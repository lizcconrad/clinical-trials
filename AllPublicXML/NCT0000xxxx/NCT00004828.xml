      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the pharmacokinetics of exogenous liothyronine administered in
      children undergoing the modified Fontan procedure.

      II. Determine the liothyronine supplementation dose that counters the fall in serum
      liothyronine concentrations and provides the greatest potential myocardial benefit after the
      modified Fontan procedure.

      III. Evaluate the potential toxicity of exogenous liothyronine administered in children
      undergoing a modified Fontan procedure.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo controlled, dose escalation study.

      Initially, patients are randomized to receive either 1 of 3 different dosages of liothyronine
      or placebo after undergoing the Fontan procedure. If no unacceptable toxicity is observed in
      this group, a third dose level of liothyronine is added to the randomization. A total of 7
      patients are enrolled at each dose level. All randomized study drugs are administered by
      continuous infusion over 1 hour after surgery.

      Cardiac function is assessed 5 days after surgery.
