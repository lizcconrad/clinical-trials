      BACKGROUND:

      Prior studies of Black-white differences in hypertension and coronary disease have compared
      racial groups from markedly different socioeconomic and educational backgrounds. This study
      represented one of a few, if any, long term prospective studies of cardiovascular disease in
      middle-class Blacks and whites of similar education and occupation, in whom both youthful and
      midlife risk factors were assessed.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      In this prospective study, the prevalence and incidence of coronary artery disease,
      hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases were compared using standardized endpoint
      criteria. The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in midlife were compared between
      cohorts, and included smoking, diabetes, family history, dietary factors, and lipoprotein
      cholesterol levels. The youthful predictors of midlife cardiovascular risk factors were
      determined using baseline data collected by identical protocols in the two cohorts between
      1957 and 1965. The youthful risk factors were related to the incidence of disease in midlife
      in two cohorts to identify differences in significance, independence, and relative importance
      of risk factors in Blacks versus whites.
