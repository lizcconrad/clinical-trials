      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the long-term safety and tolerance of a synthetic formulation of
      dehydroepiandrosterone, GL701, in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who have
      completed a prior GL701 protocol.

    <textblock>
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive daily oral dehydroepiandrosterone for 12 months. The dose
      is adjusted based on disease activity and tolerance of treatment.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.
