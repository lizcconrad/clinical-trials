  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the safety and efficacy of sevirumab (MSL 109; Protovir), human
      anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) monoclonal antibody, plus active primary treatment versus placebo
      plus active primary treatment in AIDS patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed CMV
      retinitis.

      Ganciclovir and foscarnet are used for treatment of CMV retinitis, but cause hematologic
      toxicity and nephrotoxicity, respectively. Despite continued maintenance therapy with these
      drugs, relapse occurs in 85 percent of patients within 4 months. Studies suggest that MSL
      109, a human monoclonal antibody, when given with either ganciclovir or foscarnet, may
      increase initial response and prolong time to progression in patients with CMV retinitis.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication: Required:

          -  Primary CMV treatment.

        Patients must have:

          -  AIDS.

          -  Active CMV retinitis.

          -  At least one photographable lesion of one-quarter or more optic disc area in size.

          -  Undergoing primary treatment for CMV retinitis that is not contraindicated with MSL
             109.

          -  Visual acuity in at least one eye of 3 or more letters on Early Treatment Diabetic
             Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) chart at 1 meter distance ( Snellen equivalent 5/200 ).
             Note:

          -  Exceptions may be made if visual acuity impairment is possibly reversible and there is
             at least light perception in that eye.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Retinal detachment not scheduled for surgical repair.

          -  Media opacity that precludes visualization of the fundus.

          -  Active medical problems sufficient to hinder study compliance.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  IVIG.

          -  CMV immune globulin ( CMVIG ).

          -  Interferon alpha.

          -  Interferon gamma.

          -  Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ).

        Drug or alcohol abuse sufficient to hinder study compliance.
