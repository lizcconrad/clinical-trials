      To modify and expand an existing pharmacokinetic model for nasal dose as well as to develop a
      new model to estimate tracheobronchial dose of an active agent for each subject in a study of
      acute respiratory health effects.

      BACKGROUND:

      Epidemiologic analysis of acute, reversible respiratory health effects is uncommonly
      performed, yet these are important health outcomes because acute responses by the respiratory
      defense system appear to represent one end of the continuum toward progressive, chronic and
      potentially disabling physiologic changes. Repeatable epidemiologic studies of dose-response
      relationships necessitate accurate measures of 'dose'. However, in occupational and
      environmental settings, exposure to a toxin is seldom found at identical concentrations
      and/or particle sizes among persons with the same activity patterns. In addition, air
      concentration does not account for factors such as clearance or metabolism which may alter
      the biologically effective tissue dose. These factors cause the target tissue dose of the
      toxin to vary greatly despite exposure to similar air concentrations.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The results of these toxicokinetic models were individual measures of tissue dose used in a
      2-stage epidemiologic analysis which placed special emphasis on the definition of individual
      dose-response curves for exposure to an irritant dust, sodium borate, and the reversible
      effects of peak expiratory flow and irritant symptoms. A primary advantage of the two stage
      epidemiologic approach was that it permitted particular attention to be focused on the
      factors which determined the sensitivity (threshold) and reactivity (slope) for an
      individual. The use of tissue dose estimates were also compared to simple exposure
      measurements in the epidemiologic analysis to evaluate the efficacy of using dosimetric
      methods in epidemiologic studies.
