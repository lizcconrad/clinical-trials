      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of leflunomide in treating patients who
      have anaplastic astrocytoma in first relapse.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the median time to progression, median survival, and objective
      response of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma or anaplastic oligoastrocytoma in first
      relapse treated with intravenous leflunomide (SU101). II. Assess the safety of SU101 in these
      patients. III. Describe the health-related quality of life of patients treated with
      intravenous SU101.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive leflunomide (SU101) IV
      over 6 hours on days 1-4. Patients then receive SU101 IV over 6 hours weekly for 6 weeks
      (beginning between days 8-12). Patients exhibiting complete response, partial response, or
      stable disease may continue on treatment for up to a year or until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity occurs. Patients continuing therapy receive SU101 IV over 6 hours every
      week for 7 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest. Quality of life is assessed every 8 weeks and
      at the end of the study. Patients are followed every 8 weeks or until tumor progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
