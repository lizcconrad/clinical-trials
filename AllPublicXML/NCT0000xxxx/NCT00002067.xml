      To compare the effects of megestrol acetate and placebo on body weight, anorexia, cachexia,
      calorie intake, and nutritional parameters of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of AIDS. To
      determine whether megestrol acetate relative to placebo improves the perception of well-being
      among AIDS patients with cachexia. To evaluate megestrol acetate's effect on immune function
      via skin test reactivity, T4/T8 ratio, and total lymphocytes.
