  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dosage escalation study to estimate the maximum tolerated dose of staurosporine
      analogue UCN-01. Groups of 3 to 6 patients receive a 72-hours intravenous continuous
      infusions of UCN-01 from day 1 to day 4 of each cycle the first cycle only, and over 36-hours
      on subsequent cycles. The side effects are allowed to disappear for up to 28 days. This cycle
      is repeated after evaluations and follow-ups, which are every 4 weeks, as long as the patient
      benefits.

      Patients with relapsed or refractory neoplasms will be treated with escalating doses of
      UCN-01(7-hydroxystaurosporine) a protein kinase C inhibitor which also may affect
      cyclin-dependent kinase activity, given as a 72 hour infusion. This trial will determine the
      toxicity associated with the maximally tolerated dose of this drug in patients for whom no
      other therapeutic approach is deemed to be more useful.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>

        Total bilirubin must be less than 1.5 times the upper limit and measured creatinine
        clearance of at least 55 ml/min.

        Hemoglobin must be greater than 9.0.

        Platelet count must be greater than 100,000, and absolute granulocyte count greater than
        1,500.

        Must have reliability to return for follow up and treatment, and to follow instructions.

        The patient must not have received radiation therapy of chemotherapy within the past 4
        weeks and have recovered from all toxicities prior to starting therapy.

        within 6 weeks of entry.

        Must have had tumor progression following blockade of both testicular and adrenal
        androgens.

        four weeks prior to treatment with evidence of progression of disease following this
        maneuver.

        Leuprolide or any other GnRh analog should be maintained if the patient has not had an
        orchiectomy.

        last day of infusion) and have undetectable suramin levels.

        Patients with breast carcinoma who are taking a hormonal treatment should discontinue this
        medication for at least 4 weeks prior to treatment with UCN-01 and have showed further
        progression of disease after this maneuver.

        Patients may not be treated if any of the following is present:

        No patients with local complications which require urgent local therapy (e.g.: untreated
        hydronephrosis, impending spinal cord compression, severe bone pain unresponsive to
        analgesics).

        No patients with a history of unstable or newly diagnoses angina pectoris, recent
        myocardial infarction (within 6 months of enrollment), class II-IV congestive heart
        failure, severe chronic obstructive lung disease (forced vital capacity less than 1000 ml).

        No patients with uncontrolled seizure activity, controlled seizure activity but with less
        than one year free of seizures.

        Patients with a past history of seizures must be seizure free for greater than a year and
        not taking any anticonvulsant medications.
