        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must have:

          -  Documented HIV infection.

          -  CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/mm3.

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

        Acute therapy for opportunistic infections or serious AIDS defining infections must be
        completed at least 28 days before study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Patients that are unable to take adequate oral intake (i.e. unable to eat 1 or more

          -  Patients who have severe diarrhea as defined as &gt;= 7 stools per day, or acute diarrhea
             due to a treatable cause.

        NOTE:

          -  If the patient has Cryptosporidia, Mycobacterium avium, or Cytomegalovirus that is
             unresponsive to treatment and has less than 7 stools per day, the patient may
             participate in this study.

          -  Patients who have any severe or life-threatening laboratory or clinical abnormality,
             or are not expected to live for 8 weeks.

          -  Patients who have an active opportunistic infection, including tuberculosis,
             cryptococcosis, or other serious AIDS defining infections requiring immediate
             treatment. Acute therapy must be completed at least 28 days before study entry.

          -  Patients with unexplained elevated temperature &gt;= 38.5 degrees C that persists for 7
             days or more within 14 days before study entry.

          -  Patients with malignancy other than squamous or basal carcinomas of the skin. Patients
             with visceral Kaposi's sarcoma or lymphoma requiring systemic chemotherapy or
             radiation treatment will be excluded. Patients with Kaposi's of the skin or mucous
