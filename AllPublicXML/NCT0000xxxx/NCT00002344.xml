      To assess the dose proportionality of azithromycin concentrations and toleration when
      delivered in tablet formulation to HIV-infected patients.

      The need exists to further assess the antibacterial agent azithromycin at differing doses in

      The need exists to further assess the antibacterial agent azithromycin at differing doses in
      an HIV-infected population.

      Patients are randomized to receive azithromycin at 1 of 2 doses in a two-treatment,
      two-period, cross-over study. Dosing visits are separated by at least 14-day wash-out
      periods.
