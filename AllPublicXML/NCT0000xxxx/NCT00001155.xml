  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to continue to treat patients with Wegener's granulomatosis
      who have already entered the study, and to treat new patients. The investigators will attempt
      to correlate the clinical response with specific immunosuppressive effects of drug
      administration. The investigators are accumulating data on the optimal duration and side
      effects of therapy.
