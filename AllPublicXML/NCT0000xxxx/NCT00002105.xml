  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy of Stealth liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX-SL) in the
      treatment of moderate to severe AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) by comparison with the
      established therapy BV (bleomycin/vincristine). To evaluate the safety and tolerance of
      DOX-SL compared to BV in a population of AIDS patients with moderate to severe KS.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive either DOX-SL or the BV combination. Infusions are given
      on day 1 and every 3 weeks for a total of six cycles. Kaposi's sarcoma lesions are evaluated
      prior to every cycle, at the end of the last treatment cycle, and 4 weeks following the end
      of the last treatment. Patients who respond to therapy will be followed every 2 months for up
      to 1 year. Patients must agree to have one or more representative KS lesions biopsied.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Prophylaxis for PCP, cryptococcal, and herpes infections, and antiretroviral therapy
             (e.g., AZT, ddC, ddI) provided these doses have been stable for at least 1 month.

          -  Maintenance therapy for tuberculosis, fungal, and herpes infections.

          -  Therapy for new episodes of tuberculosis, fungal, and herpes infection except with
             potentially myelotoxic chemotherapy.

          -  Foscarnet for cytomegalovirus infection.

          -  Erythropoietin.

        Patients must have:

          -  Biopsy-proven, progressive, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, with any of the following:

          -  At least 15 mucocutaneous lesions.

          -  Six or more new lesions in the prior month.

          -  Documented visceral disease with at least five accessible cutaneous lesions.

          -  Documented anti-HIV antibody.

          -  No active opportunistic infection with mycobacteria, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasma,
             Pneumocystis carinii, or other microorganisms (if REQUIRING treatment with myelotoxic
             drugs).

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 4 months.

        NOTE:

          -  Patients who fail the BV combination or who relapse are eligible to enter the Liposome
             Technology open trial using DOX-SL alone.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease.

          -  Confusion, disorientation, CNS symptoms, or peripheral neuropathy.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Other cytotoxic chemotherapy.

          -  Colony-stimulating factors.

          -  Ganciclovir.

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  Prior neoplasms treated with extensive chemotherapy that, in the investigator's
             opinion, has led to irreversibly compromised bone marrow function.

          -  History of idiosyncratic or allergic reaction to anthracyclines, bleomycin, or
             vincristine.

          -  History of major psychiatric illness.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy or interferon therapy within the past 4 weeks.

          -  More than one prior cycle of bleomycin/vincristine at any time.

        Prior Treatment:

        Excluded:

          -  Radiation or electron beam therapy within the past 3 weeks.
