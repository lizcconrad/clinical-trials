  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Indinavir is usually taken three times a day. The purpose of this study is to see if it is
      safe and effective to take indinavir only twice a day plus nelfinavir (also taken twice a
      day) and efavirenz (taken once a day).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive a treatment regimen consisting of nelfinavir, indinavir, and efavirenz for
      48 weeks. During the study, patients are evaluated for changes from baseline in plasma HIV-1
      RNA levels and lymphocyte subsets and for development of adverse events and toxicities. After
      Week 48, patients with documented virologic response are eligible to continue receiving study
      treatments and to attend scheduled follow-up visits. Patients who experience virologic
      failure are discontinued from the study.
