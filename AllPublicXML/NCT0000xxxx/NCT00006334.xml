      This study examines the clinical and genetic factors related to Turner syndrome, a disorder
      of the sex chromosomes. Humans usually have 23 pairs of chromosomes-thin strands of DNA-in
      the nucleus of every cell, which contain genes that determine our hereditary makeup. One pair
      of chromosomes is the sex chromosomes, designated X and Y. Females usually have two X
      chromosomes; however, patients with Turner syndrome have only a single X chromosome or one
      normal and one defective X or Y chromosome. This abnormality can cause medical problems such
      as short stature, premature ovarian failure and heart or kidney defects. Individuals with
      Turner syndrome have an increased risk of thyroid disorders, high blood pressure, diabetes
      mellitus, abnormal liver function, hearing loss and osteoporosis. This study will try to
      identify the genes responsible for the specific medical problems associated with the
      disorder.

      Females 10 years of age and older with X chromosome defects may be eligible for this 3- to 5-
      day inpatient study at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda,
      Maryland. Participants will have a physical examination, body measurements (height, weight,
      hip and waist) and blood drawn for clinical and research purposes.

      Participants will have a comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation, including an
      electrocardiogram (ECG), 24 hour blood pressure monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      of the heart and aorta, ultrasound imaging of the heart (cardiac echo) and expert
      consultation with the NIH Cardiology Service. Women 35 years of age and older may have a
      computerized tomography (CT) scan of the coronary arteries to investigate possible blockage
      of the heart blood supply.

      Risk for diabetes is investigated by studies of the body fat content and an oral glucose
      tolerance test. The risk for coronary artery disease is assessed by measurement of
      cholesterol and other known risk factors in the blood. Thyroid function and presence of
      antibodies to the thyroid gland are also evaluated by blood tests.

      Liver function is tested by measurement of products of liver metabolism in the blood and by a
      liver ultrasound. Ovary function is investigated by blood tests of estrogen and FSH levels
      and pelvic untrasound which visualizes the uterus.

      Bone structure and strength are evaluated by routine X-rays of the wrists and spine, and DEXA
      scan (a type of X-ray study that measures body fat, muscle and bone thickness). Adults will
      also have bone density of the spine and abdominal fat content measured by CT, which is more
      accurate than DEXA. Vitamin D levels are measured in blood tests.These are state of the art
      diagnostic tests which may uncover unsuspected anatomic problems such as abnormalities of the
      aorta or aortic valve which have serious clinical implications and would indicate the need
      for close medical follow-up, as well as uncover potential risk for development of diabetes or
      osteoporosis in the future, which would also indicate the need for changes in lifestyle or
      medical management. Study participants are invited to return for re-evaluation at 1-3 year
      intervals. A major goal of follow-up visits is to determine whether there is any enlargement
      of aortic diameter or impairment of cardiac function over time.

      Some patients may be asked to undergo a skin biopsy (removal of a small sample of skin
      tissue) to obtain more information about genetic make-up of cells. Parents of patients may be
      contacted (with the patient's permission) to provide a blood or saliva sample for genetic
      study to help understand how and why certain traits of Turner syndrome are expressed.

    <textblock>
      Turner syndrome (TS) is a sporadic disorder affecting ~ 1/2500 live female births. It is
      caused by the absence of all or significant parts of one sex-chromosome. Major developmental
      consequences include severe short stature, ovarian failure and distinctive cognitive and
      behavioral traits, with renal and cardiovascular defects affecting a minority. Adults with TS
      have excessive rates of osteoporosis, hypertension and diabetes mellitus and experience
      morbidity and mortality several-fold higher than the general population. Many of the problems
      of TS result from haplo-insufficiency for X-chromosome encoded genes, most of which remain
      unknown. Previous studies attempting to correlate genotype with phenotype in TS have been
      limited due to small numbers of subjects, limited genetic methodology and incomplete
      phenotypic characterization. This study aims to correlate TS phenotypes and genotypes using
      advanced clinical and genetic diagnostic methodologies, with the goal of identifying
      X-chromosome genes and epigenetic mechanisms causing the different features of TS. For TS
      subjects with a 45X genotype, the parental origin of the single normal X-chromosome will be
      traced to identify genomically imprinted features of the disorder. X chromosomal structural
      defects will be analyzed using high-resolution physical mapping in relation to emerging
      sequence data from the Human Genome Project. The elucidation of genetic mechanisms in TS will
      help improve the diagnosis and treatment of girls and women with this disorder and will
      further our understanding of gene dosage effects in general.
