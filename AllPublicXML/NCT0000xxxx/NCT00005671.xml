      This study will examine the health-related quality of life in patients being treated for
      chronic heart disease.

      Patients 18 years or older with chronic ischemic heart disease and left ventricular
      dysfunction enrolled in protocols in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's Cardiology
      Branch may participate in this study.

      Participants will complete five questionnaires at 3 separate times during the study-once
      during hospitalization at the NIH Clinical Center and again at home 6 months and 1 year
      later. The questionnaires, described below, require a total of about 30 minutes to complete.

        1. Demographic Information Sheet -General information such as age, marital status,
           employment, education, and history of cardiac medical procedures.

        2. General Health Survey -Patient's self-assessment, on a rating scale, of physical and
           emotional well being. Questions are related to the ability to perform work and daily
           living activities, mood and state of mind, limitations on social activities, energy
           level, pain level, general quality of life, etc.

        3. Heart Disease Survey - Patient's self-assessment, on a rating scale, of the level of
           physical, social, emotional and functional well being related to his or her heart
           condition. Questions concern fatigue level, emotional outlook, social well being, etc.

        4. Angina Survey - Information on the frequency of chest pain, chest tightness, or angina.

        5. Symptom Distress Survey - Patient's ranking of the degree of symptom distress from chest
           discomfort, difficulty breathing, heart rate irregularities, wheezing and coughing.

      All information provided in the questionnaires will be kept confidential. Upon request,
      patients will be sent a summary of the study results when the study is completed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A majority of the research in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease and left
      ventricular dysfunction deals with increasing patient survival rates and years. Very little
      research has focused on patients' perceptions of living with this chronic debilitating
      disease. The purpose of this naturalistic, prospective study is to assess the Health Related
      Quality of Life (HRQOL), anginal symptoms and symptom distress experienced by patients with
      chronic ischemic heart disease and left ventricular dysfunction. The relationship between
      underlying cardiac condition, anginal symptoms, symptom distress and HRQOL will be examined.
      The trend in HRQOL across time versus treatment group will be evaluated. The question, does
      HRQOL, anginal frequency and symptom distress at baseline predict mortality and cardiac
      related hospitalization during the year following assessment will also be addressed.

      Patients who are enrolled in protocols in the Cardiology Branch of the National Heart Lung
      and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and diagnosed with chronic ischemic heart disease and left
      ventricular dysfunction will be asked to participate in this HRQOL study. Patients will
      complete measures of HRQOL (Medical Outcomes Short Form 36 Survey; Minnesota Living with
      Heart Failure Questionnaire) and symptom measures (anginal frequency subscale of the Seattle
      Angina Questionnaire; cardiopulmonary subscale of the Heart Transplant Symptom Checklist).
      Underlying cardiac condition will be assessed using exercise thallium imaging parameters
      (METS and perfusion defects) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging parameter
      (viability). A sample size of 90 subjects is desired for this study. Data will be analyzed
      using multivariate statistics. It is expected that this study will provide new information
      regarding how patients with ischemic heart disease and left ventricular function feel their
      chronic illness and its corresponding treatment(s) affects their HRQOL.
