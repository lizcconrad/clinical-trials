      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy and hormone therapy use different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and giving
      drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether estramustine
      plus docetaxel is more effective than mitoxantrone plus prednisone for prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of estramustine plus
      docetaxel with that of mitoxantrone plus prednisone in treating patients who have stage IV
      prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with
           hormone-refractory, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with docetaxel and
           estramustine vs mitoxantrone and prednisone.

        -  Compare the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of these regimens in this patient
           population.

        -  Compare the quality of life, including palliation of metastatic bone pain and global
           quality of life, of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Record prostate-specific antigen values for future correlations with response and
           survival in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the responses in patients with bidimensionally measurable disease treated with
           these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease status (measurable or evaluable disease progression vs rising PSA only), NCI Common
      Toxicity Criteria version 2.X pain scale (grade 2 or greater vs less than 2), and SWOG
      performance status (0-1 vs 2-3). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5 and docetaxel IV
           over 1 hour on day 2.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive mitoxantrone IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and oral prednisone
           twice daily on days 1-21.

      Treatment in both arms repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after courses 4 and 8, and then at 1 year after
      randomization.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 620 patients (310 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 3.5 years.

    <description>A confirmed partial response of non-measurable disease was defined as a reduction by more than 50% over baseline in two or more Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) measurements obtained at least four weeks apart, with no evidence of disease progression on imaging. Progressive disease was defined as a 25% increase in the serum PSA level — to at least 5 ng per milliliter — over the last preregistration measurement, with confirmation of the increase at least four weeks later. For patients with a decrease in serum PSA levels during the trial, progressive disease was defined as a confirmed increase of 25%, to at least 5 ng per milliliter over the nadir.</description>

    <description>Objective responses were defined on the basis of the sum of bi-dimensional measurements of metastatic lesions. Confirmed objective responses required a follow-up scan (a minimum of four weeks later) that demonstrated a continued response. Progression was defined by one of the following: a 50 percent increase or an increase of 10 cm^2, whichever was smaller, in the sum of measurements of metastatic lesions over the sum at baseline; a clear worsening of nonmeasurable disease; reappearance of any lesion that had disappeared; appearance of any new lesion; or death.</description>
