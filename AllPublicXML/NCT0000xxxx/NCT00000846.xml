    <textblock>
      To evaluate safety and immunogenicity of 2 different HIV-1 peptide candidate vaccines, the
      UBI HIV-1 MN PND peptide immunogen and the UBI microparticulate monovalent HIV-1 MN branched
      peptide when administered sequentially by 2 different routes of immunization, parental
      priming followed by oral boosting.

      After the prescreening, volunteers will be randomized into Group I or Group II. Each group
      will contain 16 volunteers. At least 5 volunteers in each group must be women. At month 0 all
      volunteers will receive multivalent HIV-1 peptide immunogen or the placebo. Group I will
      receive the injection in the deltoid and Group II will receive it in the anterior thigh. At
      months 1, 2 and 8 all patients will receive microparticulate monovalent HIV-1 peptide or the
      placebo. Follow up will be conducted.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must have or be:

          -  Healthy.

          -  Negative ELISA for HIV.

          -  Negative for Hepatitis B surface antigen.

          -  Normal urine dipstick.

          -  Normal history and physical exam.

          -  Availability for follow-up for planned duration of the study (60 weeks).

        Risk Behavior: Required:

          -  Lower or intermediate risk sexual behavior as defined by AVEG.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with any of the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Medical or psychiatric condition or occupational responsibilities which preclude
             subject compliance with the protocol.

          -  Active syphilis. NOTE: If the serology is documented to be a false positive or due to
             a remote (&gt; 6 months) treated infection, the volunteer is eligible.

          -  Active tuberculosis. NOTE: Volunteers with a positive PPD and a normal chest X-ray
             showing no evidence of TB and not requiring INH therapy are eligible.

        Patients with any of the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  History of immunodeficiency, chronic illness, malignancy or autoimmune disease.

          -  History of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines.

          -  History of inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, celiac disease or intestinal
             malignancy.

          -  History of acute gastroenteritis within the past month or gastrointestinal surgery
             within the past 12 months.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  History of use of immunosuppressive medication.

          -  Live attenuated vaccines within 60 days of study. NOTE: Medically indicated subunit or
             killed vaccines (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal) are not exclusionary but should be
             given at least 2 weeks away from HIV immunizations.

          -  Use of experimental agents within 30 days prior to study.

          -  Receipt of blood products or immunoglobulin in the past 6 months.

          -  Prior receipt of HIV vaccines or a placebo recipient in an HIV vaccine trial.

        Risk Behavior:

        Excluded:

          -  Subjects with identifiable higher risk behavior for HIV infection as determined by
             screening questionnaire designed to identify risk factors for HIV infection.

          -  History of injection drug use within the last 12 months to enrollment.

          -  Higher risk sexual behavior as defined by AVEG.
