      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can find and locate tumor cells and either kill them or
      deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining more than one drug and combining chemotherapy with monoclonal antibody therapy
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy plus
      combination chemotherapy in treating patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Define toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose of humanized monoclonal
      antibody A33 (MOAB A33) when combined with carmustine, fluorouracil, vincristine, and
      streptozocin in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. II. Determine the effect of
      chemotherapy on human antihuman antibody response and on the pharmacokinetics of humanized
      MOAB A33 in these patients. III. Define the humanized MOAB A33 dose for a phase II study.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of humanized monoclonal antibody A33 (MOAB A33).
      Patients receive humanized MOAB A33 IV once a week for 14 weeks. Chemotherapy begins on day
      29 and consists of carmustine IV on days 29-33, fluorouracil IV on days 29-33 and 64-68,
      vincristine IV on days 29 and 64, and streptozocin IV every 7 days, beginning on day 29, for
      10 doses. Courses repeat every 14 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of humanized MOAB A33. The maximum
      tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients experience dose
      limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 3-18 patients accrued into this study over 2-9 months.
