  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare different treatments for HIV infection to see which
      works best to lower HIV levels and to raise the number of CD4 cells (cells of the immune
      system that fight infection), in HIV-positive individuals who have been on a protease
      inhibitor-containing drug regimen for at least 16 weeks.

      Researchers have found that combination anti-HIV therapy (multiple drugs given together) can
      help prevent AIDS-related illnesses and help people with AIDS live longer. In this study, the
      anti-HIV drug efavirenz (EFV) will be tested with 1 or 2 other protease inhibitors (PIs) to
      see which combination works best to treat HIV infection. EFV has been shown to limit the
      amount of HIV virus produced by infected cells.

      Current recommendations for the initial treatment of HIV infection have centered on the
      reduction of plasma HIV levels. It has been shown that a combination of 2 nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a PI is the most effective barriers to disease
      progression. This study attempts to demonstrate these data.

      Two options are available for patients whose initial PI-containing regimen has failed to
      suppress viral replication.

      Option 1 consists of immediate versus deferred use of a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor (NNRTI). Patients who choose Option 1 are randomized to 1 of 2 groups:

        1. Ritonavir (RTV) plus soft gelatin capsule saquinavir (SQV-SGC) plus efavirenz (EFV).

        2. RTV plus SQV-SGC.

      Option 2 consists of treatment with a single PI versus double PI. Patients who choose Option
      2 are randomized to 1 of 2 groups:

        1. Nelfinavir (NFV) plus EFV.

        2. RTV plus SQV-SGC plus EFV.

      Patients failing NFV in Option 2 are randomized to one of two groups:

        1. Indinavir (IDV) plus EFV.

        2. RTV plus SQV-SGC plus EFV. Patients remain on study treatment regimens for 8 weeks.
           Follow-up visits, including history and physical evaluations, take place at specified
           intervals during the next 12 months.

          -  Have an HIV RNA count of at least 400 copies/ml.

          -  Are at least 13 years old (need consent if under 18).

          -  Have been on antiretroviral treatment (including at least 2 NRTIs) for at least 16
             weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Agree to practice abstinence or to use effective methods of birth control, including a

          -  Have active opportunistic (HIV-associated) infections.

          -  Have taken nelfinavir (NFV) for more than 2 weeks after failing indinavir/ritonavir
             (IDV/RTV) treatment or have taken IDV/RTV for more than 2 weeks after failing NFV
             treatment.
