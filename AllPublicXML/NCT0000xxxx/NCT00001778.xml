  <brief_summary>

      Objective:

      Human T-lymphotropic virus type-I-associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis
      (HAM/TSP) is a rare neurologic disorder that affects less than 5% of patients infected with
      the HTLV-I virus. The purpose of this protocol is to study the natural history of HAM/TSP by
      monitoring clinical progression of patients longitudinally. Additionally, we will attempt to
      define the virological and immunological changes of HAM/TSP.

      Study Population:

      Patients with HAM/TSP who fulfill World Health Organization diagnostic criteria are eligible
      to participate in this protocol. Asymptomatic seropositive individuals and individuals with
      indeterminate HTLV-1 serology are also eligible to participate.

      Design and Outcome Measures:

      A longitudinal assessment of clinical, virological and immunological progression in HAM/TSP
      will be accomplished through periodic testing and evaluation. Asymptomatic seropositive
      individuals, those with seroindeterminate HTLV-I serology and normal volunteers may serve as
      controls. Longitudinal standardized neurological examinations will be performed. Longitudinal
      samples of serum, plasma, and lymphocytes may be obtained from participants. Lumbar punctures
      may be performed on all participants. These samples will be used virological and
      immunological assays. A focus is on the relationships between the characteristics of viral
      infection, the immune response, and the genetic makeup.
