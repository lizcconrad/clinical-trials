  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Parkinson's disease have low levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine
      is responsible for motor function and normal physical activity. Patients with Parkinson's
      disease typically suffer from tremors, rigid muscles, stooped postures, and walk with a
      shuffle. The drug levodopa acts as a replacement for dopamine and has been has been used
      effectively for over 30 years as treatment for Parkinsons disease. Because of its
      effectiveness, levodopa has been used to distinguish Parkinson's disease from other
      conditions that may resemble Parkinson's disease.

      Traditionally, levodopa has been given as a pill. In this study, researchers would like to
      inject levodopa directly into a vein (intravenous) in order to diagnose cases of Parkinson's
      disease. This method provides immediate results and allows doctors to adjust the dose of
      levodopa very carefully. Because the intravenous method of giving levodopa is less practical
      than oral medication, it is not an available alternative for the routine treatment of
      Parkinson's disease. However, it may be useful for faster diagnosis of the disease and for
      determining effective doses of oral medication.

      A positive response to levodopa is now considered a condition sine qua non for the diagnosis
      of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Under this protocol, patients with parkinsonism of
      uncertain etiology will be tested for their motor response to intravenous levodopa to aid in
      the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. This protocol regulates and stipulates the acute
      administration of intravenous levodopa and associated safety issues.

        All patients will have parkinsonism of undetermined etiology.

        Males and females between the ages of 18 and 85 are eligible for the study.

        No presence or history of any medical condition that can reasonably be expected to subject
        the patient to unwarranted risks, specifically those who have the following: a history of
        convulsive, hepatic, or renal disorders; currently receiving treatment for myocardial
        infarction, arrhythmia or cardiac failure; and pregnant women or anyone not practicing an
        effective means of birth control.
