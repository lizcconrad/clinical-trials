      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Chemoprotective drugs such as amifostine may protect normal cells
      from the side effects of chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of amifostine in treating
      patients who have ovarian epithelial cancer and who are receiving chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if patients with ovarian epithelial cancer receiving chemotherapy
      have significantly fewer neurologic events when treated with amifostine. II. Compare
      amifostine vs no chemoprotection in terms of overall incidence of neuropathy, incidence of
      neutropenia, infection, and other myelosuppressive events (e.g., leukopenia, anemia, and
      thrombocytopenia), length of hospital stay due to infections, and quality of life in this
      patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, parallel, controlled, double blind study. Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive amifostine IV over 10
      minutes, 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. Arm II: Patients receive a placebo IV over 10
      minutes, 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 8 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed
      prior to courses 1, 4, and 8, and then every 3 months for 1 year. Patients are followed
      monthly for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
