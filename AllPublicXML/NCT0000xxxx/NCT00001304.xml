  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been important in establishing synthetic human parathyroid hormone 1-34 (PTH)
      as a beneficial treatment for hypoparathyroidism, superior to conventional therapy with
      calcium and calcitriol. Providing synthetic human parathyroid hormone 1-34 (PTH) to patients
      who are unresponsive to conventional therapy has enabled severe cases of hypoparathyroidism
      to be managed effectively with the investigational drug, PTH. The primary goals of this study
      are to (1) provide long-term PTH therapy to patients who do not respond to conventional
      therapy; (2) understand the long-term effect of therapeutic PTH replacement on kidney
      function and bone mineral density; (3) study and track linear growth and bone accrual in
      children with hypoparathyroidism. (4) determine if subjects reach a normal level of peak bone
      mass and if the timing of this is comparable to normal age-matched healthy controls.

    <textblock>
      Vitamin D and its analogs, the conventional treatment for hypoparathyroidism, are associated
      with chronic hypercalciuria due to their lack of calcium-retaining effect in the kidney. This
      side effect usually occurs even while maintaining the serum calcium in the normal range and
      may lead to calcium deposition in the kidney (nephrocalcinosis) and renal insufficiency. This
      study examines the long-term effects of subcutaneous parathyroid hormone (PTH) therapy on
      calcium metabolism, bone, and renal function. Our previous short-term pilot study comparing
      subcutaneous PTH with calcitriol demonstrated a significant decrease in urinary calcium
      excretion during PTH therapy. Based upon these results, we hypothesized that treatment with
      PTH is more physiologic and provides improved long-term metabolic control. Additionally,
      treatment with PTH may avoid the adverse side effects on the kidney that are associated with
      conventional therapy. Patients initially come to the Clinical Center for a two week inpatient
      evaluation. Subsequent follow-up will occur semiannually on an outpatient basis.

          <description>Measurements were taken 1 hour before the morning dose of PTH or, calcitriol and calcium; UOM = mmol/liter, normal range 0.7-1.4. Measurements were obtained on three successive days (three separate measures) semiannually at the NIH CC for each protocol subject. The average data are the average of these three semi-annual data points for each subject which are then averaged across all the semi-annual means for all subjects within each arm over the three years of study.</description>
