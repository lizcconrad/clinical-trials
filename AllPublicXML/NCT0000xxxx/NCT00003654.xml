      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as blue dye or imaging to identify sentinel lymph
      nodes, may improve the ability to detect the extent of disease and help plan effective
      surgery for removing breast tumors.

      PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to study the effectiveness of blue dye and an imaging procedure to
      identify the sentinel lymph node under the arm in women with stage I or stage II breast
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether the concept of a sentinel lymph node within the axillary
      nodal basin is valid in staging breast cancer. II. Determine the sensitivity of combined
      methods of identification of sentinel lymph nodes by patent blue V dye and gamma probe
      detection in these women.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive patent blue V dye injection peritumorally prior to surgery.
      Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy is performed using technetium Tc 99 sulfur rhenium colloid
      injected around the tumor associated with intraoperative gamma probe detection. Nonpalpable
      tumors receive a localized injection using stereotactic injection techniques. Patients then
      undergo standard axillary (level I and II) lymph node dissection.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
