  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the tolerance and immunologic and virologic effects of multidrug combinations of
      antiretrovirals in patients with HIV infection. Specifically, to evaluate
      zidovudine/zalcitabine ( AZT / ddC ) alone or in combination with either nevirapine or
      saquinavir ( Ro 31-8959 ).

      Administration of three-drug combinations for treatment of HIV infection is preferred over
      monotherapy or duotherapy. A system has been designed to rapidly evaluate current multidrug
      combinations of antiretrovirals and allow the addition of new agents as they become
      available.

      Administration of three-drug combinations for treatment of HIV infection is preferred over
      monotherapy or duotherapy. A system has been designed to rapidly evaluate current multidrug
      combinations of antiretrovirals and allow the addition of new agents as they become
      available.

      Patients are randomized to receive AZT/ddC either alone or in combination with nevirapine or
      Ro 31-8959 for a minimum of 48 weeks. Patients are followed at weeks 2 and 4 and every 4
      weeks thereafter.
