      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 in treating patients who
      have mycosis fungoides.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity of interleukin-2 in patients with
           stage IIB-IV mycosis fungoides.

        -  Determine the response rate of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the immunologic response to this regimen in peripheral blood leukocytes and
           serum of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously on days 1-5 during weeks 1-3 and on days
      1-3 and 5 during week 4. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 4 courses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IL-2 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 3 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. Six additional patients receive IL-2 at 1 dose level preceding the
      MTD.

      Patients are followed at least 3 times during year 1 and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
