      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of doxorubicin plus external-beam radiation
      therapy in treating patients who have soft tissue sarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of doxorubicin when combined
      with external beam radiotherapy in patients with high risk soft tissue sarcomas of the
      extremity or trunk. II. Assess the radiographic and pathologic response rates to this
      preoperative regimen in the subset of these patients with measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of doxorubicin. Patients receive doxorubicin
      intravenous (IV) bolus followed immediately by doxorubicin IV over 4 days every week for 5
      weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients with measurable disease receive
      external beam radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks concurrently with doxorubicin treatment.
      Patients with measurable disease undergo surgical resection of the residual mass 4-7 weeks
      following completion of chemoradiation. Patients who have no measurable disease and have
      undergone prereferral excision undergo surgical resection of the prior surgical scar and
      tumor bed followed by external beam radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Cohorts of 3
      patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 4 months for 2 years, and
      then annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study at a rate of 5-6
      patients per month.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have cytologic or histologic proof of large (&gt;5 mc), Grade III,
             resectable soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or trunk (AJCC Stage IIIB). Patients
             with The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage IIB tumors (Grade II) greater
             than 8 cms will also be eligible.

          2. Patients may have measurable or non-measurable disease (C/P pre-referral excision).

          3. Patients may have had prior doxorubicin (up to a total doxorubicin dose of 450 mg/m2).

          4. Patients may have a prior history of malignancy (at the discretion of the Principal
             Investigator).

          5. Patients must have Karnofsky Point Scale (P.S.)&gt; of &gt;70 or Xubrod P.S. of 0 or 1.
