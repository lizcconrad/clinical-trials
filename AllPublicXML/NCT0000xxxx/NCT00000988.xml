  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety, minimum effective dose (MED), pharmacokinetics and efficacy of orally
      administered 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine (d4T) in patients with AIDS or AIDS
      related complex (ARC). To establish an appropriate dosage regimen of d4T to be employed in
      Phase II and III trials. To evaluate the effects of de-escalating doses of d4T on markers
      associated with HIV infection.

      Currently, the only FDA-approved therapy for patients with AIDS or ARC is zidovudine (AZT), a
      drug with significant value but limited use because of toxic effects on the bone marrow. d4T
      has not been tested in humans, but it has inhibited the reproduction of HIV (the virus that
      causes AIDS) in laboratory experiments. In some studies with laboratory animals, d4T was less
      toxic against blood cells than AZT.

      Currently, the only FDA-approved therapy for patients with AIDS or ARC is zidovudine (AZT), a
      drug with significant value but limited use because of toxic effects on the bone marrow. d4T
      has not been tested in humans, but it has inhibited the reproduction of HIV (the virus that
      causes AIDS) in laboratory experiments. In some studies with laboratory animals, d4T was less
      toxic against blood cells than AZT.

      A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been found in Phase I trials to date. An MED will be
      determined. The daily dose of d4T is divided into 2 portions and administered approximately
      12 hours apart for 10 weeks. 5 patients receive the initial dose level and successive groups
      of 5 patients enter the study at a lower dose level once 3 patients in the preceding group
      have successfully completed at least 3 weeks of dosing and shown a positive effect on CD4
      cell count and p24 antigen levels. The initial group of patients continue dosing at their
      dose level for an additional 94 weeks as long as they are doing well as measured by p24
      antigen levels and CD4 cell counts. The dose de-escalation scheme continues until a lack of
      efficacy is seen in 2 of 5 patients in any group. Patients are assigned to de-escalating dose
      level treatment groups in the order in which they are enrolled. Blood and urine samples are
      taken regularly to check for toxic effects and therapeutic effectiveness. In each dosing
      group, 3 of 5 patients will be p24 antigen positive greater than or equal to 70 pg/ml, and 2
      of 5 patients will have CDC-defined AIDS.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Aerosolized pentamidine for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis.

          -  TMP/SMX as an alternative prophylactic agent, 1 DS tablet orally per day.

          -  Acute therapy with oral acyclovir for herpes simplex infections for no more than 7
             days, providing d4t is suspended Symptomatic therapy such as analgesics,
             antihistamines, antiemetics, antidiarrheal agents, or other supportive therapy may be
             administered for toxicities as deemed necessary by the principal investigator. For
             therapy of fever, aspirin rather than acetaminophen should be used.

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Allowed:

          -  Transfusion of up to 2 units of packed red blood cells every 3 weeks for grade 3 or
             grade 4 anemia (see Recommendations for Grading of Acute and Subacute Toxic Effects
             (Adults)) until patient returns to baseline from grade 3 or to baseline or grade 1
             from grade 4.

        Patient must have:

          -  AIDS or AIDS related complex (CDC Group IVA or CDC Group IVC-2 with thrush or oral
             leukoplakia).
