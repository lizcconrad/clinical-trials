    <textblock>
      This study compares the effectiveness of high-dose cyclophosphamide treatment with the &quot;gold
      standard&quot; treatment, monthly intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide, in people with moderate to
      severe lupus that does not respond to high-dose corticosteroid therapy. We will give patients
      either IV cyclophosphamide (750 milligrams per square meter of body surface area) monthly for
      6 months, followed by quarterly maintenance therapy, or high-dose IV cyclophosphamide (50
      milligrams per kilogram body weight per day) for the first four days of the study. Patients
      will be followed for 24 months after therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus) remains the prototypic autoimmune disease. Recent
      data show that its incidence has tripled since 1970 and its prevalence is 1 in 800 in
      Rochester, Minnesota. The natural history of lupus in our cohort is one of (1) relapsing/
      remitting or (2) chronic activity, with only 17 percent of patients having periods of long
      quiescence. Over 75 percent of our African-American patients and 50 percent of our Caucasian
      patients have renal (kidney) involvement. Over 50 percent suffer permanent damage in one or
      more organ systems, and over 15 percent have renal failure.

      Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have shown that, for patients with
      severe lupus, especially with renal involvement, monthly IV pulse cyclophosphamide (500 to
      1000 mg/m squared BSA) for 6 months followed by quarterly maintenance for 2 years is superior
      to high-dose corticosteroid treatment. NIH and others have shown that IV pulse
      cyclophosphamide is also effective for severe lupus in other organs. However, even monthly IV
      cyclophosphamide is not successful in all cases, and it, too, has associated toxicity,
      especially premature ovarian failure. For that reason, we have pioneered the use of high-dose
      immunoablative cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) in 10 patients with severe lupus refractory to
      other treatments.

      Because of the initial success of this approach, including 75 percent complete response (on
      no medications) in renal lupus, we are conducting a controlled trial of high-dose
      immunoablative cyclophosphamide versus the &quot;gold standard&quot; monthly IV cyclophosphamide in
      people with moderate to severe lupus refractory to high-dose corticosteroid therapy. We will
      give patients either 750 mg/m2 of body surface area IV cyclophosphamide monthly for 6 months,
      followed by quarterly maintenance therapy (we will readmit patients, if necessary, for
      infections or other complications) or cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/d intravenously on days 1-4.
      We will calculate the dose of cyclophosphamide according to ideal body weight. Patients are
      scheduled to receive only one course of therapy. We will follow patients according to the
      infective guidelines for BMT.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        All patients with moderate-to-severe SLE will be considered for this trial, including women
        and minorities. SLE is too rare a disease in children for it to be feasible to include
        them. Patients must meet the following criteria to be eligible for participation in this
        clinical trial:

          -  Four or more ACR criteria (90), as revised by Hochberg (91) for the classification of
             SLE.

          -  Involvement of one or more of the following organ systems (renal, neurologic,
             hematologic, cardiac, pulmonary, cutaneous, gastrointestinal) of moderate-to-severe
             severity as indicated by an &quot;A&quot; score on the BILAG, a &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot; for severity on SLAM,
             or severe enough to require hospitalization if the organ involvement was not
             &quot;captured&quot; on either the BILAG or SLAM instruments.

          -  A lack of response to daily corticosteroids in moderate-to-high doses (0.5 -1 mg
             prednisone/kg/day or equivalent anti-inflammatory dose of methyprednisolone,
             dexamethasone, or triamicinolone). When cyclophosphamide is the accepted standard of
             care (renal and neurologic), the maximally tolerated dose of prednisone will be
             sufficient to meet the corticosteroid criterion. The ideal body weight will be used
             for this criterion in patients who are morbidly obese. The equivalent dose of
             triamcinolone (4mg triamcinolone=5mg prednisone) can be used to meet the criterion.

        And/or:

          -  A lack of response to IV pulse corticosteroids (1 gram methylprednisolone or 180 mg
             dexamethasone).

          -  Duration of treatment to determine lack of response is 3 days or longer for
             neurologic, renal, hematologic, pulmonary, or cardiac lupus, one month or longer for
             serositis.

        And/or:

          -  Equivalent degree of immunosuppression with azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporin,
             or mycophenolate mofetil. Equivalent degrees of immunosuppression are: azathioprine -
             100 mg daily or more; methotrexate - 7.5 mg weekly or more; cyclosporin - 150 mg daily
             or more; mycophenolate mofetil - 1000 mg daily or more. Duration to determine lack of
             response should be one month or longer.

        And/or:

          -  Appropriate other treatment (such as intravenous immunoglobulin for hemolytic anemia
             and thrombocytopenia).

          -  SLE patients seeking treatment for neurological complaints will be evaluated by a
             neurologist to concur that the patient meets eligibility criteria.

          -  Appropriate other treatment for cutaneous lupus patients may include combination
             antimalarial drugs (such as the combination of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with
             quinacrine).

          -  Patients may enter the trial if they received one dose of IV cyclophosphamide to
             &quot;temporize&quot; or &quot;stablize&quot; them prior to screening visit or after signing consent or if
             previous IV cyclophosphamide was for a PAST organ system, and patient presents with
             NEW organ system requiring IV cyclophosphamide.

          -  Insurance or other source of funds to pay for expenses related to this trial.

        Exlcusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 18 years and over 70 years.

          -  Any risk of pregnancy - ALL female patients must have an effective means of birth
             control or be infertile due to hysterectomy, fallopian tube surgery, or menopause.

          -  Previous completion of the NIH IV cyclophosphamide protocol.

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 45%.

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dL.

          -  FVC or FEV &lt; 50% predicted.

          -  Bilirubin &gt; 2.0, transaminases &gt; 2x normal.

          -  Patients who are preterminal or moribund.

          -  SLE patients presenting with arthritis for entry organ system.
