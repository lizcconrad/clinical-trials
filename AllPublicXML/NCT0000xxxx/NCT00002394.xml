  <brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of Giving Lamisil to HIV-Positive Subjects With Thrush Who Have Not Responded to Fluconazole Treatment</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Four-Week, Open-Label, Non-Randomized, Multicenter, Dose-Finding, Pilot Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Two Daily Doses of Lamisil (1500 Mg and 2000 Mg), Administered for a Maximum of 4 Weeks in HIV-Positive Subjects With Oral Mucosal Candidiasis Not Having Responded to a Minimum of 200 Mg Fluconazole Monotherapy</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give Lamisil to
      HIV-positive patients with thrush (a fungal infection) that has not responded to fluconazole.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalating study with up to 2 sequential cohorts. The first 15
      patients receive Lamisil for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, patients considered clinically cured
      (i.e., absence of removable, white plaques) are removed from treatment; patients not
      considered clinically cured receive an additional 2 weeks of treatment. At the end of 4
      weeks, treatment is discontinued, regardless of clinical cure outcome. If less than 80% of
      patients are clinically cured after the 4 weeks of treatment, a second cohort of 15 patients
      receive Lamisil on the same treatment regimen as first cohort (i.e., initial 2-week treatment
      period, with an additional 2 weeks of treatment for those patients who are not considered
      clinically cured after 2 weeks of treatment).
