  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the development of the ocular, or eye, motor system (the parts of the
      brain that control how the eyes move) in children. Recent technological and methodological
      advances now enable researchers to investigate the visual system and ocular motor system of
      infants, but few findings have been reported. This study hypothesizes that quantitative
      analysis of &quot;at-risk&quot; infants' eye movement systems can detect abnormalities that precede and
      predict the onset of strabismus, or cross-eye.

      We will collect data on the eye movements of a group of infants born between 36 and 44 weeks
      after conception. These infants will be enrolled between 4 and 24 weeks after birth and
      followed at 4-week (+/- 5 days) intervals until 28 weeks of age and then once a year until 3
      years after birth. The infants will undergo a complete ophthalmic evaluation at each visit
      after they enroll. At all visits up to 28 weeks of age, they will also undergo analysis of
      eye movements. We also will monitor the development of ocular alignment and check to detect
      other visual system abnormalities. The study will provide basic knowledge about the cause of
      both normal and abnormal alignment of both eyes in infants in the first 28 weeks of life.

      Little is known about the development of the ocular motor system in children. We hypothesize
      that quantitative analysis of &quot;at risk&quot; infants eye movement systems can detect abnormalities
      that precede and predict the onset of strabismus. We will collect data on the eye movements
      of a group of infants born between 36 and 44 weeks of post-conceptual age. These infants are
      enrolled between 4 and 24 weeks after birth and followed at 4 week (+/-5 days) intervals
      until 28 weeks of age and then yearly until 3 years after birth. After study enrollment
      infants will undergo a complete ophthalmic evaluation and ocular motor analysis at all study
      visits. The ocular motor analysis will include evaluation of ocular following, saccadic,
      pursuit and vergence eye movements using stimulus paradigms that have been specially
      developed for use in children. Children will be followed on an annual basis after 28 weeks of
      age until age 3 years to monitor the development of ocular alignment and to detect other
      visual system abnormalities. Study endpoints for each subject are at 28 weeks of age (ocular
      motor recordings completed) and 3 years of age (ophthalmic examinations completed). This will
      provide basic knowledge regarding the etiology of both normal and abnormal binocular
      alignment in infants in the first 28 weeks of life.
