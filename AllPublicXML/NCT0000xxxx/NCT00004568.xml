      This study is designed to learn more about the natural history of inherited neurological
      disorders and the role of heredity in their development. It will examine the genetics,
      symptoms, disease progression, treatment, and psychological and behavioral impact of diseases
      in the following categories: hereditary peripheral neuropathies; hereditary myopathies;
      muscular dystrophies; hereditary motor neuron disorders; mitochondrial myopathies; hereditary
      neurocognitive disorders; inherited neurological disorders without known diagnosis; and
      others. Many of these diseases, which affect the brain, spinal cord, muscles, and nerves, are
      rare and poorly understood.

      Children and adults of all ages with various inherited neurological disorders may be eligible
      for this study. Participants will undergo a detailed medical and family history, and a family
      tree will be drawn. They will also have a physical and neurological examination that may
      include blood test and urine tests, an EEG (brain wave recordings), psychological tests, and
      speech and language and rehabilitation evaluations. A blood sample or skin biopsy may be
      taken for genetic testing. Depending on the individual patient s symptoms, imaging tests such
      as X-rays, CT or MRI scans and muscle and nerve testing may also be done.

      Information from this study may provide a better understanding of the genetic underpinnings
      of these disorders, contributing to improved diagnosis, treatment, and genetic counseling,
      and perhaps leading to additional studies in these areas.

      The Neurogenetics Branch (NGB) within the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
      Stroke (NINDS) is conducting a study to evaluate and provide genetic diagnosis to
      participants with various diagnosed and undiagnosed neurological conditions.

      OBJECTIVES:

      The primary objective of this protocol is to provide a resource of patients for enrollment
      into new research protocols throughout the NGB and other NIH laboratories. Evaluating and
      diagnosing participants will allow the NGB specialists to maintain their expertise and gain
      additional knowledge of the course of various neurological disorders. The information
      obtained will allow for the evaluation and diagnosis of the studied neurological diseases.
      This understanding may lead to ideas for future protocols. In some cases, blood or other
      biologic samples (including urine, saliva, or a cheek swab) will be obtained for future
      laboratory studies.

      STUDY POPULATION

      The number of participants to be enrolled will be set to 2,000 patients with neurological
      diseases and their unaffected relatives.

      DESIGN:

      This is an observational diagnostic study of multiple neurological diseases and their
      progression and pathophysiology.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      No formal outcomes will be measured; however the clinical assessments of enrolled
      participants can be used to characterize the disease manifestations. In addition, DNA samples
      obtained may be used to identify and verify causative mutations as well as identify novel
      genes, which may help establish pathogenic mechanisms and genotype-phenotype correlations.

        -  Participants include those with inherited neurological conditions based on the
             training and research needs of the Neurogenetics Branch program. There is no logical
             limit; however the total number of participants that can be enrolled in the protocol
             will be restricted. No more than 2,000 participants with either diagnosed or
             undiagnosed neurological conditions and their unaffected relatives will be enrolled in
             this evaluation and diagnostic protocol.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Participants will be eligible if they:

          -  Have either a known or suspected, inherited neurological disease, OR are an unaffected
             relative (first-, second-, third, or higher degree relative) of a participant with a
             genetic neurological disease.

          -  Have the ability to understand and sign an informed consent or have a parent/legal
             guardian to do so if they are minor children or a legal guardian to provide consent
             for adults without consent capacity.

          -  Aged 2 years and above.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Participants will not be eligible if they:

          -  Are unwilling or unable to be followed as clinically indicated.

          -  Have a systemic disease that compromises the ability to provide adequate neurologic
             examination or diagnosis.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR MALI:

        Participants will be eligible if they:

          -  Have either a known or suspected, inherited neurological disease, OR are an unaffected
             relative (first-, second-, third, or higher degree relative) of a participant with a
             genetic neurological disease.

          -  Have the ability to understand and sign an informed consent or have a parent/legal
             guardian to do so if they are minor children or a legal guardian to provide consent
             for adults without consent capacity.

          -  Aged 2 years and above.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR MALI:

          -  Participants will not be eligible if they:

          -  Are unwilling or unable to be followed as clinically indicated.

          -  Have a systemic disease that compromises the ability to provide adequate neurologic
             examination or diagnosis.
