      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy of monthly intravenous mucoid exopolysaccharide
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa immune globulin (MEP IGIV) given over 1 year in reducing the frequency
      of acute pulmonary exacerbation in patients with cystic fibrosis, mild to moderate pulmonary
      disease, and mucoid P. aeruginosa colonization.

      II. Assess the effect of MEP IGIV on FEV1, sputum density of mucoid P. aeruginosa, and the
      quality of life in these patients.

      III. Assess the safety of monthly MEP IGIV. IV. Assess population-based MEP IGIV
      pharmacokinetics during chronic therapy.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by
      participating institution.

      Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: low-dose intravenous mucoid
      exopolysaccharide Pseudomonas aeruginosa immune globulin (MEP IVIG), high-dose MEP IVIG, or
      placebo. Therapy is administered every 28 days for 12 months. Treatment is not initiated in
      the presence of an acute asthmatic attack.

      Concurrent chronic suppressive antibiotics are permitted.
