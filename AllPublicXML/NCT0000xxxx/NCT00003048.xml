      RATIONALE: Amifostine may improve blood counts in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of amifostine in treating patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Define the activity of amifostine in improving blood counts in patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, nonrandomized, single center, dose escalation study. Patients
      receive amifostine IV for two weeks, followed by 2 weeks of rest. Each treatment cycle is 4
      weeks. Responses are evaluated after each cycle (for a minimum of 2 induction cycles).
      Patients with a grade 0 toxicity in the first course receive a 25% increase in dose during
      the second course. Patients with grade 1 or 2 toxicity receive no dose change. Patients with
      grade 3 toxicity receive a 25% reduction in dose or treatment is stopped. All patients
      demonstrating response are eligible for maintenance therapy. Treatment is continued for up to
      12 months or a total of 13 cycles.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued.
