      This study will examine how allergen immunotherapy (allergy shots) works to reduce or prevent
      reactions to allergens such as pollen, dust or cat dander. Certain T cells (types of white
      blood cells) called Th2 cells produce substances that generate allergies. Other T cells
      called Th1 cells produce substances that have opposite effects. This study will determine if
      allergy shots change the immune response to allergens by reducing the number of Th2 cells or
      by changing them into Th1 cells. A better understanding of how this treatment works may help
      scientists develop more effective allergy therapies.

      People between 18 and 50 years of age who have had allergic asthma for at least 1 year may
      participate in this study. Candidates' medical, allergy and medication histories will be
      reviewed, and they will have a physical examination, including routine blood tests,
      urinalysis, electrocardiogram (EKG), and lung function test. Blood will also be drawn to test
      T cell response to allergens, and 12 skin tests (similar to a tuberculosis skin test) will be
      done to test for sensitivity to various allergens.

      Participants will be admitted to the Clinical Center for 1 to 2 days for rush therapy (see
      below). They will have a brief history and physical examination. A heparin lock (thin plastic
      tube similar to an intravenous line) will be placed in an arm vein. They will then undergo
      the following procedures:

        -  Rush/Cluster Immunotherapy - An allergen is given in increasing doses over 2 to 5 weeks.
           During rush therapy, the dose is increased rapidly over 1 to 2 days until a moderate
           level dose is reached. To reduce the chance of an allergic reaction, patients take
           prednisone, cetirizine (Zyrtec® (Registered Trademark)), ranitidine (Zantac® (Registered
           Trademark)) and montelukast (Singular® (Registered Trademark)) starting 24 hours before
           treatment begins until rush therapy ends. After discharge on the third day, patients
           return to the clinic once a week for the next 2 to 5 weeks for cluster therapy, in which
           the dose is increased more gradually to a maintenance level.

        -  Maintenance Immunotherapy - Participants receive 12 weekly injections at the maintenance
           dose. Blood is drawn during one visit between weeks 2 and 7 of maintenance therapy.

        -  Follow-up Visits - Patients return to the clinic 2 and 3 weeks after the last
           maintenance dose for blood draws and evaluations. In addition, a &quot;late-phase&quot; allergen
           skin test is done at the 3-week follow-up to compare reaction results with those from
           the test done at the screening visit.

        -  End-of-Study Visit - 12 to 16 weeks after the last allergy shot, patients return for a
           final blood draw and brief evaluation.

      Asthma is a major public health problem due to its high prevalence and significant impact on
      activities of daily living. Allergen immunotherapy or vaccination consists of the therapeutic
      administration of allergen extract. The efficacy of allergen immunotherapy in asthma is
      modest, however immunotherapy remains the only known disease modifying therapy for allergic
      asthma. Because the exact mechanism through which immunotherapy works is unclear, a greater
      understanding of the mechanism of action of allergen immunotherapy is needed before modern
      immunopharmacologic methods can be applied to increase its therapeutic efficacy. This goal of
      the study is to determine the effects of allergen immunotherapy on allergen specific T cell
      responses. This is an open label study in which allergen specific CD4+T lymphocyte responses
      will be monitored before, during and after 12 weekly injections of maintenance immunotherapy,
      allowing the study of both the induction as well as decay of these changes. Immunotherapy
      will be employed in a rush/cluster schedule consisting of the serial administration of
      rapidly increasing doses of allergen delivered subcutaneously over a 2 day period (rush),
      followed by more gradually increasing weekly injections over 2-6 weeks (cluster), during
      which time the subject is brought to a maintenance allergen dose, which will then be
      repeatedly administered on a weekly basis. Immunological endpoints will consist of the
      frequency and cytokine profile of allergen specific T cell responses as measured by
      intracellular cytokine staining and the measurement of in vitro induced T cell cytokines by
      real time RT-PCR. Ten allergic asthmatic subjects will be enrolled in the therapeutic arm of
      the study.
