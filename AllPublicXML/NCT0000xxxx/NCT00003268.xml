      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.
      Chemoprotective drugs, such as amifostine, may protect normal cells from the side effects of
      chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of amifostine in treating patients with
      newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia who are receiving idarubicin plus cytarabine.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether amifostine provides systemic protection against the nonhematologic
           side effects of idarubicin (IDR) during induction therapy of acute myeloid leukemia
           (AML), allowing the dose of idarubicin to be escalated.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of idarubicin when amifostine is used as a
           chemotherapy protectant.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of dose limiting hypotension in patients receiving
           amifostine and the ability to offset this side effect with vasoconstrictive agents.

        -  Determine whether any additional side effects of amifostine are dose limiting in
           patients with AML treated with IDR and cytarabine (ARA-C).

        -  Monitor the frequency of alopecia, mucositis, diarrhea, and septicemia involving enteric
           pathogens in these patients.

        -  Determine the requirement for intravenous hyperalimentation in patients receiving
           amifostine, IDR, and ARA-C.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of idarubicin (IDR).

      Patients receive amifostine IV over 15 minutes, followed 15-30 minutes later by chemotherapy.
      Idarubicin IV is administered over 15 minutes on days 1-3. Cytarabine is administered by
      continuous infusion on days 1-7. Patients may receive 1 additional course of treatment, if
      necessary.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients each are treated at each dose level of idarubicin. Dose escalation is
      discontinued when 2 or more patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
