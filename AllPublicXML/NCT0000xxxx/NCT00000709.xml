  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide accurate and complete neurologic assessment of the course of the AIDS dementia
      complex in patients treated with zidovudine (AZT). The study will determine how frequently
      patients improve, how long improvement is sustained, and the magnitude and functional
      significance of improvement.

      Individuals with AIDS frequently suffer central nervous system (CNS) problems that are
      characterized by cognitive, motor, and behavioral deficits, in a disorder known as AIDS
      dementia complex. Clinical experience suggests that its course is often progressive, going
      from initial symptoms to moderate or severe dementia within several months. Accumulating
      evidence now suggests that direct brain infection by the HIV virus is the likely cause of the
      AIDS dementia complex. Case reports suggest that therapy with AZT, which has been shown to be
      a strong inhibitor of HIV replication in vitro, may alleviate the AIDS dementia complex. This
      study will help define the natural history of the AIDS dementia complex in treated patients.

      study will help define the natural history of the AIDS dementia complex in treated patients.

      All patients receive AZT for 24 weeks. Patients are seen weekly for the first 4 weeks, every
      other week for the next 8 weeks, and then every 4 weeks until the completion of the study for
      neuropsychological evaluation. This evaluation includes lumbar puncture, and either
      computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

             the preferred method.

          -  Maintenance anticonvulsant therapy following a seizure in the context of the AIDS
             dementia complex.

          -  Patients taking anticonvulsants should have their anticonvulsant blood levels measured
             prior to starting zidovudine (AZT) or with changes in AZT dosage.

          -  Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid.

          -  Judicious use of benzodiazepams.

          -  For analgesia or fever, modest doses of aspirin, Tylenol, or ibuprofen.

          -  Use of major mood or central nervous system altering drugs is discouraged and should
             be documented.

        Patients with the following are included:

          -  An estimated pre-illness IQ = or &gt; 70.

          -  A general neurodiagnostic evaluation before entry which will include a computerized
             tomographic (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and a lumbar puncture.

          -  Stable or indolently progressive mucocutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma with &lt; 25 lesions and
             onset of &lt; 10 new lesions during the 30-day period prior to study entry.

          -  Chronic seizure disorders requiring anticonvulsant therapy as long as the seizures are
             not associated with a fixed neurologic deficit.

          -  A blood HIV culture and p24 antigen capture assay at the time of the lumbar puncture.
             A second p24 antigen assay on study entry. Informed consent form must be signed by the
             patient, legal guardian, or parent.
