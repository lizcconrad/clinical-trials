  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the safety and effectiveness of a new drug, fluconazole, with that of the usual
      therapy, amphotericin B, in the prevention of a relapse of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) in
      patients with AIDS who have been successfully treated for acute CM in the last 6 months.

      Cryptococcal meningitis is a life-threatening infectious complication of AIDS. Because
      relapse after treatment occurs in over 50 percent of cases, chronic maintenance therapy with
      intravenous (IV) amphotericin B is usually given. However, amphotericin B is not always
      effective, has toxic effects, and must be given by the intravenous route. Fluconazole is an
      antifungal agent that can be given orally and has been shown to be effective against
      cryptococcal infections in animals and against acute CM in a few AIDS patients. Also, the
      side effects experienced by over 2000 patients or volunteers given fluconazole have seldom
      been severe enough to require withdrawal of the drug.

      Cryptococcal meningitis is a life-threatening infectious complication of AIDS. Because
      relapse after treatment occurs in over 50 percent of cases, chronic maintenance therapy with
      intravenous (IV) amphotericin B is usually given. However, amphotericin B is not always
      effective, has toxic effects, and must be given by the intravenous route. Fluconazole is an

      side effects experienced by over 2000 patients or volunteers given fluconazole have seldom
      been severe enough to require withdrawal of the drug.

      Patients accepted in the trial are randomly assigned to fluconazole or amphotericin B.
      Fluconazole is given orally once a day and amphotericin B is given intravenously once a week.
      Dosages depend on body weight. Medications may be given with amphotericin B to prevent or
      reduce discomfort from associated side effects. Patients are treated for 12 months and may
      continue to receive antiviral therapy, radiation therapy for mucocutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma,
      or preventive therapy for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) during the study.
