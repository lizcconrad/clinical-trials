  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients with high blood pressure can experience an increase of blood pressure by 10
      percent or more by taking in salt. These patients are referred to as having &quot;salt-sensitive&quot;
      (SS) hypertension.

      Previous studies conducted on patients with salt sensitive hypertension suggest that their
      portion of the nervous system responsible for maintaining normal blood pressure (autonomic
      nervous system) may respond differently to salt than patients with non-salt sensitive (NSS)
      hypertension.

      This study is designed to examine the response of the nervous system to high doses of salt in
      patients with salt-sensitive hypertension and patients with non-salt sensitive hypertension.

      A subset of patients with idiopathic hypertension shows an increase in blood pressure of 10
      percent or more in response to salt-loading and have been termed &quot;salt-sensitive&quot; (SS).
      Limited studies of adrenergic function in response to salt-loading suggest that the response
      of SS patients may differ from that of non-salt sensitive (NSS) patients. The present studies
      were designed to examine the response of the adrenergic and dopaminergic systems to
      salt-loading in SS and NSS patients with idiopathic hypertension.
