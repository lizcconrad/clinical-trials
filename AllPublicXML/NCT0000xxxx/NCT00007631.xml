      One-third of all malignancies in the United States (approximately one million cases diagnosed
      annually) are nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). NMSC causes considerable morbidity, economic
      burden, facial deformity and at least 1,000 deaths annually. Prevention of these malignancies
      with a topical agent free of serious side effects would confer substantial public health
      benefit. Three hundred fifty thousand veterans were expected to develop NMSC in 1994. NMSC is
      one of the most common conditions requiring dermatologic care in the VA system. Topical
      tretinoin has been used extensively to treat photoaged skin. Retinoids administered orally in
      high doses appear to be effective in chemoprevention of nonmelanoma skin cancer but have
      unacceptable toxicity. In this study, 1131 patients with a recent history of squamous cell
      and/or basal cell carcinoma were enrolled at six participating centers over a four-year
      period and were randomly assigned to either 0.1% tretinoin cream or placebo. They were
      followed for a minimum of two years to determine if topical tretinoin is effective in
      reducing the risk of new occurrences.

      Primary Hypothesis: To determine the efficacy of topical tretinoin cream for the prevention
      of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) among high risk individuals (at least 2 NMSC?S in last 5
      years).

      Secondary Hypothesis: Secondary objectives are: (a) to determine the long-term effect of
      topical tretinoin on the prevalence of premalignant actinic keratoses, and (b) to distinguish
      subpopulations in which topical tretinoin is particularly effective or ineffective, compared
      to the overall study population.

      Intervention: Apply Tretinoin 0.1% cream or placebo cream to face and ears twice a day.

      Primary Outcomes: New NMSC lesions on the face and ears. Number of actinic keratoses on the
      face and ears.

      Study Abstract: One-third of all malignancies in the United States (approximately one million
      cases diagnosed annually) are nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). NMSC causes considerable
      morbidity, economic burden, facial deformity and at least 1,000 deaths annually. Prevention
      of these malignancies with a topical agent free of serious side effects would confer
      substantial public health benefit. Three hundred fifty thousand veterans were expected to
      develop NMSC in 1994. NMSC is one of the most common conditions requiring dermatologic care
      in the VA system.

      Topical tretinoin has been used extensively to treat photoaged skin. Retinoids administered
      orally in high doses appear to be effective in chemoprevention of nonmelanoma skin cancer but
      have unacceptable toxicity. In this study, 1200 patients with a recent history of squamous
      cell and/or basal cell carcinoma will be enrolled at six participating centers over a
      four-year period and will be randomly assigned to either 0.1% tretinoin cream or placebo.
      They will be followed for a minimum of two years to determine if topical tretinoin is
      effective in reducing the risk of new occurrences.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        High risk individuals (at least 2 NMSC?S in last 5 years).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria would include systemic retinoid treatment or systemic chemotherapy
        within the past six months; indices of very high mortality risk within 3 years (history of
        invasive noncutaneous malignancy within the past five years or metastatic cutaneous
        malignancy, or of other severe medical problems e.g. end-stage cardiac disease); known
        allergy or severe irritation reaction to tretinoin or the cream vehicle; special conditions
        predisposing to NMSC that may not be generally applicable (xeroderma pigmentosum, basal
        cell nevus syndrome, major organ transplant recipient, known arsenic exposure, PUVA
        photochemotherapy, mycosis fungoides, or prior or current radiation therapy involving the
        face, ears, or area of prior skin cancer), and likely inability to comply with the
