  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic sinusitis is a common pediatric disease; it ranks among the top five infectious
      diseases of the upper respiratory tract. Its treatment is limited and may be due largely in
      part to a lack of understanding of its cause. The investigators have preliminary data to
      support the notion that pediatric chronic sinusitis is a distinct disease, different from
      acute sinusitis and adult chronic sinusitis. We are proposing to perform pathogenesis studies
      in children with chronic sinusitis. Specifically, we wish to elucidate the microbiologic
      features and immunologic factors involved in the formation of this disease. The study plan
      calls for microbiologic (bacterial, viral, and fungal) and immunologic (inflammatory
      mediators and leukocyte populations) data to be evaluated through a maxillary sinus washing
      and mucosal biopsies. Four populations will be studied and they are: 10 children with chronic
      sinusitis, 5 children with acute sinusitis (positive control), 5 children without sinusitis
      (negative control) and 5 adults with chronic sinusitis (positive secondary control).
