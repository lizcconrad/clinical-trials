  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considerable controversy exists regarding the effect of estrogen and progesterone on insulin
      sensitivity in postmenopausal women. Thus, the goal is to examine the effect of estradiol and
      progestin on in vivo insulin sensitivity and pathways of intracellular glucose metabolism in
      postmenopausal women. This will be accomplished by examining the effects of unopposed
      estrogen (CEE) or combination estrogen and progestin (CEE/MPA) versus placebo therapy in 30
      early menopausal women (defined from 6 months to 3 years post-cessation of menses). Women
      will be treated for 16 weeks and the outcome measures will be: 1) insulin sensitivity and
      glucose oxidation as determined by euglycemic clamp, 2) assessments of insulin sensitivity on
      muscle biopsy cultures with the primary endpoints being glucose uptake and glycogen
      accumulation/synthesis, 3) protein levels of insulin action cascade steps based on muscle
      biopsy Western blots.
