      The purpose of this study is to follow responses to treatment with vaccinia immune globulin
      (VIG) for safety and clinical benefit [during HIV vaccine research].

      VIG is purified from human blood and used to treat serious infections of the vaccinia
      (smallpox vaccine) virus or similar viruses. It is the only treatment available for those
      viruses. The only available supply of VIG has developed a discoloration over time and
      therefore is considered an investigational new drug by the FDA. This study will allow it to
      be used for intramuscular injection in a controlled setting for people who may need it
      [during HIV vaccine research].

    <textblock>
      VIG (Human) is a component of plasma from persons vaccinated with vaccinia vaccine. It is the
      only product available for the treatment of vaccinia and other orthopox infections. The only
      lot currently available was released as a licensed product in 1995 but is being treated as an
      investigational new drug because of slight discoloration in the solution. This study makes
      existing stocks of VIG available as a short-term solution for the lack of a licensed immune
      globulin to treat vaccinal infections.

      Before receiving injections and 3 and 6 months after injections, patients are tested for HIV,
      hepatitis B, and hepatitis C with pre- and post-test counseling. Referrals for appropriate
      medical care are provided. Participants have multiple injections (depending on body weight)
      of VIG at 1 or 2 clinic visits. Following administration of VIG, participants are observed
      for 1/2 hour at the clinic. Participants return to the clinic for as many as 10 visits to
      monitor for any adverse reactions and signs and symptoms of vaccinia infections. On Days 7,
      84, and 168 participants return to the clinic for evaluations and have blood drawn to check
      for the response to the VIG injections.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Participants may be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Sign a consent form including consent for pre/post HIV counseling. If under 18 years
             or unable to sign a consent form, the next of kin or a legal guardian must sign.

          -  Experience complications from prior administration of vaccinia virus vaccinations or
             accidental exposure to vaccinia or similar viruses.

          -  Have a pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Participants will not be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Have eye complications.

        Note:

          -  Caution should be noted if participants are allergic to thimerosal (a preservative in
             the study drug). Precautions can be taken if participants experience a reaction during
             VIG administration.

          -  Women who are pregnant will be counseled about risks.
