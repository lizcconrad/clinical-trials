      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer
      cells. Combining chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and peripheral stem cell transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy, radiation
      therapy, and peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have stage III or
      stage IV mantle cell lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the response to a 8 week induction chemotherapy program consisting of
      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) in patients with mantle
      cell lymphoma. II. Evaluate the efficacy of ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE)
      chemotherapy and filgrastim (G-CSF) for peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization in
      this patient population. III. Evaluate the safety and efficacy of ICE followed by total body
      irradiation and high dose cyclophosphamide and etoposide in this patient population. IV.
      Assess the contamination of PBSCs by lymphoma cells following mobilization by chemotherapy
      and G-CSF in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive induction chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin IV,
      and vincristine IV on day 1, oral prednisone daily on days 2-6, and filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously daily on days 6-10. Treatment is repeated every 14 days for up to 4 courses.
      Patients receive consolidation chemotherapy with ifosfamide IV over 24 hours and carboplatin
      IV on day 2, etoposide IV daily on days 1-3, and G-CSF subcutaneously on days 5-12 for course
      1, and on day 5 for course 2 and continuing through peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)
      collection. Treatment is repeated every 14 days for 2 courses. Following PBSC collection,
      patients receive total body irradiation twice a day for 4 days plus etoposide IV over 72
      hours on days -6, -5, and -4 and cyclophosphamide IV daily on days -3 and -2. PBSCs are
      infused on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF IV or subcutaneously twice a day beginning on day 1.
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 14-24 patients will be accrued for this study within two
      years.
