      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of R115777 in treating patients who have metastatic
      pancreatic cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and effectiveness of R115777 in patients with metastatic pancreatic
      cancer.

      II. Determine the response rate, time to progression, and 6 month survival rate of these
      patients with this treatment regimen.

      III. Assess the pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral R115777 twice daily for 21 consecutive days. Treatment continues every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.
