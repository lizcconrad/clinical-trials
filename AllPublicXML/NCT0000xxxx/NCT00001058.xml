  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy and safety of clarithromycin combined with rifabutin, ethambutol, or
      both in the treatment of disseminated Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) disease in persons
      with AIDS, including individuals who have or have not received prior MAC prophylaxis.

      It is believed that effective therapy for MAC disease in patients with AIDS requires
      combinations of two or more antimycobacterial agents in order to overcome drug resistance and
      the unfavorable influence of the profound immunosuppression associated with AIDS. Data
      suggest that clarithromycin may have substantial activity in two- or three-drug combination
      regimens with clofazimine, rifamycin derivatives, ethambutol, or the 4-quinolones.

      It is believed that effective therapy for MAC disease in patients with AIDS requires
      combinations of two or more antimycobacterial agents in order to overcome drug resistance and
      the unfavorable influence of the profound immunosuppression associated with AIDS. Data
      suggest that clarithromycin may have substantial activity in two- or three-drug combination
      regimens with clofazimine, rifamycin derivatives, ethambutol, or the 4-quinolones.

      Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms containing clarithromycin in
      combination with ethambutol, rifabutin, or both. Clarithromycin alone is taken on days 1
      through 3 to determine tolerance and rifabutin and/or ethambutol is added on day 3. AS PER
      AMENDMENT 7/2/97: Patients may elect to add ritonavir or indinavir to their treatment
      regimen. Treatment continues daily for 48 weeks. In the absence of a dose-limiting toxicity,
      those patients who are determined to be complete or partial responders continue on the
      regimen to which they were originally assigned. Patients who have failed or relapsed on
      originally assigned MAC therapy, must have their therapy amended to receive clarithromycin
      and at least two other drugs not included in their originally assigned regimen. Patients are
      followed twice in the first week, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, then monthly for
      the next 4 months, and then every 2 months thereafter until the end of 12 months. PER
      AMENDMENT 10/10/96: NOTE: Any patient who develops a toxicity to rifabutin or ethambutol
      after week 12 or thereafter will be offered the option of being registered to a salvage
      regimen of 2 new drugs not previously received, plus clarithromycin to continue for the study
      duration.
