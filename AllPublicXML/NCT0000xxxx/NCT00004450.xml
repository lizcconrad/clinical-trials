      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of interferon beta and thalidomide in male patients with
      adrenoleukodystrophy who show evidence of brain inflammatory response and are receiving
      concurrent glyceryl trierucate and glyceryl trioleate (Lorenzo's oil).

      II. Evaluate the progress of the disease and possible side effects of the medication in these
      patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are
      randomized to receive beta interferon and thalidomide placebo (arm I), thalidomide and beta
      interferon placebo (arm II), or placebo for both beta interferon and thalidomide (arm III).
      Patients receive interferon beta by subcutaneous injection and thalidomide orally. All
      patients are maintained on glyceryl trierucate and glyceryl trioleate (Lorenzo's oil)
      therapy.

      Patients are followed at 3, 6, and 12 months and then may be followed every 6 months
      thereafter.
