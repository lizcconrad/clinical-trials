  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of giving IL-2 plus
      anti-HIV (antiretroviral) therapy to HIV-positive patients with CD4 cell counts (cells of the
      immune system that fight infection) of at least 350 cells/mm3. This study will also examine
      the ability of antiretroviral therapy combined with IL-2 to boost the immune system.

      IL-2, given through injection under the skin, in combination with anti-HIV therapy can
      increase CD4 cell counts. This study examines 3 doses of IL-2 in order to determine the
      safest and most effective dose to use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interleukin-2 administered subcutaneously, in combination with antiretrovirals, results in an
      increased CD4+ cell count that might impact upon HIV disease progression. A Phase III trial
      involving large numbers of HIV-positive patients is the next step in the development process.
      To develop appropriate clinical experience with this combination, this Phase II trial will
      allow administration of IL-2 plus antiretroviral therapy to a small number of patients in
      sites being considered for the Phase III trial.

      Patients receive antiretrovirals alone or antiretrovirals plus IL-2 given subcutaneously.
      Three doses of IL-2 are studied, with 12 patients evaluated at each dose. When at least 9 of
      the first 12 patients complete the 5-day dosing period without dose-limiting toxicity, the
      next 12 patients are treated at the next highest dose every 12 hours for 5 days every 8
      weeks; when this dose is tolerated, the last 12 patients randomized receive the highest study
      dose every 12 hours for 5 days every 8 weeks. Patients enrolled at the first two doses of
      IL-2 who complete three courses of treatment have their dose escalated to a maximum of the
      highest study dose.
