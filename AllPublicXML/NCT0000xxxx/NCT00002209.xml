  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give multiple doses of CPI-1189 to
      HIV-infected, otherwise healthy, males. The study will also look at how CPI-1189 affects the
      levels of HIV, T cells (cells in the body that help fight infection), and three anti-HIV
      drugs (zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir) in the blood.

      Advanced HIV infection can cause AIDS dementia (brain damage due to HIV leading to losses of
      memory and muscle control). CPI-1189 may be able to postpone AIDS dementia or slow it down.

    <textblock>
      Late-stage HIV infection can cause AIDS dementia (brain damage due to HIV leading to losses
      of memory and muscle control). CPI-1189 may be able to postpone AIDS dementia or slow it
      down.

      In this randomized, double-blind study, 48 HIV-infected, otherwise healthy, male volunteers
      receive either multiple-dose CPI-1189 or placebo by mouth for 15 consecutive days. Each
      dosing group begins 6 weeks following the start of the preceding group. Volunteers enter the
      study site the night before dosing on Days 1 and 15 and remain at the study site for 72 hours
      following dosing. Throughout the study, volunteers have physical exams and donate samples of
      blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and sperm.
