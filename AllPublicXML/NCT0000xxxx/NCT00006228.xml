    <textblock>
      Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or
      deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Interleukin-2 may
      stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill breast cancer cells. Phase II trial to study
      the effectiveness of trastuzumab plus interleukin-2 in treating patients who have metastatic
      breast cancer that has not responded to previous trastuzumab therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the response rate and toxicity to low-dose IL-2 with intermediate-&quot;pulse&quot; dose
      interleukin 2 (IL-2) and trastuzumab in patients with uni-dimensional measurable metastatic
      breast cancer and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive (3+ overexpression
      by immunohistochemistry [IHC] method or positive by fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH])
      who either have had evidence of progressive disease while receiving a trastuzumab-containing
      regimen, or have had progressive disease within 12 months of receiving a
      trastuzumab-containing regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To perform correlative immunologic assays to determine the degree of natural killer (NK)
      cell expansion in response to low-dose IL-2, and the effectiveness of patients' peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in a standard antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
      (ADCC) assay directed against a HER2 target cell.

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab using an every 2-week schedule.

      III. To determine Fc-gamma receptor polymorphisms from study patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive trastuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 8 and
      aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) on days 2-7 and 9-21. Beginning on day 22, patients receive
      trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes every 14 days. Patients also receive aldesleukin SC daily on
      days 1-14. Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-37 patients will be accrued for this study.
