      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Hyperbaric oxygen
      may increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. Combining hyperbaric oxygen with
      radiation therapy may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma multiforme.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining radiation therapy with
      hyperbaric oxygen in treating patients who have newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility and toxicity of hyperbaric oxygen combined with
      conformal radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. II.
      Determine the efficacy of this regimen in terms of radiographic tumor response, time to tumor
      progression, and survival in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Within 2 weeks after surgery, patients receive hyperbaric oxygen over 90 minutes
      once daily, followed by conformal radiotherapy twice daily 5 days a week for 17 days in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed within 2 weeks and then every 2
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-10 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
