      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the efficacy of plasmapheresis and human immunoglobulin infusion in minimizing
      morbidity and augmenting the pace of recovery in children with Guillain-Barre syndrome.

      II. Compare the potential risks, in terms of treatment related side effects and adverse
      clinical outcome, between these two treatment modalities.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      This is a randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients are randomized to receive either human immunoglobulin infusion (IVIg) (arm I) or
      plasmapheresis (arm II).

      Arm I patients receive liquid heat-treated IVIg for 4 days starting on day 1 and then another
      single infusion of IVIg on day 7, 8, or 9.

      Arm II patients receive serial plasmapheresis treatments. The first exchange is given on day
      1 and the remaining exchanges are given over the next 5-10 days.

      Patients are followed at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 24.
