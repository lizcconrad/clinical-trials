  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test whether zidovudine (AZT) is useful as a treatment for the neurologic syndrome called
      AIDS dementia complex. To determine how long AZT takes to reach cerebral spinal fluid (CSF),
      how long, and at what concentration it is found there.

      HIV infection can result in impairment in the function of the brain and spinal cord, leading
      to disturbances in the ability to think clearly and in strength and coordination. This
      disorder, which has been called the AIDS dementia complex, may be due to a direct effect of
      HIV on the nervous system. It is known that AZT does get into the brain to some extent, where
      it may reduce growth of HIV. It is hoped that AZT will stabilize or improve the symptoms of
      the AIDS dementia complex.

      HIV infection can result in impairment in the function of the brain and spinal cord, leading
      to disturbances in the ability to think clearly and in strength and coordination. This
      disorder, which has been called the AIDS dementia complex, may be due to a direct effect of
      HIV on the nervous system. It is known that AZT does get into the brain to some extent, where
      it may reduce growth of HIV. It is hoped that AZT will stabilize or improve the symptoms of
      the AIDS dementia complex.

      The study is done in 2 stages. In Stage 1, patients are randomized to receive placebo or 1 of
      2 doses of AZT. Stage 1 lasts for 4 months. In Stage 2, patients who were initially treated
      with placebo are randomized again and all patients receive AZT. Stage 2 lasts an additional
      12 months, during which time there are periodic medical and neurologic evaluations. Before
      beginning treatment, all patients have a lumbar puncture and a computerized tomographic (CT)
      scan of the brain. The lumbar puncture is repeated twice during and once at the end of Stage
      1; the CT scan is also repeated at the end of Stage 1. Patients receiving AZT in either stage
      1 or Stage 2 are seen by their physicians every week for the first 4 weeks and every other
      week thereafter for the first 4 months of receiving the drug. After 4 months, patients are
      seen by their physicians at 4 to 12 week intervals.
