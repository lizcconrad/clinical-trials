      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combretastatin A4 phosphate in treating
      patients who have advanced solid tumors that have not responded to previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of combretastatin A4 phosphate when
      administered at single doses every 21 days in patients with advanced solid tumors. II.
      Determine both the toxicity and dose limiting toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
      III. Determine the plasma and urine pharmacokinetics of combretastatin A4 and combretastatin
      A4 phosphate. IV. Gather preliminary data regarding possible antitumor effects in those
      patients with measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive combretastatin A4
      phosphate IV over 10-60 minutes. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating
      doses of combretastatin A4 phosphate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.
      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 21 patients will be accrued for this study.
