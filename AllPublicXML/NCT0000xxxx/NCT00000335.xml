  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if hyperactivity accompanies abrupt opiate
      withdrawal in heroin addicts, to determine if computerized solid state activity monitors are
      capable of quantifying hyperactivity, and to quantify the physical and affective symptoms
      occurring during abrupt withdrawal in heroin addicts and morphine's capacity to alleviate
      these symptoms.
