      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with autologous peripheral stem cell
      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more
      cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus
      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have relapsed non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine how many patients with chemotherapy sensitive relapsed non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma receiving sequential high dose chemotherapy achieve a collection of a minimum 5
      million CD34+ cells/kg in one large volume apheresis. II. Determine the feasibility and
      safety of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine disease free and overall survival of
      patients receiving this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour followed by paclitaxel IV over 24
      hours on day 1. Filgrastim (G-CSF) and stem cell factor (SCF) are administered subcutaneously
      beginning on day 3 for approximately 7-14 days (until the completion of leukapheresis).
      Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected over 3-5 days. Three weeks after
      leukapheresis is completed, patients receive cytarabine IV over 2 hours twice a day on days
      -6 to -3. Mitoxantrone IV is administered over 1 hour on day -6. CD34+ PBSC are reinfused on
      day 0. Four weeks later, patients receive etoposide IV over 11 hours on day -2 and melphalan
      IV over 30 minutes twice on day -1. CD34+ PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Concurrent G-CSF is
      administered subcutaneously and continues until blood counts recover. Patients are followed
      at 4 weeks, every 3 months for the first 2 years, and then every 6 months for the next 2
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.
