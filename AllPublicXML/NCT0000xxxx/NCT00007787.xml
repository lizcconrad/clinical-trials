  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if kidney function can be improved during transplants by
      giving the drug Thymoglobulin with delayed cyclosporine treatment instead of initial
      cyclosporine treatment.

      There have been improvements for patients receiving kidney transplants, yet acute rejection
      is still a problem. This can lead to kidney failure over time. Patients whose graft fails to
      function properly in the first week after transplant do not do as well after 5 years as
      compared to patients without early problems. This study will see if Thymoglobulin, a drug
      that suppresses the immune system, will improve early graft function.

    <textblock>
      While graft survival of post renal transplant has improved over the last decades, acute
      rejection remains a problem that clinical research has sought to minimize through improved
      strategies. Graft survival prognosis is significantly worsened in patients whose allografts
      exhibit delayed function and patients may require early dialysis. Data shows that cadaveric
      organ recipients requiring dialysis use in the first transplant week have a 5-year post-graft
      survival rate of 51 percent compared to 70 percent for those free of this complication. A
      recent evaluation of Thymoglobulin (a rabbit-derived polyclonal antibody; an
      immunosuppressant) suggests it is an effective agent worthy of further evaluation as
      induction therapy. This trial evaluates whether a decreased DGF is seen with an improved Day
      90 graft function.

      Recipients of a first or second cadaver kidney transplant are randomized pre-transplant to 1
      of 2 treatment groups. One group receives antibody therapy (Thymoglobulin) at the time of
      transplant and delayed cyclosporine therapy. The other group starts cyclosporine therapy at
      the time of transplant without Thymoglobulin. DGF is diagnosed by a less than 20 percent
      decrease in the serum creatinine levels in the first 24 hours post-transplant and/or the need
      for dialysis. Patients on the antibody arm receive additional antibody if they experience
      DGF. Biopsies are performed in all cases of suspected rejection and any patient with
      biopsy-confirmed acute cellular rejection receives treatment. Patients have regular
      examinations including blood tests and are evaluated for kidney function and incidence of
      complications for 24 months after the transplant. The trial endpoint of graft function
      encompasses graft survival and graft function as calculated by creatinine clearance.
