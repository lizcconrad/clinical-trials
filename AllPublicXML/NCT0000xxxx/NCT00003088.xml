      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Giving drugs at different times or combining more than one drug may
      kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective for
      breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy consisting
      of either doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, or paclitaxel given at different times with that of
      combination chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by
      paclitaxel in treating women with stage II or stage IIIA breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the sequential chemotherapy with doxorubicin, paclitaxel and
      cyclophosphamide to combined doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel for
      disease free and overall survival in women with node positive stage II or IIIA breast cancer.
      II. Determine whether increasing the dose density of adjuvant chemotherapy will improve
      disease free and overall survival. III. Compare the toxicity in patients treated with these
      regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized into one of four arms
      (sequential chemotherapy every 2 weeks vs every 3 weeks vs concurrent chemotherapy followed
      by paclitaxel every 2 weeks vs every 3 weeks). All tumor should be removed by either a
      modified radical mastectomy or a segmental mastectomy plus axillary node dissection. Adjuvant
      chemotherapy is started within 84 days following the last surgical procedure. Arm I: Patients
      receive sequential chemotherapy every 3 weeks. Doxorubicin IV is administered once every 3
      weeks for 4 doses. Paclitaxel IV is then administered over 3 hours once every 3 weeks for 4
      doses. Cyclophosphamide IV is administered once every 3 weeks for 4 doses following
      paclitaxel. Arm II: Patients receive sequential chemotherapy every 2 weeks. Doxorubicin IV is
      administered once every 2 weeks for 4 doses. Paclitaxel IV is then administered over 3 hours
      once every 2 weeks for 4 doses. Cyclophosphamide IV is administered once every 2 weeks for 4
      doses following paclitaxel. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered by subcutaneous injection on
      days 3-10 after each dose of doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide. Arm III: Patients
      receive combination chemotherapy every 3 weeks. Combination doxorubicin IV and
      cyclophosphamide IV is administered once every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Paclitaxel IV is
      administered over 3 hours once every 3 weeks for 4 doses following combination chemotherapy.
      Arm IV: Patients receive combination chemotherapy every 2 weeks. Combination doxorubicin IV
      and cyclophosphamide IV is administered once every 2 weeks for 4 doses. Paclitaxel IV is
      administered over 3 hours once every 2 weeks for 4 doses following combination chemotherapy.
      G-CSF is administered by subcutaneous injection on days 3-10 after each dose of
      doxorubicin/cyclophophamide and after each dose of paclitaxel. After completion of all
      chemotherapy, patients receive tamoxifen orally for 5 years. Patients undergo radiotherapy
      4-6 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy. Patients are followed every 6 months for 5
      years, then annually until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,000 patients will be accrued for this study within 22 months.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        1. Required Tumor Parameters

             1.1 Patients with operable, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the female
             breast and positive lymph nodes. Node positivity may be determined by either an
             axillary node dissection or a positive sentinel node finding by immunohistochemistry
             or histology. This includes any patient with one or more positive lymph nodes whose
             tumors are T0, T1, 2 or 3 and N1, N2, MO. Patients with metaplastic carcinoma are
             eligible. Bilateral disease does not exclude patients from entry.

             1.2 Tumors that are locally advanced at diagnosis are not eligible. This is left to
             investigator judgment. Patients with tumors fixed to the chest wall, peau d'orange
             skin changes, skin ulcerations, or clinical inflammatory changes (T4 disease) are
             excluded from this study. Dermal lymphatic involvement noted on pathology without
             clinical inflammatory changes will not exclude a patient from this study.

             1.3 Patients with any ERP/PgR status are eligible.

          2. Prior treatment:

             2.1 &lt;84 days from mastectomy or within 84 days of axillary dissection if the patient's
             most extensive breast surgery was a breast sparing procedure.

             2.2 Surgical resection margins - All tumor should be removed by either a modified
             radical mastectomy or a segmental mastectomy. Node dissection: patients may have had
             either an axillary node dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy before beginning
             treatment on protocol.

               -  Mastectomy: There should be no evidence of gross or microscopic tumor at the
                  surgical resection margins noted in the final surgery or pathology reports for
                  patients who have had a modified radical mastectomy. Patients with close margins
                  (tumor &lt; 1 mm from margin) are eligible.

               -  Segmental mastectomy (lumpectomy): Although clear margins are preferable, DCIS or
                  LCIS at the surgical resection margin will not render a patient who has undergone
                  a segmental mastectomy ineligible for this study. Invasive tumor at the final
                  resection margin will render a patient ineligible.

             2.3 No prior chemotherapy.

             2.4 No prior radiation therapy for this malignancy. Patients who received radiation to
             the breast for DCIS are eligible. Patients who have had segmental mastectomy will be
             treated with radiotherapy according to standard procedures in the treating physician's
             institution after completion of all chemotherapy. Patients who have had modified
             radical mastectomy may also receive radiotherapy at the discretion of the treating
             physician according to institutional guidelines.

             2.5 Patients may receive up to four weeks of tamoxifen therapy for this malignancy and
             still be eligible for study entry. Patients who received tamoxifen for purposes of
             chemoprevention (e.g., Breast Cancer Prevention Trial) or for other indications
             (including previous breast cancer) are eligible. Tamoxifen therapy should be
             discontinued before the patient is enrolled on this study.

          3. Age &gt; 18. There is no upper age limit for enrollment on this study.

          4. Required initial laboratory data:

               -  Granulocyte count &gt; 1000/mm3

               -  Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3

               -  Bilirubin within upper limits of normal
