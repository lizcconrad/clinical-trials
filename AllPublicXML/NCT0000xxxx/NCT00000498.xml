      To determine whether blood pressure could be controlled by nutritional-hygienic,
      non-pharmacologic means in hypertensives treated with drugs in the Hypertension Detection and
      Follow-up Trial (HDFP).

      BACKGROUND:

      In the 1970s, many studies had been conducted to control blood pressure in individuals
      maintained at normotensive levels by the use of weight control and sodium restriction without
      the concomitant use of anti-hypertensives. The associations between weight, sodium and blood
      pressure had been well established, but data on the relationship of intervention to blood
      pressure control had been less so.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups. The 95 patients in Group I were
      advised to control weight, reduce sodium intake, modify dietary and alcohol intake and were
      removed from pharmacologic treatment. The 44 patients in Group II were removed from
      pharmacologic treatment, with no other intervention. The 48 patients in Group III were
      continued on pharmacologic treatment, with no other intervention. The primary endpoint was
      the proportion in Groups I and II with diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm
      Hg in the absence of antihypertensive drugs. Secondary endpoints were average diastolic and
      systolic pressures.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the CRISP legacy data.
