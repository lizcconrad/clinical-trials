      This is a randomized, 12-week, double-blind, 'placebo-controlled trial of outpatients meeting
      DSM-III-R criteria for cocaine dependence and major depression or dysthymia (by SCID
      interview). Participants were treated with desipramine, up to 300 mg per day, or matching
      placebo. All patients received weekly individual manual-guided relapse prevention therapy.
      Weekly outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impression Scale, self-reported cocaine
      use and craving, urine toxicology, and the Hamilton Depression Scale.
