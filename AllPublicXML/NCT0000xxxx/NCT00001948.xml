  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine and compare the health-related quality of life and degree of symptom
      discomfort in two groups of patients receiving intensive drug therapy for HIV infection. One
      group will receive continuous treatment over the entire 88-week study period; the other will
      have interruptions in therapy over the same time period.

      Patients enrolled in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease's trial,
      &quot;Immunologic and Virologic Studies of Intermittent versus Continuous HAART [highly active
      antiretroviral therapy] in the Treatment of HIV Disease,&quot; may participate in this study. At
      periodic intervals for a total of 7 times during the 88-week trial, this companion study will
      require participants in both the interrupted and the continuous therapy groups to complete
      the following two questionnaires:

        1. MOS-HIV Health Survey - The patient provides a self-assessment of his or her physical
           and emotional well being. Survey questions are related to the ability to perform work
           and daily living activities, mood and state of mind, limitations on social activities,
           ability to concentrate, energy level, pain level, general quality of life, etc.

        2. Symptom Distress Scale - The patient rates the degree of symptom distress by ranking
           from 1 to 5 his or her agreement with statements about various physical and emotional
           factors, including appetite, nausea, breathing, cough, pain, insomnia, fatigue, bowel
           problems, concentration, appearance, and outlook.

      Understanding the impact of HIV treatments on health-related quality of life and symptom
      distress may provide information helpful in evaluating new treatment approaches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of multi-drug regimens known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV
      infection can now be considered a chronic, manageable disease for many people in the United
      States. However, these therapies come with complex medication administration regimens and
      numerous side effects and distressing symptoms, which may impact significantly on a person's
      health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the HR-QOL
      and symptom distress (the degree of discomfort from specific symptoms) in individuals
      participating in the NIAID protocol, &quot;Immunologic and virologic studies of intermittent
      versus continuous HAART in the treatment of HIV disease&quot;. In that study thirty-five subjects
      will be randomly assigned to receive continuous HAART therapy and 35 subjects will receive
      interrupted therapy. In this, a companion study, HR-QOL and symptom distress will be measured
      at seven time points during the 88 weeks of the protocol. Data will be analyzed using
      repeated measures and multivariate statistical tests.
