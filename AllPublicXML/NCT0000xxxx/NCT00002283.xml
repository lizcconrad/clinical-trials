  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate the effectiveness rate of dapsone plus trimethoprim as a therapy for the first
      episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in AIDS patients. Compare the rates and
      severity of adverse effects using dapsone versus trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole (TMP /
      PurposeX). Establish relative toxicities with regard to suitability for outpatient treatment.

             Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) (i.e., DFMO, pyrimethamine, and sulfadiazine).

        Patients who are glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) positive will be withdrawn from
        the study and treated with another regimen.
