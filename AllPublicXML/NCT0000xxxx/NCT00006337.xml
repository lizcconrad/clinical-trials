  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of an experimental drug called KW-6002 on Parkinson's
      disease symptoms and on dyskinesias (involuntary movements) that develop as a result of
      long-term treatment with levodopa. This drug blocks the action of the neurotransmitter
      adenosine, thought to be involved in producing Parkinson's symptoms.

      Patients with relatively advanced (Stage II to IV) Parkinson's disease between 30 and 80
      years of age may be eligible for this 7-week study. Participants will have a complete medical
      history and physical examination, including blood tests and an electrocardiogram, and
      possibly brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT scan, and chest X-ray.

      Patients enrolled in the study will, if possible, stop taking all antiparkinsonian
      medications except levodopa (Sinemet) for one month before the study begins and throughout
      its duration. For the first 1 to 3 days, patients will be admitted to the NIH Clinical center
      to undergo a levodopa &quot;dose-finding&quot; procedure. For this study, patients will stop taking
      Sinemet and instead will have levodopa infused through a vein for up to 8 hours/day. During
      the infusions, the drug dose will be increased slowly until either 1) parkinsonian symptoms
      improve, 2) unacceptable side effects occur, or 3) the maximum study dose is reached.
      Symptoms will be monitored frequently to find two infusion rates: 1) one that is less than
      what is needed to relieve symptoms, and 2) one that relieves symptoms but may produce
      dyskinesias. This procedure will be repeated at the end of weeks 2, 4 and 6 of the study.

      When the patient's optimal dose is determined treatment will begin. Patients will take
      tablets or capsules containing KW-6002 or placebo (a look-alike pill with no active
      ingredient) once a day for 2 weeks, in addition to their regular Sinemet. All participants
      will receive placebo at least 2 weeks during the study; some patients will receive only
      placebo throughout the entire 7 weeks. At the end of weeks 1, 3 and 5, patients will be
      evaluated with a brief physical examination, routine blood and urine tests, and assessment of
      any adverse effects.

      Throughout the study, parkinsonian symptoms and dyskinesias will be evaluated and blood
      samples will be drawn periodically to measure drug levels.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the acute effects of adenosine A2a receptor
      blockade on parkinsonian symptoms and levodopa-associated motor response complications in
      patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. In a controlled clinical trial, efficacy will be
      assessed through the use of validated motor function scales. Safety will be monitored by
      means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.

        Males and females between the ages of 30-80.

        Carry the diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease based on the presence of a
        characteristic clinical history and neurologic findings.

        Patients with relatively advanced disease (Hohen and Yahr stage II-IV in the off state).

        Patients with Parkinson's disease who have been treated with levodopa for at least one
        year.

        Patients with Parkinson's disease who require levodopa/carbidopa dosing at qid or more
        frequent intervals.

        Will have been receiving a stable regimen of treatment for Parkinson's disease for at least
        4 weeks prior to study admission.

        Patients with Parkinson's disease who have associated motor response complications,
        including wearing-off fluctuations and peak-dose dyskinesias.

        Must be able to provide written informed consent.

        Patients with non-idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonian variants (e.g. juvenile
        Parkinson's disease; atypical parkinsonism; secondary parkinsonism; progressive
        supra-nuclear palsy; Shy-Drager syndrome; olivopontocerebellar atrophy will be excluded.

        Patients with a clinically significant illness of any organ system, including hepatic,
        renal, pancreatic, cardiovascular, endrocrinologic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and
        neurologic system (except for those with Parkinson's disease) who may require a change in
        the treatment of that illness during the trial, or that may compromise the safety of the
        patient volunteer during the trial, or that may affect the ability of the volunteer to
        complete the trial will be excluded.

        No presence or history of any medical condition that can reasonably be expected to subject
        the patient to unwarranted risk, including cancer (except basal cell carcinoma or
        surgically excised carcinoma in situ of the cervix) as well as liver or pancreatic enzyme
        test results above the upper limit of normal.

        neuroleptic agents, metoclopramide and buspirone within three months (within six months for
        depot formulations) because of the potential liability for extrapyramidal side effects will
        be excluded.

        Patients taking nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (phenelzine, isocarboxazid,
        tranylcypromine) will be excluded.

        plus diaphragm; condom plus spermicidal foam; condom plus spermicidal sponge). an
        intra-uterine device or tubal ligation.
