      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from melanoma cells may make the body build an immune response to
      kill tumor cells. Biological therapies such as interferon gamma and interleukin-2 use
      different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. Combining
      vaccine therapy with biological therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving vaccine therapy together with interferon
      gamma and interleukin-2 in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the clinical response rate and immune response in HLA-A2 positive patients
           with stage III or IV melanoma after receiving autologous dendritic cells pulsed with
           melanoma antigen peptides (MART-1:26-35, gp100:209-217, and tyrosinase:368-376) and
           treated ex vivo with CD40-ligand and interferon gamma, followed by interleukin-2 in
           vivo.

        -  Determine the toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis to harvest autologous dendritic cells (ADCs). Melanoma
      peptides (MART-1:26-35, gp100:209-217, and tyrosinase:368-376) are pulsed separately onto
      ADCs, which are also treated ex vivo with CD40-ligand, interferon gamma, interleukin-4,
      sargramostim (GM-CSF), and Candida albicans skin test reagent. Patients receive each melanoma
      peptide pulsed ADC vaccine separately via 3 successive 10 minute infusions on day 1. Patients
      then receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously every 12 hours on days 2-6. Treatment repeats every
      2 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, then every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3
      years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24
      months.
