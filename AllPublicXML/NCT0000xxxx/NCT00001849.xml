  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cushing Syndrome is an endocrine disorder causing an over production of the hormone cortisol.
      Cortisol is produced in the adrenal gland as a response to the production of ACTH in the
      pituitary gland.

      Between 10% and 20% of patients with hypercortisolism (Cushing Syndrome) have ectopic
      production of the hormone ACTH. Meaning, the hormone is not being released from the normal
      site, the pituitary gland. In many cases the ectopic ACTH is being produced by a tumor of the
      lung, thymus, or pancreas. However, in approximately 50% of these patients the source of the
      ACTH cannot be found even with the use of extensive imaging studies such as CT scans, MRIs,
      and nuclear scans (111-indium pentetreotide). The ability of these tests to locate the source
      of the hormone production is dependent on the changes of anatomy and / or the dose and
      adequate uptake of the radioactive agent. The inability to detect the source of ectopic ACTH
      production often results in unnecessary pituitary surgery or irradiation.

      Unlike the previously described tests, positron emission tomography (PET scan) has the
      ability to detect pathologic tissue based on physiologic and biochemical processes within the
      abnormal tissue.

      This study will test whether [18-F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) or use of a higher dose of
      [111In-DTPA-D-Phe]-pentetreotide can be used to successfully localize the source of ectopic
      ACTH production.&lt;TAB&gt;

    <textblock>
      Between 10 percent and 20 percent of patients with hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome) have
      ectopic production of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) that causes cortisol excess. In
      approximately 50 percent of these patients, the source of ACTH cannot be found despite very
      detailed and extensive examination including imaging studies such as computed tomography
      scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, and octreotide scan using the conventional low dose of
      indium-111 pentetreotide ([(111)In-DTPA-D-Phe]-pentetreotide). The sensitivity and
      specificity of these imaging studies depends on anatomic alterations and/or the dose and
      adequate uptake of radiopharmaceutical. In contrast, positron emission tomography (PET) has
      the ability to detect pathologic tissue based on physiologic and biochemical processes within
      the abnormal tissue. This protocol tests whether [18F]-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
      (18F-DOPA) or use of a higher dose of [111In-DTPA-D-Phe]-pentetreotide can be used to
      localize successfully the source of ectopic ACTH production. In addition the study examines
      whether administration of the glucocorticoid antagonist mifepristone can improved the
      sensitivity of the standard dose [111 In-DTPA-D-Phe] pentetreotide. Patients participating in
      this arm of the study will have a second standard dose scan rather than a higher dose scan.
      Others will receive a higher dose octreoscan instead.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All eligible patients are invited to participate in this protocol. Patients are adults with
        possible ectopic Cushing syndrome. Since both men and women are affected with ectopic
        Cushing syndrome, both sexes are studied. All ethnic and racial groups are at risk and will
        be included. Patients must be willing to return to NIH for follow-up studies.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Pregnant or lactating women. A pregnancy test is performed in women of childbearing
        potential (up to age 55) unless they have a history of hysterectomy.

        Children (age less than18) are excluded. Because ectopic ACTH secretion is rare in this age
        group, the likelihood of benefit is less and does not balance the risk of radiation.

        Patients taking medications that alter CYP3A4 activity will not be eligible for the
        mifepristone study, since this P450 system metabolizes mifepristone. Such participants
        would receive a clinical H-OCT instead, if the L-OCT were negative. Patients with
        hypokalemia (K &lt; 3.5 mEq/L), despite medical therapy with replacement or mineralocorticoid
        antagonists will also be excluded from the mifepristone studies.

        The presence of:

          -  severe active infection.

          -  clinically significantly impaired cardiovascular (e.g., history of abnormally low
             ejection fraction, the presence of moderate pulmonary fluid overload or leg edema, and
             blood pressure over 190/100), abnormal coagulation (PT and PTT elevated by 30 percent
             above the normal values), hematopoietic (hematocrit less than 30 percent, hemoglobin
             below 10 g/dl, white count below 3000 K/UL, and platelets below 100,000 K/mm(3)),
             hepatic (liver enzymes elevated by 3-fold above normal values) or renal function
             (plasma creatinine level over 2.0).

          -  impaired mental capacity or markedly abnormal psychiatric evaluation that precludes
             informed consent.

          -  body weight over 136 kg, which is the limit for the tables used in the scanning areas.

          -  combined blood withdrawal, during the six weeks preceding the study, of greater than
             450 ml.

          -  known allergy to [111In-DTPA-D-Phe]-pentetreotide or other somatostatin analogues.

          -  strong evidence for Cushing disease. This includes those with positive IPSS or a
             lesion on pituitary MRI.
