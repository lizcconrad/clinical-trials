      This study will assess naltrexone's effectiveness in treating alcoholism in women and provide
      information on its potential value in treating eating disorders common among alcoholic women.
      Alcoholic women with and without both eating disorders and depression will be randomly
      assigned to placebo or naltrexone treatment. Each group will receive behavioral therapy for
      12 weeks, with followup 6 months after treatment.

      Background: Despite important gender differences in drinking patterns, physiological effects
      of alcohol, and co-occurring psychiatric conditions, relatively little is known about the
      efficacy of naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence in women. This study
      investigated the safety and efficacy of naltrexone in combination with Cognitive Behavioral
      Coping Skills Therapy (CBCST) in a sample of alcohol-dependent women, some with comorbid
      eating pathology.

      Methods: One hundred three women meeting DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence (29 with
      comorbid eating disturbances) were randomized to receive either naltrexone or placebo for 12
      weeks in addition to weekly group CBCST.

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, BDI-1A, BDI-II), created by Dr. Aaron T. Beck, is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. This was administered bi-weekly throughout the treatment period.</description>

    <description>The Eating Disorder Examination Interview (EDE) devised by Cooper &amp; Fairburn (1987) is a semi-structured interview conducted by a clinician in the assessment of an eating disorder. The questions concern the frequency in which the patient engages in behaviors indicative of an eating disorder over a 28 day period. The test is scored on a 7 point scale from 0-6. With a zero score indicating not having engaged in the questioned behavior.</description>
