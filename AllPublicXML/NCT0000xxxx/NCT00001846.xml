      This protocol is designed to provide a mechanism for the Department of Transfusion Medicine,
      Clinical Center to collect and process blood components from paid, healthy volunteer donors
      for distribution to NIH intramural investigators and FDA researchers for in vitro laboratory
      use. Donors meeting research donor eligibility criteria will be recruited to donate blood and
      blood components by standard phlebotomy and apheresis techniques. The investigational nature
      of the studies in which their blood will be used, and the risks and discomforts of the
      donation process will be carefully explained to the donors, and a signed informed consent
      document will be obtained. Donors will be compensated according to an established schedule
      based on the duration and discomfort of the donation. NIH and FDA investigators requesting
      blood components for research use will be required to submit an electronic (Web-based) memo
      of request, briefly describing the nature of the research, and providing assurance that
      samples provided through this protocol will be used solely for in vitro and not for in vivo
      research. This protocol also provides a detailed schema for careful and frequent laboratory
      safety monitoring of repeat research apheresis donors.

      Blood components for research use will be distributed with a unique product number, and the
      DTM principal and associate investigators will serve as the custodians of the code that links
      the product with a donor s identity. The nature of the in vitro studies in which the blood
      and components collected in this study will be used is not the subject of this protocol, and
      is not possible to describe, since it involves basic investigative efforts in greater than
      170 different NIH and FDA laboratories. The intent of this protocol is not to approve the
      research itself, but to provide adequate and complete informed consent for the donor, and to
      assure that the education, counseling, and protection of the study subjects (research blood
      donors) is performed in accordance with IRB, OHSR, OPRR and other applicable Federal
      regulatory standards...

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      -NIH and FDA intramural investigators performing in vitro studies involving human blood
      components have a need for a steady, reliable, consistent source of these blood components,
      preferably derived from screened donors documented to be free of potential
      transfusiontransmissible diseases.

      Objectives:

        -  To provide a mechanism, that is reviewed and approved by IRB, for the Department of
           Transfusion Medicine, Clinical Center to collect and process blood and blood components
           from paid, healthy volunteer donors for distribution to NIH intramural investigators and
           FDA laboratories for in vitro research use.

        -  To provide adequate and complete informed consent to the donors of research blood
           samples, and to assure that the education, counseling, and protection of the study
           subjects (research blood donors) from research risks is performed in accordance with
           IRB, OPRR and other applicable Federal regulatory standards.

      Eligibility:

      Donors must meet the eligibility criteria for volunteer whole blood donation with the
      exception of foreign travel history and other requirements, some of which are outlined below:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  Weight greater than 110 pounds

        -  No known heart, lung, kidney disease, or bleeding disorders

        -  No history of sickle cell disease

        -  Female subjects should not be pregnant

      Design:

        -  Donors meeting research donor eligibility criteria will be recruited to donate blood and
           blood components by standard phlebotomy and apheresis techniques.

        -  The investigational nature of the studies in which their blood will be used, and the
           risks and discomforts of the donation process will be carefully explained to the donors,
           and a signed informed consent document will be obtained.

        -  Donors will be compensated according to an established schedule based on the duration
           and discomfort of the donation.

        -  NIH and FDA investigators requesting blood components for research use will be required
           to submit an electronic (Web-based) memo of request, briefly describing the nature of
           the research, and providing assurance that samples provided through this protocol will
           be used solely for in vitro and not for in vivo research.

        -  Blood components for research use will be distributed with a unique product number, and
           the DTM principal and associate investigators will serve as the custodians of the code
           that links the product with a donor s identity.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Donors must meet the eligibility criteria for volunteer whole blood donation defined in the
        Standards of the AABB2 and the Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR 640,3 as modified in the
        2007 FDA/CBER guidance document on eligibility criteria for donors of human cells and
        cellular-based products,5 with the exception of foreign travel history and other disorders
        conditions as noted below.

        Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign the written informed consent
        document

        Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

        Weight greater than 110 pounds.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        No known heart, lung, kidney disease, or bleeding disorders.

        No history of sickle cell disease.

        No history of intravenous injection drug use in the past 5 years.

        No receipt of money or drugs in exchange for sex in the past 5 years.

        No history of engaging in high-risk activities for exposure to the AIDS virus, as defined
        in the AABB Donor Education Materials distributed to all donors.

        No history of MSM in the past 5 years

        Granulocyte donors may not receive dexamethasone if they have poorly controlled
        hypertension or diabetes, or if they have a history of cataracts. Hetastarch and
        dexamethasone may elevate blood pressure and raise blood glucose levels, and repetitive
        steroid administration may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataract formation or
        progression. Granulocyte donors may not receive filgrastim if they have a history or
        symptoms of coronary heart disease.

        Female subjects should not be pregnant.

        Note: Donors who have traveled to Europe, Africa, Asia, and areas of South America that
        render them ineligible for allogeneic donation due to malarial risk, Zika risk and vCJD
        risk, are eligible for research donations.

        Donors with a history of malaria, donors who have a family history of CJD, donors who have
        undergone tattooing or body piercing within the prior 12 months, donors who have received a
        graft such as bone, skin or dura mater, donors who are taking finasteride or retinoids, and
        donors who have had sexual contact within the past 12 months with a person who has
        symptomatic hepatitis C infection or donors who have lived with a person who has hepatitis
        in the last 12 months, are similarly eligible for research-use only donation on this
        protocol.

        Donors with a positive antibody to hepatitis B core antigen are eligible for research
        donations.

        Donors with HLA antibodies are eligible for research donations.

        Donors who have received an experimental drug, agent, or vaccine, and who are referred for
        a research plasma or leukocyte collection specifically because they were given this drug,
        agent, or vaccine, are acceptable if their research product is collected for use only by
        the PI who administered the experimental drug, agent or vaccine. Otherwise, they are
        deferred for one year after receiving an experimental drug, agent, or vaccine.

        Donors who have received a xenotranplant are eligible for research donations.
