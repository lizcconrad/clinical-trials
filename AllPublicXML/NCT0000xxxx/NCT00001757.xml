  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive fungal infections are often life-threatening in persons with immunocompromise.
      Persons with prolonged neutropenia secondary to cytotoxic chemotherapies are at high risk for
      these infections. Patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, receiving prolonged
      corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapies, and persons with HIV infection and AIDS
      are also at risk. With the use of currently approved antifungal therapy, many of these
      infections may still be associated with a high mortality. Amphotericin B in its conventional
      form, is the current standard treatment for most life-threatening fungal infections. Because
      of its nephrotoxicity and other adverse effects, alternatives to conventional amphotericin B
      have been sought. Alternated agents include three lipid formulations of amphotericin B,
      fluconazole, itraconazole. Although all of these agents are associated with a decrease in
      adverse effects, their efficacy in most life-threatening fungal infections has not been shown
      to be equivalent to conventional amphotericin B.

      Voriconazole is an investigational antifungal drug currently being brought to phase III
      trials in the US. This azole has been shown active against many fungal pathogens in vitro. In
      animal models and early human trials this new agent has been shown to be effective against
      aspergillosis. It has been shown to be well-tolerated and is available in an intravenous and
      oral formulation.

      This is a non-comparative, open label study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and toleration
      of voriconazole in the treatment of invasive fungal infections. This agent will be used as
      primary therapy in those fungal infections in which no antifungal agent is currently approved
      or in patients unable to tolerate the approved agent. Voriconazole will also be used as a
      secondary treatment in those patients who have failed therapy with the primary approved agent
      or are unable to tolerate that agent or have unacceptable toxicity.

      <textblock>
        Males or (non-pregnant) females must be at least 18 Years of age.

        Subjects must have one of the following systemic or invasive fungal infections at baseline:
        (1) systemic or invasive infection due to a fungal pathogen for which there is no currently
        licensed treatment; (2) systemic or invasive fungal infection, with evidence of failure
        and/or intolerance/toxicity to treatment with approved systemic antifungal agents.
        Definition of failure to treatment with approved systemic antifungal agents: a) for
        invasive aspergillosis and other invasive fungal infections: lack of clinical response
        after at least 7 days of systemic antifungal treatment at adequate doses; or b) for Candida
        esophagitis only: lack of clinical response after at least 14 days of fluconazole at a dose
        of greater than or equal to 200 mg/day. Definition of intolerance/toxicity to treatment
        with approved systemic antifungal agents: a) intolerance to the infusion-related toxicities
        of amphotericin B preparations despite appropriate supportive therapy; b) nephrotoxicity
        defined as a serum creatinine that had increased by greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl
        while receiving amphotericin B therapy or c) preexisting renal impairment defined as a
        serum creatinine that increased to greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl due to reasons other
        than amphotericin B.

        The systemic or invasive fungal infection must be present at baseline and documented within
        four weeks preceding study entry as follows: (1) positive histopathology with evidence of
        tissue invasion by fungal elements, or (2) positive serology where diagnostic (CSF
        cryptococcal antigen; serum or CSF Coccidioides antibody; serum, CSF or urine Histoplasma
        antigen), or (3) positive mycologic culture from a normally sterile site, taken during the
        current episode of infection.

        Women of child bearing potential (or less than 2 years post-menopausal) must have a
        negative serum pregnancy test at baseline, and must agree to use barrier methods of
        contraception during the study.

        Medical history must be obtained at baseline.

        Signed written informed consent must be obtained at baseline.

        Subjects must not have previously participated in this trial.

        Subjects must not be taking and are unable to discontinue the following drugs at least 24
        hours prior to randomization: terfenadine, cisapride, astemizole, and sulphonylureas.

        Subjects must not have received any of the following drugs within 14 days prior to
        randomization: rifampin, carbamazepine, and barbiturates as these are potent inducers of
        hepatic enzymes and will result in undetectable levels of voriconazole.

        Subjects must not have the following abnormalities of liver function tests (LFT's): AST,
        ALT greater than 5 times upper limit normal; alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin greater
        than 5 times upper limit normal.

        Subjects must not have a serum creatinine greater than 3.5 mg/dl or end-stage renal disease
        requiring chronic dialysis.

        Subjects must not have allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, aspergilloma, zygomycoses,
        candiduria, and/or catheter- or device-related candidemia.

        Subjects must not have fungal infections which are not considered to be invasive or
        systemic including dermatophytosis and oropharyngeal candidiasis.

        Subjects must not be receiving or are likely to receive any investigational drug (any
        unlicensed new chemical entity), except one of the following classes of medications: Cancer
        chemotherapeutic agents, antiretrovirals, therapies for HIV/AIDS-related opportunistic
        infections.

        Subjects must not be receiving or are likely to receive the following medications or
        treatments during the study period: G-CSF or GM-CSF (for other than treatment of
        granulocytopenia), any systemic antifungal medication or white blood cell transfusions.

        Subjects must not have a history of hypersensitivity or intolerance to azole antifungal
        agents including miconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, or itraconazole.

        Subjects must not have a life expectancy of less than 72 hours.

        Subjects must not have any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, could
        affect subject safety, preclude evaluation of response, or render it unlikely that the
        contemplated course of therapy can be completed.
