      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to use BufferGel in the vaginas of women
      who do not have HIV and who have a low risk of getting HIV.

      Many new cases of HIV are the result of heterosexual activity. Condom use is currently the
      only effective way of preventing the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases
      (STDs). However, women, who have a greater risk of getting HIV, are often unable to convince
      their partner to use a condom. Therefore, it is important to develop methods that prevent the
      spread of HIV and that are controlled by the woman, such as medicines used in the vagina.
      BufferGel is known to kill the organisms that cause STDs, including HIV. BufferGel may do
      this without causing genital irritation and sores as other medicines do. More studies are
      needed to see if this is true.

      Heterosexual transmission of HIV presently accounts for the vast majority of new HIV
      infections worldwide. Currently the condom is the only method available that has been shown
      to be effective against HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). However, women
      who are at the greatest risk for acquiring HIV are often unable to negotiate condom use.
      Therefore, it is important that effective female-controlled barrier methods, such as topical
      microbicides, be made available to women. BufferGel has sufficient buffer capacity to acidify
      twice its own volume in human semen, which inactivates STD pathogens, including HIV. Unlike
      most other topical microbicides, BufferGel is non-detergent so it should not cause genital
      irritation and lesions. The safety and acceptability of BufferGel still need to be studied
      more carefully.

      Participants are divided into two cohorts. Cohort IA consists of sexually abstinent women and
      cohort IB consists of sexually active women. Within each U.S. cohort, participants are
      assigned to apply BufferGel either once or twice daily. Within each international cohort, all
      participants apply BufferGel twice daily. Participants apply BufferGel for 14 days. Pelvic
      examinations are performed at Days 7 and 14.
