      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. It is not known whether combining chemotherapy with surgery is more
      effective than surgery alone.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery with or without
      combination chemotherapy in treating patients with cancer of the esophagus.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare survival in patients with operable adenocarcinoma of the lower third of the
           esophagus or the cardia treated with fluorouracil/cisplatin vs. no chemotherapy prior to
           surgical resection.

        -  Assess whether neoadjuvant fluorouracil/cisplatin increases tumor resectability.

      OUTLINE: This study is randomized for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients are stratified by
      performance status, tumor location, and randomizing center.

      Patients randomized to no neoadjuvant chemotherapy undergo resection of the tumor with
      adequate margins and resection of regional lymph nodes (R2 with at least 8 nodal groups
      recommended).

      Patients randomized to neoadjuvant chemotherapy receive fluorouracil and cisplatin at 3-4
      week intervals; fluorouracil is given by continuous intravenous infusion for 5 days and
      cisplatin is given on the first 2 days of fluorouracil administration. Tumor response is
      assessed after 2 courses; responding patients with no serious toxicity receive a third
      course. Surgery, as above, is initiated 4-6 weeks after the second or third course of
      chemotherapy. Upon recovery (within 3-6 weeks), patients who responded to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy receive 3-4 additional courses of postoperative chemotherapy (maximum total of 6
      courses). Patients whose best response was stable disease are assessed for postoperative
      radiotherapy.

      Patients on either arm with positive resection margins, positive lymph nodes, or equivocal
      complete resection are referred for postoperative radiotherapy. Further therapy for patients
      with incomplete resection is at the discretion of the physician.

      Patients are followed every 3-4 months for at least 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients will be entered.
