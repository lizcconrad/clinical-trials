      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated
           with O6-benzylguanine and carmustine.

        -  Evaluate tumor tissue biochemical and immunohistochemical predictors of response in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate carcinoembryonic antigen levels in the peripheral blood with response in
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive O6-benzylguanine (BG) IV over 1 hour and carmustine IV over 1 hour
      (beginning 1 hour after completion of BG infusion) on day 1. Treatment continues every 6
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.7-3
      years.
