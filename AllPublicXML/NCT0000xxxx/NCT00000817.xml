  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the separate and combined efficacy of a standardized acupuncture regimen and
      amitriptyline on the relief of pain due to peripheral neuropathy and on the quality of life
      of HIV-infected patients.

      Both amitriptyline, an antidepressant, and acupuncture, a Chinese medical approach that uses
      needles to relieve pain, have been used successfully to reduce pain in some people. It is not
      known how effectively these approaches relieve or reduce pain in patients with peripheral
      neuropathy secondary to HIV infection.

      Both amitriptyline, an antidepressant, and acupuncture, a Chinese medical approach that uses
      needles to relieve pain, have been used successfully to reduce pain in some people. It is not
      known how effectively these approaches relieve or reduce pain in patients with peripheral
      neuropathy secondary to HIV infection.

      Patients are randomized to receive either standardized point acupuncture or alternate point
      acupuncture treatment twice weekly for the first 6 weeks, then once weekly for the next 8
      weeks, plus either oral amitriptyline or placebo daily for the entire 14 weeks. Acupuncture
      points are located on the lower leg. Patients are evaluated at weeks 6 and 14 and are asked
      to keep a daily pain diary.
