      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients with HIV-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has relapsed or has not responded to
      chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the response rate and duration of response to etoposide,
      mitoxantrone, and prednimustine in patients with relapsed HIV-associated non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma (NHL). II. Evaluate the response rate and duration of response to cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin, and etoposide in patients with refractory HIV-associated NHL. III. Assess the
      toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) receive oral etoposide and
      prednimustine on days 1-5 and intravenous mitoxantrone on day 1 every 3 weeks. Patients with
      refractory NHL receive cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide as a continuous infusion
      over 4 days every 4 weeks. All patients receive concomitant antiretroviral therapy with
      zidovudine or didanosine. G-CSF is given for hematologic support as indicated. All patients
      are evaluated for response after 2 courses of chemotherapy. Patients with a complete response
      (CR) receive 2 additional courses. Patients with a stable or partial response receive 2
      additional courses and are re-evaluated; those with a CR receive 2 more courses, while those
      with a stable or partial response are treated off study at the physician's discretion.
      Patients with progressive disease are removed from study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 15-20 patients will be treated on each regimen.
