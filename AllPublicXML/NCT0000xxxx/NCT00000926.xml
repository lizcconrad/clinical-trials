      The purpose of this study is to see if nonoxynol-9 (N-9) gel used in the vagina can prevent
      the spread of HIV.

      Most of the people with HIV in the world today live in southern Africa. Because this
      population is not likely to use condoms, an HIV-prevention method that women can control is
      needed. N-9 used in the vagina may help prevent the spread of HIV and other sexually
      transmitted diseases.

      Intravaginal application of N-9 may help protect women from HIV and other STD infection. Low
      rates of condom use in sub-Saharan African populations, which constitute the majority of HIV
      infections, dictate the need for prophylactic methods women can control.

      This trial will be conducted in Zimbabwe and Malawi. The Phase III trial is preceded by a
      2-week safety and acceptability pilot study to determine the extent of genital irritation
      caused by N-9 and the placebo. Following the pilot study and prior to screening for
      enrollment in the Phase III trial, potential volunteers will participate in a 2-month
      behavioral counseling program that will encourage the use of condoms. Only participants who
      decide they cannot or will not be consistent condom users are enrolled in the main study.
      Study participants are given N-9 gel or placebo to use each time they have vaginal sexual
      intercourse for 18 to 36 months. Participants have a follow-up evaluation once a month; a
      pelvic exam and blood tests are performed every third month.
