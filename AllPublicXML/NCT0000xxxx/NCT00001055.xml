  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ALVAC-HIV MN120TMG (vCP205) in comparison to
      ALVAC-RG rabies glycoprotein (vCP65) as a control when administered in HIV-1 negative
      volunteers.

      ALVAC-HIV vCP205 is a second generation candidate vaccine that can be used to induce a
      humoral and cellular response against several antigens. This recombinant construct is based
      on the canarypox vector termed ALVAC and expresses gp120 of the HIV MN strain, plus the
      transmembrane portion of the LAI strain as well as gag and protease.

      Volunteers are randomized to receive doses of ALVAC-HIV vCP205 or ALVAC-HIV vCP65 control or
      both according to varying schedules over 12 months (was 6 months, amended 11/17/95) with a 12
      month follow up. [AS PER AMENDMENT 5/29/98: One additional follow-up visit is required at
      30-36 months.]

          -  Normal history and physical exam.

          -  Negative ELISA and Western blot for HIV.

          -  CD4 count &gt;= 400 cells/mm3.

          -  Normal urine dipstick with esterase and nitrite.

          -  Occupational responsibilities that preclude compliance.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Prior psychiatric condition (such as history of suicide attempts or past psychosis)
             that precludes compliance.

          -  History of cancer unless there has been surgical excision that is considered to have
             achieved cure.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Live attenuated vaccines within 60 days prior to study entry. NOTE: Medically
             indicated killed or subunit vaccines (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal) do not exclude if
             administered at least 2 weeks from HIV immunizations.

          -  Experimental agents within 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Prior HIV vaccines.

          -  Prior rabies immunization.

        Prior Treatment:

        Excluded:

          -  Blood products or immunoglobulin within 6 months prior to study entry.

        Risk Behavior:

        Excluded: Identifiable high-risk behavior for HIV infection, such as:

          -  injection drug use within past 12 months; higher- or intermediate-risk sexual
             behavior.

          -  Occupational exposure to birds. Low risk sexual behavior.
