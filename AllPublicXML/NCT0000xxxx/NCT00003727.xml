  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with a peripheral stem cell transplant
      and immunotherapy may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill
      more cancer cells. Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and
      stop cancer cells from growing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving chemotherapy together with a peripheral stem
      cell transplant followed by immunotherapy to see how well it works in treating patients with
      chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility of ex vivo expansion and reinfusion of autologous CD4+ T cells
           after interferon therapy or high-dose chemotherapy with CD34-selected autologous
           peripheral blood stem cell rescue in patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous
           leukemia (CML).

        -  Determine the frequency of hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular remissions of CML
           following infusion of ex vivo expanded T cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo mononuclear cell leukapheresis to obtain T cells for ex-vivo
      expansion, preferably before they receive interferon alfa subcutaneously (SC) daily on a
      therapeutic trial.

      At least 1 month after interferon is stopped, mobilization chemotherapy is administered.
      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 12 hours on day 0, etoposide IV over 2 hours on day
      1, sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 3 and 4, and filgrastim (G-CSF) SC beginning on day 5.
      Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected by leukapheresis when blood cell counts have
      recovered.

      Approximately 2-3 weeks later, high-dose chemotherapy begins. Patients receive gemcitabine IV
      over 100 minutes on day -5, carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -2, followed 6 hours later by
      gemcitabine IV again, and melphalan IV over 20 minutes on day -1. CD34 selected PBSCs are
      infused on day 0, at least 18 hours after melphalan administration. Patients receive GM-CSF
      SC beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood cell counts recover.

      Patients then receive ex vivo expanded autologous T cells on day 14 after
      autotransplantation. Interferon alfa is administered three times a week starting about 3
      months after transplantation.

      Patients who only receive expanded T cells, without high-dose chemotherapy and
      autotransplantation, but show no response after 3 months, may proceed to autotransplantation
      followed by a second ex vivo expanded T-cell infusion.

      Patients are followed at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 7-22 patients will be accrued for this study.
