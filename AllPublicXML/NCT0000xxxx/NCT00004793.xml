      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the effect of bromocriptine on luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion by
      suppression of prolactin and stimulation of dopaminergic receptors in early pubertal boys and
      girls.

      II. Evaluate the effect of baclofen on LH secretion by stimulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid
      receptors in early pubertal boys and girls.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Participants receive bromocriptine or baclofen followed by nocturnal measurements of
      luteinizing hormone, growth hormone, and sex steroids. Pituitary reserve is evaluated with
      the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and in children undergoing assessment
      of short stature, standard provocative stimuli.
