  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety, side effects and anti-HIV activity of different doses of
      capravirine in children and adolescents with HIV infection. Capravirine belongs to a class of
      drugs called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), which prevent the
      virus from replicating (making more copies of itself). Other NNRTIs are nevirapine,
      delavirdine and efavirenz.

      HIV-infected children between the ages of 4 months and 21 years may be eligible for this
      study if they: 1) have received less than 6 weeks of treatment with antiretroviral drugs; 2)
      have not benefited from antiretroviral therapy after 12 weeks of treatment; 3) cannot
      continue antiretroviral treatment because of harmful side effects.

      For the first week of the study, participants will have a 1-week &quot;washout period&quot; in which
      they will receive no anti-HIV therapy. During this time, they will have physical, eye and
      neuropsychologic examinations, blood and urine tests, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram
      (EKG), chest X-ray, head CT scan and skin tests. These physical exams and tests will be
      repeated throughout the study to determine changes in health.

      After the washout period, patients will take capravirine once a day in the morning for 6
      days. After each dose, a small amount of blood will be drawn at 8 different times over 12
      hours to measure the activity of the drug and HIV blood levels. A heparin lock will be placed
      in the vein to avoid multiple needlesticks. After the 6 days of capravirine there will be
      another washout period, this time for 21 days. During this time, doctors will determine the
      optimum combination therapy for the individual patient.

      After the second washout, patients will begin combination therapy with capravirine plus at
      least two other anti-HIV medicines. (These may include a reverse transcriptase inhibitor such
      as zidovudine, didanosine, lamuvidine, zalcitabine, or stavudine, and maybe one or more
      protease inhibitors such as ritonavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, indinavir or amprenavir.) For
      the first week, patients will have a daily blood test to determine HIV blood levels.
      Afterwards, treatment will continue on an outpatient basis with clinic visits every 4 to 8
      weeks for physical exams, lab tests and other procedures as required. The study will last
      approximately 48 weeks. Patients who benefit from capravirine therapy may be able to continue
      to receive the drug from the drug company sponsor or as part of another study, or the
      protocol for this study may be amended to lengthen the treatment period.

      This is a pediatric phase I dose escalation study to determine a biologically active dose and
      to obtain information concerning the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      capravirine (AG
      1549)(5-[(3,5-dichlorophenyl)thio]-4-(1-methylethyl)-1-(4-pyridinylmethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-meth
      anol carbamate), a potent non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor, that
      induces a novel pattern of resistance mutations. In addition to obtaining needed biological
      activity, pediatric safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data, the study will utilize
      capravirine's potent antiretroviral activity and novel resistance mutation pattern, together
      with serial measurements of plasma HIV viral load, flow cytometry, and genotypic and
      phenotypic viral resistance analysis to conduct pilot studies in pediatric HIV pathogenesis,
      the response to antiretroviral therapy, and to develop strategies to optimize the management
      of pediatric antiretroviral therapy. We will also use initial viral decay dynamics and other
      patient characteristics to model predictions for the long-term response to antiretroviral
      therapy. We will enroll children who have become refractory to or have experienced toxicity
      on prior therapy. The study will include resistance testing on the failing regimen, a one
      week period off antiretrovirals (washout period), an initial 6 days of capravirine
      monotherapy followed by capravirine in combination with the optimal antiretroviral therapy as
      determined by their baseline viral resistance mutation pattern and history. The patients will
      be followed for at least 48 weeks to assess long-term tolerability and toxicity, and to
      assess the clinical, virological, and immunological response to capravirine.
