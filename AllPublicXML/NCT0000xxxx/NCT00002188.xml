  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if ALRT1057 is safe and effective in treating patients
      with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive open-label ALRT1057 for 16 weeks, as tolerated. In the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity, patients may continue treatment indefinitely provided they continue to
      benefit from therapy and the study remains open and active.

      Thirteen patients are treated initially. If at least one response is observed in these
      patients, up to 14 additional patients will be evaluated.
