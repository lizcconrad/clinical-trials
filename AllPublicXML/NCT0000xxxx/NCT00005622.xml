      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor bone marrow
      transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also helps stop the patient's immune
      system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the stem cells from a related or unrelated
      donor, that closely matches the patient's blood, are infused into the patient they may help
      the patient's bone marrow to make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and
      platelets.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well donor bone marrow transplant works in
      treating patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or nonmalignant hematologic disorders.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the survival of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation using closely matched
           related and unrelated donors in patients with malignant or nonmalignant hematological
           disorders.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft versus host disease with
           this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the relapse rates with this treatment regimen in those patients with malignant
           disorders.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of infectious complications associated with this
           treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -6 and -5, total body
      radiotherapy on days -3 through 0, and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation on day 0.

      Patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) receive intrathecal methotrexate at the
      beginning of the study. If CNS involvement is documented, patients receive a second dose of
      methotrexate 48 hours later followed by oral leucovorin calcium every 6 hours for 4 doses.
      Patients with ALL and/or CNS involvement receive intrathecal methotrexate every other week
      for 12 weeks after transplant.

      Patients with prior CNS involvement receive radiotherapy for 2.5 weeks prior to transplant.
      Patients with ALL receive total body radiotherapy for 5 consecutive days prior to transplant.

      Patients are followed once a week for 3 months, and then monthly for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study over 6 years.
