  <brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of Adding Adefovir Dipivoxil and Nelfinavir to the Anti-HIV Therapy of HIV-Infected Children</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase I/II, Open-Label, Multi-Center Study of the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, Tolerance and Activity of Two Dose Levels of Adefovir Dipivoxil (ADF) and Nelfinavir When Added to Antiretroviral Therapy for the Treatment of HIV-Infected Pediatric Patients</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give adefovir (a new
      anti-HIV drug) plus nelfinavir to HIV-infected children who are already receiving other
      anti-HIV medications.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the first phase of the study (Days 1-6), the safety and tolerability of multiple doses
      of ADF is assessed when administered simultaneously with the patient's reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor (RTI) regimen. The second phase begins on Day 7 when nelfinavir is added to the
      therapy regimen for an additional 15 weeks. ADF pharmacokinetics are measured on Days 1, 2,
      and 7 (on a subset of 18 patients); peak and trough samples are collected on Day 28.
