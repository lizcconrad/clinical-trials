      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not
      yet known if treatment with cisplatin plus epinephrine is effective for head and neck cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of
      cisplatin plus epinephrine in injectable gel form in treating patients who have recurrent or
      refractory head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the effect of intratumoral injection of a cisplatin/epinephrine gel
      (CDDP-e TI) to placebo gel for local control of recurrent or refractory squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck. II. Assess achievement of a preselected (by the investigator)
      treatment goal for the most troublesome tumor in patients with recurrent or refractory
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck following up to 6 weekly intratumoral treatments
      with CDDP-e TI vs. placebo gel. III. Compare the effect of CDDP-e TI to placebo gel on total
      local tumor volume per patient. IV. Evaluate the time to response and time to progression for
      the most troublesome tumor after local treatment with CDDP-e TI vs. placebo gel. V. Assess
      the improvement in or stabilization of quality of life in these patients as measured by the
      FACT-H&amp;N questionnaire. VI. Compare the histopathology of injected lesions that respond to
      local treatment.

      OUTLINE: Randomized, double-blind study. Randomization weighted 2:1 in favor of Arm I. Arm I:
      Intratumoral Chemotherapy. Cisplatin (NSC-119875) and Epinephrine in a bovine collagen gel,
      MP 5010, CDDP-e TI. Arm II: Control. NS in a bovine collagen gel, PLCB.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 120 evaluable patients will be studied to provide 80 evaluable
      patients on Arm I and 40 evaluable patients on Arm II.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
        neck that is recurrent or refractory following at least 1 course of therapy Primary or
        metastatic tumors involving skin, nodes (palpable and biopsy- proven), subcutaneous tissue,
        or muscle allowed No involvement of major artery or any visceral organ Measurable lesions
        accessible for direct intratumoral injection with no immediate risk of hemorrhage or
        embolization Most troublesome tumor (identified by the investigator) at least 0.5 cc and no
        greater than 20 cc Smaller tumors eligible for treatment but not for efficacy assessment An
        improvable primary treatment goal (palliative or preventive) for most troublesome tumor
        must be identified by the investigator prior to enrollment If multiple tumors qualify as
        most troublesome and share the primary physician-selected treatment goal, the largest tumor
        is selected Patient may also select a most troublesome tumor and 1 palliative treatment
        goal for that tumor (need not match the physician-selected tumor or goal) No fibrotic
        lesions (e.g., previously irradiated lesion with no subsequent disease progression) No
        tumors involving or threatening to invade the carotid or other major vessel

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: Karnofsky 60%-100% Life
        expectancy: At least 6 months Hematopoietic: Absolute granulocyte count greater than
        1,000/mm3 Platelet count greater than 75,000/mm3 Hepatic: Not specified Renal: Creatinine
        no greater than 1.5 times normal Cardiovascular: No NYHA class III/IV status No history of
        arrhythmia that would increase risk of treatment Other: No hypersensitivity to cisplatin,
        bovine collagen, epinephrine, or sulfites No significant history of extracranial carotid
        vascular disease from atherosclerosis, radiation therapy or previous carotid artery surgery
        No uncontrolled local infection at treatment sites No medical or psychiatric condition that
        would preclude informed consent No pregnant or nursing women Adequate contraception
        required of fertile patients

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: More than 28 days since any antineoplastic therapy or therapy
        with investigational agents Fully recovered from side effects of prior treatment
