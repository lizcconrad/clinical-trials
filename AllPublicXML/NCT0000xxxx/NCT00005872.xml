      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin in treating patients
      who have recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, time to progression and overall survival of
      patients with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer when treated with nitrocamptothecin. II.
      Assess the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues
      weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-55 patients will be accrued for this study.
