  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide a comprehensive analysis of risk factors for the development of clinical
      cardiotoxicities in over 6,000 children with cancer who had been treated on standardized
      protocols involving the use of anthracyclines alone or in combination with other potentially
      cardiotoxic therapies or with no use of anthracycline therapy.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The data were analyzed to estimate the incidence of clinical cardiotoxicity as measured by
      sudden death, congestive heart failure, or discontinuation of therapy based on cardiac
      function. Evaluation of patient characteristics (age, anemia) and treatment factors such as
      drug, dose level, dosing schedule, exposure to irradiation and/or cyclophosphamide identified
      groups at particularly high risk for development of clinical cardiotoxicity and provided
      estimates of this risk for future treatment planning. Such estimates of high risk groups
      should make possible future trials to test the feasibility of using cardioprotectors or
      alternate dosing schedules to prevent cardiotoxicity. The incidence of clinical
      cardiotoxicity was calculated using Kaplan- Meier estimates as a function of total cumulative
      anthracycline dose and also as a function of the time since the end of treatment stratified
      by dose levels. The estimates were stratified by exposure to cyclophosphamide and radiation
      therapy. Multivariate methods were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of selected
      patient characteristics and treatment parameters and to provide estimates of the relative
      risk of each variable. The method of recursive partitioning was used to identify
      subpopulations at elevated risk for clinical cardiotoxicity. The data and analytic techniques
      were accessible through SAS data sets and procedures available to the study at the Pediatric
      Oncology Group (POG) Statistical Office.
