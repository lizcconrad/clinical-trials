      RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of the cancer cells and slow the
      growth of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interferon alfa-2b in treating patients
      who have advanced low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response in patients with minimally treated or previously
      untreated advanced low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with pegylated interferon
      alfa-2b. II. Determine the effects of this treatment regimen on the immune system by
      measuring T-cell subsets and NK cells in this patient population. III. Determine event-free
      and progression-free survival in this patient population treated with this regimen. IV.
      Evaluate the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pegylated interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously once weekly for 6
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Upon completion of
      treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for at least 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be initially accrued for this study.
      Additional patients will be accrued if acceptable responses are seen in the first cohort.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed low-grade lymphoma including any of the
        following: REAL classification Follicular lymphoma (grade I or II) Lymphoplasmacytoid
        lymphoma Small lymphocytic lymphoma Marginal B-cell lymphoma MALT lymphoma International
        Working Formulation Follicular small cleaved cell lymphoma Follicular mixed small and large
        cell lymphoma Small lymphocytic lymphoma No intermediate or high-grade non-Hodgkin's
        lymphoma (NHL) histology No evidence of histologic transformation If previously untreated,
        large tumor burden including any of the following: Nodal or extranodal mass greater than 7
        cm in diameter Involvement of at least 3 nodal sites (each greater than 3 cm in diameter)
        Systemic symptoms Splenomegaly Ureteral compression Intraabdominal stage II, stage III, or
        stage IV disease Measurable disease No prior systemic therapy OR No more than 1 prior
        therapy ( e.g., chemotherapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy with immunotherapy, or
        chemotherapy with regional radiotherapy) A new classification scheme for adult
        non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or
        &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or
        &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
