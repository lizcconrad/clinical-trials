  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if Thalidomide modulates the production of HIV-suppressor factors (MIP-1 alpha,
      MIP-1 beta, Rantes) and TH1 type cytokines (IL-12 and INF-gamma) in HIV-infected patients and
      alters viral load.

    <textblock>
      Patients will be divided, 5 per group, into Groups I, II, III and IV. Groups I and II will
      include patients who have decided not to take anti-retro viral drugs. Groups III and IV will
      include patients receiving the same types of antiretroviral drugs. Patients in groups I and
      III will receive thalidomide while patients in group II and IV will receive placebo. The
      placebo capsules will be the same color as the thalidomide capsules and will contain glucose
      powder. Patients will ingest one capsule of thalidomide at 9 PM daily on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
      5 and 6.
