  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of didanosine (ddI) alone or in
      combination with zidovudine (AZT) in HIV-infected infants.

      PER AMENDMENT 4/8/97: Part A study objectives are completed. Part B objectives: To assess the
      safety, toxicity, and tolerability and to compare anti-HIV activity, as measured by change in
      log10 RNA, of the two study arms.

      Early treatment of HIV-infected infants with antiretroviral agents may prevent the early and
      rapid decline of CD4 count and immunologic function. Combination therapy may be preferred
      over monotherapy, since resistance to a single agent can develop rapidly. Currently, there is
      little information on ddI monotherapy in young infants less than 90 days and no information
      on the use of combination therapy in this population.

      Early treatment of HIV-infected infants with antiretroviral agents may prevent the early and
      rapid decline of CD4 count and immunologic function. Combination therapy may be preferred
      over monotherapy, since resistance to a single agent can develop rapidly. Currently, there is
      little information on ddI monotherapy in young infants less than 90 days and no information
      on the use of combination therapy in this population.

      In Part A, a cohort of patients younger than 28 days (was less than 120 days; amended
      6/20/95) of age receives open-label ddI monotherapy for 1 week before initiation of AZT/ddI
      combination therapy. After pharmacokinetic data are obtained, an additional cohort of
      patients receives ddI at a higher dose. An age-adjusted dose for ddI is determined for use in
      Part B. (NOTE: As of 2/13/95, Part A has completed accrued for infants 29 to 120 days of
      age.) Part B patients less than 90 days of age (was less than 180 days of age; amended
      6/20/95) are randomized, on a double-blind basis, to receive ddI or AZT/ddI. All patients
      continue treatment until 12 months after the last patient on Part B is enrolled. PER
      AMENDMENT 4/8/97: Part A of this protocol is closed with accrual objectives met. Part B of
      the study will remain open for patient accrual until 6/2/97. Part B is designed as a 2-arm,
      randomized, double-blind study to assess safety, toxicity and tolerability as well as
      anti-HIV activity of ddI or AZT/ddI.
