      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody F19 in treating
      patients who have advanced or metastatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Identify the toxicity associated with increasing doses of monoclonal antibody
      F19 (BIBH-1) administered weekly by intravenous infusion in patients with unresectable,
      advanced or metastatic fibroblast activation protein-positive colorectal cancer. II.
      Determine the dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these
      patients. III. Measure induction titers of human anti-human antibody to BIBH-1 and correlate
      immunologic-related clinical effects. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution,
      and imaging characteristics of increasing intravenous doses of the drug. V. Document tumor
      responses in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, open label, multicenter study. Patients receive
      monoclonal antibody F19 (BIBH-1) IV over 60 minutes weekly for 12 weeks. The first, fifth,
      and ninth treatments are combined with iodine I 131. Patients with stable or responding
      disease may continue treatment for up to 12 months. The dose of BIBH-1 is escalated in
      cohorts of 3-6 patients until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose
      limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months.
