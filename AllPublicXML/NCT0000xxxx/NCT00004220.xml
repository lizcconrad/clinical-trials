      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin and gemcitabine in treating
      patients who have advanced cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities of
      gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with advanced malignancies. II.
      Determine the pharmacokinetics of oxaliplatin and gemcitabine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose escalation study of gemcitabine. Patients receive
      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.
      Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine in combination with
      a fixed dose of oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
