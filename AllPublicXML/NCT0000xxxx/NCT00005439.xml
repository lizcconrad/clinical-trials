      BACKGROUND:

      To be useful, a screening program depends on an acceptable, valid, and reliable test, and an
      efficacious and cost-effective intervention in the population of interest. Screening children
      to detect those at high risk of adult hypertension or hypercholesterolemia was examined from
      this viewpoint. Long-term studies starting in childhood have so far revealed less than
      optimal validity of blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels in childhood as predictors of
      adult levels. However, information was sparse regarding reliability of measurements,
      accounting for which could improve validity. The efficacy of interventions that could be
      widely applied in childhood had not yet been demonstrated. In addition, the costs of an
      extensive screening program and risks such as misclassification, side effects, and labeling
      needed to be evaluated. The results of this study helped determine whether screening for risk
      factors in childhood was a useful method for preventing cardiovascular disease in adults.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study examined the following factors that were key elements in the evaluation of
      screening: 1) within-person variability of BP and lipid measurements (i.e., the reliability
      of the test) and its impact on tracking of BP and lipids from childhood to adulthood, 2)
      calculation of predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity of childhood BP and lipid
      measurements considered as screening tests for adult values, after correcting for
      within-person variability (i.e., validity), 3) one potentially effective intervention for BP
      control in children, that is, calcium supplementation, and 4) evaluating the
      cost-effectiveness of screening to identify children at high risk of developing adult
      hypertension or hyperlipidemia.
