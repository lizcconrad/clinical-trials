  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Computer systems
      that allow doctors to create a 3-dimensional picture of the tumor in order to plan treatment
      may result in more effective radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy that has been planned
      with a computer works in treating patients with prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Establish the efficacy of high-dose three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in patients
           with intermediate prognostic risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

        -  Determine the PSA relapse-free survival rate of this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive high-dose three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 4-5 days per
      week for at least 9 weeks.

      Patients are evaluated at least weekly during radiotherapy and at 2 and 4 months after
      treatment completion. Thereafter, patients are followed every 6 months for a total of 3
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
