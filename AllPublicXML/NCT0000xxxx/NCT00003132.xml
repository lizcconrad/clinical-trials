      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 plus cisplatin in treating
      patients who have metastatic or unresectable cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of bryostatin
      1 in combination with cisplatin in patients with advanced malignancy. II. Determine the
      recommended phase II doses of bryostatin 1 and cisplatin in both a 21 day and 14 day course,
      based on toxicity, effect on protein kinase C activity, and pharmacokinetics, in this patient
      population. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of bryostatin 1 in these patients. IV.
      Identify any objective tumor responses arising from treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of bryostatin 1. Cohorts 1-7: Patients receive
      cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 of the first course. Subsequent courses repeat every 21
      days with bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours on day 1 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts 8-10: Patients receive
      cisplatin as in cohorts 1-7. Subsequent courses repeat every 21 days with bryostatin 1 IV
      over 1 hour followed by cisplatin on day 1. Cohort 11: Patients receive bryostatin 1 and
      cisplatin as in cohorts 8-10. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bryostatin
      1 or cisplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of is determined. The MTD is defined as
      the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience DLT. The recommended
      phase II dose (RPTD) is defined as the dose preceding the MTD. After the RPTD is determined
      for the 21 day schedule, cohorts of patients receive escalating doses of bryostatin and
      constant doses of cisplatin on a 14 day schedule. The MTD14 and RPTD14 are determined in the
      same manner as above. Patients are followed for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-72 patients will be accrued for this study.
