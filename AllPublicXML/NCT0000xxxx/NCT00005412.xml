      BACKGROUND:

      Atherosclerosis is this nation's leading cause of death for males and females, and Blacks and
      whites. There is mounting evidence that the oxidation of blood low density lipoproteins (LDL)
      plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. LDL oxidation can be prevented
      by several dietary antioxidants, in particular, vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene.
      There is preliminary evidence that dietary antioxidants may slow the natural history of
      atherosclerosis in humans. Until now studies in this area have included predominantly white
      males with symptomatic disease.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The case-control study used data collected in ARIC to test the hypothesis that individuals in
      the lowest quintile of vitamin C, vitamin E and carotenoid consumption were at higher risk of
      asymptomatic atherosclerosis than those consuming greater amounts. Antioxidant intake was
      assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire and a diet supplement survey. Cases were
      those with asymptomatic carotid artery atherosclerosis as determined by B-mode
      ultrasonography. Controls were those without evidence of carotid artery atherosclerosis.
      Secondary analyses determined which sex-race subgroups were at particular risk due to low
      antioxidant consumption.
