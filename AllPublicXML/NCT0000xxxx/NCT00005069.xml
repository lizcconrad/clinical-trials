      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients
      who have metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of arsenic trioxide in patients with metastatic renal
      cell cancer. II. Determine the safety of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours daily for 5 days. Treatment
      continues every 4 weeks for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for at least 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-19
      months.
