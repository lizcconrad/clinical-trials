      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the rate of treatment failure in osteopetrosis patients receiving
      interferon gamma in combination with calcitriol to the rate of treatment failure in patients
      receiving calcitriol alone.

      II. Compare the number of adverse events or clinical manifestations of disease progression
      occurring in these patients.

      III. Assess the effects of interferon gamma on hematopoiesis, cranial nerve function, and
      rate of infection in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo controlled, open label study. Patients are
      randomized to one of two arms (interferon gamma in combination with calcitriol or calcitriol
      alone).

      Arm I: Patients receive calcitriol once daily. Interferon gamma is administered by
      subcutaneous injection three times a week.

      Arm II: Patients receive calcitriol once daily. Patients may continue treatment in the
      absence of toxicity and disease progression. If disease progression is diagnosed in the
      control group, patients will then receive interferon gamma in combination with calcitriol.

      Patients are followed every 4 weeks.
