      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether albuterol increases strength in patients with
      facioscapulohumeral dystrophy as measured by quantitative voluntary isometric contraction
      testing.

      II. Determine whether albuterol increases muscle mass in this patient population as
      determined by 24 hour urinary creatinine excretion and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry
      (DEXA).

      III. Examine the long term safety of albuterol in this patient population.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are
      randomized into one of three treatment groups. The first group receives placebo. The second
      group receives low dose albuterol orally every 12 hours. The third group receives high dose
      albuterol orally every 12 hours. Treatment continues for 52 weeks unless unacceptable side
      effects occur.

      All patients return for follow up assessments at weeks 4, 12, 24, and 52.
