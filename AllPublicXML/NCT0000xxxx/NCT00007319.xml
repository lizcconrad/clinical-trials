    <textblock>
      The intima-media thickness (IMT) test is a low cost, non-invasive way to measure the
      thickness of the carotid artery (the large artery in the neck). The purpose of this study is
      to compare the thickness of the carotid artery among HIV infected adults taking protease
      inhibitors (PIs), HIV infected adults not taking PIs, and HIV uninfected adults, and to
      examine how the thickness may change over time.

    <textblock>
      Determination of clinical, lipid, and non-lipid risk factors has been the traditional
      approach for gauging an individual's risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the IMT
      test, which uses sound waves to measure the thickness of the carotid artery, has been found
      to diagnose CAD and predict a person's risk for heart disease as well as or better than lipid
      and non-lipid risk factors. This study will use the IMT test to see if anti-HIV treatment and
      HIV infection affect a patient's risk of developing atherosclerosis (hardening of the
      arteries) by comparing carotid artery thickness among HIV infected adults taking PIs, HIV
      infected adults not taking PIs, and HIV uninfected adults.

      There are 3 groups in this study. Group 1 will comprise HIV infected participants currently
      taking a PI-containing regimen. Group 2 will comprise HIV infected participants who are not
      taking PIs. Group 3 will comprise HIV uninfected participants. At each site, participants
      will be enrolled by &quot;triads&quot; consisting of an individual from each group. Each member of the
      triad will be closely matched by gender, age, smoking and menopausal status, race, and normal
      or hypertensive blood pressure. All 3 members of the triad must be identified before
      participants are registered to the study.

      All participants will visit the clinic at Weeks 1, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 144 (3 years). At each
      visit, participants will have a physical exam, medical history and waist/hip ratio
      assessment, blood collection, and an IMT test. The absolute value for carotid IMT will be
      compared among the 3 groups. Viral load and CD4 counts will also be measured in Group 1 and 2
      participants.
