    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study of 9-aminocamptothecin (9-AC), administered as an intravenous
      continuous infusion over 72 hours with G-CSF support for patients with advanced refractory
      ovarian cancer. The objectives of the present study are to determine the response rate to
      9-AC in patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have recurrent disease after paclitaxel-
      and cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens.
