      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of capecitabine in treating patients who
      have recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and time to treatment failure in patients with
      recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma treated with
      oral capecitabine. II. Determine the tolerability and safety of this regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily for 14 days. Treatment continues
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
