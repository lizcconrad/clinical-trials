  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and acceptable for homosexual male couples,
      where both partners have the same HIV status, to use Advantage 24 during anal intercourse.
      Advantage 24 is a spermicide (a chemical that kills sperm).

      Much research and development is being done with chemicals that can be controlled by the
      receptive partner to prevent the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases
      (STDs). Advantage 24 currently is used in the vagina as a form of birth control. The safety
      of Advantage 24 is particularly important for HIV-positive men because they have a greater
      chance of serious reaction to Advantage 24 due to other HIV-related conditions.

      Chemical barriers which can be controlled by the receptive partner to prevent transmission of
      HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are among the highest priorities for
      research and development. Advantage 24 is a contraceptive gel containing nonoxynol-9 (N-9).
      This study provides information on the safety of N-9 in a bioadhesive gel formulated for use
      by MSM during anal intercourse. Safety is assessed for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative men
      because HIV-positive men may be at increased risk for toxicity due to other HIV-related
      conditions.

      Participants are divided into 4 cohorts depending on their serostatus and whether they are
      the insertive or receptive partner. Participants apply Advantage 24 once or twice a day for 5
      weeks and 4 times a day for the sixth week. Check-in visits, which include a genital exam,
      are performed at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7. More complete physical evaluations, including
      anoscopy for receptive partners and blood tests, are performed at Weeks 3, 6, and 8.

          -  Sensitivity or irritative symptoms when using N-9 or when exposed to latex.

          -  Three or more Herpes Simplex 2 Virus (HSV-2) outbreaks within 12 months prior to
             screening (HIV-positive participants only).

          -  One or more HSV-2 outbreaks within 6 months prior to screening (HIV-positive
             participants only).

        Receptive partners with the following additional prior conditions are excluded:
