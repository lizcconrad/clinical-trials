      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irofulven in treating patients who have
      stage IVB or recurrent cervical cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene in patients with stage IVB
      or recurrent cervical carcinoma. II. Determine the safety of this drug in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene IV over 5 minutes daily for 5
      consecutive days. Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      or disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-19
      months.
