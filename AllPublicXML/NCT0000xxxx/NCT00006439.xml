  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adherence to complex medication regimens is critical to successful treatment of HIV
      infection. Unfortunately, adherence to medical regimens with conventional interventions
      averages 50% in chronic disease. We have observed that adherence barriers that were
      unrecognized by providers in the clinic setting have been detected during home visits. It is
      possible that recognition and interventions to resolve adherence barriers observed during
      home visits may improve adherence. This proposal will test the hypothesis that home-visits
      which identify previously unrecognized adherence barriers and provide support and education
      will increase medication adherence among children and youth with HIV infection and improve
      the patient/health care provider relationship. Specific aims of the study are: 1. Determine
      the impact of a series of home-visits on adherence to medication regimens for HIV infected
      youth and children. 1a. Adherence to medical regimens will be assessed before and after the
      series of home-visits using a self-report questionnaire and Microelectronic Monitoring System
      (MEMS) or in-home pill count. 1b. For each of these measures a percentage of adherence will
      be calculated and compared from a baseline to after the final home visit and after the six
      month follow up period. 2. Assess the changes in patient satisfaction from baseline to after
      the home-visits using a questionnaire completed by the patient/family. 3. Incorporate a pilot
      study to assess the changes in the provider's knowledge of the patient's family
      characteristics and home circumstances relevant to adherence following the home visits.
