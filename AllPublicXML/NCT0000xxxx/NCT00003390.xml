      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene in treating
      patients with metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (HMAF) in patients with
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma. II. Investigate the safety of HMAF given to this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene intravenously for 5 minutes every day
      for 5 consecutive days. Treatment is repeated every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed after every 2 treatment courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-19
      months.
