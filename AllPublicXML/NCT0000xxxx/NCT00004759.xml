      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the efficacy and safety of 24- versus 48-hour infusion of methylprednisolone
      (MePRDL) versus tirilazad for patients with acute spinal cord injury.

      II. Compare neurologic recovery following 24- and 48-hour MePRDL infusions.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by participating
      institution.

      Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups within 6 hours of injury. Treatment
      begins within 2 hours of randomization.

      One group receives a 24-hour methylprednisolone (MePRDL) infusion: a loading dose followed in
      45 minutes by a 23-hour continuous infusion. A placebo for tirilazad is also administered.

      A second group receives the same MePRDL loading dose but the continuous infusion is
      maintained for 48 hours. A placebo for tirilazad is also administered.

      A third group receives a 48-hour infusion of tirilazad with an initial bolus dose of MePRDL.
      Eight additional doses of tirilazad are administered by intravenous push. The MePRDL loading
      dose may be omitted for patients who received a prestudy MePRDL dose.

      Patients are followed at 72 hours, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after the injury.
