  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a multifactorial genetic study of cancer risk-related behaviors and
      other complex human characteristics. The main areas of interest are tobacco smoking, excess
      alcohol consumption, psychological traits, and HIV/AIDS susceptibility and progression. The
      subjects will be adult male and female probands who display one or more of the phenotypes of
      interest together with their brothers, sisters and parents. Information on tobacco and
      alcohol use, psychological and personality traits, sexual behavior, HIV status and
      progression, and other characteristics with possible genetic components will be obtained
      through structured interviews and questionnaires. DNA will be prepared from blood samples and
      typed for a series of candidate genes chosen for function and for random polymorphic markers.
      By correlating the genotypic and phenotypic information, we hope to identify individual loci
      that interactively contribute to many different aspects of human health and disease.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The basic requirement for entry in the study will be the presence of any individual smoker
        who is willing to complete the evaluation process and donate a blood sample.

        Additional siblings will be encouraged but not required to participate.

        Probands will be recruited through smoking cessation programs at the National Naval Medical
        Center.

        Attendees at programs offered by the Health Promotions Department and the Military Family
        Health Center will be invited to participate in this study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All subjects will be adults (greater than 18 years).

        There will be no exclusions based on sex, ethnic group, or race.
