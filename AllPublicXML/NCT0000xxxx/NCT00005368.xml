      To determine prospectively the role of elevated plasma triglyceride (TG) as a risk factor for
      20-year coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality in familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) and
      familial hypertriglyceridemia (FHTG), the familial forms of hypertriglyceridemia. Also, to
      perform genetic epidemiologic studies of recently identified lipoprotein risk factors for
      CHD, including Atherogenic Lipoprotein Phenotypes (ALP) based on subclasses of low-density
      lipoproteins (LDL), Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) and apolipoprotein (apo) B plasma levels, and apo
      E isoforms.

      BACKGROUND:

      The study provided valuable new data on the role of triglyceride as a risk factor for
      coronary heart disease and on the genetic epidemiology of lipoprotein risk factors, using the
      only existing sample of families with hypertriglyceridemia that could be studied
      prospectively.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Using a sample of 101 families identified and studied in Seattle in the early 1970s, the
      study sought to determine if 20-year CHD mortality and all-cause mortality were increased in
      siblings and offspring of probands from families with familial combined hyperlipidemia and
      familial hypertriglyceridemia, compared to a group of married-in spouse controls. The study
      also sought to determine if elevated plasma triglycerides at baseline predicted 20-year CHD
      mortality in these family members. Based on new blood samples from these same families, the
      inheritance of LAP phenotypes was investigated, the association of elevated plasma Lp(a) and
      apo B levels with parental CHD mortality was examined, and the association of lipid levels
      with apo E isoforms was investigated. A repository of frozen white blood cells and plasma
      aliquots for future genetic studies was established.. These hypotheses were addressed by
      determining the vital status of 1009 family members in the 101 families, carefully
      classifying the cause of death as CHD or not for deceased family members, and by obtaining
      new blood samples from three generations of these families, including both local and
      non-local relatives. New personal and family history medical questionnaires were also
      completed for each participant.

      The study was renewed in FY 1997 through June 30, 2001. The study has three new specific
      aims: to elucidate the genetic basis of small, dense, low-density lipoprotein, to map the
      chromosomal location(s) of gene(s) influencing this phenotype using a whole genome screen; to
      reveal common genetic influences (pleiotropic effects) on combinations of interrelated
      lipoprotein risk factors; and to evaluate familial CVD risk by determining the association
      between CVD in the proband generation and lipoprotein phenotypes, including lipoprotein(a) in
      the younger offspring generation in specific forms of familial hyperlipidemia.
