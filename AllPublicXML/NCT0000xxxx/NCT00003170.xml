      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Glutamine may be
      an effective treatment for acute diarrhea caused by radiation therapy. It is not known if
      glutamine is an effective treatment for acute diarrhea caused by radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of
      glutamine in preventing acute diarrhea in patients who have pelvic cancer and who are
      receiving radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether glutamine is effective in reducing the acute treatment
      related diarrhea in patients receiving pelvic external beam radiation therapy as adjuvant or
      primary treatment of malignancy. II. Determine whether glutamine can reduce chronic treatment
      related enteropathy following completion of therapy. III. Determine whether glutamine causes
      any toxicity in this situation. IV. Provide initial reliability and validity data for a
      patient bowel function questionnaire.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are
      stratified by history of anterior resection of the rectum (yes vs no); total planned
      cumulative dose, including boost fields of external beam radiotherapy (4500-5350 cGy vs
      5350-6000 cGy vs greater than 6000 cGy); use of fluorouracil (none vs bolus vs continuous
      infusion); and primary site (rectal cancer vs prostate cancer vs gynecological cancer vs
      other). Beginning the first or second day of radiotherapy, patients receive either oral
      glutamine or a placebo twice daily, including the days that they do not receive radiotherapy.
      Patients continue on treatment throughout radiotherapy and continue 2 weeks postradiotherapy
      or until grade 3 diarrhea occurs. Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks, then at 12
      months, and then at 24 months after radiotherapy.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed pelvic cancer Planned therapy is to
        undergo continuous definitive or adjuvant external beam pelvic radiation therapy with or
        without fluorouracil (5-FU) plus or minus levamisole No split course radiation therapy
        Planned course of radiation therapy must also meet the following criteria: - Entire pelvis
        must be encompassed by the planned radiotherapy fields - Total planned dose to the central
        axis midplane or isocenter for the whole pelvic field must be between 4500-5350 cGy -
        Treatment must be given 4-5 times per week on a one-treatment-per-day basis No stool
        incontinence or stool frequency of 7 or more per day prior to initiation of radiation
        therapy Must be entered on study before the second radiation therapy fraction No current or
        prior metastases beyond pelvic regional lymph nodes Must have functioning rectum No planned
        perineal irradiation No anal cancer No active intraluminal gastrointestinal (GI) tumors
