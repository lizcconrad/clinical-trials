      BACKGROUND:

      The adverse health effects of actively inhaled cigarette smoke include impaired pulmonary
      function, increased coronary and cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, and
      cancer. Infants and young children of smoking parents are at increased risk for lower
      respiratory tract infections and small airways disease than are children of non-smoking
      parents. What is less clear is how the oxygen transport system of the growing child is
      affected by the long-term exposure to and passive inhalation of cigarette smoke and if this
      exposure represents a risk for the subsequent development of atherosclerotic heart disease.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A sample of 300 pre-adolescent twin pairs was recruited from an established population-based
      twin study. The three cohorts of twins and their parents were initially evaluated in a
      cross-sectional study and then followed longitudinally for up to three years. In the initial
      testing cycle the following data were collected: genotype; general health; anthropometric
      measures; resting and exercise noninvasive evaluation of hemodynamic parameters including
      blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, left ventricular mass, and oxygen consumption;
      hematocrit and blood levels of 2,3-DPG, cotinine, thiocyanate, and erythropoietin;
      spirometric and pulmonary flow data; lipid levels. There were three follow-up exams. The
      availability of repeated measures of oxygen delivery and its determinants in twins and their
      parents permitted both a unique analysis of genetic and environmental factors during the
      process of developmental change and measurements of the risks of accelerated
      atherosclerotic/ischemic heart disease and of the development of reactive airway disease.

      The following hypotheses were tested: genetic factors accounted for a significant proportion
      of the variation in the hematologic and cardiovascular determinants of systemic oxygen
      delivery; adaptive responses of the oxygen delivery system differed in the same individual
      before and after puberty; passive smoking in children was an incremental risk factor for the
      development of accelerated atherosclerotic/ischemic cardiovascular disease; passive smoking
      in children was a contributing factor in the development of reactive airway disease.
