    <textblock>
      St. John's Wort is a popular dietary supplement that many patients-including those with
      epilepsy or seizures-take in addition to their regular medicines to elevate mood or relieve
      stress. Preliminary research indicates that this supplement can speed the metabolism of the
      anti-seizure drug Tegretol, causing reduced blood levels of the drug. Patients who take
      Tegretol to control their seizures may have more frequent seizures if the blood level of the
      drug drops too low. A recent study shows that this effect is not seen when Tegretol is taken
      for at least 3 weeks. The present study will examine whether there is a medically important
      drug interaction between St. John's wort and Tegretol when Tegretol is taken for 1 day.

      Normal healthy volunteers between 21 and 65 years old who are not taking medicines that can
      affect the metabolism of drugs in the liver and have not used St. John's wort for at least 30
      days may be eligible for this 25-day study.

      Participants will take a 400-mg dose of Tegretol after fasting overnight. Blood samples will
      be drawn the next day during a 12-hour clinic stay at the following intervals: just before
      the Tegretol dose and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, 34, 48 and 72 hours after the dose. A
      catheter will be placed in the vein to prevent the need for multiple needle sticks until
      after the 10-hour sample. After completing the blood sampling, participants will take 300 mg
      of St. John's wort 3 times a day with meals for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, another fasting dose
      of Tegretol will be given and the 72-hour blood study will be repeated.

      This study may provide information important for the care of patients with epilepsy who take
      both Tegretol and St. John's Wort.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alternative or complementary therapies are widely used by patients with epilepsy. St. John's
      Wort is one of the most popular herbal dietary supplements with a variety of claims including
      mood elevation and stabilization, stress relief, anti-viral effects, and enhancement of the
      immune system. We have previously demonstrated that treatment with St. John's Wort for 14
      days does not induce the clearance of carbamazepine under steady state conditions of
      autoinduction of carbamazepine clearance. One proposed mechanism for this lack of effect is
      that St. John's Wort is not sufficiently potent to further induce previously induced CYP3A4
      enzyme activity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of St. John's Wort on
      single dose carbamazepine pharmacokinetics under conditions of uninduced CYP3A4. To evaluate
      this potential drug interaction, as well as the effect of St. John's Wort on epoxide
      hydrolase activity, eight normal healthy subjects will be enrolled into this pharmacokinetic
      study. Subjects will take a single 400 mg dose of carbamazepine followed by serial blood
      sampling over 72 hours for carbamazepine and carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentrations.
      Subjects will then begin taking a standardized formulation of St. John's Wort three times
      daily with meals for two weeks. Following 2 weeks of St. John's Wort subjects will then again
      take a single 400 mg dose of carbamazepine and have serial blood samples collected for
      carbamazepine and carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentrations. The total carbamazepine and
      carbamazepine epoxide exposure (AUC), oral clearance (CL/F), and maximal concentrations
      (Cmax) will be compared between treatment phases to characterize the potential drug
      interaction.
