      RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiosurgery delivers x-rays directly to the tumor and may cause less
      damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating
      patients who have liver metastases, lung metastases, or other advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility of fractionated stereotactic body radiosurgery in patients
           with advanced extracranial tumors.

        -  Assess the toxicities of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine tumor response and cause of death in these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fractionated stereotactic body radiosurgery over 30 minutes for
      5-10 days for a total of 3 treatments.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-25 patients will be accrued within 2-3 years.
