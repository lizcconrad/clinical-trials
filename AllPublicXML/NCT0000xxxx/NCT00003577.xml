      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not
      yet known whether combination chemotherapy plus epirubicin is more effective than combination
      chemotherapy alone for stage I or stage II breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying combination chemotherapy alone to see
      how well it works compared to combination chemotherapy and epirubicin in treating women with
      stage I or stage II breast cancer who have undergone surgery to remove the tumor.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare disease-free and overall survival of women with early stage breast cancer
           treated with adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil with or without
           epirubicin.

        -  Compare the quality of life in a subgroup of these patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to radiotherapy timing
      (concurrent versus sequential), nodal status (negative versus 1-3 versus at least 4), age (50
      and under versus over 50), grade, and tumor size. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide on days 1-14 and methotrexate IV and
           fluorouracil IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive epirubicin IV on day 1 every 3 weeks for 4 courses followed by
           cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil, as in arm I, for 4 courses.

      Some patients may receive radiotherapy during or after chemotherapy. Treatment continues in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed in a subset of patients (N=500) before chemotherapy starts, at 3
      months of treatment, at the end of chemotherapy, and at 6, 12, and 18 months after treatment.

      Patients are followed annually for 10 years.

      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 2,000 patients will be accrued for this study within 4
      years.
