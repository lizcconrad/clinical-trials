  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the major interests of this laboratory is the characterization of the cellular
      subpopulations involved in the triggering and immunoregulation of B lymphocytes to produce
      antibodies. We are assessing the responses of individuals to produce antibodies against newly
      encountered antigens such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) (approved project number
      77-I-0130) and propose to assess the amnestic responses to the previously encountered
      antigen, tetanus toxoid. The purpose of this protocol is to add this recall antigen to our
      repertoire of antigens used to evaluate the immune response in man.

      Booster immunization with tetanus/diphtheria toxoid has now been used for several years by a
      number of clinical immunology laboratories throughout the country to assess B cell related
      immunologic profiles in patients and control normal subjects. We have recently developed a
      sensitive ELISA assay for IgM and IgG in vitro specific antibody responses against tetanus
      toxoid. This will allow us to carefully and precisely monitor the evolution and
      immunoregulation of the human B cell responses to this recall antigen. This is of particular
      importance and relevance to us in our ongoing studies of a number of diseases characterized
      by abnormalities of immunologic reactivity, including those treated with various regimens of
      immunosuppressive agents.
