      BACKGROUND:

      Estrogen replacement therapy is beneficial for heart disease risk factors as well as for bone
      density. However, a large proportion of postmenopausal women are not compliant with
      therapeutic regimens. Phytoestrogens are naturally occurring compounds found in plants and
      soy products that have estrogenic effects, and may represent an alternative treatment for the
      prevention of heart disease and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. However, few
      intervention trials have examined the extent to which it is possible to improve heart disease
      risk factors, bone density, and quality of life in postmenopausal women through use of a
      dietary supplement of phytoestrogen.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 210 women were enrolled in the
      study to be followed for one to two years. The women were randomized to phytoestrogen
      treatment or to placebo. Data are collected at baseline visits, at one and three month
      follow-up telephone calls, and at 6, 12, and 24 month follow-up clinic visits. Measures of
      high density lipoprotein and other heart disease risk factors, hip and spine bone density,
      and depression, life satisfaction, and quality of well-being are obtained. Cross-sectional
      and longitudinal comparisons of treatment and placebo groups are performed before and after
      adjustment and stratification for potentially confounding covariates.

      The study was renewed in March 2002 to assess whether the women treated with phytoestrogens
      had lowered homocysteine, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, E-selectin, and decreased
      obesity and fat mass over two years.
