      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients with recurrent ependymomas following radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy and toxicity of etoposide and cisplatin in patients with
      recurrent ependymomas.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive cisplatin followed by etoposide on days 1-3. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks for a total of 6 courses unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
      intervenes. The etoposide dose may be increased by 10% on subsequent courses if the white
      blood cell and platelet nadirs on the previous course are at least 3,000 and 100,000,
      respectively. Patients are followed every 2 months for 6 months, then every 3 months for 4.5
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be entered over approximately 7 years if there
      are 3-8 responses in the first 13 patients and 7-9 responses in the first 25 patients.
