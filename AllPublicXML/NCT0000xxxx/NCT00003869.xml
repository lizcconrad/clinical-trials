    <textblock>
      Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of carboxyamidotriazole in treating
      patients who have stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Chemotherapeutic agents
      are modestly effective for the treatment of advanced lung cancer, with rapid tumor relapse
      and growth even after initial response to therapy. It is not yet known whether
      carboxyamidotriazole is more effective than no further treatment after standard chemotherapy
      for non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether oral administration of the carboxyaminoimidazole (CAI) is more
      effective than placebo in prolonging the overall survival in patients with non-small cell
      lung cancer stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer who have been stable or had
      tumor regression following chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral CAI following chemotherapy. II. To
      determine whether CAI prolongs time-to-disease progression relative to a placebo.

      III. To evaluate whether a substantive effect in quality of life (QOL) can be detected
      between the CAI and placebo groups using the FACT-L and the UNISCALE.

      IV. To document the response rate to CAI in patients with measurable or evaluable disease.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate genotypes at GSH-related loci as predictors of overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to timing of first-line therapy (prior to registration vs after registration),
      disease stage (IIIA vs IIIB vs IV), therapy components (chemotherapy and thoracic
      radiotherapy vs chemotherapy only), ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2) and participating
      center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral carboxyamidotriazole daily.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral placebo daily.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then monthly during study.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time from randomization to death of any cause. Participants who did not die or were lost to follow-up were censored at the time of last evaluation/follow-up date. Patients were followed for a maximum of 5 years from randomization. The median OS with 95%CI was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants With Severe Non-hematologic Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>every cycle during treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Severe non-hematologic adverse events were defined as adverse events grade 3 or higher, regardless of attribution to study drug. Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC version 2.0)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Disease Progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>TTP is defined as the time from randomization to first documented disease progression(PD). Patients who were lost to follow-up were censored at the time of last evaluation. For patients who died without clear documentation, PD was assumed at the midpoint of the time interval between last evaluation and death. Median TTP was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method.
Measurable PD: ≥25% increase in the sum of the products of two greatest perpendicular diameters of all indicator lesions or appearance of new lesion(s). Evaluable PD: definite increase in tumor size or appearance of new lesion(s)</description>

    <measure>Clinically Significant (10-point) Decrease in UNISCALE Quality of Life (QOL)Assessment From Baseline to Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The UNISCALE was used to assess QOL. UNISCALE is a single item global measure of QOL. Participant were to complete the questionnaire at baseline and every 8 weeks, prior to assessment by the treating physician. A high score indicates a higher quality of life while a low score represents a lower quality of life. A 10 point or greater decline (from baseline to week 8) in UNISCALE QOL score was considered clinically significant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinically Significant (10-point) Decrease in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Lung Cancer (FACT-L) Quality of Life (QOL)Assessment From Baseline to Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-L is a 36-item Likert instrument that combines frequency of symptomatic/QOL problems with perceived relative importance of each issue. It includes 4 constructs of well being: physical, social/family, emotional and functional, and a fifth construct, additional concerns, dealing solely with tumor related symptoms. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and 8 weeks. Questions within each construct were summated to obtain a construct score. A higher score relates to higher quality of life. A 10 point or greater decline (from baseline to week 8) was considered clinically significant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With a Confirmed Tumor Responses Treated With CAI.</measure>
    <time_frame>During Treatment (up to 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed response was defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) for patients with measurable disease or as a CR or regression (REGR) for patients with evaluable disease noted on 2 consecutive evaluations at least 4 weeks apart.
CR: total disappearance of all tumor;
PR: &gt;=50% reduction of the sum of the products of the two greatest perpendicular diameters of all indicator lesions;
REGR: Definite decrease in tumor size and no new lesion(s).</description>

        <title>Time to Disease Progression (TTP)</title>
        <description>TTP is defined as the time from randomization to first documented disease progression(PD). Patients who were lost to follow-up were censored at the time of last evaluation. For patients who died without clear documentation, PD was assumed at the midpoint of the time interval between last evaluation and death. Median TTP was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method.
Measurable PD: ≥25% increase in the sum of the products of two greatest perpendicular diameters of all indicator lesions or appearance of new lesion(s). Evaluable PD: definite increase in tumor size or appearance of new lesion(s)</description>

A 10 point or greater decline (from baseline to week 8) in UNISCALE QOL score was considered clinically significant.</description>

        <description>The FACT-L is a 36-item Likert instrument that combines frequency of symptomatic/QOL problems with perceived relative importance of each issue. It includes 4 constructs of well being: physical, social/family, emotional and functional, and a fifth construct, additional concerns, dealing solely with tumor related symptoms. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and 8 weeks. Questions within each construct were summated to obtain a construct score. A higher score relates to higher quality of life. A 10 point or greater decline (from baseline to week 8) was considered clinically significant.</description>

          <description>Confirmed response was defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) for patients with measurable disease or as a CR or regression (REGR) for patients with evaluable disease noted on 2 consecutive evaluations at least 4 weeks apart.
CR: total disappearance of all tumor;
PR: &gt;=50% reduction of the sum of the products of the two greatest perpendicular diameters of all indicator lesions;
