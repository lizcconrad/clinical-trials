      To determine response rate, median time to tumor progression, qualitative and quantitative
      toxicity and reversibility of toxicity in patients with advanced refractory AIDS-associated
      Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) administered a 3-hour infusion of paclitaxel every 14 days. To evaluate
      the clinical benefit of paclitaxel in this patient population by evaluating self-reported
      responses to the Symptom Distress Scale and by documenting and evaluating any changes in
      their lymphedema, pain and disfiguring facial lesions.

    <textblock>
      Patients are treated with paclitaxel intravenously every 2 weeks up to 10 courses. Patients
      who achieve a complete response receive 2 additional courses those who achieve partial
      response or stabilization, continue therapy until progression.
