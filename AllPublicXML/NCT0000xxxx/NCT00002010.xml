      The study is intended to examine the efficacy of fluconazole for the treatment of
      coccidioidal meningitis in patients with new onset of infection, relapse of previous
      infection, or failed previous therapy. Drug efficacy, safety and tolerance will be examined.

          -  Be clinically judged to be in need of treatment for coccidioidal meningitis.

          -  Have &gt; 1 week life expectancy.

          -  Allowed:

          -  Immunocompromised patients.

          -  Patients with renal disease will have the dose of fluconazole adjusted and serum

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded:

          -  Current antifungal infection that is responding to another agent. Findings of
             improvement include one of the following, while on other therapy (without subsequent
             relapse of the item):

          -  CSF culture conversion from positive to negative.

          -  Immediately life-threatening coccidioidomycosis defined as infection of such a degree
             of clinical severity that the patient would be expected to die within 1 week, if
             untreated, based on clinical judgment.

          -  Experienced a prior allergic reaction or major side effect from an imidazole or
