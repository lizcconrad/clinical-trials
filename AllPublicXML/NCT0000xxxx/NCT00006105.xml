      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Chemoprotective drugs, such as amifostine, may protect normal cells
      from the side effects of chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemcitabine, cisplatin, and
      amifostine following surgery in treating patients who have locally advanced bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxicity of adjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin with amifostine
           cytoprotection in patients with completely resected locally advanced bladder cancer.

        -  Compare recurrence rate in these patients when treated with this regimen to historical
           control patients who had a cystectomy performed by the same surgeon.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, and cisplatin
      IV over 60 minutes and amifostine IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Treatment continues every 28
      days for a total of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-42 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Subjects receive the study drug combination in 29-day cycles. Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) is given by IV infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. Cisplatin (70 mg/m2) is given by IV infusion on Day 1 of each cycle. Immediately prior to each cisplatin infusion amifostine (910 mg/m2) will be given by IV infusion.</description>
