  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the use of acyclovir (ACV) and zidovudine (AZT) in the treatment of cytomegalovirus
      (CMV) retinitis in patients with AIDS who would otherwise be treated with ganciclovir (DHPG)
      alone.

      CMV retinitis is one of the most common opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS. DHPG
      is at present the only drug available for widespread compassionate use in the United States.
      Although most patients respond to treatment with DHPG, the medication does not cure the
      infection. Most patients will have a relapse and will require retreatment with DHPG. Because
      of the large relapse rate, most people treated for CMV retinitis are placed on continuous
      treatment with DHPG. There are two major problems associated with ongoing use of DHPG: 1) The
      development of a low white blood cell (WBC) count (leukopenia) which is a known side effect
      of the drug; and 2) the increased risk for leukopenia when DHPG is given together with AZT,
      the only antiviral drug currently available for the treatment of HIV infection. Therefore,
      patients cannot take both AZT and DHPG at the same time because the bone marrow toxicity is
      made much more severe when the drugs are given together. This has resulted in the difficult
      decision as to whether to forgo potential life-extending therapy with AZT in order to
      preserve sight. An effective treatment for CMV retinitis is needed that will allow the
      patient to also take AZT. ACV is presently the drug of choice for severe herpes virus
      infections. It has been shown to be effective in suppressing severe CMV disease in patients
      who have received bone marrow transplants.

      who have received bone marrow transplants.

      Patients receive ACV intravenously and AZT orally for 12 weeks. Tolerance of the combined
      administration of ACV and AZT is monitored. AMENDED: AZT dose lowered and inclusion of
      concurrent medication expanded.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Prior Medication:

        Required:

          -  Patients must have successfully completed remission induction therapy with ganciclovir
             (minimum of 14 days of therapy) for acute cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis within the
             preceding 48 hours. Patients who show no evidence of progressive disease are
             considered to have met criteria for successful induction.

        Amended to allow:

          -  Investigational triazoles.

          -  Human recombinant erythropoietin (Eprex).

          -  Other investigational non-antiviral therapies offered through treatment IND.

        Patients must:

          -  Have HIV infection as determined by a commercially licensed ELISA test confirmed by a
             licensed Western blot

          -  Have salvageable vision (corrected acuity of 20/100 or better) in at least one eye.
