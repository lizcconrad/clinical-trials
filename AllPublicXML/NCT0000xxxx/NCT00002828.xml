      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of raltitrexed and fluorouracil in treating
      patients who have colorectal cancer that is metastatic, recurrent, or cannot be surgically
      removed.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of raltitrexed when administered with
      fluorouracil in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma. II. Determine the toxicity and
      safety of this regimen in these patients. III. Assess, in a preliminary manner, the antitumor
      activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of raltitrexed. Patients receive raltitrexed IV over
      15 minutes followed 24 hours later by fluorouracil IV. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of raltitrexed until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD
      is defined as the dose immediately preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 6-10 patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are
      followed for 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-20
      months.
