      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of pyrazoloacridine in treating patients
      who have metastatic skin or eye melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the antitumor activity of pyrazoloacridine (PZA) in chemotherapy naive patients
           with metastatic cutaneous or ocular melanoma.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of PZA in this patient population.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of PZA in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified into cutaneous or ocular melanoma treatment groups.

      Patients receive pyrazoloacridine IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 28-70 patients will be accrued for this study.
