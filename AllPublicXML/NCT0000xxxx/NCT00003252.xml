      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Chemoprotective drugs, such as amifostine, may protect normal cells
      from the side effects of chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase IV trial to study the effectiveness of amifostine in treating patients with
      cancer who have neurological changes caused by chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility and tolerability of administering amifostine by
      intravenous infusion over 5 minutes in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, controlled study. Patients receive intravenous amifostine
      over 5 minutes 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. Patients are followed for one month post
      treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
