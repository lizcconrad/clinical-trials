      To compare the time to progression of CMV retinitis between oral ganciclovir and IV
      ganciclovir during 20 weeks of maintenance treatment. To compare the safety and tolerance of
      oral ganciclovir with IV ganciclovir therapy during 20 weeks of maintenance treatment. To
      describe the safety and tolerance of oral ganciclovir treatment when given concurrently with
      anti-retroviral treatment, e.g. zidovudine or ddI. To describe the survival of people with
      AIDS and CMV retinitis.

      Approximately 150 subjects with AIDS and newly diagnosed CMV retinitis will be enrolled in
      the study to achieve 120 randomized subjects. Eligible subjects will have CMV retinitis which
      has been diagnosed within one month of study entry by an ophthalmologist using indirect
      ophthalmoscopy. Subjects will be accrued by recruitment or referral. Anyone who volunteers
      for the study, meets the eligibility criteria, and signs an informed consent will be eligible
      for entry.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must have the following:

          -  Confirmation of HIV infection by HIV-antibody testing, p24 antigen assay, or culture
             of HIV, or have diagnosis of AIDS by CDC criteria.

          -  CMV retinitis diagnosed within one month of study entry.

          -  Understand the nature of the study, agree to its provisions, and sign the informed
             consent approved by the appropriate institutional review board and Syntex.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        The following are excluded:

          -  Antimetabolites. Alkylating agents. Selected nucleoside analogs. Selected Cytokines.

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Persistent diarrhea, nausea, or abdominal pain or other clinically significant GI
             symptoms or uncontrolled gastrointestinal disease. Diarrhea is defined as 3 or more
             unformed stools per day.

          -  Have ocular media opacities (corneal, lenticular, or vitreal) preventing
             ophthalmologic retinal assessment and photography.

          -  Have ocular conditions requiring immediate surgical correction (e.g. retinal tear or
             detachment).

          -  Require continuation of concomitant medications precluded by this protocol, e.g.,
             antimetabolites, alkylating agents, selected nucleoside analogs, and selected
             cytokines and other medications listed in the protocol.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to acyclovir or ganciclovir.

          -  Dementia, decreased mentation or other encephalopathic signs and symptoms which would
             interfere with the ability of the subject to give informed consent or comply with the
             protocol.

        Prior Medication:

        The following are excluded:

        - Previous use of anti-cytomegalovirus drug (e.g., ganciclovir, foscarnet, FIAC, or CMV
        hyperimmune globulin) within one month of study entry.
