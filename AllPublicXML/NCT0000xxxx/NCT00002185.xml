      This is an open-label, randomized, pilot, Phase II study of the safety and efficacy of
      Viracept in combination with modified antiretroviral therapy as treatment in patients with
      cutaneous and mucosal KS. Patients will be randomized to modify (add or switch or initiate)
      their current antiretroviral therapy and will add Viracept or remain on their current
      background antiretroviral therapy for a 2 month period. Initially 20 patients will be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio (i.e., 14 Viracept, 6 control) for a 2 month period. Response to
      therapy will be evaluated at the end of the 2 month control phase. At this point, patients
      who were initially assigned to the control arm will continue on open label Viracept for an
      additional 10 month period.

             recovered from the effects of these therapies.

          -  Unstable or severe intercurrent medical conditions, including but not limited to,
             significant symptomatic visceral KS.

          -  Clinically significant malabsorption syndrome.

        1. Immediate topical or systemic treatment for KS lesions.

          -  Use of Retinoid class drugs, either topically or systemically, or beta-carotene
             compounds or Vitamin A doses of more than 15,000 IU (5,000 mcg) per day concurrently.

        Immediate radiation treatment.

        1. Treatment of KS lesions with intra-lesional chemotherapy within 4 weeks of entry.
