  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at whether emtricitabine is as safe and effective as abacavir (ABC) when
      taken with stavudine (d4T) and efavirenz (EFV) in patients who have never taken anti-HIV
      drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive open-label emtricitabine or ABC in combination with
      stavudine and efavirenz. Viral load and CD4+ cell counts are compared at Weeks 24 and 48.
      Patients are followed for 48 weeks.
