      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define the phenotype and genotype of previously unrecognized types of familial diabetes
      insipidus (FDI) in kindreds with atypical or novel forms of FDI.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Participants undergo a series of tests to determine the presence, absence,
      cause, natural history, clinical status, and mode of inheritance of their type of diabetes
      insipidus (DI). The studies include measurements of basal fluid intake and urine output,
      plasma vasopressin during standard fluid deprivation or waterload/saline infusion tests, and
      changes in water balance during a therapeutic trial of DDAVP. If clinically indicated,
      echocardiograms and assays of plasma catecholes and renin are also completed.

      Linkage analysis is performed for all participants; kindreds with the Marfan-like syndrome
      are also studied for the fibrillin-1 genotype.

      Participants determined to have DI are treated with desmopressin for 2 days.
