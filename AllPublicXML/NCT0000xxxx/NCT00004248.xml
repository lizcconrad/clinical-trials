      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill
      liver cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of doxorubicin and interleukin- 2 in
      treating patients who have liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the immunological response to doxorubicin and protracted recombinant
      interleukin-2 in terms of alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma specific cytotoxic T cells
      detectable in peripheral blood in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. II.
      Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population. III. Determine
      the tumor response to this regimen in terms of changes in alpha fetoprotein and tumor size
      measured by CT scan in these patients. IV. Determine the progression free survival and
      overall survival of this patient population treated with this regimen. V. Determine the
      correlation between immunological response, tumor response, progression free survival and
      overall survival in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 3-5 minutes on day 1 and recombinant
      interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV continuously beginning on day 5 and continuing until day 57. Patients
      achieving partial or complete clinical response regardless of immunological response and
      patients with stable disease and an immunological response continue on IL-2 therapy
      continuously until day 92. Patients with stable disease and no immunological response receive
      an additional dose of doxorubicin on day 57 and then continue on IL-2 until day 92. Patients
      who are clinically eligible with progressive disease and an immunological response continue
      IL-2 therapy as above. Patients are followed at 2 weeks and then monthly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-30 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 3 years.
