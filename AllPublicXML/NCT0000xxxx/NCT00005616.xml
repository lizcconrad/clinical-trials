      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating
      patients who have colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine any toxicity associated with increasing single doses of monoclonal
      antibody F19 (BIBH-1) administered by intravenous infusion in patients with colorectal cancer
      scheduled for surgical resection. II. Compare the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and
      imaging characteristics of increasing intravenous doses of iodine I 131 BIBH-1 in this
      patient population. III. Compare the BIBH-1 related human antihuman antibody (HAHA) serum
      concentration with immunologic related clinical effects in these patients. IV. Compare the
      uptake of iodine I 131 BIBH-1 in tumor to the uptake of normal tissue when administered to
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody F19 (BIBH-1)
      combined with iodine I 131 IV over 60 minutes. Patients undergo surgical resection
      approximately 7 days after BIBH-1 infusion. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses
      of BIBH-1 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients
      are followed once during days 5-14 and then at day 30 after surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 months.
