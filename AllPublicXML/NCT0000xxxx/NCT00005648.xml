  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of gemcitabine with or without
      tipifarnib (R115777) in patients who have advanced pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the investigator
      or patient will know the identity of the assigned treatment) to compare the overall survival
      of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer after treatment with gemcitabine with and without
      tipifarnib (referred to as R115777). Gemcitabine is an approved chemotherapy agent
      administered intravenously (iv) (though a vein) for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
      R115777 is an orally (by mouth) administered investigational drug that is being tested in
      combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
      Patients will continue to receive treatment with gemcitabine and R115777 (or placebo) unless
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed. All patients in the study will be
      followed for study assessments and safety for up to the 5 years, the start of further
      treatment, or death (whichever comes first). R115777 (or matching placebo) 200 mg will be
      orally administered at intervals of approximately 12 hours daily throughout the study.
      Gemcitabine will be administered iv at a starting dose of 1000 mg/m2 every week for the first
      7 weeks, followed by 1 week rest, and then every 3 out of 4 weeks thereafter. Treatment with
      gemcitabine and tipifarnib (or placebo) will continue for up to 5 years (or until the start
      of further treatment) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
