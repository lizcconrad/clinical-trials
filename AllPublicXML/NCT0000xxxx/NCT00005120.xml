  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give calanolide A to
      HIV-infected adults who have not used anti-HIV drugs in the past.

    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive (+)-calanolide A or placebo for 21 days. All patients may
      elect to receive an open-label, 3-month course of approved retroviral therapy (up to
      triple-drug therapy) to be selected by, and administered under the care of, the patients'
      physicians. If the patient has no insurance coverage or does not wish to utilize his/her
      insurance for anti-HIV medications, Sarawak MediChem Pharmaceuticals will provide these
      medications at no charge for up to 3 months.
