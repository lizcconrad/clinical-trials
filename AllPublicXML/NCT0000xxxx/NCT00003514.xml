      RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the
      laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antineoplaston therapy works in treating
      patients with neuroendocrine tumor that is metastatic or unlikely to respond to surgery or
      radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Provide treatment with antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 for patients with metastatic or
           incurable neuroendocrine tumors.

        -  Describe response, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 by intravenous
      injection 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.

      Treatment continues for at least 2 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional 8
      months after reaching CR.

      Tumors are measured every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
