  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS) is a genetic disorder (autosomal recessive) caused by an
      abnormality in the production of cholesterol. The disorder can occur in both a &quot;mild&quot; or
      &quot;severe&quot; form. SLOS is associated with multiple birth defects and mental retardation. Some of
      the birth defects include; abnormal facial features, poor muscle tone, poor growth, shortened
      life span, and abnormalities of the heart, lungs, brain, gastrointestinal tract, limbs,
      genitalia, and kidneys.

      There is no known cure for SLOS but recently patients have been treated with increased
      amounts of cholesterol in their diet. The cholesterol in a persons diet is unable to correct
      the abnormalities in the patient's organs, but researchers hope it will improve growth
      failure and mental retardation.

      This study was developed to answer questions about the causes and complications of SLOS, as
      well as the effectiveness of cholesterol treatment. The study will enroll patients diagnosed
      with SLOS, and their mothers. The objectives of the study will be to address the following
      questions:

        1. &lt;TAB&gt; What is the prognosis / natural history of the demyelination in the nervous system
           of patients with SLOS?

        2. &lt;TAB&gt; Do patients with SLOS have other problems concerning the function of their
           endocrine systems?

        3. &lt;TAB&gt;What are the genetic make-ups of patients with SLOS?

        4. &lt;TAB&gt;Can further studies of cholesterol metabolism and genetic testing, using SLOS
           fibroblasts, increase the understanding of SLOS?&lt;TAB&gt;...

    <textblock>
      Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive multiple congenital
      anomaly/mental retardation syndrome. Typical clinical features include a distinctive facial
      appearance, mental retardation, autistic behavior, hypotonia, failure to feed, poor growth,
      decreased life span, and variable structural anomalies of the heart, lungs, brain,
      gastrointestinal tract, limbs, genitalia and kidneys. The SLOS phenotypic spectrum is broad
      and variable. At the severe end of the spectrum SLOS is a lethal disorder with multiple major
      congenital anomalies; whereas, mild cases of SLOS present with a combination of minor
      physical stigmata, behavioral problems, and learning disabilities. SLOS is due to an inborn
      error of cholesterol biosynthesis. Biochemically, SLOS patients have a deficiency of
      3beta-hydroxysterol delta(7)-reductase activity. 3beta-hydroxysterol delta(7)-reductase is an
      NADPH dependent microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of the C7(8) double bond of
      7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) to yield cholesterol in the last step of cholesterol
      biosynthesis via the Kandutsch-Russel pathway. This inborn error of cholesterol biosynthesis
      results in elevated tissue and serum 7-DHC levels and typically decreased serum and tissue
      cholesterol levels. In 1998 we established that the deficiency in 3beta-hydroxysterol
      delta(7)-reductase activity is due to mutation of the 3beta-hydroxysterol delta(7)-reductase
      gene (DHCR7). Once the biochemical defect in SLOS was identified, dietary cholesterol
      supplementation was proposed and employed as a therapeutic approach. Although developmental
      malformations remain fixed, dietary cholesterol supplementation appears to improve the
      overall health of these patients, and initial results have shown that dietary cholesterol
      supplementation has had a positive impact on some of the behavioral manifestations of this
      disorder. Although our understanding of this disorder has advanced over the last few years,
      many questions remain concerning the effectiveness of cholesterol replacement therapy, the
      long term prognosis for individuals on dietary cholesterol supplementation, and the need for
      adjunctive measures in the clinical management of SLOS patients. We propose to answer some of
      these questions by continuing our longitudinal natural history/prognosis study on patients
      with SLOS. We also plan on studying very closely related disorders such as lathosterolosis
      under this protocol. Lathosterolosis is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme sterol
      3-beta-hydroxysteroid-delta-5-desaturase which is necessary for the conversion of lathosterol
      into 7-DHC. The clinical picture is very similar to SLOS with prominent features including
      microcephaly, ptosis bilateral 2,3 toe syndactyly. Lathosterolosis is also inherited in an
      autosomal recessive manner. Lethosterolosis is extremely rare with only 4 cases described in
      the literature so far and an estimated incidence of less than 1 in a million. The below
      objectives, protocol evaluations, risks, benefits and other pertinent issues apply to SLOS
      and lathosterolosis even if lathosterolosis is not explicitly named.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Any patient with biochemically confirmed SLOS will be accepted into this study.
             Patients of any age, either gender, or any ethnicity will be accepted into this study.
             No exclusions will be made based on race or gender. Historically, more males than
             females have been diagnosed as having SLOS. This bias was likely a result of the fact
             that genital hypoplasia is readily apparent in a male, and therefore the clinical
             diagnosis is easier to make in a male patient. SLOS syndrome appears more commonly in
             individuals of Northern European ancestry. Out of 150 biochemically proven cases, only
             one was an African American and no patients of Asian descent were reported. One SLOS
             mutant allele (R404C) appears to be present in individuals of French Canadian and
             Creole heritage. This likely represents a founder effect. One puzzling finding is that
             the carrier rate of the most common SLOS mutant allele in Black Canadians from Ontario
             and African Americans from Pennsylvania appears to be approximately 0.7%. However,
             clinical cases appear to be rare. The predominance of Caucasians reported in the
             literature may represent a bias of ascertainment of the disorder, variable
             presentation in different ethnic groups, or a founder effect in some ethnic groups.
             Because we function as a referral center with respect to recruitment, the ethnic
             background of our population is likely going to reflect the overall population of
             diagnosed cases.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients will be excluded if they cannot travel to the NIH because of their medical
             condition.

          -  Pregnant women will be excluded, and a negative urine pregnancy test will be required
             of menstruating women.
