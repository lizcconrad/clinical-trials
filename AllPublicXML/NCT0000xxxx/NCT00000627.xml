  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the use of fluconazole as (1) induction therapy in histoplasmosis, (2)
      maintenance therapy to prevent relapse of histoplasmosis.

      Histoplasmosis is a serious opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. Fluconazole is a
      triazole antifungal agent that has been used successfully in the treatment of experimental
      histoplasmosis in animals, but has not been completely evaluated in patients for this use. It
      has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for certain other fungal infections.
      Nevertheless, physicians are prescribing it to their patients with histoplasmosis. This is a
      pilot study to examine the role of fluconazole for treating histoplasmosis in AIDS patients.

      Histoplasmosis is a serious opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. Fluconazole is a
      triazole antifungal agent that has been used successfully in the treatment of experimental
      histoplasmosis in animals, but has not been completely evaluated in patients for this use. It
      has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for certain other fungal infections.
      Nevertheless, physicians are prescribing it to their patients with histoplasmosis. This is a
      pilot study to examine the role of fluconazole for treating histoplasmosis in AIDS patients.

      At least 40 patients with AIDS and an initial episode of disseminated histoplasmosis are
      selected for the study. Patients receive fluconazole for a total of 12 weeks. Patients who
      are unable to take the drug orally may receive it intravenously until oral administration is
      possible. Patients are evaluated at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. Patients who are doing well
      without evidence of clinical failure or dose-limiting toxicity are permitted to continue
      maintenance therapy to prevent relapse at a reduced dose for an additional 12 months; those
      who relapse on the reduced dose are permitted to receive re-induction with a higher dose.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Corticosteroids for up to 21 days at doses no greater than 20 mg/day prednisone

             sulfonamides, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, pentamidine for Pneumocystis carinii
             pneumonia (PCP) or PCP prophylaxis, topical antifungals, pyrimethamine, ganciclovir.

          -  Didanosine (ddI), dideoxycytidine (ddC), foscarnet, or other investigational drugs
             considered to be essential for patient management.

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Allowed:

          -  Transfusion.

        Patients must have the following:

          -  HIV infection.

          -  Histoplasmosis.

          -  Appropriate consent must be obtained from a parent or legal guardian for patients less
             than 18 years of age.

        Allowed:

          -  Hematologic and/or renal laboratory abnormalities.

          -  Concurrent malignancies.

          -  Concurrent infection with Mycobacteria.

          -  Patients with severe manifestations of histoplasmosis who are thought to be at risk of
             dying within one week should receive up to 250 mg amphotericin B for up to seven days
             prior to enrollment and then be re-evaluated. Patients who are still severely ill and
             do not meet eligibility criteria may not enter the study.

        Specific criteria defining life-threatening histoplasmosis include:

          -  Systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg without other cause; arterial pO2 &lt; 60 torr without
             other cause; and SGOT &gt; 10 x upper limit of normal or bilirubin &gt; 3 x upper limit of
             normal. Any other cases not meeting this definition must be reviewed with the protocol
             chair.

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Amphotericin B (up to 250 mg) over 7 days in patients with severe histoplasmosis.
