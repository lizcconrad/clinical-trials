  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to work in cooperation with another study being conducted by
      the National Cancer Institute. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is studying the effects of
      a drug called raloxifene on premenopausal women believed to have a high risk of developing
      breast cancer (98-C-0123).

      In this study, researchers are interested in learning about the effects of raloxifene on the
      uterus and ovaries of the women participating in the NCI study. To do this researchers plan
      to conduct ultrasounds on the patients enrolled in the NCI study. In addition researchers
      plan to take samples of the lining of the uterus in these patients (endometrial biopsy) if
      found to be necessary.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the reproductive effects of raloxifene on women who
      have normal functioning ovaries by taking ultrasounds of the ovaries and lining of the uterus
      (endometrium).

    <textblock>
      Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor-modulating agent that has been recently approved
      by the FDA for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal patients. A phase II trial
      evaluating the safety and efficacy of raloxifene in premenopausal patients at high risk for
      developing breast cancer has been recently approved by the IRB (98-C-0123). In this protocol,
      for assessment of the effects of raloxifene on the endometrium and ovaries, patients are
      scheduled to be studied with transvaginal sonography and hysterosonography, once during their
      menstrual cycle at periodic intervals. They are also scheduled to have endometrial biopsies
      as indicated. It is known that all SERMs (clomiphene, tamoxifen and in one small study
      raloxifene) raise the area under the curve of estradiol levels throughout the cycle in
      premenopausal women. Our study is designed to study the reproductive effects of raloxifene in
      these young women with competent ovaries using sonography of the ovaries and endometrium, and
      correlating it with steroid hormone levels which would be obtained under protocol 98-C-0123.
