  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To obtain preliminary evidence of antiretroviral activity of 1592U89 when administered in
      combination with other specific NRTI agents in NRTI experienced patients and to assess the
      safety and tolerance of multiple oral doses of 1592U89 when administered in combination with
      specific marketed NRTIs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will all receive oral doses of 1592U89 in combination with protocol specific current
      antiretroviral therapy. The treatment groups will be assigned based on each subject's
      previous NRTI experience.

      The study medication is self administered and all evaluations will be performed on an
      outpatient basis. Patients will be seen at day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 12, 16, 20 and 24.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must have:

          -  CD4+ cell count &gt;= 100 /mm3.

          -  Plasma HIV RNA &gt;= 30,000 copies/ml.

          -  Study participants may be recruited from all clinical categories, provided they do not
             meet any of the exclusion criteria.

          -  Parent or legal guardian to sign written, informed consent for patients under the age

             NOTE:

          -  For this study, a CD4+ cell count &lt;= 200 cells/mm3 in the absence of any other AIDS
             defining indicator condition is not considered an AIDS defining event.

          -  Malabsorption syndrome or other gastrointestinal dysfunction that might interfere with
             drug absorption.

          -  Patients with life threatening infection or other serious medical conditions whose
             participation may compromise patient safety.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents within the 24 weeks of the study.

          -  Patients receiving other investigational drugs.

          -  Foscarnet therapy or therapy with other agents with documented activity against HIV in
             vitro.

          -  Treatment with immunomodulators.

          -  Patients on methadone.

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Excluded:

          -  Treatment with radiation therapy within the 24 weeks of the study. NOTE:

        Excluded:

          -  Treatment with any antiretroviral therapy with NRTIs (alone or in combination) other
             than those defined for each treatment group.

          -  Treatment with any non-nucleoside RT inhibitors or protease inhibitors.

          -  Treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents within 1 month prior to study entry.

          -  Investigational HIV vaccine within the past 3 months.

          -  Immunomodulating agents such as systematic corticosteroids, interleukins, thalidomide,
             anticytokine agents, anti-oxidants or interferons within 1 month of study entry.

        Prior Treatment:

        Excluded:

          -  Treatment with radiation therapy within 1 month of entry.

        Risk Behavior:

        Excluded:
