      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of pyrazoloacridine in treating patients
      who have unresectable primary or metastatic kidney cancer that has not been previously
      treated.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, duration, and survival in previously untreated
      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with pyrazoloacridine (PZA). II. Determine the
      nature, degree, and duration of toxic effects of PZA in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pyrazoloacridine IV over 3 hours every 3 weeks. The minimum
      treatment period is 2 courses with tumor restaging at 6 weeks. Patients with complete
      remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) may continue on treatment until refractory (PR) or
      for at least 3 additional courses (CR). Patients with stable disease continue on therapy for
      at least 2 more courses. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months.
