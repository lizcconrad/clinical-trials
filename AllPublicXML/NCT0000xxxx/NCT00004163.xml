      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can locate tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of trastuzumab in treating patients who
      have advanced salivary gland cancer.

    <textblock>
      Due to the age of this study upon transfer from the NCI to DFCI, data was not accessible to
      find the exact primary completion date (PCD) or study completion date (SCD). The September
      2001 date used for both is based on known enrollment dates and an estimate on median time to
      progression (TTP) in the setting of this clinical trial. Since participants were treated
      indefinitely until progression, TTP is deemed to reflect generally the time on treatment for
      evaluation of the primary response outcome. Furthermore, patients were followed for
      progression to estimate TTP, a secondary outcome measure.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate to trastuzumab in patients with advanced or
      metastatic salivary gland cancer. II. Determine the time to progression in these patients
      after this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of trastuzumab in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to histology: intercalated duct (adenoid cystic
      carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma, malignant mixed tumor, polymorphous low grade
      adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, adenocarcinoma) vs excretory duct (squamous cell
      carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Histologic diagnosis of any of the following malignancies originating from salivary
             tissue: adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma,
             malignant mixed tumor, polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated
             carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma.

          -  Her2/neu determination: Patients must have overexpression of the Her2/neu protein in
             the tumor documented by the Dako polyclonal rabbit anti-Her2 antisera assay.

        Overexpression may be documented by staining of the original paraffin embedded tumor from
        the time of diagnosis or from material obtained at the time of locoregional or distant
        recurrence.

        Overexpression of HER2/neu will be per the Dako Herceptest guidelines. A Score of 2+ or 3+
        will be defined as overexpression. All slides will be reviewed by members of the
        departments of pathology at either the Brigham and Women's Hospital or the Beth Israel
        Hospital in Boston.

          -  Patients must be incurable on the basis of unresectable local or distant disease as
             determined by the patient's surgeon.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 to 1.

          -  Patients must have at least uni-dimensionally measurable disease documented within one
             month of initiation of treatment. Measurement may be by physical exam or
             radiologically. Attempts should be made to photo document all tumor sites assessed by
             physical examination with a metric ruler within the photo for measurement
             confirmation.

          -  Patients must be willing and able to go through the process of informed consent.

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy exceeding 3 months.

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years old.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function as defined by the following tests to be
             performed within 14 days of therapy initiation:

               -  Platelet count &gt; 99,999 cells x 106/L

               -  Hemoglobin &gt;8.5 gm/di or HCT &gt; 25%
