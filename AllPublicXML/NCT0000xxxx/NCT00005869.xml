      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. It is not yet known whether nitrocamptothecin is more effective
      than gemcitabine for pancreatic cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin with
      gemcitabine in treating patients who have unresectable locally advanced or metastatic
      pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the overall survival, time to treatment failure, clinical benefit
      response rate (analgesic consumption, pain intensity, performance status, and weight change),
      and objective response rate in chemotherapy-naive patients with unresectable locally advanced
      or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with oral nitrocamptothecin vs
      gemcitabine. II. Compare the toxicity of these 2 regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to measurable disease (yes vs no), Karnofsky performance status (50-70% vs
      70-100%), and prior radiotherapy. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I:
      Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every week for 8
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable
      or responding disease after week 8 may receive additional courses. Arm II: Patients receive
      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every week for 7 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo 1 week of
      rest. Patients with stable or responding disease after week 8 may receive gemcitabine IV over
      30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks. Pain is assessed within 7 days
      prior to study, at days 28 and 56 during study, and then every 28 days after completion of
      study. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year or until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 994 patients (497 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 22 months.
