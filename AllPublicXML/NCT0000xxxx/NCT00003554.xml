      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of the monoclonal antibody rituximab in
      treating patients with multiple myeloma that is newly diagnosed.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the role of rituximab in inducing apoptosis of malignant plasma cells
      in patients with multiple myeloma. II. Evaluate the role of this regimen in improving the
      response rate to melphalan and prednisone in these patients. III. Determine whether the
      regimen decreases residual disease in these patients. IV. Evaluate the toxic effects of this
      regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab IV every week for 4 weeks. Treatment is repeated every 6
      months for six courses. Treatment may be discontinued after four courses if uncontrolled
      infection occurs. Patients also receive oral melphalan and prednisone for 4 days which begin
      after the first course of rituximab. Treatment is repeated every 4-6 weeks for at least nine
      courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-24
      months.
