  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dosage escalation study to estimate the maximum tolerated dose of drug resistance
      inhibitor PSC 833 given in combination with paclitaxel. Groups of 3 to 6 patients receive
      continuous-infusion paclitaxel for 5 days and oral PSC 833 for 6-7 days, following paclitaxel
      on the first course, then beginning 3 days prior to paclitaxel on subsequent courses.

      Stable and responding patients are re-treated every 21 days, with paclitaxel dose adjusted to
      maintain an absolute neutrophil count less than 500 for no more than 4 days.

    <textblock>
      The clinical study entitled &quot;A Phase I Study of Infusional Paclitaxel with the P-glycoprotein
      Antagonist PSC 833&quot; seeks to determine the maximum tolerated dose for the proposed
      P-glycoprotein antagonist, PSC 833, in combination with paclitaxel. PSC 833 is a cyclosporine
      analogue which is purportedly non-nephrotoxic and non-immunosuppressive. It has been shown in
      in vitro studies to enhance chemosensitivity as well as cyclosporine and to be far better at
      increasing intracellular drug accumulation than the concentrations of verapamil which are
      clinically achievable. The purpose of this study is to define the maximum tolerated dose in
      combination with paclitaxel, and to determine how the drug affects the pharmacokinetics of
      paclitaxel. PSC 833 will most likely reduce the clearance of paclitaxel as reported for the
      parent compound, cyclosporine. This effect will increase the area under the curve (AUC) of
      paclitaxel, may increase toxicity, and requires that the escalation scheme for PSC 833 be a
      conservative one. The first cycle of paclitaxel will be given in the absence of PSC 833.
      Subsequently, 7 days of PSC 833 will be given alone to allow monitoring of pharmacokinetics
      and adverse effects of PSC 833 alone. In the second cycle, both agents will be combined.
      Escalation of the PSC 833 will continue until a target concentration is reached, or until the
      maximum tolerated dose is reached. Clinical responses will be monitored in order to provide
      the best possible medical care to our patients.
