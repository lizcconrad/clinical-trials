  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When patients receive repeated blood transfusions the level of iron in the patient s blood
      can rise. When iron is processed in the body a protein known as hemosiderin can begin
      collecting in the organs. If too much hemosiderin collects in the organs they can begin to
      malfunction. This condition is called transfusional hemochromatosis.

      An organ of particular importance in transfusional hemochromatosis is the heart. Patients
      born with diseases requiring blood transfusions at birth begin to develop heart problems in
      their teens. These patients typically only live for 17 years. Adults that require
      transfusions can begin experiencing heart problems after 100-200 units of backed red blood
      cells.

      Deferoxamine (Desferal) is a drug that binds to iron and allows it to be excreted from the
      body. It is the only effective way to remove iron from patients who have been overloaded with
      iron because of multiple transfusions. Previous studies have lead researchers to believe that
      deferoxamine, when given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous), can be delay or
      prevent heart complications.

      Researchers plan to continue studying patients receiving deferoxamine as treatment for the
      prevention of heart complications associated with repeated blood transfusions. In this study
      researchers will attempt;

        1. To determine if deferoxamine, given regularly, can indefinitely prevent the heart,
           liver, and endocrine complications associated with transfusional hemochromatosis

        2. To determine whether heart disease caused by transfusional hemochromatosis can be
           reversed by intensive treatment with deferoxamine....

      The purposes of this protocol are two-fold: 1) to determine whether deferoxamine, given
      subcutaneously on a regular basis, can indefinitely prevent the cardiac, endocrine and
      hepatic complications of transfusional hemochromatosis; and 2) to determine whether cardiac
      disease can be reversed by intensive intravenous treatment in patients who already have
      objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction. The clinical manifestations and course of patients
      who require regular blood transfusions is well established. Those with congenital anemias who
      require transfusions from birth develop cardiac disease in their teens and their mean of
      survival is only 17 years. Adults with acquired anemias begin to exhibit cardiac
      manifestations of iron deposition after 100-200 units of packed red cells. Deferoxamine, when
      given by the subcutaneous route, has been shown to reduce substantially the total iron burden
      in thalassemic patients. Our results indicate that cardiac complications are delayed or
      prevented. We plan to continue to follow our cohort of patients on optimal medical management
      to determine if chelation alters disease outcome. Patients with heavy iron burdens who
      already manifest cardiac disease will be chelated intensely to determine whether reducing the
      iron burden is associated with reversal of cardiac complications.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Patients studied under this protocol will be at risk for or have evidence of significant
        excess tissue iron.

        Most patients will be on regular blood transfusion secondary to either congenital or
        acquired anemia.

        The majority of patients have homozygous beta thalassemia.

        Patients with sickle cell anemia will be included only when there is an absolute indication
        for regular blood transfusions (e.g., a history of stroke).

        Twenty to thirty adults with acquired anemia and good long-term prognosis will be accepted
        for study if chelation can be initiated early in their transfusion history (less than 30-50
        units).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Such patients will be excluded from study if they have diabetes or cardiac disease due to
        another cause (coronary artery or valvular heart disease).
