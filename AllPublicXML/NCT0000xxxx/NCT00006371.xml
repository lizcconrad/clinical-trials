      RATIONALE: Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs such as
      aminoglutethimide or ketoconazole may stop the adrenal glands from producing hormones.
      Combining hydrocortisone with either aminoglutethimide or ketoconazole may be an effective
      treatment for prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining hydrocortisone with either
      aminoglutethimide or ketoconazole in treating patients who have localized stage IV prostate
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) response proportion and duration
      of response of patients with localized stage IV (D0.5) adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated
      with early medical adrenalectomy using hydrocortisone combined with aminoglutethimide or
      ketoconazole after prior antiandrogen withdrawal. II. Compare the incidence of grades 3-4
      toxicities of these regimens in these patients. III. Correlate adrenal androgen suppression
      with response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior antiandrogen therapy (yes vs no).
      Patients with prior antiandrogen therapy begin study therapy after appropriate antiandrogen
      withdrawal, while those without such prior therapy begin study therapy immediately. Patients
      undergo medical adrenalectomy using hydrocortisone combined with aminoglutethimide OR
      ketoconazole. Oral hydrocortisone is administered twice daily. Oral aminoglutethimide is
      administered twice daily for 1 week and then 4 times daily during subsequent weeks. Oral
      ketoconazole is administered three times daily. Combination treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
