      RATIONALE: Tamoxifen may be able to increase bone density and decrease cholesterol in women
      who are undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of tamoxifen in preventing bone loss and
      heart disease caused by chemotherapy treatment in premenopausal women who have stage I or
      stage II breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the bone density in the femoral neck and lumbar spine and cholesterol levels in
           premenopausal women with stage I or II breast cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy
           with or without tamoxifen.

        -  Collect information regarding breast cancer risk factors, treatment, pathology, diet,
           activity levels, weight, and smoking in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of treatment (adjuvant chemotherapy plus
      tamoxifen vs adjuvant chemotherapy alone).

      Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy with or without oral tamoxifen at the discretion of
      the treating physician.

      Prior to starting chemotherapy, patients undergo blood draw to measure baseline levels of
      follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins, and
      low-density lipoproteins. Patients undergo baseline bone densitometry of the femoral neck and
      lumbar spine to assess bone density prior to starting chemotherapy or within 30 days of the
      first drug treatment. Laboratory studies and bone densitometry are repeated at years 1 and 2.
      A comparison is made between the study findings at baseline and at years 1 and 2.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
