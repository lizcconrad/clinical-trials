      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of micellar paclitaxel for treating
      severe psoriasis. Paclitaxel in another formulation (Taxol) is approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration for use in patients with cancer. This drug can decrease growth of cancer cells
      and of new blood vessels. Because patients with psoriasis have an increase in skin cell and
      blood vessel growth, paclitaxel may also improve their condition. The dose of drug used in
      this study is much lower than those used to treat cancer patients and is expected to cause
      relatively few side effects.

      Patients 18 to 70 years of age with psoriasis lesions affecting at least 20% of their skin
      may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a history and physical
      examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, and possibly an exercise stress test.

      Participants will receive six intravenous (through a vein) infusions of paclitaxel over a
      6-month period. Each infusion will take about 2 hours. Patients will stay in the clinic for
      observation for at least 1 hour before going home and will return to the clinic for follow-up
      examination and tests one week after each infusion. However, on weeks 0 and 8 visit will last
      for approximately 8 hours and will require a return to the clinic the following morning.
      Blood collection will be performed during the week 0 and 8 visits to determine how fast
      Micellar Paclitaxel is eliminated from your body. Approximately 2 teaspoons of blood will be
      taken prior to the infusion, twice during the infusion, and eight times during the 22 hours
      following the infusion for a total of eleven samples. These return visits will last
      approximately 1-2 hours. Patients will have the following procedures:

        1. A skin biopsy (removal of a small tissue sample for microscopic examination) will be
           done at the first visit (week 0) and again at weeks 6, 14 and 22. The area of the biopsy
           will be numbed with an anesthetic, and a small circle of skin about the width of a
           pencil eraser and half as deep will be cut and lifted away. Stitches will be placed and
           removed 1 to 2 weeks later.

        2. A history and physical examination will be done at every visit. Patients will be
           interviewed about changes in their skin condition and about treatment side effects and
           will be examined by a nurse or physician.

        3. Blood and urine samples will be collected at frequent intervals (nearly every visit) to
           test for side effects.

        4. Photographs of the skin will be taken at the first visit and at several later visits to
           document changes in psoriasis.

        5. A blood sample will be drawn for genetic testing to look for gene changes in people with
           psoriasis.

        6. An electrocardiogram will be taken at the last visit. This will be done at week 24 and
           compared to the screening EKG.

        7. Gonadal toxicity monitoring will be started with all patients entered into the protocol
           as of May 2001. Blood will be drawn to measure Inhibit A for females and Inhibit B for
           males at weeks 0, 6, 14, and 22.

      Paclitaxel is an antiangiogenic chemotherapeutic drug approved by the FDA for use in cancer.
      There is anecdotal evidence that some patients with cancer and concomitant psoriasis have
      shown improvement in their skin while receiving paclitaxel for cancer. Angiotech
      Pharmaceutical, Inc., the company with commercial rights over non-cancer uses of paclitaxel,
      has data that suggests paclitaxel demonstrates anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory
      properties, in addition to the better known antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects
      attributed to this compound. In this pilot open-label single-dose study, we initially treated
      patients with severe refractory psoriasis using intravenous Micellar Paclitaxel (75 mg/m(2)
      every 4 weeks) for six months. Because this dosing regimen was well tolerated and because the
      dosing interval seemed too long, we now propose to treat patients with intravenous Micellar
      Paclitaxel at the adjusted dose of 37.5 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks.
