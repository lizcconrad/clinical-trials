  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine, in HIV-infected patients, the magnitude and duration of the biological effects
      of ditiocarb sodium (sodium diethyldithiocarbamate; DTC) that may be relevant to treatment of
      HIV infection.

      DTC has been studied in previous clinical trials in HIV-infected patients with the suggestion
      of delay in disease progression to AIDS and improvement in CD4 counts while on the drug.

      DTC has been studied in previous clinical trials in HIV-infected patients with the suggestion
      of delay in disease progression to AIDS and improvement in CD4 counts while on the drug.

      Two groups of patients, one group asymptomatic and the other with AIDS diagnosis, are
      enrolled in the study. All patients receive DTC intravenously once a week for two weeks.
      Drugs are given on days 1 and 8. Blood samples are drawn on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12.
