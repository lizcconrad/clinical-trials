      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients
      who have relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's disease.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of arsenic trioxide in terms of rate of response
      (complete or partial remission), duration of response, relapse free survival, and overall
      survival in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's disease. II. Evaluate the
      toxicities of this agent in this patient population. III. Elucidate the mechanism of action
      of this treatment by measuring induction of apoptosis and caspace activation when given to
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours
      daily for up to 60 days. After 4-6 weeks of rest, patients receive up to 5 additional courses
      of therapy of 25 days each followed by 4-6 weeks of rest. Patients with a complete response
      (CR) receive 1 additional course of 25 days after achieving CR. Treatment continues in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed monthly for 6
      months, every 2 months for 6 months, every 3 months for 12 months, and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
