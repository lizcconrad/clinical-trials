  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety, tolerance, and potential in vivo antiviral effects of five dosage
      levels and a dose to be determined of human anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) monoclonal antibody
      (SDZ MSL-109; formerly SDZ 89-109) when administered once every 2 weeks for a total of 12
      doses to patients with either AIDS or eligible AIDS-related complex (ARC) and with culture
      proven evidence of CMV viremia and/or viruria. Sandoglobulin will be employed as a
      comparative control.

        Patients must have:

          -  AIDS or be HIV positive with CD4 lymphocyte counts below 200 cells/mm3 and be
             receiving prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) (with or without

             anti-cytomegalovirus therapy except as stipulated in this protocol.

          -  Any other experimental antiviral therapy.

          -  Biologicals including immunoglobulin therapy (except those patients randomized to
             receive Sandoglobulin as specified in this protocol).

        Patients with the following are excluded:
