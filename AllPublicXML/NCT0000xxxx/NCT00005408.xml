      To reanalyze data on risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) including total
      cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol for the subjects in the first,
      second, and third exams of the NHLBI Twin Study.

      BACKGROUND:

      The results of these longitudinal analyses yielded new insights on genetic effects affecting
      CVD risk factors during the aging process.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The analyses utilized maximum likelihood estimators of genetic variance which were
      asymptotically more efficient than the method-of-moments estimators used in previous
      analyses. The models used incorporated terms to partition the variance in a trait from twin
      data into either i) additive genetic variance and unshared environmental variance (the AE
      model), ii) additive genetic variance, dominance genetic variance, and unshared environmental
      variance (the ADE model), or iii) additive genetic variance, shared environmental variance,
      and unshared environmental variance (the ACE model). The AE, ADE, and ACE models were fitted
      separately to data from each of the three exams to obtain a cross-sectional analysis. The
      investigators also extended these models for use with longitudinal data by incorporating
      terms to represent the covariance of variance components from different exams.

      Two important additional objectives of this study were i) to introduce resistant estimation
      techniques in twin modeling, which trimmed the effect of outlier data points smoothly, and
      ii) to carefully study the performance of maximum likelihood and method-of-moments estimators
      when assumptions of the twin model were violated. The results of these parts of the study
      should yield a more complete understanding of the relative merits and limitations of twin
      modeling procedures.
