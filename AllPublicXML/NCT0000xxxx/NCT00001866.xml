      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of a new surgical procedure to correct
      congenital nystagmus-a disorder of eye muscle-vision-brain coordination characterized by
      rapid to and fro eye movements (oscillation). Nystagmus usually begins in infancy or early
      childhood; its effect on vision varies greatly among patients. Current treatments, such as
      prism glasses, acupuncture, electronic nerve stimulation, contact lenses, various drug
      treatments, and others have had limited success.

      Patients with congenital nystagmus sometimes have other eye problems as well, such as
      cataracts, glaucoma, astigmatism or strabismus (cross-eyes). When these patients have eye
      muscle surgery to correct a problem, such as strabismus, their nystagmus also improves.
      Researchers think that simply cutting the muscles might produce this beneficial effect. This
      study will test this hypothesis-the horizontal muscles of the eye will be cut and then
      reattached in the same position. This procedure has been tried in one sheepdog with good
      results.

      This small preliminary trial will include five adult patients with congenital nystagmus who
      have no other treatment options. It will evaluate the safety of the surgery and its effect on
      eye oscillation and vision. If the procedure is found to be safe, additional patients will be
      studied.

      Patients will have a medical history, basic physical examination, complete eye examination,
      and electro-oculography (eye movement recordings) to determine if eligibility for the study.
      Those accepted into the study will undergo eye muscle surgery and followup eye examinations
      and electro-oculography at 1 week, 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years after
      surgery.

      This is a prospective open-label pilot study of a new surgical approach never before
      performed on humans. Subjects of this study are patients with congenital nystagmus and no
      other treatment options. Using standard surgical techniques we will determine if simple
      tenotomy with reattachment will reduce their nystagmus. An oculographic reduction of the
      nystagmus is measured by the Nystagmus Acuity Function (NAF), considered a primary outcome.
      Phase II of the study includes binocular visual acuity as a second primary outcome. A 20%
      improvement in NAF will be considered a clinically significant reduction in nystagmus and a
      10 letter or greater improvement in binocular vision will be considered a clinically
      significant improvement in visual acuity. Secondary oculographic outcomes include breadth or
      creation of null zones, slow phase velocity during foveation, and nystagmus intensity. Other
      secondary outcomes will include visual functions, assessed pre- and post-operatively using
      standard measures of binocular visual acuity (Phase I) and the National Eye Institute-Visual
      Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ) in patients 18 years or older. Extraocular muscle
      proprioception and afferent innervation in control of ocular motor behavior will also be
      examined as secondary outcomes. The study will initially be limited to 5 adults 18 years of
      age and older (Phase I). However, recognizing that there are many visual differences between
      younger and older patients, the study will then be expanded to include children after the
      initial pilot study (Phase II). The NEI DSMC, ICRRC, and IRB will assess adverse events after
      Phase I, and if in their judgment there are no serious safety concerns surrounding the
      procedure, Phase II will be initiated. The initiation of Phase II begins with enrollment of 5
      adults and after review of 1 week post-surgical safety data, 5 patients under the age of 18
      will be enrolled. Patients who have a clinical and oculographic diagnosis of congenital
      nystagmus as determined by a screening exam at NEI and have not had previous extraocular
      muscle surgery and have no other nystagmus treatment options (a gaze null or convergence
      damping) are eligible. They must be able to undergo a complete ophthalmic and ocular-motor
      evaluation and be cooperative for standard eye movement recordings. After informed consent
      and assent, eligible patients will undergo a complete ophthalmic and ocular motor
      examination. They will have their eye movements recorded using a standard oculographic
      recording technique and protocol. In Phase II these recordings will take place three
      preoperative visits at least 2 weeks apart and no more than 4 months prior to surgery. Using
      routine operative techniques for extraocular muscle surgery, the patient will have all four
      horizontal recti tenotomized and reattached at their original insertions. In addition to
      routine post-operative care, complete ocular examinations and eye movement recordings will be
      repeated at 1 week, 6 weeks, 6 months, and12 months after surgery. The patient's subjective
      visual responses (e.g., visual acuity and binocular function) will be compared before and
      after surgery. Objective changes in the eye movement recordings and binocular visual acuity
      post-operatively will be quantified and compared to preoperative values.
