  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To obtain data on the safety of administering megestrol acetate and dronabinol as single
      agents or in combination to patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-wasting
      syndrome. To obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of single agent and combination therapy
      with megestrol acetate and dronabinol with regard to weight gain, appetite increase and
      quality of life in this patient population. To obtain steady-state pharmacokinetics data when
      megestrol acetate and dronabinol are administered as single agents and in combination.

      HIV-wasting syndrome, which is characterized by severely debilitating anorexia and weight
      loss, is of particular concern because it can exacerbate the primary illness and is
      associated with a poor prognosis. Attempts at maintaining body mass through the use of
      megestrol acetate and dronabinol, two anti-cachectic drugs, may prolong survival.

      HIV-wasting syndrome, which is characterized by severely debilitating anorexia and weight
      loss, is of particular concern because it can exacerbate the primary illness and is
      associated with a poor prognosis. Attempts at maintaining body mass through the use of
      megestrol acetate and dronabinol, two anti-cachectic drugs, may prolong survival.

      Fifty-six patients are randomized to one of four treatment arms, as follows: high-dose
      megestrol acetate alone; dronabinol alone; high-dose megestrol acetate combined with
      dronabinol; or low-dose megestrol acetate combined with dronabinol. Treatment continues for
      12 weeks. Patients are evaluated for toxicity, preliminary evidence of response (e.g., weight
      gain), and steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug therapies.
