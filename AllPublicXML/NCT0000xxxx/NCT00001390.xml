  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Saliva is critical in maintaining oral health and comfort. Our laboratory has investigated
      several disorders of salivary glands. The purpose of this protocol is to obtain data from
      healthy volunteers for comparison with data from patients with salivary dysfunction. We plan
      to utilize the NIH Clinical Center Clinical Research Volunteer Program to solicit paid
      participation from healthy adults. Study procedures are accomplished in 2-3 outpatient visits
      that include an interview, saliva collection, lip biopsy, clinical laboratory studies, dry
      eye examination, and lip biopsy follow up, as needed. These are routine diagnostic
      procedures. Biopsy specimens may be used in clinical and laboratory studies, such as in vitro
      biochemical analysis or in vivo transplantation.

      Some of the Healthy Volunteers may be asked to participate in an MRI study of the salivary
      glands.

      -  Objective: To obtain data from healthy volunteers for comparison with data from patients
           with salivary dysfunction.

        -  Study population: Healthy volunteers aged 18-70 years old

        -  Design: Observational

        -  Outcome measures: Clinical and basic science data to serve as controls for comparisons
           with subjects presenting with salivary gland dysfunction

      Saliva is critical in maintaining oral health and comfort. Our laboratory has investigated
      several disorders of salivary glands. The purpose of this protocol is to obtain data from

      Some of the Healthy Volunteers may be asked to participate in an MRI study of the salivary
      glands.

      The outcome measurement for this study is to determine those healthy subjects whose data and
      specimens can be used as control comparison for our patient subjects in our
      Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome studies (15-D-0051, 99-D-0070, 11-D-0094 and/or 11-D-0172).
