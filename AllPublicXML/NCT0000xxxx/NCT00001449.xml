  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical toxicities associated with
      administering sequential dFdC as a one hour infusion followed by a continuous infusion of
      FUdR over 24 hours with low dose oral LV weekly for three weeks out of four.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MTD and biochemically active dose of FUDR as a 24-hour and gemcitabine as a 2-hour
      infusion will be determined first (Part A); if the biochemically active FUDR dose is less
      than the MTD, new patients will be entered to determine the maximum tolerated duration of
      FUDR infusion (Part B).
