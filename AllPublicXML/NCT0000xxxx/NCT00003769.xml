      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it
      can be removed during surgery.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of perillyl alcohol followed by surgery in
      treating patients who have stage II or stage III pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the biologic activity of perillyl alcohol in patients with potentially
      resectable, stage II or stage III pancreatic adenocarcinoma. II. Characterize the acute
      toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Evaluate the antitumor activity of this drug in
      these patients. IV. Monitor and quantitate the plasma levels of perillyl alcohol after oral
      administration in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral perillyl alcohol 4 times daily on days 1-14. Patients undergo
      surgical resection on day 15. There is no continuation of perillyl alcohol postoperatively.
      Patients are followed at a minimum of 2 and 4 months following surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage II or stage III
        pancreatic adenocarcinoma that is considered resectable Lesions should be amenable to
        surgery with curative intent Bidimensionally measurable or evaluable disease No evidence of
        metastatic disease No clinically detectable third space fluid collections (e.g., ascites or
        effusions)

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: Not
        specified Hematopoietic: WBC at least 3,500/mm3 Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3
        Hemoglobin at least 9.5 g/dL Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 4 times upper limit of
        normal (ULN) PTT no greater than 1.5 times control (unless on anticoagulants) Renal:
        Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN Other: Not pregnant or nursing Fertile patients
        must use effective contraception No concurrent serious systemic disorders incompatible with
        study No active infection No second primary malignancy, previously untreated with curative
        intent or presently active, that would preclude curative resection of the pancreas

        chemotherapy for pancreatic carcinoma Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: No
        prior radiotherapy for pancreatic carcinoma Surgery: See Disease Characteristics Other: At
        least 1 month since prior investigational agents At least 72 hours since prior
        anticoagulant therapy, cholesterol-lowering agents (e.g., lovastatin), high dosage
        vitamins, or antioxidants No concurrent anticoagulants except for the sole purpose of
        central line patency maintenance No other concurrent investigational agents
