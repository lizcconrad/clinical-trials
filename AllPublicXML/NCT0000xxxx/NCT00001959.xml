    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of the drug pirfenidone in treating focal segmental
      glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Patients with this disease have kidney fibrosis (scarring) and
      proteinuria (excessive excretion of protein in the urine). About half of patients with FSGS
      eventually require kidney dialysis or transplant. Steroids, which are currently used to treat
      the disease, are effective in only a minority of patients. Other drugs, such as cyclosporin
      and cyclophosphamide, improve proteinuria in a very small percentage of patients and have
      serious side effects.

      Patients with FSGS who wish to participate in this study will undergo pre-study evaluation
      with blood and urine tests. Patients must be on a stable dose of an ACE inhibitor (a drug
      that lowers blood pressure and reduces proteinuria) for at list 6 months before starting
      pirfenidone therapy. (Patients who are not already taking an ACE inhibitor will be started on
      the drug; those who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors will be given a different drug.) Patients
      with elevated cholesterol will take a cholesterol-lowering drug. A diet containing
      approximately 1 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight per day will be recommended.

      Patients will take pirfenidone by mouth 3 times a day for 12 months. Blood and urine will be
      tested once a month, either at NIH or by the patient's local kidney specialist. They will
      collect two 24-hour urine samples at the beginning of the treatment period, at 2-month
      intervals throughout the study, and at a 6-month follow-up. Patients will also be asked to
      give three to five tubes of blood and urine samples for analysis during the study.

      In animal studies, pirfenidone improved kidney function and proteinuria and reduced kidney
      scarring in rats with a disease similar to FSGS. In human studies, pirfenidone improved
      breathing and survival in patients with lung fibrosis.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot phase II trial is to evaluate the ability of pirfenidone, a novel
      anti-fibrotic agent, to reduce the proteinuria and slow the rate of progression of renal
      insufficiency in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). We will enroll 25
      patients with renal biopsy proven FSGS and evidence of impaired renal function (glomerular
      filtration rate, GFR, of 10-80 ml/min; after 1/02 must have GFR greater than 25 ml/min) as
      assessed by the 4 variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. As standard of
      care therapy, all patients will also receive angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)
      therapy, and will receive an HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor drug if hypercholesterolemic.
      Preliminary evaluation will assure that the patients meet the study requirements, and an
      evaluation period will be used to ensure that patients are on maximal conservative therapy
      prior to the baseline period. Patients will receive treatment with pirfenidone daily, with
      dose adjusted for body weight and level of kidney function. The primary end point will be the
      decrease glomerular filtration as a marker of glomerular injury; reduction in proteinuria
      will be a secondary end-point. If the pilot study suggests this drug delays progression of
      renal insufficiency or reduces proteinuria in patients with FSGS, we will proceed with a
      large scale randomized, placebo-controlled study.

    <description>During the study drug period of 12 months, patients will receive oral pirfenidone daily. For patients whose initial renal function is 50-80 ml/min as assessed by the MDRD equation, the initial pirfenidone dosage will be calculated at 40 mg/kg/d, with a maximum dose of 800 mg TID. For patients whose initial renal function is 30-50 ml/min, the initial dose will be 30 mg/kg/d. For patients whose initial renal function is between 15 and 30 ml/min, the initial dose will be 20 mg/kg/d.</description>
