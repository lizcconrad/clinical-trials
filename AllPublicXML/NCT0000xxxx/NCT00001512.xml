  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The idiotype of the immunoglobulin on a given B cell malignancy (Id) can serve as a clonal
      marker, and a previous pilot study in lymphoma patients has demonstrated that autologous Id
      protein can be formulated into an immunogenic, tumor specific antigen by conjugation to a
      carrier protein (KLH) and administration with an emulsion-based adjuvant. The goals of
      vaccine development in the current study are to develop vaccines: 1) with improved potency
      and 2) which are more effective at inducing cell-mediated immune responses. The selection of
      GM-CSF as the immunological &quot;adjuvant&quot; is a direct extension of our laboratory studies in
      small animal models demonstrating that GM-CSF can enhance the potency of the prototype Id-KLH
      vaccine by augmenting almost exclusively the cellular arm of the immune response.

      The objectives of this study are: 1) to evaluate cellular and humoral immune responses
      against the unique idiotype of the patient's lymphoma and 2) to evaluate the ability of the
      Id vaccine to clear the bone marrow of malignant cells detectable by pathologic examination
      or molecular examination (polymerase chain reaction amplification of the rearranged bcl-2
      oncogene).

      The goal of this study is to treat previously untreated patients with follicular lymphomas to
      complete remission or minimal residual disease with ProMACE chemotherapy. Three to six months
      after completion of chemotherapy, in an effort to reduce the relapse rate (by eradicating
      microscopic disease resistant to chemotherapy), patients will receive an autologous Id
      vaccine administered in combination with GM-CSF. Id-KLH (0.5 mg) is administered
      subcutaneously. GM-CSF is administered subcutaneously locally with the vaccine on the day of
      vaccination and for the three consecutive days following vaccination as close to the initial
      vaccination site as possible at one of two doses (patients are randomized to either a high or
      low dose, 500 or 100 micrograms/m2).

      We plan to accrue 42 patients. Twenty-nine patients have been enrolled. Sixteen patients have
      entered and/or completed the vaccination phase. Patients have demonstrated significant
      lymphoproliferative responses specific for autologous idiotype of a magnitude which is
      significantly greater than previously observed.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients must meet all of the following eligibility criteria.

        Tissue diagnosis of: follicular small cleaved cell, or follicular mixed lymphoma with
        surface IgM, IgG or IgA phenotype with a monoclonal heavy and light chain. Pathology slides
        must be submitted to the NIH Pathology Department for review.

        Stage III or IV lymphoma.

        Only previously untreated patients are eligible.

        Previous treatment with radiation alone (less than TBI) is permissible.

        A single peripheral lymph node of at least 2 cm size accessible for biopsy/harvest.

        Karnofsky status greater than or equal to 70 percent.

        Life expectancy of greater than 1 year.

        Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg per dl unless felt to be secondary to

        Gilbert's disease. SGOT/SGPT less than or equal to 3.5 times upper limit of normal.

        Ability to give informed consent. Ability to return to clinic for adequate follow-up for
        the period that the protocol requires.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Prior total body irradiation.

        Presence of antibodies to HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen or other active infectious
        process.

        beta-HCG level will be obtained in women of child-bearing potential.

        treated squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or effectively treated carcinoma in
        situ of the cervix.

        Patients unwilling to give informed consent.
