      This study examined the interactions of various drugs used to treat HIV infection in order to
      design larger studies of possible combinations for people who continue to have high viral
      levels despite combination therapy.

      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older who have a viral load of at least 500
      copies/mL; who have received 20 weeks of protease inhibitor therapy, with the same protease
      inhibitors in combination therapy for the last 12 weeks; and who have never been treated with
      abacavir, amprenavir or efavirenz were enrolled.

      All patients will receive 600 milligrams a day of efavirenz (a non-nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor); 300 mg twice daily of abacavir (a nucleoside analog); and 1200 mg
      twice a day of amprenavir (a protease inhibitor). In addition to these drugs, six patients
      will receive 500 mg twice a day of ritonavir (a protease inhibitor); six patients will
      receive 200 mg twice a day of ritonavir; and 10 will receive 1250 mg twice a day of
      nelfinavir (a protease inhibitor).

      Patients in the two ritonavir groups (500-mg and 200-mg dose groups) took abacavir and
      amprenavir for one week and then come to the clinic for blood tests to measure drug levels
      before taking their morning pills and at 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours after taking the
      medicines. They will then add ritonavir to their treatment regimen. After one week, they will
      return for blood tests as before. They will then add efavirenz to their regimen and had
      bloods drawn again after another 1 or 2 weeks.

      Patients in the nelfinavir group took abacavir, amprenavir and nelfinavir for one week and
      then have blood sampling as described above for the ritonavir group. They will then add
      efavirenz to the regimen and repeat the blood tests again after another 1 or 2 weeks.

      Participants are being seen in the clinic for follow-up only if they wish to continue to
      participate and if the regimen appears to offer clinical benefit.

      In this study of pharmacokinetic interactions, (1) the effect of ritonavir on the
      pharmacokinetics of amprenavir; (2) the effect of efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of
      amprenavir and ritonavir, and (3) the effect of efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of
      amprenavir and nelfinavir were examined. Twenty-two patients who have a viral burden of at
      least 500 copies/mL on combination therapy with a protease inhibitor for at least 20 weeks
      were to be enrolled to receive open-label treatment, 6 with abacavir 300 mg po BID,
      amprenavir 1200 mg po BID, ritonavir 200 mg po BID and efavirenz 600 mg po QD, 6 with
      abacavir 300 mg po BID, amprenavir 1200 mg po BID, ritonavir 500 mg po BID and efavirenz 600
      mg po QD, and 10 with abacavir 300 mg po BID, amprenavir 1200 mg po BID, nelfinavir 1250 mg
      po BID and efavirenz 600 mg po QD. The groups enrolled sequentially: low-dose ritonavir
      combination group, then the full dose ritonavir combination group, and then the nelfinavir
      combination group. Subjects were seen at pre-entry, baseline (Day 1), and thereafter at study
      weeks 1 (serial sampling), 2 (serial sampling), 4, 8, 12, 16, 24 then every 8 weeks through
      one year. Patients discontinued current therapy and without a washout period began dosing.
      For the groups who will receive ritonavir, the schedule was: dose with abacavir and
      amprenavir and, after one-week, serial plasma sampling was performed for baseline amprenavir
      levels. Next ritonavir at the assigned dose was added (for the full-dose, there is a rapid
      dose escalation) and plasma sampling was repeated one week later; finally, efavirenz 600 mg
      once daily will be added and plasma sampling was again be repeated between 2 weeks after
      beginning the combination. For the nelfinavir group, the schedule was: dose with nelfinavir,
      amprenavir, and abacavir for one week and obtain serial plasma sampling, then add efavirenz
      for another week and obtain serial plasma sampling. Patients with a confirmed increase in
      viral burden of one log or greater from baseline will end study participation. The safety and
      antiviral activity of each combination were also assessed and continue to be assessed;
      toxicity management is outlined in the protocol. This study remains open in order to continue
      to provide these drugs to subjects who completed the original one-year study period and who
      wish to continue medications that appear, by viral load, to be of benefit to them.

        INCLUSION

        Adults (greater than 18 years) infected with HIV-1.

        Plasma viral burden greater than 500 RNA copies/ml by bDNA method at screening visit while
        receiving a protease inhibitor as a part of combination therapy.

        Treatment with a protease inhibitor or inhibitor(s) for the preceding 20 weeks with no
        protease inhibitor drug change or dose interruption for greater than 3 days in the most
        recent 12 weeks.

        Laboratory values at screen:

        hemoglobin greater than 9 g/dl;

        granulocyte count greater than 900 cells/microL;

        platelet count greater than 80,000 cells/microL;

        AST (SGOT) less than 151 U/L;

        Creatine less than 2 mg/dL.

        Willingness to avoid becoming pregnant or causing a pregnancy by use of effective methods
        which include surgical sterilization and barrier methods such as condoms and/or diaphragms.
        Hormonal methods of birth control are not acceptable unless barrier methods are also used
        because drug interactions may render their concentrations subtherapeutic.

        Willing and able to provide written informed consent.

        Negative serum or urine pregnancy test on the day of enrollment.

        No intolerance of ritonavir or nelfinavir.

        EXCLUSION

        Treatment with systemic corticosteroids at greater than physiologic replacement doses,
        interleukins, interferons, radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents within 30
        days of study drug administration or an anticipated need for radiation or chemotherapy
        treatment within the next 48 weeks (with the exception of local treatment for Kaposi's
        sarcoma).

        Subjects suffering from serious medical conditions such as diabetes, congestive heart
        failure, cardiomyopathy, or other cardiac dysfunction, which, in the opinion of the
        investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient.

        Current or anticipated therapy with other agents with documented activity against HIV-1 in
        vitro (other than stable maintenance dosing of foscarnet begun prior to screening).

        Prior exposure to abacavir, amprenavir or efavirenz.

        Concomitant therapy at entry with corticosteroids in other than replacement doses,
        chemotherapy, or investigational agents.

        Active, untreated opportunistic infection or other major illness that would, in the opinion
        of the investigator, increase the risk that adverse events might pose to the patient or
        might render the patient too ill to return for study visits.

        Lymphoma not diagnosed within 5 years of study enrollment.

        Significant substance abuse or psychiatric illness that might interfere with assessment or
        compliance.

        Refusal to employ adequate means of birth control (non-hormonal methods); efavirenz is
        potentially teratofenic and conception must be avoided.

        Malabsorption or other gastrointestinal dysfunction which, in the opinion of the
        investigator, might interfere with drug absorption or render the patient unable to take
        oral medication.

        History of serious rash (erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) caused by
        nevirapine or delavirdine.

        Treatment with phenobarbital, rifampin, rifabutin, midazolam, astemizole, cisapride, or
        triazolam unless subject is safely able to discontinue the drug(s) prior to receipt of
        study medications.

        Pregnancy or lactation.
