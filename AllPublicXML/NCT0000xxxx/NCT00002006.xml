      To assess the safety and efficacy of subcutaneously administered sargramostim (
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF ) in increasing and maintaining the
      neutrophil count in HIV-infected adults who have developed neutropenia as a result of
      receiving the antiretroviral agent, zidovudine ( AZT ). To assess the safety and efficacy of
      subcutaneously administered GM-CSF in increasing and maintaining the neutrophil count in
      HIV-infected adults with pre-existing neutropenia who are at high risk of developing
      hematologic intolerance while receiving the antiretroviral agent, AZT, for the first time. To
      assess the potential therapeutic benefit of concomitant GM-CSF and AZT on the natural history
      of HIV infection and associated infectious complications.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Allowed:

          -  Minimal local irradiation for tumors.

        Patients must have:

          -  Diagnosis of AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC).

          -  Neutropenia, due either to zidovudine (AZT) or HIV infection.

          -  Life expectancy = or &gt; 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded:

          -  Significant malabsorption as defined by greater than 10 percent weight loss and one or
             more of the following:

          -  Serum carotene less than 75 IU/ml.

          -  Vitamin A level less than 75 IU/ml.

          -  More than 4 foul-smelling or greasy stools per day.

          -  Other criteria of malabsorption.

          -  Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) or other tumor which is likely to require specific antitumor
             therapy during study, other than minimal local irradiation.

          -  Active, life-threatening infection with bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoan
             pathogens or fever of 39 degrees C within 10 days of study entry, unless it is
             apparent that the fever is not due to a severe underlying infection.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded within 4 weeks of study entry:

          -  Any investigational drug.

          -  Immunomodulating agents.

          -  Hormonal therapy.

          -  Cytolytic chemotherapeutic agents.

          -  Antiretroviral agent other than zidovudine (AZT).

          -  Excluded within 4 months of study entry:

          -  Suramin.

          -  Excluded within 3 months of study entry:

          -  Ribavirin.

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Significant malabsorption.

          -  Tumor likely to require specific antitumor therapy during study.

          -  Other significant medical problems and conditions specified in Patient Exclusion
             Co-Existing Conditions.

          -  Uncorrected nutritional deficiencies that may contribute to neutropenia.

          -  Hypersensitivity to zidovudine (AZT) or other nucleoside analogs.

          -  Profound dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit the giving of informed
             consent.

        Prior Treatment:

        Excluded within 1 month of study entry:

          -  Transfusion.

          -  Excluded within 4 weeks of study entry:

          -  Radiation therapy to greater than 100 cm2 body area.

        Current drug or alcohol abuse. Unprotected sexual behavior or other activities which might
        introduce a new inoculation of HIV during the study.

        Patients must be willing to refrain from unprotected sexual or other activities which might
        introduce a new inoculum of HIV during the study.
