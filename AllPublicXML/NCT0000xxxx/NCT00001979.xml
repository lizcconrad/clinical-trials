  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney diseases related to the immune system include, nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis,
      membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and nephritis associated with connective tissue
      disorders.

      This study will allow researchers to admit and follow patients suffering from autoimmune
      diseases of the kidney. It will attempt to provide information about the causes and specific
      abnormalities associated with autoimmune kidney disease.

      Patients with kidney disease as a result of their immune system, and patients with diseases
      of the immune system who may later develop kidney disease, will be potential subjects for
      this study.

      Patients will undergo a history and physical examination, and standard laboratory test to
      more closely understand the causes, signs, symptoms, and responses to medication of these
      diseases. Based on these evaluations the patients may qualify as candidates for other
      experimental studies. At any time these patients may be asked to submit blood or urine
      samples for further research.

      Patients with known or suspected immunologically-mediated kidney diseases, including but not
      limited to, nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis,
      and nephritis associated with other systemic or connective tissue disorders, will be
      evaluated at the Clinical Center. Patients who have immunologically-mediated diseases with
      potential for kidney disease will be evaluated as well. Studies will include characterization
      of the clinical and laboratory features of these disorders, studies of natural history and
      complications, evaluation of responses to standard treatment, and determination of the
      patients' eligibility to enter other experimental diagnostic or therapeutic protocols.
      Patients may be asked to contribute blood and/or urine samples for immunological research
      studies.
