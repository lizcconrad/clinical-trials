          -  Standard therapy for infections that develop during the study period.

          -  Oral acyclovir.

          -  Nystatin.

          -  Ketoconazole.

          -  Immunomodulators.

          -  Specific therapy for malignancies (including Kaposi's sarcoma).

        Patients must have the following:

          -  Serious underlying medical problems, including insulin- dependent diabetes mellitus,
             unstable ASHD (atherosclerotic heart disease) or uncontrolled hypertension, which may
             complicate interpretation of treatment results.

          -  Dementia.

          -  Evidence of = or &gt; 2 + proteinuria at study entry.

        Concurrent Medication:

          -  Immunomodulators.

          -  Specific therapy for malignancies (including Kaposi's sarcoma).

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Active opportunistic infection or malignancy requiring treatment at study entry.

          -  Prior history of psychiatric illness or head injury which in the judgment of the
