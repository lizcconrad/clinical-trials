      BACKGROUND:

      The report of the Task Force on Respiratory Diseases identified a clinical syndrome of acute
      respiratory insufficiency (ARI) and estimated that approximately 60,000 Americans die of ARI
      yearly. ARI was not precisely defined; indeed, the Task Force realized that pathologists do
      not recognize ARI. The Task Force pointed out that no diagnostic tests for early detection of
      ARI exist, that the incidence and prevalence of the disease are not known, and that existing
      therapy is supportive and nonspecific (diuretics, corticosteroids, etc.). The pathogenesis of
      the syndrome, the mechanism of interstitial edema, the defenses of the lung against agents
      causing ARI, and the ultrastructural pathology and natural history of the disease were
      virtually unknown. The Task Force indicated a need for Respiratory Care Centers with highly
      trained personnel that could reduce mortality from ARI.

      This clinical trial grew out of the Task Force report. Nine participating centers defined ARI
      in clinical and physiological terms and agreed to a prospective randomized study for 3 years
      to compare treatment of severe ARI by conventional means with treatment by extracorporeal
      membrane oxygenators.

      Animal studies have shown that ECMO's can provide one to two weeks' support for the lungs
      without serious blood damage, in contrast to bubble oxygenators, which allow complete
      pulmonary bypass for approximately 6 hours, after which severe blood damage occurs at the
      direct blood-gas interface. If patients with hypoxia secondary to acute reversible lung
      injury can be supported with ECMO's until the lung lesion heals, improvement in survival
      rates and avoidance of the hazards of conventional therapy may result. The trial, now
      completed, was conducted at nine clinical centers in the United States.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Randomized, non-blind, fixed sample; 90 eligible patients were randomly assigned to a group
      receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation plus conventional therapy or to a group
      receiving conventional therapy.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the Query/View/Report (QVR)
      System.
