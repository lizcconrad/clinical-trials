    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare two different echocardiographic techniques in the
      evaluation of heart disease (coronary artery disease). Both tests called Myocardial Contrast
      Echocardiography with Pharmacologic Stress and Stress Echocardiography with Dobutamine, are
      performed using a standard echocardiographic machine.

      Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography (MCE) does not use radioactivity. It uses sound waves
      like standard echocardiography. However, with MCE patients receive an injection of a
      &quot;contrast agent&quot; directly into the blood stream through a vein. The contrast agent, called
      Optison, is made of tiny microbubbles smaller than red blood cells. The echocardiogram can
      detect these microbubbles in the small blood vessels of the heart muscle and allow
      researchers to find areas of the heart receiving less blood flow than others. It is important
      to observe the heart during exercise because there are changes in blood flow. Since MCE
      cannot be performed when the patient is exercising, researchers give medication (adenosine)
      that stimulates the heart and creates a situation similar to exercise.

      Stress Echocardiography with Dobutamine does not use radioactivity. It uses sound waves like
      standard echocardiography. During this echocardiogram patients receive doses of a medication
      called dobutamine that stimulates the heart to beat stronger and faster.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of MCE compared to stress
      echocardiography at detecting coronary artery disease (CAD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress echocardiography has become a valuable technique for the non-invasive detection of
      coronary artery disease (CAD). Its accuracy has been shown to be superior to that of the
      exercise electrocardiogram and comparable to that of myocardial perfusion imaging. Myocardial
      contrast echocardiography (MCE) offers the potential to evaluate tissue perfusion at the
      level where oxygen transfer to the myocytes occurs. MCE can, therefore, provide information
      regarding the functional status of the myocardial microvasculature and presence of blood flow
      disparity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of MCE compared to stress
      echocardiography. We will correlate these results with findings from coronary angiography and
      compare the ability of those techniques to detect CAD.
