      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating patients who
      have metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Confirm the greater than 20% response rate to irinotecan in patients with
      metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer who have not receive prior chemotherapy for their
      advanced disease. II. Characterize pharmacokinetic parameters of irinotecan and its
      metabolite SN-38 and their relationship to response and toxic effect. III. Characterize tumor
      samples for topoisomerase I activity, proliferative fraction (ki67 expression), and p53
      expression and determine whether clinical response is related to these tumor characteristics
      in patient population. IV. Determine the in vitro inhibition of topoisomerase I activity by
      irinotecan, SN-38, and other camptothecin analogs and evaluate whether the degree of in vitro
      sensitivity to irinotecan and/or SN-38 is associated with clinical response in these
      patients. VII. Determine the frequency of somatic mutations following irinotecan and
      correlate this with pharmacologic parameters.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV at a starting dose weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2
      weeks of rest. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Tumor status is reassessed every 12 weeks during study. Patients attaining a
      complete response may receive additional courses of treatment. Patients are followed until
      death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54 patients will be accrued into this study at a rate of 25
      patients per year.
