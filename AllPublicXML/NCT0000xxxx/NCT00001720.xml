  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bones grow and stay strong through a continuous process of formation (building) and
      resorption (break down). When more bone is formed than resorbed, the density (level of
      calcium) in bone increases and the bones become stronger. However, if more bone is resorbed
      than formed the density of bone decreases and the bones become weak. This condition is called
      osteoporosis.

      Osteoporosis is a rare but serious condition in children. Childhood osteoporosis can occur
      without a known cause (idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis). Children with osteoporosis suffer
      from pain, inability to stay active, and increased amounts of broken bones, including
      fractures of the spine. Even mild childhood osteoporosis may have long-term consequences
      since individuals who achieve a less than normal bone composition (peak bone mass) during the
      first 20-30 years of life may be at an increased risk for osteoporosis as adults.

      Alendronate (Fosamax) is a drug that works by stopping bone resorption (break down). It has
      been used to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis, male osteoporosis and adults with
      osteoporosis due to long-term steroid therapy. The goal of this study is to determine the
      effectiveness of alendronate in children with idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. Researchers
      believe that children treated with alendronate will improve bone strength and decrease the
      amount of fractures caused by osteoporosis.

    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a rare but serious condition in children. One of the least well understood
      forms of childhood osteoporosis is idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. Affected children suffer
      from pain, decreased activity tolerance, and increased fractures, including vertebral
      compression fractures. Even mild childhood osteoporosis may have long-term consequences since
      individuals who achieve a lower peak bone mass during the first 2-3 decades of life may be at
      increased risk for osteoporosis as adults.

      Alendronate (Fosamax (Trademark), Merck &amp; Co.), an aminobisphosphonate, is a potent inhibitor
      of bone resorption. It has been used to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis, idiopathic male
      osteoporosis, and glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis in adults. The goal of this protocol is
      to evaluate the effectiveness of Alendronate in children with glucocorticoid induced and
      idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study
      design. We hypothesize that children treated with this drug will have an improvement in bone
      mineral density and decrease in osteoporotic fractures.

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Chronological age: 6.0 - 17.0 years. Study population will be restricted to children
        greater than 12 years of age until 8 patients have completed 6 months of the study or
        safety data is available from a comparable study.

        AP Lumbar spine bone mineral density less than or equal to -2 standard deviations for age
        matched controls (z-score) using Hologic QDR machine.

        Normative data published by Faulkner will be used to calculate Z-scores.

        Patients with Idiopathic Juvenile Osteoporosis, osteoporosis (BMD less than -2 SD compared
        to age-matched controls) in a child with no identifiable etiology. Children with IJO and
        delayed puberty will have their z-score calculated on the basis of bone age.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Inability to swallow pills or comply with administration instructions.

        Upper gastrointestinal tract disease.

        Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 35 mL per min per 1.73 square meters.

        Prior treatment with bisphosphonates.

        Concurrent therapy with oral aspirin or salicylate containing compounds, excluding
        delayed-release salicylates which act in the distal gastrointestinal tract (for example,
        mesalamine, sulfasalazine, etc...).

        Hypocalcemia.

        Treatment with hGH or calcitonin in the preceding 6 months.

        Inability to undergo dual energy x-ray absorptiometry.

        Positive pregnancy test.

        In females, sexual activity without an effective method of contraception.
