  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To define the toxicity and maximum-tolerated dose of weekly oral etoposide (VP-16) in
      patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma; to determine the clinical pharmacology of orally
      administered VP-16 in AIDS patients. A secondary objective is to obtain preliminary data for
      determining the effect of oral VP-16 on Kaposi's sarcoma.

      VP-16 is an antitumor agent. Previous problems with VP-16 include the route of administration
      and the toxicities. VP-16 has been given intravenously for 3 consecutive days in a 21-day
      cycle for lung cancer and testicular cancer. VP-16 has also been used in lymphoma therapy.
      Oral VP-16 would eliminate the need for an intravenous catheter and so a patient could avoid
      the pain, inconvenience, and potential complications associated with medications administered
      intravenously. The relative ease of outpatient administration and the potentially significant
      antitumor activity of oral VP-16 motivates this study. The possibility of weekly drug
      administration is the other focus of this study.

      administration is the other focus of this study.

      Four patients are entered at each dose level starting with level 1. Patients are not entered
      into the next higher dose level until at least two patients at the previous dose level have
      completed at least 3 weeks of therapy with grade 2 or less maximum tolerated dose-defining
      toxicities. Treatment is repeated weekly for 52 weeks until either a grade 3 or 4 toxicity
      occurs, or until a patient shows a complete response or progressive disease. Patients with a
      complete response are continued on drug for 4 additional weeks from the time that complete
      response is first documented. Patients with progressive disease are withdrawn from study.
      Patients with partial response or stable disease continue until either unacceptable toxicity
      occurs or a complete response or progression of disease is reached.

             dose before starting AZT. Zidovudine will not be provided by the NIAID Clinical
             Product Research Repository.

        AMENDED:

          -  Zidovudine (AZT) allowed after completing 12 weeks on study.
