      RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally occurring substances that may also be made in the
      laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antineoplaston therapy works in treating
      patients with colon cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in patients with
           adenocarcinoma of the colon by determining the proportion of patients who experience an
           objective tumor response.

        -  Evaluate the adverse effects of and tolerance to this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive gradually escalating doses of oral antineoplaston A10 and oral
      antineoplaston AS2-1 6-7 times a day. If the patient has not achieved a partial or complete
      response after 3-4 months of treatment, the investigator may discontinue treatment. Patients
      with stable disease may continue to receive treatment until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity is observed.

      Tumors are measured every 4 months during the first 2 years, then every 6 months during years
      3 and 4, and yearly during years 5 and 6.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
