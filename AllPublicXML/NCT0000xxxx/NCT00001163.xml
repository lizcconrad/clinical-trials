  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical, epidemiologic, genetic, and laboratory study of individuals and families
      at high risk of cancer and selected tumors to investigate the genetic susceptibility and
      environmental exposures which may alter cancer risk. Families with multiple members who have
      an unusual pattern or number of cancers or tumors are evaluated clinically. This evaluation
      is specific for the type of cancer or tumor predominant in the family in order to determine
      the affection status of each individual for genetic epidemiologic studies. Genetic and
      environmental risk factor information specific for the tumor type is obtained.

      Individuals with, or at high risk of, cancer because of their personal, familial, or
      environmental histories are identified by healthcare worker referral or by personal inquiry.
      Relevant etiologic risk factor information is documented through review of pathology
      specimens and medical, vital, and genealogical records. Selected individuals and family
      members are asked to complete questionnaires and to undergo clinical evaluations specific for
      the tumor of interest. They are also asked to donate biologic specimens to be used in the
      search for cancer etiology and mechanisms of carcinogenesis. No therapy beyond counseling and
      education for cancer prevention, risk reduction, and early detection will be given.

      Genetic testing for tumor susceptibility gene(s) mutations and risk notification will be
      offered to study participants for whom a specific mutation predictive of disease has been
      identified in his/her family. This testing will only be offered when reasonable individual
      cancer risk estimates can be delivered, and only to those participants who choose to know
      their individual genetic status after appropriate education and counseling. The testing will
      be conducted exclusively in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-licensed
      laboratories. Genetic testing and risk notification are entirely optional and do not affect
      participation in other aspects of the protocol. A separate consent procedure and consent form
      will be used for genetic testing and risk notification related to these specific genes.

      Once enrolled, study participants are monitored prospectively for the development of outcomes
      of interest, typically by means of periodic mail or telephone contact. In selected instances,
      subjects may return to the Clinical Center periodically for study-specific follow-up
      examinations. Although we do not offer specific anti-cancer therapy as part of this protocol,
      we provide assistance to insure that study participants who require treatment for
      tumor-related problems that develop during the course of the study are referred to
      appropriate healthcare providers. We remain available to study participants and their
      healthcare providers for advice and consultation related to the management of familial
      cancer/tumor predisposition.

      Background:

      Persons may be prone to develop cancer for a variety of reasons including: inherited
      predisposition benign, premalignant, or malignant conditions; environmental exposures shared
      by family members; previous tumors, immune deficiency, or preneoplastic conditions.

      Investigations of individuals and families at high risk of cancer often lead to etiologic
      clues that may be important in the sporadic counterparts of these cancers in the general
      population.

      Identification of etiologically important genetic factors could inform chemoprevention
      trials, screening programs, and treatment of the studied cancer types.

      Objectives:

      To evaluate and define the clinical spectrum and natural history of disease in syndromes
      predisposing to cancer.

      To evaluate potential precursor states of disease in families at risk.

      To quantify risks of tumors in family members.

      To map, clone, and determine function of tumor susceptibility genes.

      To identify genetic determinants, environmental factors, and gene-environment interactions
      conferring cancer risk in individuals and families.

      To evaluate gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in tumor formation.

      To educate and counsel study participants about their tumor risk including prevention
      recommendations and early detection activities when known.

      To develop educational materials for medical professionals and high-risk family members.

      Eligibility:

      Persons of any age will be considered for inclusion in the study because of either,

      A family or personal medical history of neoplasia of an unusual type, pattern, or number; or,

      Known or suspected factor(s) predisposing to neoplasia, either genetic and/or congenital
      factors, environmental exposure, or unusual demographic features.

      Types of familial tumors that we are currently actively accruing include Cancers: bladder,
      bone, brain, chordoma, lung, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCC).

      Design:

      This is a prospective study. Individuals and families are studied long-term, using a cohort
      approach.

      The study design and clinical evaluation vary by the specific type of familial neoplasm being
      studied.

      The overall approach to eligible study participants includes defining affection status,
      characterization of disease, localization of genetic loci, identification of genes,
      evaluation of phenotype/genotype correlations, estimation of risk of the disease associated
      with carrier status and identification of other risk factors that modify penetrance (genetic,
      environmental, host factors).

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        On referral, persons of any age will be considered for the inclusion in the study because
        of either:

        A family or personal history of neoplasia of an unusual type, pattern, or number; OR,

        known or suspected factor(s) predisposing to neoplasia, either genetic and/or congenital
        factors (birth defects, metabolic phenotype, chromosomal anomalies or Mendelian traits
        associated with tumors), environmental exposure (medications, occupation, radiation, diet,
        infectious agents, etc.), or unusual demographic features (very young age of onset,
        multiple tumors, etc.).

        Personal and family medical history must be verified through questionnaires, interviews,
        and review of pathology slides and medical records. For familial neoplasms, two or more
        living affected cases among family members are required. The types of familial tumors that
        we are currently actively accruing include:

        Familial Cancers: bladder, brain, chordoma, lung, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome
        (NBCC)

        Familial Benign Neoplasms: meningiomas, neurofibromatosis 2 (bilateral acoustic
        neurofibromatosis)

        The types of familial tumors under active accrual and study are predominantly
        investigator-and hypothesis-driven. This approach permits GEB investigators to remain alert
        to the opportunities afforded by clusters of rare tumors in families and individuals, and
        to be more responsive to the dynamic research priorities in cancer genetics.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Referred individuals and families for whom reported diagnoses cannot be verified.

        Inability to provide informed consent.

        Eligible for familial melanoma, lymphoproliferative, breast-ovarian cancer, or testicular
        cancer protocols.
