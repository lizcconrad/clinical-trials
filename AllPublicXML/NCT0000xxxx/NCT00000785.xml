  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PRIMARY: To estimate the proportion of tuberculosis patients in the CPCRA who have
      drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and to describe the patterns of drug resistance.

      SECONDARY: To compare drug resistance data on the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates of
      HIV-infected patients to those of HIV-uninfected patients who are being followed in the
      CPCRA. To assess the relationship of resistance data with geographic, demographic, and HIV
      and TB risk factor information.

      Geographic areas and demographic subgroups affected by the TB epidemic appear to be congruent
      and associated with the concurrent HIV epidemic. The total number of CPCRA patients who will
      develop, or who have experienced, confirmed TB is unknown. It is critical to determine the
      depth and breadth of the current problem of drug-resistant TB.

      Geographic areas and demographic subgroups affected by the TB epidemic appear to be congruent
      and associated with the concurrent HIV epidemic. The total number of CPCRA patients who will
      develop, or who have experienced, confirmed TB is unknown. It is critical to determine the
      depth and breadth of the current problem of drug-resistant TB.

      For both retrospective and prospective components of the study, demographic, geographic, HIV
      and TB risk factor information will be collected on CPCRA patients with confirmed pulmonary
      or extrapulmonary TB. Mycobacterial culture results will be recorded. Retrospective data will
      be collected on CPCRA patients with confirmed tuberculosis who have been diagnosed since
      January 1992 until the time of site registration. Prospective data will be collected on CPCRA
      patients with confirmed tuberculosis diagnosed during the period of 1 to 2 years following
      site registration.

        Patients must meet the following criteria:

          -  CPCRA patients with confirmed pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB. Confirmed clinical TB
             requires a positive culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

        NOTE:

          -  There is no requirement that patients have HIV infection.
