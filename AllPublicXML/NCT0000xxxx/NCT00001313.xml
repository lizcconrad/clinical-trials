  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researchers will admit and evaluate patients with known or suspected heart
      disease referred to the Cardiology Branch of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
      (NHLBI).

      Patients participating in this study will undergo a general medical evaluation, including
      blood tests, urine, examination, chest x-ray and electrocardiogram (EKG). In addition,
      patients may be asked to have an echocardiogram (ultrasound scan of the heart) and to perform
      an exercise stress test.

      These tests are designed to assess the types and causes of patient's heart diseases and to
      determine if they can participate in other, specific research studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principal mission of the NIH is the conduct of research that elucidates biological
      mechanisms, pathogenesis, and treatment of disease. Patients with known or suspected
      cardiovascular diseases are referred to NHLBI cardiologists for consideration of
      participation in clinical research protocols. However, eligibility for participation is often
      uncertain from referral information or even after an outpatient evaluation. The purpose of
      this protocol is to permit inpatient evaluation of patients for whom participation in
      clinical research protocols is under consideration in order to determine protocol eligibility
      by means of conventional laboratory and cardiovascular testing.
