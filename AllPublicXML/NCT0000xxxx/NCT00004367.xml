      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether the prevalence of abnormalities on clinical vestibular
      (balance) tests is higher in panic disorder with agoraphobia than in uncomplicated panic
      disorder and nonpanic anxiety disorder.

      II. Determine whether the prevalence of abnormalities on audiological tests of cochlear or
      brainstem function is elevated in panic disorder without agoraphobia or nonpanic anxiety
      disorder.

      III. Determine whether symptom patterns can be identified that are indicative of vestibular
      abnormalities in panic disorder.

      IV. Determine whether vestibular dysfunction can be induced by psychosomatic mechanisms.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by otoneurological function (panic disorder without
      agoraphobia, panic disorder with agoraphobia, anxiety disorder without panic or
      agoraphobia-like avoidance, and normal controls).

      Patients undergo a psychiatric interview and a structured interview focused on anxiety
      disorders. Physical evaluation is completed.

      A vestibular evaluation consisting of posturography, rotational testing, and ocular motor
      screening battery, and positional and caloric testing is completed on all patients. Patients
      then complete an audiological test battery consisting of basic audiological analysis, speech
      recognition scores, immittance testing, brainstem evoked response, and determination of
      binaural masking level differences.

      Control patients also complete a hyperventilation-rotational test.
