      To develop a clinical severity index that could prospectively identify sickle cell disease
      patients who were at high risk for a turbulent clinical course and a poor prognosis.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Using the database, univariate analysis showed that factors associated with the occurrence of
      cerebrovascular accident (51 patients) included hematocrit, rate of change of pocked red cell
      count, and polymer fraction at 40 percent oxygen saturation (PF40). Only low hematocrit was
      predictive of death in the pediatric cohort. There were 45 disease-related deaths.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
