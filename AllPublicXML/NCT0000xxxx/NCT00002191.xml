  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy (stool frequency) and safety (adverse experiences) of albendazole,
      administered for 28 days, compared to placebo and for 62 days in open-label fashion, in
      treating intestinal microsporidiosis in HIV-positive patients. To assess the effect of
      albendazole on stool volume, weight gain, microsporidial counts in small bowel biopsies, and
      on the relationship between microsporidial counts in stool and stool frequency and volume. To
      correlate microsporidial counts with the clinical course of microsporidiosis.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Required:

          -  If coincident enteric pathogens that are not eradicable (i.e., Mycobacterium avium
             complex) are detected, they should be treated appropriately and the patient must be on
             a stable regimen of therapy for at least two weeks.

        Allowed:

          -  Patients taking antidiarrheal medications must be on a stable regimen for at least
             seven days prior to randomization.

          -  Patients taking other concomitant medications, including antiretrovirals, must be on a
             stable regimen for two weeks prior to randomization.

        Patients must have:

          -  HIV positive status. Written documentation (for example, patient's chart) of HIV
             diagnosis is acceptable in lieu of repeat testing. Confirmation by Western blot is not
             necessary.

          -  Biopsy-proven microsporidiosis of the fourth portion of the duodenum or proximal
             jejunum within 90 days before randomization.

          -  Average of &gt; 3 liquid bowel movements per day over 7 consecutive days immediately
             prior to randomization, with an average volume &gt; 500 ml per day over three or more
             consecutive days immediately prior to randomization, as documented by data collected
             in a daily diary. NOTE:

          -  Patients receiving antidiarrheal therapy must meet these criteria despite such
             therapy.

          -  History of an average of &gt; 3 liquid bowel movements per day for three additional weeks
             immediately preceding the 7-day period described above (for a total of four weeks), as
             documented in the patient's chart.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Grade 4 neutropenia.

          -  Decompensated liver disease.

          -  Positive toxin analysis for C. difficile.

          -  Positive microscopic examination for Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and
             Isospora belli.

          -  Positive on culture for Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia and Campylobacter.

          -  Positive fluorescent antibody test for Cryptosporidium.

          -  Evidence of CMV on small bowel biopsy, flexible sigmoidoscopic or colonoscopic
             biopsies within 90 days of randomization.

          -  Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the patient
             unsuitable for study entry.

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:

        Hypersensitivity to albendazole.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Use of potential antiprotozoal drugs, e.g., mebendazole or metronidazole, within one
             week prior to enrollment.

          -  Receipt of albendazole during the one month prior to enrollment.
