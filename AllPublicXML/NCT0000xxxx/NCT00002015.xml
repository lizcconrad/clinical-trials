  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of intravenous ganciclovir in children (ages 3 months - 12
      years). To determine the safety and tolerance of a 2 to 3 week induction course of
      ganciclovir IV in immunocompromised children receiving treatment for life- or
      sight-threatening cytomegalovirus infections.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Topical acyclovir.

          -  Consult with the Syntex study monitor for the following:

          -  Cytokines.

          -  Soluble CD4.

          -  Trichosanthin (Compound Q).

          -  Imipenem-cilastatin.

          -  Other investigational drugs.

        Patients must have the following:

          -  Congenital or acquired immune deficiency.

          -  Eligibility to receive ganciclovir for the treatment of life- or sight-threatening
             Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded:

          -  Mild to moderate Cytomegalovirus infection that does not satisfy the clinical severity
             criteria.

          -  Congenital or neonatal CMV infections without documented congenital or acquired
             immunodeficiency.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Other myelosuppressive drugs.

          -  Antimetabolites.

          -  Alkylating agents.

          -  Nucleoside analogs (topical acyclovir is allowed).

          -  Interferons.

          -  Foscarnet.

          -  Consult with the Syntex study monitor for the following:

          -  Cytokines.

          -  Soluble CD4.

          -  Trichosanthin (Compound Q).

          -  Imipenem-cilastatin.

          -  Other investigational drugs.

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Mild to moderate Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection that does not meet the clinical
             severity criteria.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 500 cells/mm3 or a platelet count &lt; 25000
             platelets/mm3. Note:

          -  Exceptions may be made for patients with pre-existing neutropenia or thrombocytopenia
             and immediately life-threatening disease, if the investigator believes that a delay in
             starting ganciclovir therapy is not advisable. In such patients, the investigator
             should advise the parents or guardians of the risk of further bone marrow suppression
             and the increased risk of infection or bleeding.

          -  Receiving excluded medications that it is not possible to discontinue.

          -  Congenital or neonatal CMV infections without documented congenital or acquired
             immunodeficiency.

          -  Demonstrated hypersensitivity to acyclovir or ganciclovir.
