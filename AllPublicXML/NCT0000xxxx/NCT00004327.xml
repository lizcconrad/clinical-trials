      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the efficacy of octreotide, a somatostatin octapeptide analog, in decreasing
      gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with hormone-refractory hereditary hemorrhagic
      telangiectasia or senile ectasia.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are treated with subcutaneous injections of octreotide twice a
      day. The dose is adjusted based on response.

      If there is no requirement for transfusions or intravenous iron for 4 weeks and the
      hemoglobin is greater than 10 mg/dL, therapy is continued for 1 year. If there is no decrease
      in bleeding after 10 weeks, the patient is removed from study.
