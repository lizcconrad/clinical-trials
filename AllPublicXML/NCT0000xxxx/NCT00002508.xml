      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow doctors to give
      higher doses of chemotherapy and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by
      peripheral stem cell transplantation or bone marrow transplantation in treating patients who
      have relapsed or recurrent germ cell cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, overall survival, and disease-free survival of
      patients with refractory or relapsed germ cell carcinoma treated with high-dose induction
      chemotherapy comprising carboplatin and etoposide followed by autologous bone marrow or
      peripheral blood stem cell rescue.

      OUTLINE: Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) or bone marrow is harvested. Patients
      receive carboplatin IV continuously and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days -5 through -3.
      Autologous PBSC or bone marrow is reinfused on day 0.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Documented relapsed or refractory germ cell cancer of the
        following sites of origin: Testes Ovary Retroperitoneum Mediastinum Other sites Any stage
        of disease allowed Any histologic subtype allowed Seminoma only allowed if ineligible for
        radiotherapy Failed to achieve complete remission (CR) following at least 3 courses of a
        standard platinum-containing regimen or experienced clear relapse following CR obtained
        with such a regimen Absence of tumor markers in the presence of stable residual masses
        after initial treatment may be allowed (surgical biopsy should be performed; if medically
        safe, to confirm persistence of disease and rule out mature teratoma or fibrosis) Prior CNS
        involvement allowed in the absence of gross residual CNS tumor following definitive local
        therapy (surgery plus radiotherapy) No gross tumor involvement on bone marrow biopsy

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 15 to 60 Performance status: Karnofsky 80-100% Hematopoietic:
        Granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm3 Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Hepatic: Bilirubin
        less than 2.0 mg/dL SGOT/SGPT less than 2 times normal Albumin greater than 3.0 mg/dL
        Renal: Creatinine less than 1.8 mg/dL Cardiovascular: LVEF at least 50% No other serious
        cardiac disease that would preclude transplantation Pulmonary: DLCO, FEV1, and FVC at least
        50% predicted pO2 at least 70 mm Hg on room air Other: HIV negative No other concurrent
        serious psychiatric, neurologic, neoplastic, immunologic, or other medical problem that
        would preclude transplantation Not pregnant
