      RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop
      cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells
      from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining biological therapy with chemotherapy may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy plus chemotherapy
      in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the toxic effects, patient tolerance, and practicality of
      administering interferon alfa-2b, fluorouracil, interleukin-2, and isotretinoin (FUNIL-cRa)
      in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent renal cell carcinoma. II. Obtain a pilot
      indication of responsiveness of these patients to this regimen. III. Evaluate the measurement
      of tumor thymidylate synthetase as a prediction of response of these patients to this and
      other fluorouracil based regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by performance status (0 vs 1), nephrectomy (yes vs no),
      site of disease (pulmonary or lymph node metastases only vs other disease site), radiotherapy
      (yes vs no), and prior adjuvant biologic or hormone therapy (yes vs no). Patients receive
      intravenous fluorouracil daily for 14 days, and subcutaneous interferon alfa-2b 3 times a
      week for 6 weeks. Beginning on day 15, patients receive intravenous interleukin-2, 5 days a
      week and oral isotretinoin 2 times a day for 4 weeks. Treatment courses are 6 weeks, followed
      by a 2 week rest period. Treatment continues for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with partial or complete response may undergo
      surgical resection. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued to this study.
