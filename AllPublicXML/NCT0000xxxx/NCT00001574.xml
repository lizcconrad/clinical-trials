  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain tumors represent the most common solid tumor of childhood. Treatment generally entails
      surgery and radiation, but local recurrence is frequent. Chemotherapy is often used in an
      adjuvant setting, to delay radiation therapy or for resistant disease. Children with brain
      tumors are generally followed by imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. Difficulty arises in
      trying to distinguish tumor regrowth from treatment related edema, necrosis or radiation
      injury. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic (NMRS) Imaging is a non-invasive
      method of detecting and measuring cellular metabolites in vivo. NMRS imaging complements
      routine MRI by giving chemical information in conjunction with spatial information obtained
      by MRI.

      This study will be conducted to determine NMRS imaging patterns before, during and after
      chemotherapy in pediatric patients with primary or metastatic brain tumors in an attempt to
      identify and characterize specific patterns of metabolites related to tumor regrowth, tumor
      response to therapy, edema or necrosis.

      Background:

        -  Brain tumors represent the most common solid tumor of childhood. Treatment generally
           includes surgery and radiation, but recurrences are frequent, particularly for
           high-grade lesions.

        -  Chemotherapy is often used in an adjuvant setting, to delay radiation therapy or for
           resistant disease.

        -  Children with brain tumors are generally followed by imaging studies, such as CT or MRI.

        -  Difficulty arises in trying to distinguish tumor regrowth from treatment related edema,
           necrosis or radiation injury.

        -  Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic (NMRS) Imaging is a non-invasive method
           of detecting and measuring cellular metabolites in vivo.

      Objective:

        -  To determine NMRS imaging patterns before, during and after chemotherapy in pediatric
           patients with primary or metastatic brain tumors

        -  To identify and characterize specific patterns of metabolites related to tumor regrowth,
           tumor response to therapy, edema or necrosis.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age less than or equal to 21 years.

        -  Patients entered on this trial will also be entered on one of the Branch s primary brain
           tumor treatment trials.

        -  Histologically confirmed primary or metastatic brain tumor. Patients with a brainstem
           glioma or optic pathway gliomas are not required to have a histologic diagnosis.

        -  Measurable or evaluable tumor at the time of study entry.

      Design:

        -  This is intended to be a pilot study to define metabolite patterns associated with tumor
           growth, tumor edema and tumor necrosis as seen on standard MRI; and determine the
           feasibility of using metabolite patterns to predict response to therapy in pediatric
           patients with brain tumors.

        -  Contalateral spectroscopic analysis of normal appearing brain will also be performed
           when feasible.

        -  Analysis of results will be stratified according to type of tumor, and prior history of
           radiation therapy or surgery.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Age less than or equal to 21 years.

        Patients entered on this trial will also be entered on one of the Pediatric Oncology
        Branch's primary treatment trials (e.g., phenylacetate, phenylbutyrate, SU-101) or on the
        Natural History or Standard Therapy protocols. The patient's management will be determined
        by the primary treatment protocol.

        Histology confirmed primary or metastatic brain tumor. Patients with a brainstem glioma are
        not required to have previously had a histologic diagnosis.

        Measurable or evaluable tumor at the time of study entry.

        Durable Power of Attorney (DPA): A DPA is required of all patients 18 - 21 years of age.

        All patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is less than 18 years of age) must
        sign a document of informed consent indicating their awareness of the investigational
        nature and the risks of this study. When appropriate the minor patient will give verbal
        assent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Pregnant women.

        Any patient who is unable (either because of physical or psychological factors) to undergo
        imaging studies and who is not an anesthesia candidate.

        Any patient with a metallic implant, including cardiac pacemakers, neural pacemakers,
        shrapnel, cochlear implants or ferrous surgical clips.

        Any patient with a history of a severe reaction to Gadolinium or other contrast agents.
