  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Native Hawaiian Diabetes Intervention Program is a project focused on determining whether
      a cultural-based, healthy lifestyles program with family support will have a positive effect
      on lifestyle behaviors and psychosocial and clinical outcomes. A culturally sensitive,
      lifestyle intervention program was administered via community peer educators to a population
      of Native Hawaiians with or at risk for diabetes. The effect of this intervention program on
      selected outcomes is being compared to a ''standard'' program given to a similar population
      in a second Native Hawaiian community.
