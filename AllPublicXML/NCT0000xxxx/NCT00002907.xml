      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 in treating patients with
      relapsed multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of bryostatin 1 administered as a 72-hour continuous
      infusion in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma. II. Determine the qualitative and
      quantitative toxic effects of bryostatin 1 in these patients. III. Determine the duration of
      response and survival following bryostatin 1 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive bryostatin 1 by 72-hour continuous infusion every 2 weeks until
      disease progression or 2 courses beyond complete remission. Response is assessed after every
      4 courses. Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 evaluable patients will be entered into this study over
      1.25 years.
