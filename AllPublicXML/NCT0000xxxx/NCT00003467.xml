      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of carmustine in treating adults with
      recurrent supratentorial low-grade glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of Gliadel wafers (carmustine) in the treatment of
           recurrent supratentorial low grade glioma.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease (fibrillary astrocytoma vs oligodendroglioma or
      mixed glioma).

      Patients receive up to 8 Gliadel wafers (containing carmustine) implanted in the resected
      tumor cavity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue a maximum of 68 patients within 18-24 months.
