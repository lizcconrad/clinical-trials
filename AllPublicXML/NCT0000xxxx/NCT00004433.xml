      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the presumed mechanism of action of low dose pergolide to act acutely through the
      dopaminergic autoreceptor or postsynaptically at D2 sites in children 7 to 17 with tourette
      syndrome (GTS).

      II. Compare tolerability and safety of pergolide in these patients to standard neuroleptic
      therapy via naturalist assessment after 3-6 months of treatment using matched historical
      controls on neuroleptics.

      III. Determine efficacy of pergolide for tic control in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      This is a three part study: part I is a randomized, double blind, fixed single dose study;
      part II is a randomized, open label, stratified study; and part III is a randomized, double
      blind, placebo controlled study.

      Part I patients are randomized to receive oral pergolide at one of three dose levels or
      placebo for 10 weeks. Part II patients are randomized to receive either low or high dose
      pergolide for 4 weeks.

      Part III patients are randomized to first receive either pergolide or placebo by oral fixed
      doses twice daily followed by flexible clinically adjusted dosing for the next 3 weeks after
      a 2-week placebo run-in. Patients then cross over to receive the other treatment after
      another 2 weeks of placebo run-in. Total treatment duration is 16 weeks.

      Patients are followed at 6 months.
