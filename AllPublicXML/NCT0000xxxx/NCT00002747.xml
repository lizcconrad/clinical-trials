      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It
      is not yet known if surgery plus radiation therapy is more effective with or without
      chemotherapy for treating mouth cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery and radiation
      therapy with or without chemotherapy in treating patients with stage II, stage III, or stage
      IV mouth cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the short- and long-term local control rates, disease-free survival,
      and overall survival following treatment with neoadjuvant cisplatin plus fluorouracil
      followed by surgery with or without radiotherapy vs surgery alone with or without
      radiotherapy in patients with previously untreated stage II-IV squamous cell carcinoma of the
      oral cavity. II. Assess the prognostic significance of clinical and pathologic responses to
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy in these patients. III. Compare the short- and long-term toxic
      effects of these two regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center and nodal
      status (N0 vs N1-2 vs N3). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I:
      Patients receive cisplatin IV on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease after 2 courses or progressive disease at
      any time proceed to surgery. Patients undergo resection of the primary tumor site and
      possible nodal dissection no sooner than 2 weeks after completion of chemotherapy. Patients
      then undergo radiotherapy over 5-6 weeks no later than 8 weeks after surgery. Arm II:
      Patients undergo surgery and radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients are followed every 3 months
      for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then yearly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients will be accrued for this study over 9 years.
