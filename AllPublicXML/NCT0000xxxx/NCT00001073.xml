  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give isotretinoin to
      HIV-infected women with cervical tumors to prevent these tumors from becoming cancerous.

      Cervical tumors are found in both HIV-infected and HIV-negative women. However, HIV-infected
      women are at a greater risk, and often their tumors become cancerous more quickly than those
      in HIV-negative women. Isotretinoin may be able to prevent this from happening. However,
      since these tumors tend to disappear over time, many doctors are hesitant to give their
      patients isotretinoin since this drug causes birth defects. This study looks at whether it is
      better to treat cervical tumors in HIV-infected women or to wait and see if they will
      disappear by themselves.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical neoplasia is frequently seen in HIV-infected women, apparently resulting from
      immunosuppression and common risk factors, including sexual behavior patterns. In HIV
      seronegative women, progression of preinvasive neoplasia is relatively slow, and up to 40
      percent of low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (grade I CIN/HPV-associated changes)
      regress to a normal appearance over time. Many clinicians have opted not to treat CIN
      I/HPV-associated changes due to this high spontaneous regression rate. Currently, retinoids,
      principally isotretinoin, are the most consistently effective medical therapy for
      CIN/HPV-associated changes, but use of isotretinoin in HIV-infected patients has not been
      extensively documented. (AS PER AMENDMENT 6/10/97)

      Patients are randomized to receive oral isotretinoin for 6 months or be observed only for 6
      months, with 12 additional months of follow-up. [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/23/99: Follow-up time has
      been decreased to 9 months from the last patient enrolled.]
