      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage
      tumors cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is
      not yet known which regimen of chemotherapy plus radiation therapy is more effective for
      early-stage breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two different regimens of
      adjuvant chemotherapy plus radiation therapy in treating women who have early-stage breast
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the effects of synchronous vs sequential adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy
           on local recurrence, disease-free and overall survival, and treatment delay in women
           with early-stage breast cancer.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens, in terms of dose intensity and toxicity, in this
           patient population.

        -  Compare the quality of life and cosmetic outcome in patients treated with these
           regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      clinical oncologist, axillary clearance (yes vs no), radiotherapy boost intent (boost vs no
      boost), and chemotherapy intent (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil [5-FU] vs
      anthracycline-containing regimen). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      Patients receive any chemotherapy regimen that includes cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and
      5-FU. Some regimens may also include epirubicin, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, and/or mitomycin.
      Chemotherapy repeats every 3 weeks for 4-8 courses.

        -  Arm I (synchronous chemoradiotherapy): Patients receiving synchronous therapy receive
           any of the above chemotherapy regimens plus daily radiotherapy between courses 2 and 3
           OR courses 5 and 6 of chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is administered for 3-5 weeks.

        -  Arm II (sequential chemoradiotherapy): Patients receiving sequential therapy receive any
           of the above chemotherapy regimens followed by daily radiotherapy beginning after
           completion of all chemotherapy (after course 6 or 8). Radiotherapy is administered for
           3-5 weeks.

      Treatment in both arms continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed before chemotherapy, 2-3 weeks after the completion of all
      treatment, and then at 1, 2, and 5 years.

      Patients are followed annually for 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,250 patients (1,125 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study.
