      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give 1592U89 plus 141W94
      plus DMP 266 to patients with HIV who have developed resistance to indinavir, ritonavir,
      saquinavir, or nelfinavir after at least 20 weeks of protease inhibitor treatment. This study
      also examines how long this combination therapy is effective before patients develop
      resistance to it.

      This is a multicenter, open-label study. A total of 80 patients are treated on this study and
      include:

      At least 30 patients with a viral burden of 500 - 40,000 copies/ml. At least 30 patients with
      a viral burden greater than 40,000 copies/ml. At least 20 patients with less than 1 year
      total prior treatment with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).

      All patients receive self-administered, combination antiretroviral therapy for 48 weeks, as
      follows:

      1592U89 plus 141W94 plus DMP 266.

          -  Drugs that may interact with CYP3A4, that should be used with caution including (but
             not limited to):

          -  Detoxification treatment including opiate agonists (methadone, buprenorphine, etc.):

          -  Patients currently receiving this treatment should be enrolled only if stable on this
             therapy.

        Patients must have:

          -  HIV-1 infection (all CDC clinical categories allowed).

          -  HIV-1 RNA greater than 500 copies/ml when measured on 1 occasion within 14 days of
             study drug administration.

          -  Signed, informed consent from parent or legal guardian for those patients under 18
             years of age.

        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Malabsorption syndrome or other gastrointestinal dysfunction that may interfere with
             drug absorption or render the patient unable to take oral medication.

          -  Active AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or disease that is likely to preclude the
             patient from study participation.

          -  Serious medical conditions such as diabetes, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy,
             or other cardiac dysfunction that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             compromise the safety of the patient.

        Excluded:

          -  Immunomodulating agents, e.g., corticosteroids, interleukins, thalidomide,
