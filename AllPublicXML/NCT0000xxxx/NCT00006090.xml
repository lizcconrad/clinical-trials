      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients
      who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has relapsed or has not responded to treatment
      with fludarabine.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the clinical efficacy and safety of arsenic trioxide in patients
      with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that is refractory to fludarabine or in relapse. II.
      Determine the pattern of clinical adverse experience in these patients when treated with this
      regimen. III. Evaluate the effects of this drug on cytokines, apoptosis, and angiogenesis in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 2 hours on days 1-15 OR on days 1-5, 8-12,
      and 15-19. Courses repeat with 2 to 5 week intervals between courses for 10-12 courses (about
      1 year) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for the second year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-37 patients will be accrued for this study.
