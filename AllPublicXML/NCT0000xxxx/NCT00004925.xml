      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells
      and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal doxorubicin and trastuzumab
      in treating women who have locally advanced, inflammatory, or metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety, especially the cardiac safety, of doxorubicin HCl liposome and
           trastuzumab (Herceptin) as first- or second-line therapy in women with metastatic,
           inflammatory, or locally advanced breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior anthracycline therapy (yes vs no).

      Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour followed 30 minutes later by
      trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment continues every
      21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed for at least 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
