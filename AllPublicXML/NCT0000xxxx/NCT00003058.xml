      Troglitazone may help liposarcoma cells develop into normal cells. This was a single arm,
      open-label study with a two-stage design to evaluate troglitazone in patients with
      liposarcoma stratified by histologic subtype.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the clinical activity of troglitazone in patients with malignant liposarcoma
      stratified by histologic subtype.

      II. To perform correlative imaging, biological, and biochemical testing of patients in order
      to define the degree to which in vivo terminal differentiation may be promoted by this
      therapeutic intervention.

      III. To evaluate the tolerance and safety of troglitazone in this patient population.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      Initially, 14 patients of each of the 5 histologic subtypes of liposarcoma will be accrued.
      If 1 or more patients show evidence of biological response, an additional 16 patients of each
      subtype will be accrued for a total of 30 patients per subtype. If 4 or more of 30 patients
      achieve biological response then troglitazone will be deemed promising in that histologic
      subtype.
