      RATIONALE: Less intensive therapy may attain in the same results as intensive therapy in
      children with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of less intensive therapy for
      children who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Confirm the previously found excellent survival for low-risk patients (Group A) with
           B-cell lymphoma/leukemia treated with the LMB 89 regimen.

        -  Verify that good event-free survival is retained in intermediate-risk patients (Group B)
           when the dose of cyclophosphamide (CTX) or the number of CTX-containing regimens is
           reduced.

        -  Verify that good event-free survival is retained in high-risk patients (Group C) despite
           reduction in doses during consolidation therapy and a reduced number of maintenance
           courses, and, for patients with CNS involvement, additional intravenous and intrathecal
           methotrexate in place of cranial irradiation.

        -  Monitor survival and event-free survival of all patients registered prior to the first
           chemotherapy course.

        -  Compare the survival and event-free survival of Group C patients with CNS involvement
           against results from those treated on the LMB 89 study.

        -  Compare event-free survival and survival of patients with large cell and Burkitt's and
           Burkitt's-like lymphoma.

        -  Monitor the long-term toxicity in patients treated on this study, including fertility,
           cardiotoxicity, and secondary malignancy.

        -  Characterize further the biology of childhood small non-cleaved cell lymphoma with
           respect to drug resistance (i.e., topoisomerase II and MDR activity), viral association
           (i.e., Epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, human herpesvirus 6), and
           specific breakpoint translocations (i.e., IgH and C-myc) per companion study CCG-B944.

        -  Characterize further the biology of childhood mature B-cell lymphoma per UKCCSG studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to participating group
      (UKCCSG vs SFOP vs CCG), histology (large cell vs small non-cleaved cell), risk group (Group
      A vs Group B vs Group C). Stage III Group B patients are further stratified according to
      Murphy stage (stages I/II vs III vs III/IV) and by LDH (less than twice normal vs twice
      normal or higher). Group C patients are further stratified based on presence of CNS disease
      (yes vs no).

      Patients with resected stage I and resected abdominal-only stage II disease are treated on
      the Group A Regimen. Patients with unresected stage I/II, stage III, or CNS-negative stage IV
      disease with fewer than 25% blasts in bone marrow are treated on the Group B Regimen.
      Patients with 25% or more blasts in bone marrow or with CNS involvement (i.e., L3 blasts in
      CSF, cranial nerve palsy, clinical spinal cord compression, isolated intracerebral mass, or
      parameningeal cranial or spinal extension) are treated on the Group C Regimen.

           COPADM 2 according to the same schedule as in COPADM 1 in Induction 1 except CTX is
           increased. G-CSF is administered as in the Group A Regimen. Patients receive MTX IT and

           ARA-C IT on day 7.

        -  Response is assessed upon recovery with resection of residual masses. If histology is
           negative patients proceed to a second course of CYM. If histology is positive patients
           proceed to CYVE on arm I of the Group C Regimen.

           receive COPADM 1 as in COPADM 1 in Induction 1 of the Group B Regimen except HD MTX IV
           is given over 4 hours on day 1. G-CSF is administered as in the Group A Regimen. TIT is
           given on days 2, 4, and 6. Patients receive COPADM 2 as in COPADM 2 in arm I of the
           Group B Regimen, Induction 2 except HD MTX IV is given over 4 hours on day 1. G-CSF is
           administered as in the Group A Regimen. Patients receive TIT on days 2, 4, and 6.

        -  Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms upon recovery and disease assessment:

      Arm I:

        -  Consolidation: Patients receive CYVE: ARA-C IV on days 1-5, and VP-16 IV over 2 hours on

           hours after starting MTX, and TIT prior to beginning CF.

        -  Response is assessed upon recovery with resection of residual masses. Patients with a
           complete response receive a second course of CYVE (no HD MTX/CF), beginning 1 week after
           HD MTX.

        -  Maintenance (28 days between courses):

             -  Course 1: Patients receive COPADM as in arm I Maintenance in the Group B Regimen,
                except HD MTX is administered as in Group C Induction, and TIT is given on day 2
                replacing MTX IT and HC.

             -  Course 2: Patients receive CYVE: ARA-C IV every 12 hours on days 1-5, and VP-16 IV

             -  Course 3: Patients receive COPAD as in Group B Induction 1, except CTX IV is
                administered over 30 minutes on days 1 and 2.

             -  Course 4: Patients receive treatment identical to Course 2.

      Arm II:

        -  Consolidation: Patients receive Mini-CYVE: ARA-C IV on days 1-5, and VP-16 IV over 1
           hour on days 2-5. G-CSF is administered as in the Group A Regimen. For patients with CNS
           disease: MTX IT and HC IT as in arm I in the Group C Regimen, and HD MTX, CF, and TIT as
           in arm I in the Group C Regimen.

        -  Response is assessed upon recovery with resection of residual masses. Patients with a
           complete response receive a second course of CYVE (no HD MTX and CF) beginning 1 week
           after HD MTX.

        -  Maintenance: Patients receive COPADM and TIT as in arm I of the Group C Regimen in
           Course 1 for 1 course only.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 6 months, every 6 months for 2.5 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 900 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
      Yearly accrual is expected to be 20 Group A patients, 115 Group B patients, and 45 Group C
      patients.
