  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the safety and effectiveness of itraconazole oral solution to placebo in the
      treatment of a pulmonary aspergilloma.

      Aspergilloma is a &quot;fungal ball&quot; in the lungs caused by Aspergillus. The infection can spread
      from the lungs through the blood to other organs. Aspergilloma can be life-threatening;
      therefore, an effective treatment is needed.
