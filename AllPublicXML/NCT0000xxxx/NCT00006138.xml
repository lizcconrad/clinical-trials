      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the frequency and severity of osteopenia and osteoporosis in patients with
      thalassemia major who undergo dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and correlate these findings
      with other relevant endocrinologic measurements.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo dual energy x-ray absorptiometry for bone density measurements, height
      (sitting and standing) and weight measurements, comprehensive endocrinologic examination, and
      assessment of the severity of iron overload at baseline, and then at years 1 and 2.
