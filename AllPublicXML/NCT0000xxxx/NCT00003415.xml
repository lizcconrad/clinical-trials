      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Chemoprotective drugs such as amifostine may protect normal cells
      from the side effects of chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of amifostine plus topotecan in treating
      patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the hematologic and cytogenetic response to treatment with amifostine
      plus topotecan in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. II. Evaluate the toxic effects of
      this treatment in these patients. III. Evaluate the effects of this treatment on bone marrow
      recovery in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of topotecan. Patients receive amifostine IV
      followed by topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 every 4-8 weeks for at least two
      courses. Patients who are responding after two courses of induction receive maintenance
      courses every 6-8 weeks for up to ten courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at each dose level of topotecan.
      The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 26 patients will be accrued for this study.
