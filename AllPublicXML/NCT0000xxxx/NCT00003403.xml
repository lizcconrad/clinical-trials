      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of GPX-100 in treating patients who have
      solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of GPX-100 in outpatients with incurable,
      solid tumors who are not candidates for effective systemic therapy. II. Evaluate and quantify
      the toxicity of GPX-100 in this patient population. III. Identify any changes in disease
      status in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter, dose escalation study. Patients receive GPX-100
      IV once every 3 weeks. Patients receive 2 courses of treatment in the absence of disease
      progression or dose limiting toxicity. Treatment may continue for up to 6 courses (4 courses
      with prior doxorubicin) in patients with responding or non-progressing disease. One patient
      is entered at each of the first 3 dose levels. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are entered at
      subsequent dose levels. The maximum tolerated dose of GPX-100 is defined as the dose at which
      no more than 2 instances of dose limiting toxicity are observed in 6 patients.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
