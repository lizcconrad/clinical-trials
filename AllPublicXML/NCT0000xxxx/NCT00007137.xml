  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound to examine changes in
      tongue volume and blood circulation during tongue exercises that require the use of different
      tongue muscle movements and contractions. More information on the structure and function of
      the human tongue is needed to develop better treatments for people with certain diseases
      affecting speech and swallowing.

      Normal volunteers between 21 and 80 years old who live in the metropolitan Washington, D.C.,
      area may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a brief medical history
      and physical examination, including suitability for MRI testing, and a brief examination of
      tongue, lip and jaw movements.

      Participants will undergo ultrasound and MRI studies. During both tests, they will perform
      tongue exercises, such as holding a soft round object on the tongue or exerting tongue
      pressure against the back of the throat or roof of the mouth.

      During the ultrasound, the subject lies on a flattened dental chair. A small transducer is
      placed under the chin to take images of the tongue during the exercises. A thin rubber strip
      with air-filled pressure bulbs is attached to the roof of the mouth (with dental adhesive) to
      measure tongue pressure.

      For the MRI, the subject lies on a table that slides inside a donut's machine containing a
      magnetic field. MRI coils-special padded sensors that improve image quality-are placed around
      the head and neck. A pressure cuff placed around the arm measures blood pressure. The subject
      wears earplugs to muffle loud thumping noises that occur during electrical switching of the
      magnetic fields. The subject is in constant visual contact with the researchers and MR
      technologist and may request to stop the study at any time.

      Participants may undergo another procedure, called magnetic resonance diffusion tensor
      imaging, to examine how the fluid (water) in the tongue tissue shifts during tongue
      maneuvers. This procedure is essentially the same as the first MRI study, but two small round
      coils are placed in the mouth (one on each side) between the cheeks and the teeth.

      As an organ unparalleled in anatomical architecture, the tongue has the versatility to effect
      regional deformations and positional changes with multiple potential degrees of freedom.
      Despite an abundance of studies on the tongue and its functions, as well as numerous proposed
      tongue models over the years, much of the anatomical and biomechanical details of the in vivo
      human tongue remain poorly understood. Physiologically based biomechanical modeling of the
      tongue in swallowing is the ultimate objective of this protocol. However, before such
      modeling can be accurately pursued, a substantial database must be established, and several
      important, unaddressed issues regarding lingual anatomy and biomechanics must be resolved.
      These issues include: (1) the compressibility of the human tongue and its common, yet
      untested, reference as a muscular hydrostat; (2) task induced interactions between lingual
      musculature and vasculature and region-specific vascular demands; (3) changes in lingual
      fiber orientation, length, and strain distribution as a function of contraction tasks; and
      (4) effects of normal aging, disease processes, and task training on lingual myoarchitecture
      as well as the integration between structure and function. Using advanced 3D MRI, Doppler
      ultrasonography, and other MR imaging techniques (e.g., tagged MRI, diffusion tensor MRI),
      this protocol proposes to quantitatively address these issues and contribute to a better
      understanding of the functional biomechanical as well as myoarchitectural intricacies of the
      in vivo human tongue.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Volunteers must:

          1. be older than 21 years in age;

          2. reside in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C. Area;

          3. have no speech, swallowing, respiratory, or cardiac problems;

          4. be able to hold breath for at least 20-30 seconds;

          5. be in good general health;

          6. not be pregnant or nursing;

          7. not be on medications that would adversely affect blood pressure, circulation,
             pulmonary function, speech, or swallowing ability.

        Patients must:

          1. be older than 21 years in age;
