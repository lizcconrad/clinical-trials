      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to explore how the brain changes
      (reorganizes itself) in response to learning and to brain lesions in healthy people and
      people with various physical disabilities.

      Normal volunteers and patients with disabilities including blindness, limb amputation,
      hemispherectomy (removal of a cerebral hemisphere), and stroke may be eligible for this
      study. Candidates will be screened with medical and neurological examinations.

      Participants will have MRI scans while they lie still or perform certain movements, as
      instructed. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves instead of X-rays to show
      structural and chemical changes in tissues. During the scan, the subject lies on a table in a
      narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. He or she can speak with a staff member through
      an intercom system at all times during the procedure. All participants will first have a scan
      to show brain structure, which will take about 30 minutes. A second scan will measure blood
      flow or biochemical concentration and will take from 1 to 2 1/2 hours.

      Depending on their disability, patients will participate in one of the following tests:

        -  Blindness-This will study the ability of blind people to process tactile information.

        -  Stroke- This will study mechanisms underlying recovery of motor function after stroke.
           The patient will perform voluntary movements or remain still during the scan.

        -  Amputation- This will study mechanisms underlying the ability of the brain to reorganize
           after amputation. The patient will move different parts of the body or remain still
           during the scan.

        -  Hemispherectomy- This will study mechanisms underlying the ability of one side of the
           brain to control movements of both arms. The patient will make different kinds of
           movements during the scan.

      Normal volunteers will participate in one of the following tests:

        -  Use-dependent plasticity- This will evaluate the effectiveness of amphetamine and
           placebo in demonstrating brain flexibility. The volunteer will take an amphetamine or
           placebo (inactive pill) before the scan and then perform a specific exercise using the
           thumb.

        -  Motor fatigue- This will study the mechanisms that underlie fatigue, which affect many
           patients with neurological conditions. The volunteer will contract muscles in the
           forearm and hand for several minutes until he or she feels fatigue.

        -  Light deprivation- This will evaluate changes in the brain that occur after light
           deprivation. The volunteer will remain at rest in the scanner for up to 150 minutes.

        -  Somatosensory stimulation-This will examine whether stimulation of the wrist can cause
           changes in hand representation in the part of the brain that controls movement. The
           volunteer will make hand movements at different times during the test. In addition, mild
           electric shocks will be delivered to the wrist for up to 2 hours. Although the shock
           intensity is regulated to avoid pain, there may be some discomfort.

      The purpose of this protocol is to investigate plastic changes in human cerebral cortex in
      health and disease. The overall hypothesis is that it is possible to identify neuroimaging
      patterns reflecting reorganization in the human cerebral cortex using fMRI and that it is
      possible to obtain information on the mechanisms underlying some of these plastic changes by
      using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of GABA. This information is potentially
      important for the understanding of mechanisms of cortical reorganization operating in humans.
      Patients and normal volunteers will be scanned at rest and during performance of different
      tasks. These studies should provide new information on mechanisms of human plasticity. The
      MRI techniques used for that purpose are functional MRI (fMRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and
      conventional MRI with magnets between 1.5 and 4 tesla.

        Patients must be able to give informed consent.

        Patients recruited would come from those referred to the Human Cortical Physiology Section
        who would have distinct neurological syndromes from well-defined peripheral and central
        nervous system lesions including stroke, hemipherectomy, and amputation.

        Healthy adults without history of neurological disease.

        Pregnant women will be excluded.
