    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or
      deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy and chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell
      transplantation may be an effective treatment for metastatic prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy plus
      chemotherapy followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have
      metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y90 monoclonal antibody m170
           administered with paclitaxel and cyclosporine followed by autologous peripheral blood
           stem cell transplantation in patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate
           cancer.

        -  Determine the preliminary efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody
      m170 (Y90 MOAB m170). Patients are assigned to one of four cohorts.

      After the first occurrence of hematologic dose-limiting toxicity in a patient, all subsequent
      patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning 4 days prior to undergoing
      apheresis and continuing until 6 million CD34+ cells/kg are collected. After 2 patients in a
      cohort group experience hematologic dose-limiting toxicity, subsequent patients undergo
      autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation.

        -  Cohort I: Patients receive unlabeled monoclonal antibody (MOAB) m170 IV over 5 minutes
           followed by a tracer dose of indium In 111 monoclonal antibody m170 (In111 MOAB m170) IV
           over 5-10 minutes on day 0 and unlabeled MOAB m170 IV followed by Y90 MOAB m170 IV on
           day 7. Patients also receive oral cyclosporine every 12 hours on days -3 to 25. Patients
           may undergo autologous PBSC transplantation on day 21 and receive G-CSF SC daily
           beginning on day 21 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Cohort II: Patients receive treatment as in cohort I. Patients also receive paclitaxel
           IV over 3 hours on day 9.

        -  Cohort III and IV: Patients receive treatment as in cohort I without In111 MOAB m170.
           Patients also receive paclitaxel as in cohort II.

      Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB m170 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6
      months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 36 months.
