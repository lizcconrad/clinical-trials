      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether release of endogenous growth hormone (GH)-releasing hormone
      is involved in GH responses to clonidine, pyridostigmine, levodopa, arginine, GH-releasing
      peptide, insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and exercise in patients with acromegaly.

      II. Determine whether endogenous GH-releasing hormone influences the maintenance of GH
      hypersecretion.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Growth hormone-releasing hormone antagonist (GHRH-A) is administered to
      volunteers and followed with 1 of these challenges: insulin, clonidine, pyridostigmine,
      arginine, levodopa, growth hormone-releasing peptide, or exercise. Tests are repeated with
      normal saline as the control; the order of administration (control vs. pharmacologic
      stimulation) is randomly assigned.

      Patients receive GHRH-A (dose determined in volunteer study), thyrotropin-releasing hormone,
      and growth-releasing hormone.

      All stimulation tests follow an overnight fast.
