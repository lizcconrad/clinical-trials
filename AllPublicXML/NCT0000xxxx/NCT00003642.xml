      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining more than one drug and combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy combined with
      fluorouracil and cisplatin in treating patients who have stage II or stage III bladder
      cancer, and who have undergone transurethral resection.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the rate of severe acute toxicity occurring during therapy with
      accelerated external radiotherapy with concurrent fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin following
      transurethral resection of the bladder in patients with stage II or III muscle invasive
      transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. II. Evaluate the rate of freedom from local
      recurrence to this combined therapy assessed 3 months after the end of treatment in these
      patients. III. Assess the feasibility of this new therapeutic approach in this patient
      population. IV. Determine the overall recurrent free survival, long term side effects, and
      overall survival in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients undergo accelerated external
      radiotherapy twice daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Concurrent chemotherapy is administered
      on the first and fifth week consisting of cisplatin IV over 2 hours daily and fluorouracil by
      24 hour continuous infusion daily on days 1-5. Patients are followed at 3 months, then every
      3 months for the first 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 19-43 patients accrued into this study.
