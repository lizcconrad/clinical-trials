      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Based on anti-HIV-1 screening of a repository of 200,000 blood donor sera collected in late
      1984, the Transfusion Safety Study identified and enrolled into ongoing followup 133
      seropositive donors and 111 HIV-1-infected transfusion recipients. Included among these were
      38 'transmission clusters' composed of a donor and from one to six linked, infected
      recipient(s), and, in four cases, infected recipients' sexual partners. Frozen cells and sera
      collected at six-month intervals over a six-year period from members of these clusters were
      available for study. Specimens were accessed such that sub-repositories of cellular DNA,
      PCR-amplified HIV-1 sequences, and viral isolates were generated for future investigations of
      these unique clusters. The studies included analysis of sequence diversity in envelope (env)
      V3, V4, and V5 hypervariable regions both within each infected individual over time, and
      between different members of each cluster and different clusters. Sequence diversity profiles
      from PBMC and serum were analyzed separately to discern differences in these different blood
      components at each sampling and over time. The pattern of turnover of specific sequence
      variants over time (evolution of viral genotypes) was correlated with clinical and
      immunological progression.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
