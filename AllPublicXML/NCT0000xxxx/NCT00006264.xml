      RATIONALE: Antiviral drugs such as zidovudine and ganciclovir act against viruses and may be
      an effective treatment for HIV. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to
      kill lymphoma cells. Combining these treatments may be effective in treating AIDS-related
      primary central nervous system lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining zidovudine, ganciclovir, and
      interleukin-2 in treating patients who have AIDS-related primary central nervous system
      lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of zidovudine, interleukin-2, and ganciclovir in
           patients with AIDS related primary central nervous system lymphoma.

        -  Determine the response rate and overall survival of these patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive zidovudine (AZT) IV and ganciclovir IV over 1 hour
           every 12 hours on days 1-14. Patients also receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV every 12
           hours on days 1-14 and a combination antiretroviral therapy consisting of nucleoside
           reverse transcriptase inhibitors (one of which must be AZT), nonnucleoside reverse
           transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors. AZT and ganciclovir treatment
           continues for an additional 7 days if partial response is achieved.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive IL-2 subcutaneously 3 times a week for 6 months.
           Patients also receive oral ganciclovir 3 times a day and combination antiretroviral
           therapy (AZT allowed, but not required). Treatment continues in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
