  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and effectiveness of intravenous spiramycin in patients with
      AIDS-related cryptosporidial diarrhea.

      Spiramycin, a macrolide antibiotic, has been studied in the United States for the treatment
      of cryptosporidial diarrhea. Some reports suggest that spiramycin is useful in improving the
      symptoms of cryptosporidial diarrhea in some patients. Results of one study, however, showed
      no significant difference between spiramycin and placebo (inactive medication). A later study
      indicated that the absorption of spiramycin is significantly decreased when food is present.
      Thus, the results of the trial may have been due to poor absorption of spiramycin.

      Spiramycin, a macrolide antibiotic, has been studied in the United States for the treatment
      of cryptosporidial diarrhea. Some reports suggest that spiramycin is useful in improving the
      symptoms of cryptosporidial diarrhea in some patients. Results of one study, however, showed
      no significant difference between spiramycin and placebo (inactive medication). A later study
      indicated that the absorption of spiramycin is significantly decreased when food is present.
      Thus, the results of the trial may have been due to poor absorption of spiramycin.

      Patients are observed for 3 days to establish baseline conditions. They are informed that the
      treatment period is 21 days during which they receive 15 days of spiramycin and 6 consecutive
      days of placebo; they are not told which 6-day period they receive placebo. All patients
      receive 15 days of spiramycin. Patients who do not have a favorable response are treated with
      a higher dose of spiramycin for an additional 15 days. Responders at either dose are followed
      weekly for 4 weeks. Should a relapse occur, patients receive an additional 15 days of
      therapy, at the dose of spiramycin that initially produced a response, following
      reestablishment of a baseline with 6 days of placebo. Nonresponders to the higher dose are
      taken off the study.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Vitamin supplements.

          -  Zidovudine (AZT) for patients previously taking AZT. However, dosing with spiramycin
             should be delayed until the dose of AZT has stabilized. The dose may be decreased for
             AZT-associated toxicity.

        Allowed for diarrhea:

          -  Loperamide hydrochloride capsules (2 mg) or loperamide hydrochloride liquid (1 mg/5
             ml).

        Allowed for nausea:

          -  Sucralfate and metoclopramide hydrochloride.

        Allowed for vomiting:

          -  Prochlorperazine and trimethobenzamide hydrochloride.

          -  Allowed as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP):

          -  Aerosolized pentamidine.

        Patients must have:

          -  A diagnosis of AIDS according to the CDC.

          -  Chronic diarrhea.

          -  Presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in stool specimen. Patients or a legally
             authorized representative must sign an informed consent form. Diet will be lactose
             free, maximum 7 g fat/day with unlimited calorie intake. Patients who require total

          -  Known sensitivity to macrolide antibiotics.

          -  Presence of other diarrhea-causing pathogens.

          -  Active opportunistic infection requiring systemic antimicrobial therapy.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:
