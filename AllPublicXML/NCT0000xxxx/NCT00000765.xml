  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of early treatment with zidovudine for preventing a
      decline in CD4+ lymphocyte counts in patients with primary HIV infection. To determine the
      natural history of virologic and immunologic changes in primary HIV infection.

      Previous studies indicate that intervention with zidovudine during primary HIV infection
      could reduce the initial viral burden and subsequent decline in immune functions, and could
      prolong not only the time to development of AIDS but also the time to initiation of chronic
      antiretroviral therapy.

      Previous studies indicate that intervention with zidovudine during primary HIV infection
      could reduce the initial viral burden and subsequent decline in immune functions, and could
      prolong not only the time to development of AIDS but also the time to initiation of chronic
      antiretroviral therapy.

      Patients are randomized to receive either zidovudine or placebo daily for 24 weeks. Patients
      are followed until development of an AIDS-related opportunistic infection or malignancy.
      After week 24, patients meeting standard prescribing criteria may start FDA-approved anti-HIV
      therapies. After study week 48, patients may co-enroll on another clinical trial to receive
      experimental therapy.
