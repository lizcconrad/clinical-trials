      To make intravenous (IV) ganciclovir available to immunocompromised patients with
      life-threatening or sight-threatening Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, where the symptoms of
      the disease are too severe to allow admission to a controlled clinical study of ganciclovir
      therapy. To determine the safety and tolerance of 2 - 3 weeks induction course of ganciclovir
      IV followed by a maintenance course of ganciclovir IV for an indefinite duration. To tabulate
      the patient's clinical response.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease who meet the criteria for a treatment IND protocol, or
             other clinical studies, including controlled clinical studies of anticytomegalovirus
             therapy in peripheral CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS.

          -  Mild to moderate CMV infections who fail to meet the severity criteria. CMV syndrome
             (i.e., cytopenia, increased liver enzymes, fever, viremia, viruria) is not considered
             immediately life-threatening.

          -  Transplant patients in whom trial reduction of immunosuppressive drug treatment is
             feasible.

          -  Children with congenital or neonatal CMV where there is not a documented primary or
             acquired immunodeficiency.

          -  Hypersensitivity to acyclovir or ganciclovir.

          -  Receiving antimetabolite treatment that cannot be discontinued.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Antimetabolites.

          -  Alkylating agents.

          -  Nucleoside analogs (topical ophthalmics are permitted).

          -  Interferon.

          -  Foscarnet.

          -  Cytokines.

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection who meet the criteria for a treatment IND protocol, or
             other clinical studies, including controlled clinical studies of anticytomegalovirus
             therapy in peripheral CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS.

          -  Mild to moderate CMV infections who fail to meet the severity criteria. CMV syndrome
             (i.e., cytopenia, increased liver enzymes, fever, viremia, viruria) is not considered
             immediately life-threatening.

          -  Transplant patients in whom trial reduction of immunosuppressive drug treatment is
             feasible.

          -  Children with congenital or neonatal CMV where there is not a documented primary or
             acquired immunodeficiency.

          -  Hypersensitivity to acyclovir or ganciclovir.

          -  Receiving antimetabolite treatment that cannot be discontinued.

        Patients must qualify as follows:

          -  Previously enrolled in compassionate use study (ICM 1257/1257A) or have terminated
             from another Syntex ganciclovir study.

          -  Diagnosis of AIDS and life-threatening Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.

          -  Diagnosis of other immunodeficiencies other than AIDS, with life-threatening or
             sight-threatening CMV disease.
