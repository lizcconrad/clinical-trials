      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. It is not yet known if topotecan is more effective given by
      infusion or by mouth.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of topotecan given by
      infusion with that of topotecan given by mouth in treating patients who have small cell lung
      cancer that has relapsed following previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the response rate, response duration, time to response, time to
      progression, and survival of patients with relapsed limited or extensive stage small cell
      lung cancer treated with oral vs intravenous topotecan. II. Compare the qualitative and
      quantitative toxicities of these treatment regimens in this patient population. III. Compare
      the quality of life in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to gender,
      liver metastases (yes vs no), and duration of response to prior chemotherapy (6 months or
      less vs greater than 6 months). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I:
      Patients receive topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Arm II: Patients receive topotecan
      orally on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients experiencing complete or partial response continue until progression or for at least
      2 courses past maximal response. Patients with stable disease should receive at least 4
      courses. Quality of life is assessed Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
