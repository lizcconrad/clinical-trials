      RATIONALE: Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by
      stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells in the cervix.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-12 in treating patients who
      have advanced or recurrent cancer of the cervix.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rates, duration of response, and survival in women with
      advanced, recurrent, or inoperable cervical cancer treated with interleukin-12. II. Determine
      the toxic effects of systemic interleukin-12 in these patients. III. Correlate response to
      therapy and survival with the presence or absence of human papilloma virus (HPV), and the
      specific subtype of HPV, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients
      receive induction interleukin-12 IV over 5-20 seconds on day -13 and then daily on days 1-5.
      Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years,
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 78 patients (39 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 26 months.
