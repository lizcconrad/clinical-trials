      This 27-week double-blind, placebo controlled treatment is designed to evaluate
      dextroamphetamine sulfate (sustained release) as an adjunct in concurrent cocaine and opiate
      dependent patients. All subjects will receive methadone. For the treatment of cocaine
      dependence, subjects will receive one of 2 doses of dextroamphetamine (15 or 30mg) or
      placebo. After 4 weeks of treatment the dose level of dextroamphetamine is doubled (30 or
      60mg). This dose is maintained for 20 weeks; during which subjects attend twice weekly visits
      to the clinic and receive weekly cognitive behavioral therapy. Follow up evaluations will be
      conducted out to 3 months post treatment. Subjects will be assisted in transferring to
      Houston area methadone clinics to maintain treatment for opiate dependence following
      treatment completion.
