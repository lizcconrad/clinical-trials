  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the possible relationship between silicone implants or injections and
      the connective tissue diseases scleroderma and myositis. It will explore whether certain
      factors in the blood or the immune system or other factors are involved in the development of
      these diseases following silicone implantation or injection.

      Men and women 18 years of age and older who meet the following criteria may be eligible for
      this study:

      Group 1-Patients who have had silicone implants or injections and who later developed
      scleroderma or myositis

      Group 2-Patients with scleroderma or myositis who have not had silicone implants or
      injections

      Group 3-Healthy volunteers who have had silicone implants or injections and did not develop
      symptoms or other medical features of connective tissue disorders.

      Participants will have a thorough history and physical examination, blood and urine tests,
      chest X-ray and lung function tests. In addition, patients will complete a questionnaire
      about their procedure (including information such as the types of implanted devices and
      injections, reason for the procedure, post-operative complications, other illnesses or
      medical conditions present before and after the procedure, etc.).

      This multicenter study will attempt to determine the epidemiologic, clinical, serologic and
      immunogenetic factors associated with patients who develop scleroderma/systemic sclerosis
      after silicone prosthesis implantation or silicone injection. This will be accomplished by
      comparing these patients to groups of appropriately matched patients with idiopathic
      scleroderma/systemic sclerosis without silicone exposure, and appropriately matched
      volunteers who have received similar silicone implants or injections and have not developed
      symptoms, physical examination findings, or laboratory abnormalities associated with
      autoimmune/connective tissue diseases. Patient and physician questionnaires will be
      self-administered, and will collect data regarding: the number and types of implanted
      silicone devices or injections; the indications for and nature of the surgical procedures;
      peri- and post-operative complications; initial and subsequent clinical presentations; and
      therapy and clinical course of the patients. Routine clinical tests and immunologic
      laboratory evaluations will be performed. Also, studies will be conducted on the proportion
      of circulating activated lymphocytes and levels of soluble mediators of inflammation
      (cytokines, sIL-2R, sCD4, sCD8, TNF), the types of HLA and T cell receptor genes present in
      the patients, and the presence and titers of anti-silicone antibodies and autoantibodies.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        For all groups: Age greater than 18 years; ability to give informed consent.

        Must not have severe medical disease requiring intensive care or any other conditions in
        which the drawing of the amount of blood required for research purposes is not deemed
        medically appropriate by the treating physician or the principal investigator.

        For Group 1: Patients who have had silicon prostheses, or silicone injection, who
        subsequently developed scleroderma/systemic sclerosis or myositis as defined by criteria
        established by the American College of Rheumatology.

        For Group 2: Patients with idiopathic scleroderma/systemic sclerosis or myositis as defined
        by criteria established by the American Collage of Rheumatology, without silicone
        implantation or injection, age-, sex-, and race-matched to Group 1.

        Group 3: Patients who have had silicone prostheses or silicone injection, age-, sex-, race-
        and silicone exposure-matched to patients in Group 1, who have not developed chronic
        symptoms, physical findings, or laboratory abnormalities associated with autoimmune or
        connective tissue diseases.
