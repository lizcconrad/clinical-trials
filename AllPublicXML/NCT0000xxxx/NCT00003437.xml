      RATIONALE: Hormone therapy may stop the growth of cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy
      use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining
      hormone therapy with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known which
      hormone therapy and chemotherapy regimen is most effective for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of different steroid therapy
      and chemotherapy regimens in treating children who have acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the effects of oral prednisolone vs oral dexamethasone on remission rate,
           event-free survival, and overall survival of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

        -  Compare the effect of oral mercaptopurine (MP) vs oral thioguanine (TG) on remission
           rate, event-free survival, and overall survival of this patient population.

        -  Assess the effect of a schedule concentrating on tight control of maintenance therapy,
           compensating where necessary for constitutional drug resistance and avoiding poor
           physician or patient compliance, on event-free survival of these patients.

        -  Compare the pharmacokinetics of MP and TG in these patients.

        -  Collect data on the presence or absence of minimal residual disease in serial bone
           marrow samples to assess its clinical importance.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized twice during the
      study: prednisolone vs dexamethasone and mercaptopurine vs thioguanine. Patients are
      initially stratified according to risk status (standard vs intermediate vs high). Patients
      are stratified at the second randomization according to gender, age (under 2 years vs 2 to 9
      years vs over 9 years), WBC (under 50,000/mm^3 vs over 50,000/mm^3), steroid allocation, and
      early response (slow vs rapid).

      Patients with verified CNS disease receive weekly intrathecal (IT) methotrexate until 2
      consecutive clear cerebrospinal fluid samples have been obtained. Cranial radiotherapy is
      administered over 15-21 days during weeks 5-8 concurrently with methotrexate IT in the
      appropriate regimen. Following radiotherapy, these patients receive monthly methotrexate IT
      for 1 year and then every 3 months until the end of therapy.

      Patients with testicular infiltration receive additional radiation fractions daily for 12
      days to both testes during weeks 5-8.

      Regimen A (standard-risk patients)
