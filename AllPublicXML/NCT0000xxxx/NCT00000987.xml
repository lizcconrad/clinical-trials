  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combined chemotherapy when it is
      administered to patients with advanced Kaposi's sarcoma together with one of two different
      doses of zidovudine (AZT).

      The combination of AZT and chemotherapy may be effective in treating the tumor as well as
      preventing the life-threatening infections when used for patients with AIDS and Kaposi's
      sarcoma. The MTD of combined chemotherapy is being determined so that the information will be
      available for future studies, when the relative effectiveness of the two doses of AZT has
      been learned.

      The combination of AZT and chemotherapy may be effective in treating the tumor as well as
      preventing the life-threatening infections when used for patients with AIDS and Kaposi's
      sarcoma. The MTD of combined chemotherapy is being determined so that the information will be
      available for future studies, when the relative effectiveness of the two doses of AZT has
      been learned.

      AMENDED: AZT by mouth. If the treatment is well tolerated, subsequent groups of patients are
      started on increasing doses of doxorubicin combined with the same dose of bleomycin and
      vincristine. After determination of the MTD of chemotherapy in combination with AZT, the 2nd
      phase begins in which AZT is given and the first group of patients is given bleomycin and
      vincristine only. If this combination is well tolerated, then the subsequent groups are
      started on increasing doses of doxorubicin with the same dose of bleomycin, vincristine and
      AZT. The MTD of chemotherapy in combination with AZT is then determined. Patients achieving
      maximum response to the tumor are maintained on AZT alone. This is an outpatient study, and
      patients are seen every 2 weeks for evaluation, with a physical examination every month.
      Original design: The combination of chemotherapy and AZT is given to groups of four patients
      each, the first group beginning with bleomycin and vincristine, without the addition of
      doxorubicin. The chemotherapy is given intravenously every 2 weeks. This is combined first
      with AZT by mouth.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Medication for grades 1 and 2 oral toxicity. Antiemetic agents, except steroids, for
             gastrointestinal toxicity. Toxicity grades according to NIAID Recommendations for
             Grading of Acute and Subacute Toxic Effects (Adults).

        Patients must demonstrate any of the following clinical and laboratory findings:

          -  25 or more mucocutaneous lesions with or without lymphedema.

          -  Progressive Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) with 10 or more new lesions in the month prior to
             study entry or visceral involvement.

          -  Oral mucosal lesion(s) requiring therapy.

          -  Prior history of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) or Mycobacterium avium
             intracellulare.

        Patients with any of the following constitutional symptoms with no etiology established may
        be included:

          -  Temperature &gt; 38 degrees C and/or drenching night sweats for more than 1 month.

          -  Watery diarrhea (= or &gt; 3 stools/day) for 2 or more weeks.

          -  Weight loss &gt; 10 percent of normal. Patients with carcinoma in situ of the cervix or
             localized squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin may be included.

        Active alcohol or drug abuse sufficient to prevent adequate compliance with study therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following conditions will be excluded:

          -  Peripheral sensory or motor neuropathy.

          -  Opportunistic infections requiring therapy.

          -  Significant pulmonary (exertional dyspnea with minimal exercise) or cardiac
             insufficiency (New York Heart Association, status &gt; 2).

          -  Serious neuropsychiatric illness which would prevent informed consent of intensive
             treatment.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Any drugs causing anemia, neutropenia, or significant risk of nephrotoxicity. Patients
             with a history of other systemic malignancies or lymphomas, except carcinoma in situ
             of the cervix or localized squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, will be
             excluded from the study.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Systemic antineoplastic chemotherapy.

          -  Excluded within 30 days of study entry:

          -  Any other investigational therapy.

          -  Antiretroviral agents (zidovudine, ribavirin).

          -  Immunomodulating agents (steroids, interferons, naltrexone, isoprinosine, and
             interleukin-2).
