      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Antineoplastons are naturally occurring substances that may also be
      made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells. It is not yet
      known whether giving antineoplastons with chemotherapy is more effective than chemotherapy
      alone in treating women with refractory breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying methotrexate alone to see how well it
      works campared to methotrexate and antineoplaston therapy in treating postmenopausal women
      with advanced refractory breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the antitumor activity of antineoplaston A10 with methotrexate vs methotrexate
           alone, in terms of objective tumor response, in women with advanced breast cancer.

        -  Compare the adverse effects of and tolerance to these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gradually escalating doses of oral antineoplaston A10 capsules 7
           times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached, followed by oral methotrexate
           capsules 2 to 3 times per day in five days on and five days off courses. Treatment
           continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral methotrexate alone on the same schedule as in arm I.

      Tumors are measured every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for years 3 and 4, and then
      annually for years 5 and 6.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-70 patients will be accrued for this study within at least
      12 months.
