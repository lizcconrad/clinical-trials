      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as ABX-EGF can locate tumor cells and either kill them
      or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF in treating
      patients who have either renal (kidney), prostate, pancreatic, non-small cell lung, colon,
      rectal, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety of monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF in patients with renal, prostate,
           pancreatic, non-small cell lung, colorectal, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction
           cancer.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and the dose-response relationship of this drug in this
           patient population.

        -  Evaluate the clinical effect of this drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF IV over 1 hour once weekly on weeks 0-3*
      (enrollment for the weekly dosing schedule completed as of 4/21/03 [with the exception of
      patients undergoing full pharmacokinetic analyses, described below]) OR once every 2 weeks on
      weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6* OR once every 3 weeks on weeks 0, 3, 6, and 9*. Patients undergoing
      full pharmacokinetic analyses receive a loading dose on week 0 and the subsequent 3 doses on
      weeks 3-5.

      NOTE: *All patients receive a total of 4 doses.

      Cohorts of 2-8 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which at least 2 or 3 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 5 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 76 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately
      14 months.
