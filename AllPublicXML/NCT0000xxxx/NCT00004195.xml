      RATIONALE: Eniluracil may increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy by blocking tumor
      enzymes that break down chemotherapy drugs.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of eniluracil followed by
      surgery in treating patients who have primary or metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the enzymatic activity of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), normal mucosa, or normal liver in patients with
      primary or metastatic colorectal cancer. II. Evaluate the ability of eniluracil to inactivate
      DPD in the tumor, PBMCs, and normal tissue in this patient population. III. Assess DPD
      recovery and uracil levels in PBMCs following surgical resection in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo controlled study. Patients are stratified according to
      colorectal tumor (primary vs metastatic). Patients are randomized into one of two treatment
      arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral eniluracil twice daily on days -2 and -1 followed by
      surgical resection and tissue harvest on day 0. Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo as
      in arm I followed by surgical resection and tissue harvest on day 0. Patients are followed
      weekly for 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients (10 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.

    <description>To see if at standard clinical doses are capable of inhibiting DPD in Primary and metastatic colorectal cancer in vivo. Since one of the mechanisms of 5-FU(Fluorouracil) tumor resistance is overexpression of DPD,effective inactivation DPD in tumors by eniluracil in this study will be supportive of the use of eniluracil to overcome this type of 5-FU(Fluorouracil) resistance</description>
