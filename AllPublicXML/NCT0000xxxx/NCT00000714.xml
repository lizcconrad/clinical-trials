      To determine the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug therapy (trimetrexate
      plus leucovorin calcium (TMTX / LCV)) in the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
      (PCP) in patients who have AIDS, are HIV positive, or are at high risk for HIV infection, and
      who have suffered severe or life-threatening ill effects from both conventional therapies for
      PCP. AMENDED: 08/01/90 As of August 31, 1989, 437 patients were enrolled into uncontrolled
      studies of trimetrexate for PCP:214 in TX 301/ACTG 0=039 (trimetrexate for patients
      intolerant of approved therapies) and 223 in NS 401 (trimetrexate for patients refractory to
      approved therapies). The analysis of overall response rate, stringently defined as having
      received at least 14 days of trimetrexate and being alive at follow-up 1 month after the
      completion of therapy, reveals 84/159 intolerant patients and 48/160 refractory patients had
      responded, for rates of 53 percent and 30 percent, respectively. These response rates include
      all individuals who received at least one dose of trimetrexate. Of the 111 patients who were
      ventilator-dependent at study entry, 18 completed a course of therapy and were alive a month
      later, for a response rate of 16 percent. All other ventilated patients died. The most common
      severe (grades 3 and 4) toxicities were: transaminase elevation (&gt; 5 x normal) in 94
      patients, anemia (&lt; 7.9 g/dl) in 109, neutropenia (&lt; 750 cells/mm3) in 58, fever (&gt; 40 C) in
      37, and thrombocytopenia (&lt; 50000 platelets/mm3) in 27. Toxicity required discontinuation of
      therapy in approximately 5 percent of all patients.

      Original design: The drugs usually used to treat PCP in AIDS patients, trimethoprim /
      sulfamethoxazole and pentamidine, have had to be discontinued in many patients because of
      severe side effects. Currently there are no proven alternatives to these drugs. TMTX was
      chosen for this trial because it was found to be very active against the PCP organism in
      laboratory tests. Also TMTX, in combination with LCV, had a high response rate and did not
      cause severe toxicity in a preliminary trial.

      AMENDED: 08/01/90 As of August 31, 1989, 437 patients were enrolled into uncontrolled studies

      Original design: The drugs usually used to treat PCP in AIDS patients, trimethoprim /
      sulfamethoxazole and pentamidine, have had to be discontinued in many patients because of
      severe side effects. Currently there are no proven alternatives to these drugs. TMTX was
      chosen for this trial because it was found to be very active against the PCP organism in
      laboratory tests. Also TMTX, in combination with LCV, had a high response rate and did not
      cause severe toxicity in a preliminary trial.

      Patients entered in the study are given TMTX for 21 days and LCV for 24 days. Doses are
      determined by body size. Both drugs are given by intravenous infusion, but LCV may be given
      orally after the first 10 days. It is essential to ensure that patients receive each and
      every dose of LCV and that LCV therapy is continued for a full 3 days after TMTX therapy has
      been completed or discontinued. Doses are adjusted if side effects, such as low white blood
      cell counts, are too severe. During the 21-day trial, zidovudine (AZT) may not be used,
      because of possible increased bone marrow toxicity. AZT may be resumed as soon as the
      administration of TMTX and LCV has been completed.
