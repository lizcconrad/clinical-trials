  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many women with lower abdominal pain have endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition in
      which the lining of the uterus (endometrium) is found outside of the uterus. The diagnosis of
      endometriosis is usually made at surgery. The treatment of endometriosis includes medical and
      surgical approaches alone or in combination. The hormone estrogen stimulates the growth of
      the endometrium and may also stimulate the growth of endometriosis. Medical therapies that
      act to decrease the level of estrogen can reduce the amount of endometriosis and pain. When
      therapies are discontinued, symptoms often return. In addition, medical treatment for
      endometriosis is expensive and is often associated with weak bones (osteoporosis) and hot
      flashes as a result of low levels of estrogen.

      Surgical treatment is removal or destruction of the endometriosis tissue. Studies show the
      pain from endometriosis is relieved longer with tissue removal than with destruction.

      This study was developed to see if surgery followed by daily doses of Raloxifene (Evista) is
      effective in reducing pain, for a longer time than surgery in combination with a placebo
      (inactive &quot;sugar pill&quot;) treatment. Raloxifene acts like estrogens in some tissues and not
      like estrogens in others. Postmenopausal women receiving Raloxifene for the prevention of
      osteoporosis had an increase in bone density and an improvement of their blood lipids (fat
      content in the blood). However, unlike estrogen, Raloxifene does not promote the growth of
      breast tissue or the uterus. If Raloxifene blocks estrogen action in the lining of the uterus
      (endometrium) of reproductive age women, as it does in post-menopausal women, it may also
      limit the growth of endometriosis and prevent the return of pain.

      Many women with pelvic pain have endometriosis, a condition in which tissue from the uterine
      lining (endometrium) is also outside the uterus. Endometriosis pain often returns after
      medical treatment is stopped. Surgical therapies have had varied success in reducing pain,
      with laparoscopic excision of implants one of the most effective methods. Raloxifene (Evista
      (Trademark), Lilly), has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in
      preventing bone loss in postmenopausal women. This compound has effects that are both similar
      to and different from those of the hormone estrogen. Unlike estrogen, raloxifene does not
      stimulate growth of the uterus or breast tissue in post-menopausal women. If raloxifene
      blocks estrogen action in the lining of the uterus (or endometrium) of reproductive age
      women, as it does in postmenopausal women, it may also limit growth of endometriosis and
      prevent the return of pain. This phase II randomized placebo-controlled study evaluates
      whether surgery followed by daily administration of raloxifene for six months reduces pain
      for a longer time than surgery alone.
