    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to establish the safest doses for the combination of a
      farnesyl transferase inhibitor, R115777 plus topotecan in patients with advanced solid
      tumors, previously treated or beyond standard therapy of clinical benefit. Maximum tolerated
      dose, dose limiting toxicity and the activity of this combination will be assessed.

      This chemotherapy regimen is a two-pronged attack at the way cancer cells replicate. R115777
      is a compound that may inhibit cancer cell growth by interfering with the p21 ras oncogene,
      while topotecan, a topoisomerase-1 inhibitor, works on cancer cells not subject to control by
      the ras oncogene. Animal studies suggest that the combination may be synergistic. Another
      advantage is that R115777 can be taken by mouth.
