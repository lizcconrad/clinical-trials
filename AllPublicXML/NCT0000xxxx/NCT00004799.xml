      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the safety and efficacy of acellular 2-component vs. acellular
      multicomponent vs. whole-cell pertussis vaccine vs. placebo in infants living in Sweden.

      II. Compare the relative protection of each vaccine against atypical or subclinical pertussis
      infection.

      III. Analyze possible laboratory correlates to vaccine protection.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by
      participating institution.

      The first group of infants receives a vaccine composed of inactivated pertussis toxin (iPT)
      and filamentous hemagglutin (FHA).

      The second group receives a vaccine containing iPT, FHA, pertactin, agglutinogen 2, and
      agglutinogen 3.

      The third group receives a whole-cell pertussis vaccine. The fourth group receives a
      diphtheria-tetanus vaccine as the control. All vaccines are given as an intramuscular
      injection, at 2-3, 4, and 6 months of age.

      Close surveillance of infants and families continues for 2-3 years.
