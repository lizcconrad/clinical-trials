  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine which of 2 doses of dapsone is effective prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii
      pneumonia (PCP) in patients with oral thrush or hairy leukoplakia and less than 400 CD4
      lymphocytes per mm3. To determine whether the long-term toxicities associated with daily
      dapsone in this population are tolerable.
