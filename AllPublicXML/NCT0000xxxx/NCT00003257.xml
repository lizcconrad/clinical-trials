      RATIONALE: Inserting the gene for p53 into a person's tumor may improve the body's ability to
      fight cancer or make the cancer more sensitive to chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gene therapy in treating patients who
      have recurrent head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the objective response rate of Ad5CMV-p53 in patients with recurrent
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. II. Evaluate the duration of response, time to
      disease progression, and overall survival of these patients after this treatment. III.
      Evaluate the effectiveness of Ad5CMV-p53 in reducing cancer morbidity (pain assessment,
      analgesic consumption, and Karnofsky performance status). IV. Assess the quality of life of
      these patients receiving this treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open label study. All patients receive direct intratumoral
      injections of Ad5CMV-p53 on days 1, 2, and 3 of each 4-week treatment course. Patients are
      treated for at least 2 courses barring local disease progression or unacceptable adverse
      events; patients with responding or stable disease receive a maximum of 12 courses. Patients
      are evaluated for safety 4 weeks from the completion of the last treatment. Quality of life
      is assessed before, during, and after treatment. Patients are followed every 2 months for up
      to 18 months or until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 39 patients will be accrued for this study.
