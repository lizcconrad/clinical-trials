  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research studies of early onset-obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette's
      syndrome have questioned whether autoimmunity could play a role in the development of these
      conditions. As a result, there has been an increased interest in the field of research on the
      potential involvement of autoimmunity in other psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia.

      Autoimmune conditions occur when the normal immune system of the body begins working against
      itself. The immune system recognizes cells as foreign and begins to attack them.

      There are several similarities between autoimmune diseases and schizophrenia. Genetics play
      some role in the development of both diseases. Both conditions show a similar course, and
      both conditions tend to show worsening of symptoms when exposed to stress.

      Previous research studies have shown intravenous immunoglobulin to be safe and effective when
      used in neurologic diseases involving the immune system. Presently the NIMH is testing the
      effectiveness of IVIg in OCD and Tourette's syndrome.

      Intravenous Immunoglobulin IVIg is a medication that has been used to treat diseases like
      Kawasaki disease, systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, lupus nephritis, and idiopathic
      thrombocytopenic purpura. The drug modifies the body's natural immune reactions.

      This research study is a 13-week trial of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) on patients
      suffering from childhood-onset schizophrenia, who have failed to respond to other therapies.

      Recent developments in the study of early-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and
      Tourette's syndrome have implicated an autoimmune etiology in a subset of these conditions,
      and renewed interest into the possibility of autoimmune pathophysiology underlying other
      psychiatric disorders. There are several clinical and epidemiologic similarities between
      autoimmune diseases and schizophrenia: genetic predisposition, but with twin concordance
      below 50%; waxing and waning course; exacerbation of symptoms or precipitation of relapse by
      psychosocial stress. However, other mixed evidence has engendered considerable debate in the
      literature regarding the role of immune mechanisms in schizophrenia. The clinical efficacy
      and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in immune-mediated neurological diseases has
      been documented, and clinical studies of the efficacy of IVIg in the treatment of both
      Tourette's syndrome and OCD are currently ongoing at the NIMH (see protocol 92-M-0132). In
      this protocol, we propose a 13-week placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study of IVIg
      in 25 patients suffering from treatment-refractory childhood-onset schizophrenia. After the
      first 5 patients have completed the trial, this data will be presented to the NIMH
      Institutional Review Board and a decision will be made as to whether this trial should
      proceed.

        Patients will be recruited from both professional referrals and patient advocacy sources,
        subject to medical and psychiatric screening.

        Children and adolescents will be sought who meet DSM-III-R and DSM-IV criteria for
        schizophrenia, with onset of psychotic symptoms before age twelve, and who have no
        concurrent substance abuse disorders or other active medical conditions. In addition, they
        will have failed adequate trials of at least two typical neuroleptics, and not benefited
        from either olanzapine or clozapine.
