      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of SR-45023A in treating patients who have
      advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of SR-45023A in patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are refractory or for which no standard therapy
      exists. II. Determine the quantitative toxic effects of SR-45023A in these patients. III.
      Assess the pharmacokinetic profile of SR-45023A in these patients. IV. Identify the antitumor
      activity of SR-45023A in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral SR-45023A twice daily for 14
      days, followed by 7 days rest. On day 14 of course 1, patients receive only one dose of
      therapy due to pharmacokinetic sampling. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating
      doses of SR-45023A until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as
      the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients
      are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
