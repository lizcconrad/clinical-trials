      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Hydration with saline solution may protect kidney cells from the
      side effects of chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of glufosfamide with or without
      hydration in treating patients who have advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the activity of glufosfamide as determined by objective response in
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the response rate in this patient
      population after this treatment. III. Determine the duration of objective response in these
      patients treated with this drug. IV. Characterize the toxicities of this drug in these
      patients. V. Assess the impact of the hydration scheme on the toxicity profile (renal
      function) of this drug in these patients. VI. Assess the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug
      in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to
      receive glufosfamide with or without hydration. Arm I: Patients receive glufosfamide IV over
      1 hour every 3 weeks. Arm II: Patients receive glufosfamide as in arm I. Patients are
      hydrated with excess physiological saline solution 4 hours before and 3 hours after treatment
      with glufosfamide. Treatment in both arms continues for 2-6 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with an objective complete response
      continue treatment for a maximum of 2 courses after the confirmation of response. Patients
      are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-32 patients (8-16 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
