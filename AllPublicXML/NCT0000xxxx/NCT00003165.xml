      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Giving drugs in different forms may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of doxorubicin in treating women with
      advanced metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the antitumor activity of doxorubicin-HPMA conjugate (PK1) in women
      with advanced breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive doxorubicin-HPMA
      conjugate (PK1) by intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks. Patients may receive a total of 6
      courses of treatment in the absence of toxicity and progressive disease.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
