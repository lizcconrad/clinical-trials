  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of high-titered ALVAC-HIV MN120TMG (vCP205) given
      sequentially or simultaneously with rgp120/HIV-1SF2 in MF59 adjuvant emulsion in HIV-negative
      volunteers.

      ALVAC-HIV vCP205 is a second-generation candidate vaccine that can be used to induce a
      humoral and cellular response against several antigens. vCP205 expresses proteins from two
      strains of HIV (MN and LAI). rgp120/HIV-1SF2 expresses proteins from a different strain of
      HIV. This study will help to show how the immune system responds to proteins from more than
      one strain of virus.

      ALVAC-HIV vCP205 is a second-generation candidate vaccine that can be used to induce a
      humoral and cellular response against several antigens. vCP205 expresses proteins from two
      strains of HIV (MN and LAI). rgp120/HIV-1SF2 expresses proteins from a different strain of
      HIV. This study will help to show how the immune system responds to proteins from more than
      one strain of virus.

      Six groups of 25 volunteers each are randomized to receive simultaneous or sequential doses
      of ALVAC-HIV vCP205 and SF2 rgp120 or control vaccines (ALVAC-RG rabies glycoprotein vCP65 or
      BIOCINE Placebo Vaccine 2). In each group, 21 volunteers receive vaccine and 4 receive
      control vaccines. Volunteers are stratified by lower or higher risk sexual behavior.
      Immunizations are given to three groups at months 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12, and to the other
      three groups at months 0, 1, 6, 9, and 12. Volunteers are followed for 24 months.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Volunteers must have:

          -  Normal history and physical exam.

          -  CD4 count &gt;= 400 cells/mm3.

          -  Normal urine dipstick with esterase and nitrite.

        NOTE:

          -  No more than 10 percent of volunteers in each stratum may be over age 50.

        Risk Behavior:

        Allowed for volunteers stratified to the higher risk stratum:

        High risk behavior for HIV infection, such as

          -  injection drug use within the past 12 months.

          -  higher or intermediate risk sexual behavior.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Subjects with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Positive hepatitis B surface antigen.

          -  Medical or psychiatric condition (such as recent suicidal ideation or present
             psychosis) that precludes compliance.

             to a remote (&gt; 6 months) treated infection are eligible.

          -  Active tuberculosis. NOTE: Subjects with a positive PPD and a normal chest x-ray
             showing no evidence of TB and not requiring isoniazid therapy are eligible.

          -  Allergy to egg products or neomycin.

          -  Prior immunization against rabies.

          -  History of serious allergic reaction to any substance, requiring hospitalization or
             emergent medical care (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, bronchospasm, or hypotension).

          -  Prior psychiatric condition (such as history of suicide attempts or past psychosis)
             that precludes compliance.

          -  History of cancer unless there has been surgical excision that is considered to have
             achieved cure.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Live attenuated vaccines within 60 days prior to study entry. NOTE: Medically
             indicated killed or subunit vaccines (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal) do not exclude if
             administered at least 2 weeks from HIV immunizations.

          -  Experimental agents within 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Prior HIV vaccines.

          -  Prior rabies immunization.

        Prior Treatment:

        Excluded:

          -  Blood products or immunoglobulin within the past 6 months.

        For volunteers stratified to the lower risk stratum:

        High risk behavior for HIV infection, such as

          -  injection drug use within the past 12 months.

          -  higher or intermediate risk sexual behavior.
