      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplant may
      allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.
      Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the number of immune cells found
      in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the
      side effects of chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving filgrastim together with
      chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplant works in treating patients with Hodgkin's
      lymphoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the clinical outcomes, survival, and morbidity of transplantation in patients
           with Hodgkin's lymphoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma when treated with filgrastim (G-CSF)
           followed by high dose chemotherapy plus G-CSF followed by autologous peripheral blood
           stem cell (PBSC) transplantation.

        -  Determine whether sufficient PBSC can be collected for use in autologous transplantation
           in these patients when mobilized with hematopoietic growth factor alone compared to
           chemotherapy plus growth factor.

        -  Determine whether these primed PBSC support prompt lymphoid and myeloid hematopoietic
           recovery after transplantation in these patients.

        -  Compare the numbers of committed progenitor cells and/or primitive, pluripotential
           hematopoietic stem cells with these two priming techniques.

        -  Compare the numbers of tumor cells in cryopreserved PBSC following these priming
           techniques.

        -  Evaluate response and extended relapse free survival in conjunction with rapid
           hematopoietic reconstitution and limited transplant associated morbidity and mortality
           in these patients when treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: In the first priming phase, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SQ)
      daily on days 1-7 and peripheral blood stem cells are collected on days 6-8.

      At least 48 hours after the last dose of G-CSF and after the third leukapheresis, patients
      receive the second priming, which consists of cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day 1 and
      cytarabine IV over 1 hour every 12 hours for a total of 2 doses on day 1. Patients also
      receive mitoxantrone IV over 1 hour daily and dexamethasone IV every 12 hours for a total of
      4 doses on days 1-2. Patients receive G-CSF SQ daily beginning on day 4 and continuing until
      the completion of leukapheresis. PBSC are collected on 3 consecutive days after blood counts
      recover.

      In the transplant phase, patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have not exceeded
      pretransplant radiotherapy limits receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -7 and -6
      and total body irradiation twice daily on days -4 through -1. Autologous PBSC are reinfused
      on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF IV daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until day 21 or
      until blood counts recover.

      Patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma or patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have exceeded
      pretransplant radiotherapy limits receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours daily on days -6
      through -3, carmustine IV over 1 hour on day -6, and etoposide IV over 4 hours every 12 hours
      for a total of 6 doses on days -6 through -4. Autologous PBSC are reinfused on day 0.
      Patients also receive G-CSF IV daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until day 21 or until
      blood counts recover.

      All patients receive radiotherapy for any residual nodal masses measuring at least 2 cm 5
      days a week beginning on day 28.

      Patients are followed at day 100, then every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for 2
      years, and then annually thereafter.

      This was changed to a treatment guideline study.
