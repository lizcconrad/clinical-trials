  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to evaluate selected patients with documented recurrent or unusual
      infections and their family members for clinical and laboratory correlates of immune
      abnormalities. It allows long term follow up of patients with host defense defects and
      permits the periodic study of their blood, urine, saliva, skin, stool and vaginal specimens
      or wound drainage from such patients or their family members for medically indicated purposes
      and research studies related to understanding the genetic and biochemical bases of these
      diseases. This protocol may help provide patients and materials for the development of
      therapies for these diseases.

      This study will:

        1. Determine the biochemical and genetic causes of inherited immune diseases affecting
           phagocytes (white blood cells that defend against bacterial and fungal infections)

        2. Try to develop better ways to diagnose and treat patients with these diseases, and to
           prevent, diagnose and treat their infections

      Patients and family members may undergo the following procedures:

        -  A personal and family medical history, physical examination and other procedures, which
           may include various blood tests; urinalysis; saliva collection; imaging studies such as
           chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and lung
           function studies, dental examination or eye examinations, if medically indicated.

        -  Patients who have draining wounds will have fluid collected from these wounds for
           biochemical study.

        -  Tissues removed as part of medical care, such as pieces of lung, liver, or teeth, or
           biopsies of these tissues will be studied.

        -  Patients who have an immune problem that investigators wish to study further will be
           asked to return to NIH for follow-up visits at irregular intervals, but at least every 6
           months. The visits will include an updated medical history, examination directed at the
           particular medical problem related to the immune disorder, follow-up of abnormal tests
           or treatment, and collection of blood, saliva, urine, or wound fluid for study.

        -  Patients may have genetic testing and must be willing to have specimens stored for
           future research.

        -  Family members will have a medical history, saliva or urine collection, and chest X-ray
           or other imaging study, if medically indicated.

        -  Normal volunteers who have had tissue biopsies or pieces of tissue removed as part of
           medical care, such as pieces of lung, liver, or teeth, will have these tissues studied.

        -  NIH does not cover the cost of the initial screening visit for travel or lodging. A
           financial assessment may determine if the patient is eligible for financial assistance.
           This study does not enroll children under the age of 2.

        -  Patients will be asked to obtain their medical records, previous test results, or
           imaging studies prior to the first visit.

      This protocol is designed to evaluate selected patients with documented recurrent or unusual
      infections and their family members for clinical and in vitro correlates of immune
      abnormalities. It will also allow long term follow up of patients with host defense defects
      and permit us to periodically obtain blood, urine, saliva, skin, breast milk, stool and
      vaginal specimens or wound drainage from such patients or their family members for medically
      indicated purposes and research studies related to understanding the genetic and biochemical
      bases of these diseases. This protocol may help provide patients and materials for the
      development of therapies for these diseases.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients known to have or suspected of having an immune defect significantly or primarily
        involving the phagocytes will be eligible for enrollment, as well as their blood relatives.
        Such syndromes include but are not limited to those listed above. There will be no limit as
        age, sex, race or disability. Normal volunteers will be healthy adults between the age of
        18 and 70 years and of either sex.

        Subjects enrolled will be able to provide informed consent for themselves or if they lack
        the capacity to provide informed consent, the study team will comply with MAS 87-4.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The presence of an acquired abnormality which leads to immune defects, such as HIV,
        cytotoxic chemotherapy or malignancy could be grounds for possible exclusion if, in the
        opinion of the investigator, the presence of such disease process interfered with
        evaluation.

        Subjects with dementia that impairs obtaining informed consent are excluded unless there is
        an appropriate surrogate (legal guardian or durable power of attorney who is willing to
        provide consent).
