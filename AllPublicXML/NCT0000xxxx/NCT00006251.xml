      This clinical trial studies fludarabine phosphate, low-dose total-body irradiation, and donor
      stem cell transplant followed by cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and donor lymphocyte
      infusion in treating patients with hematopoietic cancer. Giving low doses of chemotherapy,
      such as fludarabine phosphate, and total body irradiation (TBI) before a donor peripheral
      blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also keep the
      patient's immune response from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may
      replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor lymphocyte
      infusion) after the transplant may help increase this effect. Sometimes the transplanted
      cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving
      cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the risk of graft rejection associated with the addition of fludarabine
      (fludarabine phosphate) to a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen for patients with
      malignant diseases treatable by allogeneic stem cell transplantation and compare this rate to
      that observed among patients previously treated without fludarabine.

      II. To estimate the rate of grade acute II/IV graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD
      in patients treated with low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI), fludarabine, peripheral blood
      stem cell (PBSC) infusion and immunosuppression with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days - 4
      to -2 and undergo low-dose TBI on day 0. (Note: Patients who have had an autologous
      transplant within 90 days prior to day 0 will not receive fludarabine phosphate.)

      PBSC INFUSION: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSC transplant on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to
      35 with a taper to day 56. Patients receive mycophenolate mofetil PO BID on days 0-27.

      POST TRANSPLANT DONOR LYMPHOCYTE INFUSION (DLI): Patients with stable mixed chimerism on day
      56, and without evidence of GVHD, undergo DLI IV over 30 minutes on day 65. Patients without
      a complete response, full donor chimerism, and GVHD after 2 months undergo further DLI at
      higher cell numbers. Up to 6 DLIs may be given 65 days apart.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months
      and then annually thereafter.
