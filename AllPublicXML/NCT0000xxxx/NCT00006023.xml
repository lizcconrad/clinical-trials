      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of capecitabine in treating patients who
      have metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of capecitabine in terms of PSA response, PSA response
      duration, and time to PSA progression in patients with metastatic hormone refractory prostate
      cancer. II. Evaluate the toxicity of this treatment in these patients. III. Evaluate the
      correlation between PSA response and quality of life in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days
      1-14. Treatment continues every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed on days 1 and 8 of the
      first course of treatment, on day 1 of each course thereafter, and at treatment failure.
      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.

        allowed if clinically unacceptable to discontinue use If disease progressed while receiving
        hormonal agents (e.g., goserelin, leuprolide, diethylstilbestrol), therapy must continue
        during study Radiotherapy: At least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy No prior radiotherapy
        to lesions to be evaluated No concurrent radiotherapy to more than one area Surgery: See
