      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who
      have metastatic germ cell tumors that have not responded to cisplatin.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of temozolomide in patients with cisplatin refractory
      metastatic germ cell tumors. II. Determine the safety of this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study over 25 months.
