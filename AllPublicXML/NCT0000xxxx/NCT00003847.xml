      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy for the
      treatment of patients who have recurrent small cell lung cancer following treatment.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Established the safety of VX-710 in combination with doxorubicin and
      vincristine for the treatment of patients with recurrent small cell lung cancer. II.
      Characterized the plasma pharmacokinetics of this regimen in patients. III. Established the
      ability of this regimen to improve the response rate to chemotherapy in patients who relapsed
      on front-line therapy. IV. Evaluated the multidrug resistance profile of these patients
      following this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: This was a multicenter study. Stage I: Patients received VX-710 IV over 72 hours,
      followed by doxorubicin IV and vincristine IV four hours after initial VX-710. Vincristine
      was administered at half dose in the first 3-6 patients. If no more than 1 of 6 patients
      experienced a dose limiting toxicity in the half dose cohort, 3 additional patients received
      full dose vincristine. The maximum tolerated dose was defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experienced a dose limiting toxicity. Stage II: Patients received
      VX-710 IV over 72 hours, followed by doxorubicin IV and full dose vincristine IV four hours
      after initial VX-710. Treatment continued for up to 6 courses every 3 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were followed every 3 months for up to
      1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 35 and a maximum of 92 patients was to be accrued for this
      study.
