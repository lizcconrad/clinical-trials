    <textblock>
      Compare the outcome of two primary surgeries techniques (von Langenbeck and Furlow double
      z-plasty) performed on children with cleft lip/palate to determine if one results in
      significantly better velopharyngeal competency for speech.

      This study is conducted with patients with complete unilateral cleft lip and palate. The
      subjects will have their palatal clefts surgically repaired by either the von Langenbeck or
      the Furlow double z-plasty palatoplasty. Patients will be randomly assigned to four groups,
      to have with the von Langenbeck palatoplasty with intravelar veloplasty or the Furlow double
      opposing z-plasty palatoplasty between 9 and 12 months of age or between 15 and 18 months of
      age. Lip repair will be randomized to either the Spina or Millard method and will be
      accomplished by six months prior to palatoplasty. The major emphasis will focus on assessment
      of the near and long term outcomes of the palatal surgeries on velopharyngeal function for
      speech.
