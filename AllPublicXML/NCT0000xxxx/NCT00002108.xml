      Patients 12 years and older are randomized to receive one of two doses of 3TC for a duration
      determined by the patient's physician or until termination of the program. Patients &lt; 12
      years receive a lower dose of 3TC. Patients are followed monthly. For selected sites only,
      serum samples are collected every 3 months from patients identified as HBsAg positive.
