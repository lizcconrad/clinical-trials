  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune cells attack the
      insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. Several environmental and genetic factors may
      predispose individuals to developing this disease, including changes in a gene called CD152.
      This study will examine how this gene may influence the development of insulin-dependent
      diabetes.

      Patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus enrolled in clinical trials at the National Institutes
      of Health and at the University of Florida and healthy normal volunteers may participate in
      this study. Participants will have up to three blood samples drawn over a period of less than
      1 year. The first sample (about 20 milliliters, or 4 teaspoons), will be examined for changes
      in the structure of the CD152 gene. If the CD152 structure is different from that normally
      seen in the general population, a second sample (about 90 ml, or 6 tablespoons of blood) will
      be drawn. This sample will be used to study the function of specialized immune system cells
      (T cells), including their growth and survival, chemicals they produce when stimulated, and
      other factors. If these cells function differently from what is generally seen in the
      population, a third sample (90 ml) will be drawn for more detailed studies.

      This investigation may help explain what makes certain individuals susceptible to Type 1
      diabetes mellitus and may contribute to the development of improved treatments for the
      disease.

      Genetic variations in CD152 have been reported to confer susceptibility to the development of
      type-1-diabetes mellitus (T1DM). In this protocol we will draw blood samples from patients
      and normal control volunteers in order to analyze for the presence of CD152 genetic
      variations and to determine whether those variations are associated with measurable
      abnormalities in T cell function. Subjects with T1DM and homozygous CD152 gene polymorphisms,
      patients with T1DM but without CD152 polymorphisms, and control subjects with or without
      CD152 polymorphisms will be studied to determine whether the CD152 polymorphisms have
      measurable effects on T cell function and signaling. We will assess T cell function by
      measuring: proliferation, viability, apoptosis, cytokine production and T cell signal
      transduction. The identification and characterization of genes that are linked to T1DM may
      provide an explanation into the mechanisms by which individuals are predisposed to T1DM.
