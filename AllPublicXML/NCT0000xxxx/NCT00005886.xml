    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      tamoxifen or LY353381 may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying how well tamoxifen works on the biomarkers
      of the tumor tissue, compared with LY353381, in treating women with newly diagnosed breast
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether LY353381 hydrochloride or tamoxifen administered in the interval
           between biopsy and re-excision alters the expression of tissue biomarkers relative to
           placebo controls in postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.

        -  Phase I: Patients are randomized to receive either oral LY353381 hydrochloride or oral
           placebo daily.

      Upon completion of phase I, all treatment centers begin phase II of the study.

        -  Phase II: Patients are randomized to receive either oral tamoxifen or oral placebo
           daily.

      Treatment in both phases continues for 2-6 weeks (until scheduled lumpectomy or mastectomy)
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 and 2 weeks after surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 120 patients (60 per treatment phase) will be accrued for
      this study within 18 months.
