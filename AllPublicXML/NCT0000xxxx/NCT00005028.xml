  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining paclitaxel and bryostatin 1 in
      treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone
      therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the onset, duration, and degree of response in patients with hormone-refractory,
      metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with paclitaxel and bryostatin 1.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the overall
      survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and bryostatin 1 IV over 1
      hour on days 2, 9, and 16. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months and then every 3 months thereafter.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate that failed first-
             or second-line hormonal therapy (e.g., gonadal androgen suppression [orchiectomy or
             luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone] with or without antiandrogens)

               -  Failure on hormonal therapy is defined by 1 of the following criteria:

                    -  Biochemical progression (after withdrawal of antiandrogens), documented by 3
                       rising PSA values, each value measured at least 2 weeks apart, with the last
                       measurement being at least 25% of the nadir achieved while on hormonal
                       therapy and with an increase in the absolute value by at least 5 ng/mL

                    -  Measurable disease progression, defined by an increase in the sum of the
                       products of the perpendicular diameters of any measurable lesion(s) by at
                       least 25%
