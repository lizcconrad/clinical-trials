      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of paclitaxel with or without
      PSC 833 in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the response rate and time to treatment failure of paclitaxel with
      and without the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) antagonist PSC 833 in advanced breast cancer. II. For
      each treatment arm, relate paclitaxel AUC (area under curve), and/or time above .05 um/L, to
      myelosuppression and/or response. III. To obtain preliminary estimates of MDR in this group
      of patients by measuring MDR1-Pgp immunostaining in pretreatment biopsies in 20 patients and
      biopsies taken at the time of progression.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to three criteria: 1)
      treatment within 2 years of adjuvant chemotherapy vs. progression on chemotherapy for
      advanced disease 2) measurable vs. evaluable disease 3) institution. Patients receive
      paclitaxel alone or paclitaxel plus PSC 833. In the first arm, paclitaxel alone is
      administered by continuous infusion over 3 hours once every 3 weeks. In the second arm, PSC
      833 is administered PO four times a day for 3 days; paclitaxel is administered by continuous
      infusion over 3 hours on day 2. Courses repeat every 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 70 patients will be accrued per year in this study.

        anthracyclines are contraindicated, metastatic disease within 2 years of any adjuvant
        cytotoxic regimen, or failure of one prior cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimen for advanced
        breast cancer also qualifies Evaluable or measurable disease in at least one nonirradiated
