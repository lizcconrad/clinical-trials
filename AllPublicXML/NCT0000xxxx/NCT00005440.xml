      BACKGROUND:

      Disability among those with asthma is common and costly. Little is known about the causes of
      disability in asthma; experience with other chronic diseases suggests that illness severity
      alone does not adequately predict disability. There is a theoretical and experimental basis
      upon which to postulate that other variables, including factors such as job flexibility,
      asthma self-efficacy, social supports, and cigarette smoking may be predictors of disability
      in asthma. The study helped to explain the inter-relationships among illness severity, other
      co-factors and disability in asthma, addressing a major research gap.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study was a cross-sectional survey, including retrospective work history data. A random
      sample was conducted of 40 board certified pulmonologists in Northern California enrolling
      persons with asthma. Pulmonologists maintained a log of all persons meeting a clinical
      definition of asthma presenting to their offices for treatment over a one month period. A
      total of 601 subjects with any history of laborforce participation were interviewed by a
      trained survey worker in order to assess severity of disease using a severity scale based on
      symptoms, medications, and past-asthma history. The computer-assisted, telephone-administered
      interviews used established survey instruments to assess psychosocial variables, smoking
      exposure and work history.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
