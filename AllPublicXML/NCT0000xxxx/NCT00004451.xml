    <textblock>
      Subjects fast for 8 hours before receiving a test to determine their blood glucose levels.
      Following this test, subjects are randomized to receive either a glucose or saccharin
      sweetened drink. A series of memory tests and an additional 3 blood glucose level tests are
      administered approximately 15 minutes later. A minimum of 1 week afterward, the subjects
      return and receive the alternate sweetener followed by additional memory tests.
