  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetically inherited heart disease. It causes
      thickening of heart muscle, especially the chamber responsible for pumping blood out of the
      heart, the left ventricle. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most important cause of
      sudden death in apparently healthy young people.

      A genetic test called linkage analysis is used to locate genes causing inherited diseases
      like HCM. Linkage analysis requires large families to be evaluated clinically in order to
      identify the members with and without the disease.

      In this study researchers will collect samples of DNA from family members of patients with
      HCM. The diagnosis of the disease will be made by history and physical examination,
      electrocardiogram (12 lead ECG), and ultrasound of the heart (2-D echocardiogram). The
      ability of the researchers to locate the gene responsible for the disease improves with
      increases in the size of the family and members evaluated.

      In order to continue research on the genetic causes of heart disease, researchers intend on
      studying families with specific genetic mutations (beta-MHC) causing HCM. Researcher plan to
      also study families with HCM not linked to specific gene mutations (beta-MHC).

    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most important cause of sudden death in apparently
      healthy young individuals but its clinical manifestations are highly variable. Linkage
      analysis is used to localize a gene causing an inherited autosomal dominant disease, such as
      HCM. Linkage analysis requires that large families be evaluated clinically to determine the
      members with and without the disease. For this study, DNA needs to be extracted from blood
      samples of family members. The presence of the disease is determined by history and physical
      exam, 12 lead ECG and 2-D echocardiogram. The likelihood of localizing the gene increases
      with the size of the family and the number of members evaluated. The beta myosin heavy chain
      (beta-MHC) gene has been shown to be responsible for HCM in 10%-30% of affected kindreds.
      Other linage studies have shown that there are at least 3 other genes which cause HCM in
      other kindreds, but these genes are presently unknown. We have identified 13 unique mutations
      in the beta-MHC gene which cause the disease in 17 kindreds. This has allowed us to
      demonstrate skeletal muscle involvement, study the abnormal physiology which is a consequence
      of the mutations, make pre-symptomatic diagnosis, and redefine the natural history of the
      disease. In order to continue our clinical and laboratory studies of this disease over the
      next 3 years, it is our intention to identify 50 additional HCM kindreds, with approximately
      50 members each, that have beta-MHC gene mutations. During this time, in order to map other
      HCM genes, we will also evaluate at least 6 families, of approximately 300 members each, in
      which the disease is not linked to the beta-MHC gene.
