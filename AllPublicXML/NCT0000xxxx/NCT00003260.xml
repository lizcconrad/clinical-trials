      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and giving the drugs in different
      combinations may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether receiving irinotecan with
      fluorouracil and leucovorin is more effective than receiving oxaliplatin with fluorouracil
      and leucovorin in treating recurrent metastatic colorectal cancer

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of irinotecan with
      oxaliplatin followed by fluorouracil and leucovorin in treating patients with recurrent
      metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of leucovorin calcium plus fluorouracil with either
      irinotecan or oxaliplatin in terms of progression free survival in patients with recurrent
      metastatic colorectal cancer. II. Compare the efficacy, tolerance, quality of life, and
      overall survival in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by participating
      institution and measurable or evaluable disease. Patients are randomized to receive either a
      2 hour continuous infusion of irinotecan or a 2 hour continuous infusion of oxaliplatin on
      day 1. All patients receive a 2 hour continuous infusion of leucovorin calcium followed by IV
      bolus and 48 hour continuous infusion of fluorouracil on days 1 and 2. Courses are repeated
      every 2 weeks. Patients will receive the alternate treatment if disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity occurs on their initial treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months
      after end of treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue a total of 109 patients per arm over approximately
      18 months.
