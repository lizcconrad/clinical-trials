      RATIONALE: New imaging procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging may improve the ability
      to detect the extent of newly diagnosed cancer.

      PURPOSE: Diagnostic study of magnetic resonance imaging to determining the extent of cancer
      in patients who have newly diagnosed glioma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI)
      and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (DI) measures of glioma cell burden correlate with
      histopathologically measured cell counts in glioma patients who are scheduled to undergo
      surgical resection. II. Determine whether 1H-MRSI and DI measures of glioma cell burden are
      invariant over the short term (1 week) as steroid dose is increased in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Part I: Patients who are scheduled to have surgical resection of brain tumor undergo
      conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic
      imaging (1H-MRSI), and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (DI) within 1 week before
      resection. Patients undergo conventional MRI within 72 hours after completion of surgical
      resection. Image characteristics of the resected tissue are correlated with histopathological
      measures. Part II: Patients who have clinical indications for increasing the dexamethasone
      dose are treated on part II of the study. Patients are stratified by status of steroid
      treatment (steroid naive vs prior steroid management). Patients undergo conventional MRI,
      1H-MRSI, and DI within 2 days before and within 4-7 days after increasing the dexamethasone
      dose. Image characteristics on films taken before and after increasing the dexamethasone dose
      are compared.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for part I of the study and a total
      40 patients (20 per stratum) will be accrued for part II of the study within 4 years.
