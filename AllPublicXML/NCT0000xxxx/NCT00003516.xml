  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current therapies for Stage III or Stage IV Prostate Cancer provide very limited benefit to
      the patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove
      beneficial in the treatment of Stage III or Stage IV Prostate Cancer.

      PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that
      Antineoplaston therapy has on patients with Stage III or Stage IV Prostate Cancer.

      Stage III or Stage IV Prostate Cancers receive Antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 capsules orally
      six to seven times a day. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Stage III or Stage
           IV Prostate Cancer, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response,
           partial response or stable disease).

        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Stage
           III or Stage IV Prostate Cancer.

        -  To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing MRI scans, which are
           performed every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for
           2 years thereafter.
