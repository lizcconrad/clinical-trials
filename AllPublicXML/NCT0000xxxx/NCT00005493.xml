  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To analyze existing data from the Physicians Health Study (PHS), a randomized primary
      prevention trial of low-dose aspirin and beta carotene conducted among 22,071 U.S. male
      physicians, to address questions concerning aspirin and cardiovascular (CV) disease that
      could not adequately be addressed during the randomized aspirin period.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The aspirin component of the trial was terminated on January 25, 1988, due to a demonstrated
      benefit of aspirin on myocardial infarction. At that time, however, the number of strokes and
      CV deaths experienced by trial participants was inadequate to definitively evaluate these
      endpoints. The beta carotene component of the trial continued uninterrupted until its
      scheduled termination in December, 1996. During this period detailed information continued to
      be collected on post-trial aspirin use through annual questionnaires. As of October, 1995,
      the number of deaths, including cardiovascular deaths, had increased fourfold from that in
      the randomized period, and the number of strokes had increased 3.5 times. The investigators
      used data from both the randomized aspirin period and the observational period following the
      trial to assess the impact of aspirin use on cardiovascular and total mortality, and the
      long-term impact of aspirin use on subsequent stroke and MI. The methods included analyses of
      both randomized aspirin assignment and of time-varying aspirin use, as assessed on the annual
      questionnaires. Because of the potential for bias, the propensity for aspirin use,
      particularly during the observational period was taken into account. Analyses included use of
      proportional hazards models allowing for both time-varying effects of aspirin use and
      controlling for time-varying confounders, as well as more complex procedures using causal
      modeling.
