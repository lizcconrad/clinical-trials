      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells
      and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal
      cells. Combining chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, and surgery may be a more
      effective treatment for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy, monoclonal
      antibody therapy, and surgery in treating women who have stage II, stage III, or stage IV
      breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the cardiac and other toxicity of paclitaxel when administered with
           trastuzumab (Herceptin) after doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in women with stage IIB,
           IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, or previously untreated stage IV breast cancer.

        -  Determine whether the addition of paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab to conventional
           breast cancer adjuvant therapy (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) further decreases
           tumor size and the number of positive axillary nodes in these patients.

        -  Determine the 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Determine whether the initial pathologic response in patients receiving neoadjuvant
           therapy correlates with the eventual 5-year disease-free survival or overall survival.

        -  Compare the number of patients eligible for breast-conserving cancer surgery after
           treatment with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide vs paclitaxel and trastuzumab.

        -  Correlate clinical and radiographic response rate with pathologic response rate in the
           primary tumor and axillary lymph nodes and determine which parameter best determines the
           pathologic response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients either received neoadjuvant therapy (HER-2 overexpressing and
      non-overexpressing patients) or adjuvant therapy (HER-2 overexpressing patients only).

        -  Neoadjuvant therapy: Patients receive one of two treatment regimens.

             -  Regimen I (HER-2 non-overexpressing patients or HER-2 overexpressing patients who
                refuse trastuzumab (Herceptin) therapy): Patients receive doxorubicin IV and
                cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 every 3
                weeks for a total of 4 courses. Patients then undergo surgery with or without
                adjuvant radiotherapy and/or oral tamoxifen.

             -  Regimen II (HER-2 overexpressing patients only): Patients receive doxorubicin and
                cyclophosphamide as in regimen I. After completion of course 4, patients receive
                paclitaxel IV and trastuzumab IV over 90-150 minutes weekly on weeks 13-24.
                Patients then undergo surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy. Patients then
                receive trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes weekly on weeks 29-69 if they did not
                receive radiotherapy or on weeks 36-76 if they did receive radiotherapy.

        -  Adjuvant therapy: Patients who receive adjuvant therapy (HER-2 overexpressing patients
           only) receive doxorubicin IV and cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on day 1 every 3
           weeks for a total of 4 courses. After completion of course 4, patients receive
           paclitaxel IV and trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes weekly on weeks 13-24. Patients then
           may undergo radiotherapy followed by trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes weekly on weeks
           29-69 if they did not receive radiotherapy or on weeks 36-76 if they did receive
           radiotherapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 125 patients (100 in the neoadjuvant group and 25 in the
      adjuvant group) will be accrued for this study within 5 years.

          <title>Estrogen Receptor Status</title>
          <description>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a test that “maps” the genetic material in a person’s cells. This test can be used to visualize specific genes or portions of genes. FISH testing is done on breast cancer tissue removed during biopsy to see if the cells have extra copies of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene. The more copies of the HER2 gene that are present, the more HER2 receptors the cells have. These HER2 receptors receive signals that stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells.</description>

          <title>Clinical Stage</title>
          <description>Tumor grade is the description of a tumor based on how abnormal the tumor cells and the tumor tissue look under a microscope. It is an indicator of how quickly a tumor is likely to grow and spread. The grading system is as follows: grade I - cancer cells that resemble normal cells and aren't growing rapidly. grade II - cancer cells that don't look like normal cells and are growing faster than normal cells. grade III - cancer cells that look abnormal and may grow or spread more aggressively. Grade IV- They tend to grow quicker, spread more often and have a worse prognosis.</description>

Systolic function was measured by the ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

          <description>Doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide in combination with paclitaxel and trastuzumab (AC-TP) Associated Systolic Dysfunction. Systolic function was measured by the ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). LVEF is a measurement in determining how well your heart is pumping out blood and in diagnosing and tracking heart failure.</description>
          <population>LVEF data during AC-TP are complete on 50 patients. 2 are incomplete because of withdrawal (1) and progressive disease (1). 43 of the 52 patients underwent LVEF determination at 1.5 years.</population>
