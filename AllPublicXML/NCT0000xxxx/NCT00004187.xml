      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining capecitabine and
      oxaliplatin in treating patients who have advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer that
      cannot be surgically removed.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of capecitabine when combined with
      oxaliplatin in patients with chemotherapy naive or thymidylate synthase inhibitor pretreated
      unresectable, advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. II. Determine the safety profile,
      toxicity, and efficacy of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the complete and
      partial remission rates, time to treatment failure, and overall survival of patients treated
      with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of capecitabine. Patients are
      stratified by pretreatment status (any pretreatment vs chemotherapy naive vs thymidylate
      synthase inhibitor pretreatment). Phase I : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on
      day 1 and oral capecitabine every 12 hours on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The
      MTD is defined as the highest dose at which 2 or more of 6 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicity. Phase II: Patients receive capecitabine at the feasible dose. The feasible dose is
      defined as the dose immediately preceding the MTD from phase I. Patients are followed every 3
      months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study and a
      total of 27-68 patients (14-25 thymidylate synthase inhibitor pretreated patients and 13-43
      chemotherapy naive patients) will be accrued for phase II of the study.
