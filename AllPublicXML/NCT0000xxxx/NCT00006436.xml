  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  HIV-infected patients have a weakened immune system, and chemotherapy, which is used to
           treat lymphoma, probably causes further damage to the immune system.

        -  Limiting the amount of immune damage due to chemotherapy might decrease the number of
           infections and the risk of developing cancer in the future in HIV-infected patients with
           non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether reducing the total amount of chemotherapy using a specific
           combination of drugs called EPOCH-R (etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine,
           cyclophosphamide and rituximab) will rid the body of lymphoma quickly while decreasing
           the risk of infections and future cancers.

        -  To determine whether the lymphoma will remain undetectable for at least one year if
           treatment is stopped one cycle after the patient enters remission.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and HIV infection 4 years of age and older who have not
      been treated previously with rituximab or cytotoxic chemotherapy.

      Design:

        -  Patients receive EPOCH-R in 3-week treatment cycles for at least three and no more than
           six cycles.

        -  The lymphoma is evaluated using CT and PET scans at the end of treatment cycles 2 and 3.
           A bone marrow biopsy is repeated after cycle 2 if a biopsy was initially positive on
           screening for participation in the study.

        -  Anti-HIV therapy is stopped before chemotherapy begins and is restarted when EPOCH-R
           treatment ends.

        -  Patients are monitored for treatment response with blood tests and imaging scans at
           baseline, when treatment ends, 2 months after treatment ends and then every 3 to 6
           months for a total of 24 months following chemotherapy.

      Background:

      This is a study to investigate in a preliminary fashion the feasibility of short course
      chemotherapy to patients with HIV-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (HIV-NHL).

      This study will investigate if the paradigm for treatment can be successfully changed from a
      standard of 6 cycles to one cycle beyond complete remission with 6 total allowable cycles.

      Objective:

      To assess with 90 percent probability that at least 50 percent of patients treated with
      short-course EPOCH-R will be progression free at one year.

      Eligibility:

      Aggressive CD20 positive DLBCL.

      HIV+ serology.

      All stages (I-IV) of disease.

      ECOG Performance status 0-4.

      NHL previously untreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy.

      Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

      May not be pregnant or nursing.

      May not have received previous rituximab.

      Design:

      Patients will be treated every three weeks with a combination of EPOCH and rituximab for one
      cycle beyond CR/CRu by CT scan of all detectable tumors for a minimum of three and maximum of
      six cycles. Following cycle 2, CT, positron emission tomography scans (PET), and bone marrow
      biopsies (if initially positive) will be performed.

      At the conclusion of the study, we will estimate whether the number of cycles can be reduced
      using the paradigm. If the cumulative number of patients to relapse exceeds 25 percent by 6
      months, the study will be closed.

      Following the completion of chemotherapy, restaging will be performed 2 months following the
      end of treatment, then every 3 months for one year, every 6 months for one year, then every
      12 months until relapse, death, or loss to follow up.

      Antiretroviral therapy (ART) will be given concurrently with treatment regimen.

      To study the effects of treatment approach on parameters of HIV disease, measurements of CD4
      cells and viral loads will be made at baseline and at the completion of therapy, and then 2
      months following the end of treatment, and then every 3-6 months for a total of 24 months
      following chemotherapy.
