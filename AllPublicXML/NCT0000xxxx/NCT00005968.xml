      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irofulven in treating patients who have
      stage IV melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients with stage IV
      malignant melanoma treated with 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene. II. Determine the toxicity of
      this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene IV over 5
      minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding
      disease after completion of course 2 receive additional courses. Patients are followed every
      3 months for 5 years, and then annually thereafter until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 16-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
