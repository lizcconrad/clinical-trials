      OBJECTIVES:

      Determine the effectiveness of the combined use of clotrimazole and hydroxyurea on a specific
      panel of red cell characteristics in patients with sickle cell syndromes.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral hydroxyurea either once or twice daily plus oral clotrimazole twice
      daily after meals for 6 months. Patients are assessed at 3 and 6 months during treatment.
