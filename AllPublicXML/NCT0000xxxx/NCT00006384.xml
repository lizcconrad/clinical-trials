      RATIONALE: SU5416 may stop the growth of kidney cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.
      Interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of the cancer cells. Combining interferon
      alfa-2b with SU5416 may be an effective treatment for kidney cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining SU5416 and interferon alfa-2b
      in treating patients who have unresectable or metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy and toxicity of SU5416 combined with interferon alfa-2b
      in patients with unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive SU5416 IV over 30-60 minutes twice
      weekly and interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously every 12 hours daily. Treatment continues every
      6 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses. Patients who achieve partial response or stable disease
      after completion of course 2 receive additional courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response may receive additional
      courses, at the discretion of the protocol investigator, in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression are allowed to stay
      on the study until any measurable lesion increases to over 100% of baseline measurement.
      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-31 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
