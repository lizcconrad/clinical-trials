  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) unlike X-rays and CT-scans does not use radiation to create
      a picture. MRI use as the name implies, magnetism to create pictures with excellent
      anatomical resolution. Functional MRIs are diagnostic tests that allow doctors to not only
      view anatomy, but physiology and function. It is for these reasons that MRIs are excellent
      methods for studying the brain.

      In this study, researchers will use MRI to assess brain anatomy and function in X and Y
      chromosome variation, healthy volunteers, and patients with a variety of childhood onset
      psychiatric disorders. The disorders include attention deficit disorder, autism, congenital
      adrenal hyperplasia, childhood-onset schizophrenia, dyslexia, obsessive compulsive disorder,
      Sydenham's chorea, and Tourette's syndrome.

      Results of the MRIs showing the anatomy of the brain and brain function will be compared
      across age, sex (gender), and diagnostic groups. Correlations between brain and behavioral
      measures will be examined for normal and clinical populations.

      Driven by the hypotheses that many of the most severe neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood
      onset are associated with deviations from the path of normal brain development, the
      neuroanatomical substrates of which can be detected by magnetic resonance imaging, we are
      acquiring brain images in healthy and neuropsychiatrically impaired subjects. To explore
      gene, brain, behavior relationships in health and illness we are also acquiring DNA along
      with clinical, behavioral, and cognitive data in singleton and twin populations. Controls and
      clinical populations are screened and characterized in behavioral, cognitive, and physical
      domains. Longitudinal brain MRI scans are acquired and analyzed using state-of-the-art image
      analysis techniques. Data from the project has resulted in seminal papers on
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Childhood-Onset Schizophrenia, and normal pediatric
      brain development. The data from the normative project is unique in its longitudinal nature
      and sample size.
