      RATIONALE: Turner's syndrome is a disease in which females are missing all or part of one X
      chromosome and do not produce the hormones estrogen and androgen. Giving growth hormone may
      help girls with Turner's syndrome attain a more normal height. It is not yet known if growth
      hormone is more effective with or without oxandrolone for Turner's syndrome.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oxandrolone in girls who
      have growth hormone-treated Turner's syndrome.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomly assigned to recombinant
      human growth hormone (GH) and oxandrolone versus GH and placebo.

      GH is administered by daily subcutaneous injection and oxandrolone is given every day by
      mouth. Treatment continues for 3 years; estrogen is offered after year 2.

      A study duration of 8 years is anticipated.
