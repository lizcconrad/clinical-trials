      BACKGROUND:

      Two hypotheses have been proposed to account for the effects of social support on
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Both hypotheses operate through effects on risk
      factors for coronary heart disease, specifically arterial blood pressure and serum lipids.
      The stress- buffering hypothesis states that social support functions as a social resource
      for individuals exposed to social stressors; those persons with more support are less
      vulnerable to the risk-enhancing effects of stressors. The health behavior hypothesis states
      that persons with more support engage in more positive health behaviors, such as avoiding
      tobacco; moderate alcohol use; exercise; and, a prudent diet. A major limitation in research
      to evaluate these alternative hypotheses has been the failure to conceptualize and measure
      social support in a way appropriate to detect its effects in varying social and cultural
      contexts. This is a major issue in research in sub-cultural communities that are also high
      risk communities, such as African-Americans.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A cross-sectional survey of social stressors, social supports, health behaviors, and arterial
      blood pressure and serum lipids was conducted in a Black community in the rural South to
      evaluate the relative strengths of the stress-buffering versus the health behavior
      hypothesis. Social support was measured using a culturally appropriate technique which was
      sensitive both to the distinction between kin and nonkin social support, and the modification
      of the effects of that support by generational status. Multiple regression analysis and path
      analysis were used to evaluate the alternative hypotheses.
