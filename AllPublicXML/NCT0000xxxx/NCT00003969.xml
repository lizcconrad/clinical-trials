      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of a geldanamycin
      analogue in treating patients with advanced cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose for a geldanamycin analogue,
           17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (AAG), in patients with advanced malignancies.

        -  Determine the toxic effects and dose-limiting toxicity of AAG in this patient
           population.

        -  Determine the safe dose of AAG for a Phase II study.

        -  Measure the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of AAG in these patients.

        -  Assess time to tumor progression and any antitumor activity in patients treated with
           AAG.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive a geldanamycin analogue, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (AAG), IV
      over 15-30 minutes every week. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of AAG until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
