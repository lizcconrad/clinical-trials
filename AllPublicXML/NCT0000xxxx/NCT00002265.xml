  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine; ddC) monotherapy is safe and tolerable in
      the treatment of patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex (ARC) who previously
      demonstrated intolerance to zidovudine (AZT) treatment while in Protocol N3300 (NIAID ACTG
      114) or N3492 (NIAID ACTG 119).

      NOTE OF CAUTION FOR CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS ON STUDY:

      Patients on amphotericin, pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole,
      ganciclovir, intravenous pentamidine, intravenous acyclovir or oral acyclovir or other bone
      marrow or renal toxic drugs may not tolerate concomitant ddC. If these drugs are given
      concomitantly with ddC, patients should have frequent clinical and laboratory assessments, as
      appropriate. Drugs that are nephrotoxic or have the potential to cause peripheral neuropathy
      might be expected to cause increased toxicity when co-administered with ddC. Drugs that could
      cause serious additive toxicity when co-administered with study medication will be allowed
      for treatment of an acute intercurrent illness or opportunistic infection at the discretion
      of the investigator. Their use may be allowed with interruption of study drug for up to 35
      days per episode, for a total of 90 days for the study. If the patient's condition requires
      chronic administration of these medications, the patient will be discontinued from study
      medication and followed.

          -  Medications on which patient has been stable for 14 days prior to study entry.

          -  Allowed if no evidence of peripheral neuropathy at study entry:

          -  REFER TO NOTE OF CAUTION IN PROTOCOL SUMMARY.

        Patients must have the following:

          -  Previously enrolled in NIAID ACTG 114 or NIAID ACTG 119.

          -  Experienced = or &gt; grade 3 zidovudine (AZT) related toxicity while enrolled in the

             probable relationship to AZT. Although NIAID ACTG 119 is an open-label study,
             investigators should also contact Hoffmann-La Roche prior to entering any patient into
             this protocol.

          -  Toxicities must be &quot;probably&quot; AZT related (as determined by the investigator and
