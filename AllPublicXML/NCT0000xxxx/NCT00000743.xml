  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and tolerance of alvircept sudotox (sCD4-PE40) given at various
      dosing intervals and concentrations. To determine whether frequent dosing alters
      immunogenicity or toxicity. To obtain preliminary data to ascertain whether sCD4-PE40 has
      activity against HIV in human subjects. To determine whether there is any additive toxicity
      with combined use of sCD4-PE40 and zidovudine (AZT).

      There is some evidence that AZT and sCD4-PE40, an experimental drug with anti-HIV activity
      previously demonstrated in vitro, may produce increased benefit when used in combination in
      HIV-infected patients.

      There is some evidence that AZT and sCD4-PE40, an experimental drug with anti-HIV activity
      previously demonstrated in vitro, may produce increased benefit when used in combination in
      HIV-infected patients.

      Cohorts of six patients each receive escalating doses of sCD4-PE40 in a single IV weekly dose
      for 8 weeks. All six patients at a given dose must complete 2 weeks of therapy without
      dose-limiting toxicity before dose escalation in subsequent patient cohorts may occur. The
      MTD is defined as the dose of sCD4-PE40 immediately below that at which two or more of six
      patients experience grade 3 or higher toxicity or one or more of six patients experience
      grade 4 toxicity. After the MTD for the once-weekly schedule is reached, subsequent cohorts
      receive escalated doses of sCD4-PE40 on a 5x weekly schedule for approximately 4 weeks, in an
      attempt to establish the MTD for that schedule. When an MTD has been determined for the 5x
      weekly schedule, and if antiretroviral activity is observed, six additional patients receive
      this dose combined with AZT for 4 weeks.

             cryptococcosis, Pneumocystis carinii, herpes zoster, histoplasmosis, or CMV or
             nonopportunistic diseases including liver disease, renal disease, or orthostatic
             hypotension) at time of study entry.

          -  Active pulmonary disease.

          -  Chronic active hepatitis B surface antigenemia or unstable hepatitis C.
