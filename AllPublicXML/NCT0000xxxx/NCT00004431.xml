      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of L-baclofen in patients with refractory trigeminal
      neuralgia.

      II. Evaluate the safety and tolerance of L-baclofen in these patients.

    <textblock>
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel study.

      Patients are randomized to receive either L-baclofen or placebo orally at increasing daily
      doses for 1 week. Patients then continue to receive the maximum dosage acceptable for a 1
      week maintenance period.

      Patients, thereafter, may enroll in a long term open label study with L-baclofen.

      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics-- Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia - Paroxysmal attacks of facial
        or frontal pain lasting a few seconds to less than 2 minutes - Pain has at least 4 of the
        following characteristics: Distribution along one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve
        Sudden, intense, sharp, superficial, stabbing, or burning quality Pain intensity severe
        Precipitation from trigger areas, or by certain daily activities such as eating, talking,
        washing the face, or cleaning the teeth Between paroxysms entirely asymptomatic - No
        neurological deficit - Attacks are stereotyped in the individual patient - Exclusion of
        other causes of facial pain by history, physical examination and special investigations
        when necessary Must be uncontrolled or refractory as defined by occurrence of at least 2
        paroxysms of pain per day despite conventional treatment with maximally tolerated doses of
        carbamazepine --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- No concurrent medication for trigeminal
        neuralgia other than carbamazepine, phenytoin, and neurontin Concurrent medication for
        other conditions allowed Concurrent medication must be on stable dose(s) --Patient
        Characteristics-- Hepatic: No significant hepatic disease Renal: No significant renal
        disease Neurological: No evidence of progressing neurological disorder (e.g., intracranial
        neoplasm, multiple sclerosis) Other: No history of drug abuse Not pregnant Effective
        contraception required of all fertile patients
