      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of pyrazoloacridine in treating women who
      have refractory metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of pyrazoloacridine in patients with refractory breast
      cancer. II. Determine the toxic effects of pyrazoloacridine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pyrazoloacridine IV over 3 hours. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for 2-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
