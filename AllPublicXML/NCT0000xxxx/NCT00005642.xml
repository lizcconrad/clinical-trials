      RATIONALE: SU5416 may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of SU5416 in treating patients who have
      advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum target-inhibiting dose of SU5416 in patients with
      advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the relationship between dose or plasma levels and the
      clinical safety profile and antitumor effects of this treatment regimen in terms of objective
      response, stabilization of disease, or progression-free survival in this patient population.
      III. Evaluate the relationship between dose or plasma levels of SU5416 concentrations and the
      ability of this treatment regimen to reduce microvessel density and induce apoptosis of
      endothelial and tumor cells in this patient population. IV. Determine prognostic and
      surrogate serologic markers in these patients treated with this regimen. V. Determine if pre
      and posttreatment plasma and serum levels of angiogenic growth factors, basic fibroblast
      growth factor, and vascular endothelial cell growth factor are prognostic in predicting
      patient response to this regimen. VI. Determine if elevated plasma levels of endothelial cell
      specific proteins reflective of SU5416-induced endothelial damage and/or apoptosis are useful
      surrogate markers in assessing response to this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-deescalation study. Patients receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour twice
      weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 6-12 patients receive deescalating doses of SU5416 until the maximum
      target-inhibiting dose (MTID) is determined. The MTID is defined as the dose at which
      patients experience no greater than grade 1 toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
