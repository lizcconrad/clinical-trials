      Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining
      chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery may be a more effective treatment for cancer of
      the rectum. Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining oxaliplatin, fluorouracil,
      and external-beam radiation therapy followed by surgery in treating patients who have locally
      advanced cancer of the rectum

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin when combined with fluorouracil and
      external beam radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the rectum.

      (Phase I closed to accrual effective 03/27/2003). II. Determine the pathological response
      rate in patients treated with this preoperative regimen and surgical resection.

      III.Determine the late toxicity of this preoperative regimen in these patients. IV.
      Determine, in a preliminary manner, the progression-free survival, local control, and overall
      survival in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study of oxaliplatin.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, fluorouracil IV continuously on days
      1-7, and radiotherapy on days 1-5. Treatment repeats weekly for a maximum of 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients
      are treated at that dose level in the phase II portion of the study. (Phase I closed to
      accrual effective 03/27/2003). Patients may undergo radical resection of rectal tumor within
      4-6 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study (phase I
      closed to accrual effective 03/27/2003) and a total of 19 patients will be accrued for phase
      II of the study within 12-18 months.

    <description>The new regimen will be considered worthy of further investigation if 5 or greater CR's are observed among the 25 patients treated at the MTD. Assuming the new regimen will result in a 30% CR rate, the probability of observing 5 or greater CR's in 25 patients studied is 0.91. For an underlying CR rate of 0.25 this probability is 0.79. The probability of observing 5 or greater CR's if the underlying CR rate is 0.10 is 0.10.</description>
