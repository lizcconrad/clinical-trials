      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Specific hypotheses tested included an adverse effect of saturated fat and carotenoids
      (alpha-carotene, lutein, and lycopene), flavonoids, folic acid, and vitamin B6. Plausible
      biological interactions between nutrients, such as fatty acids of the n-6 and n-3 series were
      also explored. Each participating center sent data on tape to the coordinating unit at the
      Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health. The relations of dietary factors
      and coronary heart disease were first estimated within each study and compared for
      consistency. Data were then combined to obtain the best overall estimates, taking into
      account the validity of dietary data collected at each center. Members from study centers met
      annually to discuss the interpretation of findings. Over 6,000 cases of myocardial infarction
      or coronary death were anticipated, which should have provided excellent precision in
      measuring associations, and allowed the comparison of extreme intakes that were poorly
      represented in individual studies.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
