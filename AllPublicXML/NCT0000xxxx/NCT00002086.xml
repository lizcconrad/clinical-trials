  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary: To determine whether the combination of zidovudine/zalcitabine/interferon alfa-n1
      (Retrovir/HIVID/Wellferon) can produce complete responses (i.e., CD4 counts return to &gt;= 800
      cells/mm3 for more than 24 weeks) in patients with virus sensitive to all three agents. To
      determine the antiviral effect of the combination therapies as evidenced by measures of
      quantitative viral load performed at select study centers only.

      Secondary: To determine the effectiveness of Retrovir/HIVID and Retrovir/HIVID/Wellferon in
      maintaining or increasing CD4 counts and preventing disease progression as evidenced by the
      development of an AIDS-defining indicator disease. To determine the effect of these regimens
      on secondary measures of clinical status (e.g., performance score, weight change, and
      secondary infections) and on measures of virologic activity such as serum p24 antigen. To
      assess the safety and tolerance of these regimens.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must have:

          -  HIV infection documented by licensed ELISA confirmed by Western blot; OR positive HIV
             culture; OR positive HIV antigen; OR plasma viremia.

          -  CD4 counts &gt;= 300 and &lt;= 500 cells/mm3 on two occasions within 30 days prior to study
             entry.

        Patients &lt; 18 years of age must have written consent of parent or guardian. The effects of
        the combination therapy on infants or the developing fetus are unknown. Patients are

        Patients with the following symptoms and conditions are excluded:

          -  Current AIDS-defining indicator disease, including opportunistic infections, AIDS
             dementia, AIDS-wasting syndrome, and AIDS-associated malignancy.

          -  Grade 2 or worse peripheral neuropathy.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Chemotherapeutic agents during the 76 weeks following study entry.

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  History of AIDS-defining indicator disease, including opportunistic infections, AIDS
             dementia, AIDS-wasting syndrome, or AIDS-associated malignancy.

          -  History of grade 2 or worse peripheral neuropathy.

          -  History of intolerance to Retrovir at 600 mg/day, HIVID at 2.25 mg/day, or any
             interferon-alfa product at 3.0 MU/day.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  More than 3 months of any prior antiretroviral therapy.

          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Immunomodulating agents such as systemic corticosteroids, IL-2, IFN-alfa, or IFN-beta
             within 4 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Cardiac glycosides, antiarrhythmics, or vasodilators.

        Prior Treatment:

        Excluded:

          -  Radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry. Current alcohol or illicit drug
