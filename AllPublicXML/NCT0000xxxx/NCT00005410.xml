      BACKGROUND:

      Ample data now exist to dispel the prevailing clinical impression that coronary heart disease
      (CHD) occurs infrequently in United States Blacks. It is well known that CHD is the leading
      cause of death among United States Blacks. Among patients with acute myocardial infarction
      who often present with typical ischemic chest pain, it has been shown that Blacks present
      more often without chest pain when compared to whites and Hispanics. In addition, more than
      25 percent of the myocardial infarction patients have unrecognized infarctions. Morbidity and
      mortality associated with angina pectoris, cardiovascular disease, and myocardial infarction
      occurs in United States Blacks at rates which are at least comparable to their white
      counterparts. Yet, there are limited epidemiological studies designed to identify the
      determinants of CHD in the Black population.

      The patients were originally screened to participate in a multicenter clinical trial on
      'Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) Following Myocardial Infarction.' Only 28
      patients out of 599 screened subjects were eligible for the SAVE study. The baseline data
      obtained from the 599 screened subjects comprised the database.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Data analysis was performed to: determine the prevalence of coronary heart disease in Blacks
      presenting with chest pain; identify the correlates of CHD in Blacks; determine the
      sensitivity and specificity of a Rose questionnaire angina in Blacks; determine the
      association between the Rose questionnaire angina and CHD manifestations in Blacks, and
      identify predictive and causal models of CHD.
