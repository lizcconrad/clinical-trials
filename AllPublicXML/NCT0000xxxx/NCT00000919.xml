  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of various combinations of anti-HIV
      drugs in HIV-positive men and women. Patients receive specific combinations of 3 or 4 of the
      following 6 drugs: didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T) efavirenz (EFV), nelfinavir (NFV),
      lamivudine (3TC), or zidovudine (ZDV).

      Anti-HIV therapy is effective in preventing the spread of HIV in the body. However, patients
      often experience unpleasant side effects and have difficulties following the dosing schedule.
      This study looks for combinations of anti-HIV drugs (&quot;cocktails&quot;) which will be the most
      effective with the fewest problems.

    <textblock>
      Highly active antiretroviral therapy, though effective in the suppression of HIV
      proliferation, is often complicated by difficulties with adherence and drug toxicity. Various
      combinations of highly active antiretroviral therapy exist; all have proved efficacious in
      related trials. The question addressed in this trial is which combination of antiretroviral
      &quot;cocktails&quot; provides the single greatest advantage in preventing the spread of HIV in the
      body. In effect, which therapy provides the greatest benefit with the fewest complications.

      Step 1: Patients are randomized to 1 of 6 arms:

      Arm A: didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), efavirenz (EFV), and nelfinavir (NFV) placebo.

      Arm B: ddI, d4T, EFV placebo, and NFV. Arm C: lamivudine (3TC)/zidovudine (ZDV), EFV, and NFV
      placebo. Arm D: 3TC/ZDV, EFV placebo, and NFV. Arm E: ddI, d4T, EFV, and NFV. Arm F: 3TC/ZDV,
      EFV, and NFV. Patients with virologic failure on 2 successive measurements or study-drug
      intolerance discontinue their randomized study therapy and proceed to Step 2. [AS PER
      AMENDMENT 7/5/00: Patients must switch regimens as soon as possible after confirmation of
      virologic failure to prevent development of drug resistance.]

      Step 2:

      Arm A: Patients receive treatment as in Arm D of Step 1. Arm B: Patients receive treatment as
      in Arm C of Step 1. Arm C: Patients receive treatment as in Arm B of Step 1. Arm D: Patients
      receive treatment as in Arm A of Step 1. Arms A, B, C, and D: Patients who fail Step 2
      treatment proceed to Step 3. Arms E and F: Patients with virologic failure on Step 1 proceed
      immediately to Step 3.

      Step 3 (salvage therapy):

      Arm A, B, C, and D: Patients receive indinavir (IDV), amprenavir (APV), ddI, and hydroxyurea
      (HU).

      [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/5/00: Patients now receive treatment on Regimen 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
      Regimen 1 consists of IDV, ritonavir (RTV), ddI, and HU. Regimen 2 consists of APV, RTV, ddI,
      and HU. Regimen 3 consists of IDV, RTV, abacavir (ABC), and 3TC/ZDV. Regimen 4 consists of
      APV, RTV, ABC, and 3TC/ZDV. Regimen 5 consists of IDV, RTV, ABC, d4T, and 3TC. Regimen 6
      consists of APV, RTV, ABC, d4T, and 3TC.] Arm E: Patients receive IDV, APV, and 3TC/ZDV. [AS
      PER AMENDMENT 7/5/00: Patients now receive treatment on Regimen 7 or 8. Regimen 7 consists of
      IDV, RTV, and 3TC/ZDV. Regimen 8 consists of APV, RTV, and 3TC/ZDV.] Arm F: Patients receive
      IDV, APV, ddI, and d4T. [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/5/00: Patients now receive treatment on Regimen 9
      or 10. Regimen 9 consists of IDV, RTV, ddI, and d4T. Regimen 10 consists of APV, RTV, ddI,
      and d4T.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/5/00: Patients already enrolled in Step 3 before site
      registration to Version 4.0 of this protocol have the option of receiving 1 of the
      appropriate new Step 3 regimens as outlined above or staying on their originally assigned
      Step 3 therapy.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 3/21/01: If virologic failure on Step 1 or 2 is confirmed,
      then HIV-1 RNA genotype resistance testing (in real-time, if possible) is performed. Patients
      receive 1 of the Step 3 drug regimens based on the results of the resistance testing.]
      Patients may co-enroll in metabolic, pharmacologic, immunologic, or adherence substudies.
