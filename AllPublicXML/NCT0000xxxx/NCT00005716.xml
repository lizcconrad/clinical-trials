      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Forty-two (42) elementary schools in urban Baltimore and Washington, DC, served as
      recruitment sites and approximately 300 students with moderate to severe asthma were
      enrolled. All participants enrolled in the A+ Asthma Program. Primary care practitioners of
      these students were randomized to a minimal contact program or to the A+ asthma physician
      partnership. They were offered a menu of educational offerings to improve their knowledge and
      skills. The primary outcome measure was emergency care use. Secondary measures included
      physician practices, hospitalization, health care utilization, restricted activities,
      medication use, school absences and coping skills.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
