  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are diagnostic
      tests that allow researchers to look at different chemical properties of tissue. Magnetic
      resonance imaging and spectroscopy studies can be used to gather or evaluate information
      about various aspects of patient s bodies or to monitor changes in the biochemistry and
      physiology of patient s bodies.

      Unlike other diagnostic techniques (CT scan and PET scan) MRI and MRS do not use ionizing
      radiation. Some studies have shown that MRI is more effective at distinguishing normal parts
      of the anatomy from abnormal anatomy, especially in the brain. MRI has become the diagnostic
      test of choice for evaluating patient with multiple sclerosis.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate normal volunteers and patients with a variety of
      diseases with magnetic resonance imaging. Researchers will attempt different magnetic
      resonance imaging methods and techniques as well as different levels of magnetic strength.

      Background:

      MRI is a constantly evolving imaging modality. Pulse sequences are often modified to improve
      their performance. However, many of these changes have not yet been approved by the FDA and
      therefore, are not considered standard of care. Some of these sequences require the use of
      new types of imaging coils, which are also investigational.

      Objectives:

      The major purpose of this protocol is to inform patients undergoing MR scans in the Clinical
      Center that they be scanned with MRI sequences and/or coils which may or may not be FDA
      approved and to get the patient s consent for this. This is not a formal research study since
      specific disease entities and specific pulse sequences are not studied in a systematic way.
      Rather, the purpose is to give NIH patients access to gradual improvements in MR technology
      that would otherwise not be available to them.

      Eligibility:

      All patients who, by virtue of the NIH protocol in which they are enrolled, qualify for MRI
      will be eligible for participation in this protocol.

      Design:

      Up to 99,999 participants will be enrolled in this study.

          -  Patients in whom the scan must be performed quickly, i.e. those patients under
             anesthesia, anxious patients, those requiring emergency medical care, or others in
             which it is deemed inappropriate to prolong a study.
