      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Approximately 498 of 750 normal and hypertensive subjects who were carefully characterized in
      terms of blood pressure response to salt loading and depletion in the late 1970s were
      re-examined to identify physiological factors contributing to salt-sensitivity of blood
      pressure. This helped to confirm preliminary observations suggesting that salt sensitivity in
      normotensive subjects predicted the subsequent development of hypertension with aging. In
      addition, longitudinal observations in hypertensive patients and in normotensives helped to
      determine whether salt-sensitivity or salt-resistance of blood pressure were associated with
      differences in the risk for development of specific forms of cardiovascular disease (stroke,
      angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure), renal and metabolic (diabetes
      mellitus) disorders.
