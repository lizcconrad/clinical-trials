  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety profile, assess pharmacokinetic properties (blood levels), and obtain
      preliminary indication of the antiviral and immunologic effects of recombinant CD4
      immunoglobulin G (CD4-IgG).

      CD4-IgG may be effective in blocking HIV transmission and spread, that is, CD4-IgG has
      antiviral effects. Studies done in adult patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex (ARC)
      have shown that rCD4 can be safely administered by intravenous bolus, intramuscular or
      subcutaneous injection. No serious or dose-limiting, drug-related toxicities have been
      observed to date.

      CD4-IgG may be effective in blocking HIV transmission and spread, that is, CD4-IgG has
      antiviral effects. Studies done in adult patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex (ARC)
      have shown that rCD4 can be safely administered by intravenous bolus, intramuscular or
      subcutaneous injection. No serious or dose-limiting, drug-related toxicities have been
      observed to date.

      Patients receive one intravenous injection the first week, followed by a 6 day washout period
      and then intravenous injections on a twice weekly basis from week 2 to week 12. The dose per
      injection may vary. The study evaluates 2 groups: (1) Children 3 months to 5 years of age;
      (2) Infants 0-3 months of age.
