  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine the safety and tolerance of the administration of ganciclovir and foscarnet given
      together or alternately; to determine the interactive pharmacokinetics (blood level) profile
      of long-term combined and alternating therapy with these two drugs. Additional objectives are
      to examine the effect of these treatments in controlling time to cytomegalovirus (CMV)
      retinitis progression and to examine the antiviral activity of combined and alternating
      ganciclovir/foscarnet treatment and development of antiviral resistance. Sight-threatening
      CMV retinitis occurs in at least 6 percent of AIDS patients. By 1991 (US), there may be 6000
      to 10000 patients with CMV retinitis. Many clinical reports suggest that both ganciclovir
      (DHPG) and foscarnet have an antiviral effect against CMV that is often associated with
      clinical stabilization. Effectiveness of ganciclovir and foscarnet is correlated with weekly
      maintenance and since toxicity is dose-limiting in up to 20 percent of patients receiving
      either drug for long periods, it may be beneficial in long-term maintenance treatment to
      combine or alternate these two drugs at a lower total weekly dose of each drug.

      This strategy may result in a greater net antiviral effect with less toxicity than is seen
      with either drug alone, because the toxicities of each drug are quite different.

      All patients have newly diagnosed CMV retinitis and have completed a 14-day course of
      intravenous ganciclovir or foscarnet induction therapy within 1 week prior to study entry.
      The maintenance period consists of a 12-week study period followed by a 40 week follow-up
      period. Treatment consists of either combined sequential daily maintenance therapy of both
      foscarnet and ganciclovir or alternating daily treatment with ganciclovir one day and
      foscarnet the following day.

             stable for at least 30 days prior to entry.

             study period if absolute neutrophil count is &gt; 1000 cells/mm3 and hemoglobin = or &gt; 8
             g/dl.

          -  Vancomycin.

          -  Fluconazole or investigational triazoles (e.g., itraconazole, SCH 39304) for

          -  Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis (except parenteral pentamidine).

          -  Acyclovir or other appropriate medication may be instituted in the event of the
             appearance of Herpes simplex virus

          -  (HSV) or Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infections.

          -  G-CSF or GM-CSF for grade 4 neutropenia.
