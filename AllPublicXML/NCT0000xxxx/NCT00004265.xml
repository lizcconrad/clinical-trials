      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients who
      have recurrent or refractory non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and response duration in patients with recurrent
      or refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with second line paclitaxel. II.
      Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this treatment regimen in relapsed
      patients with recurrent NSCLC. III. Evaluate the time to treatment failure and overall
      survival in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour weekly for 6 weeks. Courses repeat every
      8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-60 patients will be accrued for this study.
