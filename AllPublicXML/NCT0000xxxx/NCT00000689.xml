  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the toxicity and effectiveness of adding sargramostim (recombinant
      granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor; GM-CSF) to a standard chemotherapy drug
      combination (methotrexate, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
      dexamethasone) known as mBACOD in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in patients who are
      infected with HIV.

      Treatment of patients with AIDS-associated lymphoma is achieving inferior results when
      compared with outcomes for non-AIDS patients. Treatment with mBACOD has been promising, but
      the toxicity is very high. Patients treated with mBACOD have very low white blood cell
      counts. GM-CSF has increased the number of white blood cells in animal studies and
      preliminary human studies. It is hoped that including GM-CSF among the drugs given to
      lymphoma patients will prevent or lessen the decrease in white blood cells caused by mBACOD.

      Treatment of patients with AIDS-associated lymphoma is achieving inferior results when
      compared with outcomes for non-AIDS patients. Treatment with mBACOD has been promising, but
      the toxicity is very high. Patients treated with mBACOD have very low white blood cell
      counts. GM-CSF has increased the number of white blood cells in animal studies and
      preliminary human studies. It is hoped that including GM-CSF among the drugs given to
      lymphoma patients will prevent or lessen the decrease in white blood cells caused by mBACOD.

      Patients admitted to the study receive chemotherapy in 21-day cycles. The length of therapy,
      2 - 8 months, depends on how the tumor responds to treatment. Four medicines are given on day
      1 of each cycle by vein (IV) (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin, vincristine). Dosages
      of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide are increased in later groups of patients if toxicity in
      the first group is tolerable. A fifth medicine (dexamethasone) is given by mouth (PO) on days
      1 - 5 of each cycle and the sixth medicine (methotrexate) is given IV on day 15 of each
      cycle. Leucovorin is given after methotrexate to prevent methotrexate side effects. GM-CSF
      treatment is started on day 3 and continued for 11 days. To prevent the spread of the tumor,
      a spinal tap is done on 4 occasions to inject cytosine arabinoside directly into the spinal
      fluid. If tumor cells are present in the spinal fluid, the patient also takes cytosine
      arabinoside by spinal tap 3 x/week until the tumor cells disappear and then at monthly
      intervals for 1 year. Patients with tumor cells in the spinal fluid are also given radiation
      treatment to the head.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must have:

          -  Positive HIV antibody by ELISA with Western blot confirmation, or positive HIV culture
             or serum p24 antigen capture assay, or prior diagnosis of AIDS by the CDC surveillance
             criteria.

          -  Pathological diagnosis of large cell (cleaved or non-cleaved), immunoblastic, or small
             non-cleaved lymphoma, stage I, II, III, or IV.

          -  If displaying systemic (&quot;B&quot;) symptoms, evaluation for concurrent opportunistic
             infections as follows:

          -  Buffy coat for Mycobacterium intracellulare-avium (MAI) and cytomegalovirus (CMV)
             cultures; serum cryptococcal antigen; some measure of pulmonary function to exclude
             Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia including chest x-ray and either gallium scan, blood
             gases, or DLCO; stool culture and special stains for Salmonella, Isospora belli,
             cryptosporidium, CMV, and MAI in patients with diarrhea; computerized tomography (CT)
             scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain, or lumbar puncture for India ink,
             acid-fast bacilli smear, cryptococcal antigen, or fungal/mycobacterial culture.

        Bone marrow involvement is permitted if the patient meets the hematologic criteria above.

        Patients who have central nervous system (CNS) involvement at diagnosis or who are
        diagnosed during treatment will receive cranial radiotherapy:

        - The total dose of 2400 rads will be delivered at a rate of 200 rads/day to the mid plane
        employing parallel opposing, lateral whole brain fields. The lower border of the field will
        encompass C2 to cover the meninges.

          -  Patients will be treated 5 days/week, Monday through Friday, until the total
             prescribed dose has been completed.

          -  Radiation will begin as soon as possible after documentation of lymphomatous disease
             in the CNS. If a second course of treatment is required, the 2400 rads is well within
             whole brain tolerance for normal tissues (4500-5000 rads).
