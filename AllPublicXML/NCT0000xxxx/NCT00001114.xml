  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary: To evaluate the safety, toxicity, and antitumor activity of two doses of interferon
      alfa-2b (IFN-alpha) combined with a fixed dose of didanosine (ddI) in patients with Kaposi's
      sarcoma associated with HIV infection.

      Secondary: To evaluate the effects of combined IFN-alpha and ddI treatment on HIV expression
      and markers of immune function.

      Previous studies have shown that IFN-alpha can induce regression of Kaposi's sarcoma and
      suppression of HIV in some patients. Although various trials using IFN-alpha in combination
      with the nucleoside analogue zidovudine have demonstrated a high degree of antitumor activity
      and evidence of HIV suppression, the overlapping toxicity (primarily neutropenia) of these
      two agents has proven dose-limiting. The toxicity profile of ddI suggests that this drug may
      be better tolerated than zidovudine when combined with IFN-alpha.

      Previous studies have shown that IFN-alpha can induce regression of Kaposi's sarcoma and
      suppression of HIV in some patients. Although various trials using IFN-alpha in combination
      with the nucleoside analogue zidovudine have demonstrated a high degree of antitumor activity
      and evidence of HIV suppression, the overlapping toxicity (primarily neutropenia) of these
      two agents has proven dose-limiting. The toxicity profile of ddI suggests that this drug may
      be better tolerated than zidovudine when combined with IFN-alpha.

      Up to 90 patients are randomized to receive either low or high doses of IFN-alpha (1 or 10
      million Units/day) in combination with a fixed dose of ddI. Fourteen patients are initially
      entered at each dose level. If no objective antitumor responses are observed among the first
      14 patients at a given dose, no further patients are entered on that treatment arm. If one or
      more antitumor responses are seen at a given dose, up to 45 patients may be entered on that
      treatment arm. Patients must complete at least 4 weeks of study therapy to be considered
      evaluable for tumor response. Treatment is continued until tumor progression or unacceptable
      toxicity occurs. PER AMENDMENT 9/19/96: NOTE - After 16 weeks of treatment subjects may
      receive any FDA approved antiretroviral drug regimen in addition to or in place of ddI.
