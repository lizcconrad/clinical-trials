      The purposes of this study are to identify the genes responsible for inherited connective
      tissue disorders and learn about the range of medical problems they cause. It will
      investigate whether specific gene changes cause specific medical problems and will establish
      diagnostic criteria (signs and symptoms) for the individual syndromes.

      Children and adults with a known or suspected inherited connective tissue disorder (Marfan,
      Ehlers-Danlos or Stickler syndrome, or other closely related disorders) and their family
      members may be eligible for this study.

      Patients enrolled in the study will have a medical history, physical examination and blood
      tests, as well as other procedures that may include:

        -  Echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart)

        -  X-rays and other imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or
           computerized tomography (CT) scans

        -  Lung function studies

        -  Urine tests

        -  Skin biopsy (removal of a small piece of tissue, under local anesthetic, for microscopic
           examination)

        -  Examination by various specialists (e.g., in ophthalmology, gastroenterology,
           rehabilitation medicine) as needed

        -  Questionnaires regarding chronic pain and fatigue, quality of life, and the impact of
           the connective tissue disorder on the patient and family.

      (Patients who wish to enroll but cannot travel to NIH may have a more limited participation,
      including review of medical records, telephone interview regarding personal and family
      history, and collection of a specimen (blood, skin biopsy, or other) for genetic testing.

      Patients will be notified of genetic testing results that show a change responsible for their
      connective tissue disorder. If they wish, the information will also be sent to their local
      health care provider, along with recommendations for additional tests or treatment options.
      No treatment is offered as part of this study.

      Participating family members who do not themselves have a connective tissue disorder will
      provide a small blood sample for gene testing and be interviewed by telephone about their
      personal and family health history. Those whose blood test results show a gene change
      associated with a connective tissue disorder will be invited to NIH for a discussion of the
      findings or referred to a genetic center in their area.

      We will investigate the clinical manifestations and molecular genetic defects of heritable
      connective tissue disorders, concentrating on the Marfan, Stickler, and Ehlers-Danlos
      syndromes. Although each of these conditions has been known for many years, the full spectrum
      of the associated phenotypes continues to be expanded and the genetic etiology of these
      conditions has not been completely elucidated. In addition, many patients have features
      overlapping two or more of the described syndromes, precluding unequivocal diagnosis. The
      goals of this study are to further define and characterize the full phenotype and natural
      history of these disorders, and to perform genetic linkage, gene identification, mutation
      detection, and genotype/phenotype correlations in affected individuals and families.
      Individuals suspected to have Marfan, Stickler or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or a closely related
      disorder, as well as interested family members, will be enrolled. Participants will undergo
      genetic analyses and periodic clinical assessment. The expected outcomes will be improved
      clinical descriptions of the conditions and gene and mutation identification with analysis of
      genotype/phenotype correlations.
