      RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop
      cancer cells from growing.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy in treating patients
      with glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the time to progression in patients with glioblastoma multiforme or
      anaplastic astrocytoma (primary presentation) treated with surgical resection, radiotherapy,
      and T cell immunotherapy as initial therapy. II. Determine the toxic effects of this therapy
      in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are vaccinated with irradiated, autologous tumor cells plus sargramostim
      (GM-CSF) intradermally near draining lymph nodes in the groin or axillary regions. This is
      then followed by 3 consecutive days of intradermal injections of GM-CSF only, directly into
      the vaccine sites. Enlarged lymph nodes are then removed 7-10 days later and activated with
      staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). T cells are expanded ex vivo
      over approximately 10 days. 1-2 days prior to infusion, oral cyclophosphamide is administered
      as a one time dose. The lymphocyte infusion is then administered intravenously. Based on
      availability, patients may receive vaccine boosts with additional injections of irradiated
      autologous tumor cells thawed from the original, cryopreserved collection. Patients are
      followed at 1 month and then every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
