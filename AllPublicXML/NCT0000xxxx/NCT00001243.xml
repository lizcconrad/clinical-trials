      This study will examine the effects of HIV on bone marrow cells. Various types of cells from
      bone marrow will be studied to learn which cells become infected with HIV, what changes occur
      in the number of or growth patterns of the cells, what kinds of proteins the cells make in
      the presence or absence of HIV and whether the cells can function normally.

      HIV-infected and non-infected individuals 18 years of age and older may participate in this
      study.

      Participants will undergo the following procedures:

        -  Blood draw: Blood will be drawn through a needle from a hand or arm vein. About 150
           milliliters (10 tablespoons) will be collected each time. No more than 450 ml (30
           tablespoons) will be taken over a 6-week period.

        -  Bone marrow aspirate: Bone marrow will be drawn from the hipbone. For this procedure, a
           local anesthetic is injected in the skin over the hipbone. A small needle is put about
           1/2-inch through the shell of the bone and about 3 to 4 teaspoons of marrow are drawn
           from the cavity into a syringe.

      White cells from marrow of uninfected individuals may be infected with HIV in the laboratory
      and grown over time for study. Alternatively, uninfected cells may be used as controls to
      compare with cells from HIV-infected individuals.

      White cells from marrow of HIV-infected individuals will be grown in the laboratory and
      studied in comparison with cells from uninfected individuals. Or, bone marrow cells may be
      injected into immune-deficient mice to try to develop an animal model for HIV infection.
      White blood cells will also be studied in the laboratory to learn how the immune system
      responds to HIV infection.

    <textblock>
      Hematologic abnormalities occur with high frequency (up to 70% of patients) in human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. The pathogenesis of these abnormalities is
      not currently understood, although both an abnormal bone marrow environment (e.g., altered
      growth factor production) and direct infection and dysfunction of progenitor cells themselves
      have been postulated. Under the current protocol we have studied bone marrow precursor cells
      from both HIV infected and uninfected individuals and have shown not only that these cells
      are infectable in vitro with HIV but also infected in vivo in a subpopulation of seropositive
      individuals. While the effects of HIV infection of precursor cells on subsequent
      hematopoietic potential is not completely understood, we could not show a clear correlation
      between in vivo infection of these cells and suppressed hematopoiesis. It seems clear from
      this study and others that other alterations within the bone marrow environment must play a
      role in the clinically observed hematologic abnormalities. We therefore wish to continue our
      studies to elucidate the relative contributions of direct infection of myeloid progenitor
      cells and alterations in bone marrow environment in the pathology seen in HIV infected
      individuals. Understanding the pathogenesis of abnormal hematopoiesis in HIV infection will
      allow investigators to design appropriate therapeutic strategies. Using recently developed
      techniques we also wish to use bone marrow cells from HIV infected individuals to establish
      antibody libraries. This will allow the study of immunologically important epitopes on the
      HIV virion with potential impact on the subsequent design of HIV vaccines or introduction of
      passive immunotherapy. Thirdly, research in the field of HIV has been hampered by the lack of
      an appropriate animal model. One promising approach is the use of human bone marrow to
      reconstitute lethally irradiated Balb/c mice. Once the human hematopoietic system is
      established in the mouse, it may be possible to infect these animals with HIV and study in an
      in vivo model the effects of infection on hematopoiesis.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Both HIV seropositive and seronegative individuals.

        Have adequate blood counts (HIV positive volunteers: hemoglobin greater than or equal to
        9.0 g/dL, HCT greater than or equal to 28%, platelets greater than or equal to 50,000; HIV
        negative healthy normal volunteers: hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12.5 g/dL, HCT
        greater than or equal to 38%, platelets greater than or equal to 150,000.

        Aged 18 years or older, male or female.

        Ability to give informed, written consent.

        This protocol was amended in 1990 to allow inclusion of Zairian patients who were studied
        by the principal investigator on site in Zaire. These marrow aspirations were all performed
        in March-April 1990 before the current requirements for Multi-site Collaborations were
        instituted. At this time, no further off-site collaboration will be undertaken under this
        protocol.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Women who are pregnant.

        Patients/volunteers with blood clotting disorders as demonstrated by an elevated PT, PTT or
        low platelet count (Seropositive: platelets greater than or equal to 50,000; Seronegative:
        platelets greater than or equal to150,000.

        Patients/Volunteers who are taking NSAIDS or other anti-coagulant medication.
