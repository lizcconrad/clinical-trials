      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients
      who have stage IV, or relapsed malignant melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety of administering MART-1 peptide-pulsed dendritic cells to patients
           with stage IV or relapsed malignant melanoma.

        -  Determine the immunological and clinical responses in this patient population after this
           therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis between days -14 to -8. Mononuclear cells are isolated, used
      to generate dendritic cells (DC), and then pulsed with MART-1 peptide. Patients are
      vaccinated with MART-1 peptide-pulsed DC either IV or intradermally on days 0, 14, and 28.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MART-1 peptide-pulsed DC until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Patients require a single leukapheresis to obtain 2x10^9 PBL, which are cryopreserved in RPMI 1640, 20% autologous serum, 10% DMSO. Aliquots are thawed at days -7, 7 and 21 for the first, second, and third immunizations respectively. Blood is drawn at the time of leukapheresis and on the day of the first vaccination for autologous serum, which is sufficient for the cell cultures of all patient groups.</description>
