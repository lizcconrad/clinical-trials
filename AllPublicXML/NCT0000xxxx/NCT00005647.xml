      RATIONALE: SU5416 may stop the growth of head and neck cancer by stopping blood flow to the
      tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining SU5416 with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of SU5416 and paclitaxel in treating
      patients who have recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic cancer of the head and neck.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of SU5416 and paclitaxel in patients
           with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer.

        -  Determine the antiangiogenesis effect of this combination regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity, pharmacodynamic effects, and pharmacokinetic parameters of this
           combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over one hour on day 1 and SU5416 IV over one hour on days 1
      and 4. Treatment continues weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel and SU5416 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-15 months.
