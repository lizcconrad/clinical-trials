  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that specialized pacemaking devices (DDD pacing) can improve the
      symptoms associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in adults. In addition, studies
      have also shown that specialized pacemaking devices (DDD pacing) can improve conditions of
      HCM in children. However, growth of the body and organs, including the heart, is very rapid
      during childhood. Therefore the long-term effects of DDD pacing in children are unknown.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the growth rate and nutrition of children with HCM.
      Due to this heart condition and the restrictions that are often placed on the child's
      activity level, children with HCM may grow at a slower rat and may have a greater tendency to
      be overweight.

      Children participating in the study will have their growth rate and nutritional status
      measured before the study begins and throughout the course of the study.

      Findings in this research study will not directly benefit the patients participating in it.
      However, information gathered as a result of this study may lead to improvements in the
      management of children with HCM in the future.

      Several studies have shown that dual chamber (DDD) pacemaker therapy relieves LV outflow
      obstruction and improves symptoms in most adult patients with obstructive hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy (HCM). It is however, uncertain whether DDD pacing will be efficacious in
      children with obstructive HCM, because of evolving cardiac morphology and increased LV
      hypertrophy and outflow obstruction associated with rapid body growth. We propose to monitor
      clinical progress, and cardiac morphologic and hemodynamic changes over several years
      following implantation of a DDD pacemaker in children who present with obstructive HCM
      between the ages of 5 to 15 years. Functional status, myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, and
      LV outflow obstruction will be evaluated by exercise tests, echocardiography, thallium
      scintigraphy, Holter monitoring, electrophysiologic and cardiac catheterization studies. The
      results of pacemaker therapy will be compared with the findings in a cohort of young patients
      with obstructive HCM who elect not to be treated with DDD pacemaker.
