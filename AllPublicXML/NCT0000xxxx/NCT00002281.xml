  <brief_summary>

      To evaluate the safety, tolerance and biological activity of filgrastim (granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF) given by daily subcutaneous (SC) injection prior to and
      concomitantly with erythropoietin (EPO) and zidovudine (AZT) in patients with AIDS or severe
      AIDS related complex (ARC). To evaluate the safety, tolerance, and biological activity of EPO
      given 3 times weekly by SC injection concomitantly with G-CSF and prior to and concomitantly
      with AZT in patients with AIDS or severe ARC. To study the safety and tolerance of 3 dose
      levels of AZT given to patients with AIDS or severe ARC concomitantly treated with G-CSF and
      EPO. To study the effect of G-CSF alone and in combination with EPO on HIV replication in
      vivo as measured by circulating HIV p24 antigen, plasma HIV viremia and semiquantitative HIV
      cocultures.
