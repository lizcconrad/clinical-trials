  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DDD pacing improves symptoms and relieves LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction in most
      patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Notably, when pacing is temporarily
      discontinued, the beneficial effects of pacing are evident in sinus rhythm. The long term
      results of this novel therapy are, however, uncertain. We propose (1) to record the
      hemodynamic changes following &gt;4 years of pacing; and (2) to determine whether DDD pacing
      continues to be necessary in patients who have had a substantial relief of their LVOT
      obstruction. Patients who have had &gt;50% reduction in LVOT pressure gradients will be
      randomized to two pacing modalities: DDD at 70 beats per minute and AAI pacing at 70 beats
      per minute (DDD switched off), and reevaluated after a six-month period.

        Group 1:

        HCM patients, aged grater than 20 years of either gender who received DDD pacemakers at the
        NIH at least 4 years ago, for relief of LVOT obstruction and drug-refractory symptoms.

        Group 2:

        HCM patients selected from Group 1 who at the follow-up cardiac catheterization are
        demonstrated to have either (1) no significant LVOT obstruction (less than 30mm HG at rest
        and less than 50mm HG with Isuprel); or (2) a substantial reduction of the LVOT obstruction
        (greater than 50% reduction in LVOT gradient).

        Patient who have developed a heart block will be excluded from group 2.

        Females must have a negative pregnancy test.
