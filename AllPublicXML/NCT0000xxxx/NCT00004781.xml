      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the development of oral manifestations of human immunodeficiency
      virus infection in relationship to the onset of immunologic alterations and systemic symptoms
      in different risk groups: gay/bisexual men, male intravenous drug users, and female
      intravenous drug users.

      II. Evaluate the immune and inflammatory response to periodontal and other microbial
      pathogens.

      III. Evaluate the bacterial species infecting the oral cavity in patients in these risk
      groups.
