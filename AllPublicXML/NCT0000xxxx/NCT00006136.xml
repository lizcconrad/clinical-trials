      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether arginine butyrate with or without epoetin alfa can stimulate
      gamma-globin chain production to a degree that decreases anemia and results in hematologic
      improvement in patients with thalassemia intermedia.

      II. Determine whether a proportional increase in gamma-globin synthesis and mRNA and an
      improvement in nonalfa and alfaglobin chain imbalance by at least 10% over baseline correlate
      with improved hematologic response in these patients when treated with this regimen.

      III. Determine whether a decrease in hemolysis, as assayed by a decrease in LDH, compared to
      baseline levels correlates with improved hematologic response in these patients when treated
      with this regimen.

      IV. Determine whether any particular genotypes are more responsive than others to this
      therapy in these patients.

      V. Determine whether baseline epoetin alfa levels, gender, and/or baseline reticulocyte
      counts (or percent circulating nucleated erythroblasts) correlate with improved hematologic
      response in these patients when treated with this regimen.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive arginine butyrate IV over
      6-14 hours on days 1-5 of weeks 1-4 and 7-10. Patients then receive maintenance arginine
      butyrate IV over 6-14 hours on days 1-4 of weeks 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25.

      Patients who have no medical contraindications (e.g., paraspinal extramedullary
      hematopoiesis, hypertension, or poorly controlled congestive heart failure) may continue
      therapy. Patients receive arginine butyrate IV over 6-14 hours on days 1-4 of weeks 27, 29,
      31, 33, 35, 37, and 39 and epoetin alfa intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC) three
      times weekly on weeks 27-40.

      Patients may continue to receive epoetin alfa IM or SC alone three times weekly on weeks
      41-52. Patients with severe anemia (hemoglobin less than 7 g/dL) may receive epoetin alfa
      alone on weeks 1-12 before arginine butyrate induction therapy.

      Patients who complete therapy at week 26 are followed every 2 weeks for 2 months. Patients
      who complete therapy at week 40 are followed monthly for 2 months.
