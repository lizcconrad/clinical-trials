      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine and liposomal doxorubicin
      in treating women who have metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rate, duration of response, time to disease progression,
      and duration of survival of women with metastatic breast cancer when treated with gemcitabine
      and doxorubicin HCl liposome.

      II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of this
      treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine intravenous (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and
      doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 2.5 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 20 months.
