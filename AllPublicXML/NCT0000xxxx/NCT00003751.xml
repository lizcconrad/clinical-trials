  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Penicillamine may stop the growth of glioblastomas by stopping blood flow to the
      tumor. A diet low in copper may interfere with the growth of brain tumor cells. Radiation
      therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining these therapies may be
      effective in treating glioblastoma.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of penicillamine, a low copper diet, and
      radiation therapy in treating patients who have newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of penicillamine and copper reduction on survival and
      time to progression in adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. II. Determine the effect of
      penicillamine on the reduction of serum copper in these patients. III. Determine whether
      penicillamine reduces the tumor volume, vascularity, invasion, and edema in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral penicillamine on the following schedule: Week 1: once daily
      Week 2: two times daily Week 3: three times daily Week 4: four times daily Week 5 to end of
      study: increased dose four times daily. Patients also receive oral pyridoxine daily and
      maintain a low copper diet (no greater than 0.5 mg/day). This regimen is continued for up to
      2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Radiotherapy is
      administered over 6 weeks, beginning on day 1 of penicillamine therapy. Patients are followed
      every month (with MRI every 2 months) until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
