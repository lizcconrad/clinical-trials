      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and efficacy of a short course (72 hours) of intravenous
      acetylcysteine in patients with acute liver failure for whom no antidote or specific
      treatment is available.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to receive
      intravenous acetylcysteine or placebo for 72 hours. Treatment must begin within 12 hours of
      hospitalization. Patients who advance to grade III or IV encephalopathy are eligible for
      liver transplantation.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria

        This is a phase III blinded study, which will involve approximately 200 patients. For this
        purpose, acute liver failure will be defined as onset of any mental status alteration and
        coagulopathy (INR &gt; 1.5) within 26 weeks of onset of a hepatitic illness, with no evidence
        of underlying chronic liver disease. Eligible patients will be those admitted to study site
        hospital intensive care units with acute liver failure and who can be evaluated and started
        on treatment within the first 24 hours of hospitalization or those who evolve to altered
        mentation if already in the hospital. All subjects will be between 18 and 70 years.
        Patients transferred from referring hospitals to a study site may be considered for
        enrollment, provided that no other specific treatment protocol has begun, and that no liver
        support device (bioartificial liver (BAL), extracorporeal liver assist device (ELAD),
        transgenic pig perfusion) has been used or is contemplated. Use of fresh frozen plasma
        infusions will not disqualify patients from participation.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Patients less than age 18 or over 70 years of age.

          2. ALF patients where acetaminophen or mushroom poisoning is assessed or Suspected to be
             a significant contributing or sole cause of the illness. Both these diagnoses require
             specific antidote therapy, including NAC in the case of acetaminophen, rather than
             randomized or non-specific treatment.

          3. Patients with a diagnosis of shock liver (ischemic hepatopathy), since the overall
             outcome for these patients in largely determined by the underlying etiology of the
             condition leading to shock. Heat stroke is not excluded.

          4. Acute liver failure of pregnancy or the HELLP syndrome (pregnancy associated hemolysis
             and coagulopathy). The effect of NAC on the fetus or the mother has not been
             determined; in addition, pregnancy-related liver diseases usually mandate rapid
             delivery of the infant.

          5. ALF thought secondary to intrahepatic malignancy. Patients with hepatic malignancy
             experiencing ALF have 100% mortality and are not transplant candidates.

          6. Patients who exhibit signs of cerebral herniation at the time of enrollment.

          7. Patients who demonstrate the presence of intractable arterial hypotension (arterial
             systolic blood pressure equal to or below 70 mmHg) present, or require inotropic drugs
             at the time of enrollment.

          8. Severe sepsis (temperature &gt;39o C and/or significant bacteremia) present at the time
             of enrollment.

        In general, acute liver failure (ALF) patients comprise somewhat more women than men, but
        there is no preponderance of any racial group, other than that expected on the basis of
        geographic differences. No exclusion will be made on the basis of race, ethnic group or
        gender. Criteria for inclusion of women and minorities will be those established in the NIH
        guidelines. Each study site will provide for review a log of patients considered for the
        NAC study with no identifiers, yielding only gender and age, race and reason for not
        participating as a check on gender or ethnic bias.
