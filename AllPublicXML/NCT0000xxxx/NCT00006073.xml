  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate healthy normal volunteers and patients with a variety of endocrine
      disorders to 1) learn more about conditions that affect the endocrine glands (glands that
      secrete hormones) and 2) train physicians in endocrinology.

      Patients with endocrine-related conditions and healthy volunteers of all ages may be eligible
      for this study.

      All participants will have a physical examination medical and history. They may be required
      to provide blood, saliva or urine samples and undergo ultrasound (using sound waves) or
      magnetic resonance (using a magnetic field) imaging to visualize internal body structures.

      Some healthy adult volunteers will have hormone-stimulating tests to assess endocrine
      function. These tests measure blood hormone levels before and after injection of a synthetic
      form of a hormone. A device called a heparin lock, through which the hormone is injected and
      the blood samples are collected, is placed in a vein in the arm or hand. Blood samples are
      drawn before the hormone is injected and at various intervals after the injection to measure
      levels of the hormone. These tests, which last from 1 to 3 hours, may include the following:

        1. CRH stimulation test corticotropin-releasing hormone is given to test pituitary and
           adrenal gland function

        2. ACTH stimulation test adrenocorticotrophic hormone is given to test adrenal gland
           function

        3. LHRH stimulation test luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone is given to test pituitary
           gland function

        4. TRH stimulation test thyroid-releasing hormone is given to test pituitary and thyroid
           gland function

        5. GHRH stimulation test growth hormone releasing hormone is given to measure growth
           hormone levels.

      An oral glucose tolerance test, which is similar to the stimulation tests, may also be done
      to measure blood glucose (sugar) and insulin levels after drinking a sugary liquid.

      Healthy volunteers and patients with a hereditary endocrine disorder and their family members
      may also be asked to provide a blood sample for genetic studies of inherited endocrine
      disorders. Patients with endocrine-related disorders may be offered medical or surgical
      treatment for their disorder.

      This protocol is designed to allow endocrine-related evaluations of healthy subjects and
      patients with a variety of endocrine disorders. Healthy subjects may be studied to obtain
      normative data for endocrine tests involving blood, urine, saliva, ultrasound and magnetic
      resonance examinations. If not eligible for a specific NICHD research protocol, patients with
      endocrine-related conditions may be evaluated under the auspices of this protocol to advance
      the clinical skills of physicians participating in NICHD clinical research and training
      programs, and to provide stimuli for new clinical research initiatives. Standard,
      medically-indicated laboratory or radiological studies may be performed to confirm a
      diagnosis or to aid in the management of the patient. In some cases, the patient will receive
      medical or surgical treatment for their disorder, according to current clinical practice. The
      overall purpose of endocrine evaluations under this protocol is to support our clinical
      training and research missions.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Healthy subjects and patients with endocrine-related conditions of all ages are eligible
        for this protocol. The actual selection of patients most appropriate for clinical training
        needs will be made by protocol investigators.

        Subjects with disabilities are not formally excluded from the study unless the disability
        would specifically prevent their participation. If a subject with cognitive impairment
        wishes to participate, there must be available a family member or other qualified
        individual holding a durable power of attorney who is able to guide the impaired subject s
        participation and be an advocate for their interests. This participation is limited to the
        non-research, clinical training arm of the study.
