      RATIONALE: 4'-Iodo-4'-deoxydoxorubicin may improve organ dysfunction and ease symptoms caused
      by primary systemic amyloidosis.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 4'-iodo-4'-deoxydoxorubicin in treating
      patients who have primary systemic amyloidosis.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the clinical efficacy of 4'-iodo-4'-deoxydoxorubicin in producing
      palliation of symptoms and/or improvement of organ dysfunction caused by organ infiltration
      by amyloid in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis. II. Assess the safety profile, with
      emphasis on cardiac safety, of this drug in these patients. III. Evaluate the time to
      progression of amyloidosis-associated clinical symptoms and/or organ dysfunction, duration of
      response, and survival of these patients on this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive 4'-iodo-4'-deoxydoxorubicin IV over 1 hour once a week for 4 weeks.
      Courses are repeated every 12 weeks. Treatment continues for up to 4 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
