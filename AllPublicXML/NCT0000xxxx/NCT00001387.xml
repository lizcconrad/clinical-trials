  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paclitaxel is an active antitumor agent that has demonstrated a broad range of activity in
      preclinical and clinical studies. The optimal dose and schedule has not yet been determined
      in either adults or children. The objective of this trial is to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose and the toxicities of paclitaxel given as a short hour infusion in children
      with refractory malignancy. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel given in this way
      will be studied and both model-dependent and model-independent parameters will be determined.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

        Histologically confirmed cancer (including leukemia) that is: Refractory to standard

        Biologic Therapy: Not specified.

        Chemotherapy: No prior taxanes. At least 3 weeks since myelosuppressive therapy (6 weeks
        since nitrosourea).

        Endocrine Therapy: Not specified.

        Radiotherapy: Prior extensive craniospinal or pelvic irradiation allowed.

        Surgery: Ineligible for potential curative surgery.

        Other: Prior bone marrow transplant allowed.

        Performance status: ECOG 0-2;

        Life expectancy: At least 8 weeks.

        Hematopoietic: (except with leukemia, bone marrow involvement, history of bone marrow
        transplantation, or extensive prior radiotherapy).

        Absolute granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm(3);

        Platelet count at least 100,000/mm(3);

        OTHER:

        No concurrent anticonvulsant therapy.

        No grade 2 or worse neuropathy.

        No significant systemic illness (e.g., infection) that could compromise drug excretion or
        confuse assessment of toxicity.
