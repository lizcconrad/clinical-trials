  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 2 drugs (AmBisome
      versus voriconazole) in treating fungal infections. Immunocompromised patients, especially
      those with persistent fever and neutropenia, are at a high risk of developing deeply
      invasive, life-threatening fungal infections with Candida, Aspergillus, and other
      opportunistic fungal pathogens. The risk of fungal infection increases in direct proportion
      with severity of neutropenia and duration of fever. Antifungal therapy, therefore, is an
      important step in the amelioration of fungal disease.

      Patients are first split into groups to receive either voriconazole or AmBisome. Both drugs
      are given through a vein (IV) for at least 3 days. At the conclusion of 3 days, the
      voriconazole patients are then switched to oral voriconazole. The AmBisome patients continue
      with IV AmBisome. Both groups continue treatment until blood counts increase and fever
      subsides.

          -  Are hospitalized with low white blood cell counts.

          -  Have received at least 96 hours of IV antibiotics.

          -  Have an oral temperature (or equivalent) of 38.0 C (100.4 F) or greater within the 24
             hours before the study starts.

          -  Are not pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Agree to use a barrier method of contraception (e.g., a condom) during the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a serious fungal infection.

          -  Have a history of an allergic reaction to antifungal agents.

          -  Are taking certain medications which may interfere with the study drug.

          -  Have previously participated in this trial.

          -  Have any conditions which could affect your safety, make evaluation of response
             difficult, or make it unlikely that you can complete the course of therapy.
