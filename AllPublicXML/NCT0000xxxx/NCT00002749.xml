      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of carboplatin in patients with
      progressive glioma.

    <textblock>
      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the response to carboplatin (CBDCA) in patients with progressive
      low-grade gliomas. II. Assess the activity of CBDCA in stabilizing the growth of these
      tumors.

      OUTLINE: Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Carboplatin, CBDCA, NSC-241240.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 evaluable patients will be entered if there is at least 1
      response in the first 9 patients.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed primary intracranial low-grade glioma
        (i.e., astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma) No more than 2 years since tissue diagnosis Biopsy
        not required for intrinsic chiasmatic mass or tumor infiltration along the posterior optic
        tracts Evidence of progressive disease by at least one of the following: Papilledema or
        other clinical sign of increased intracranial pressure Documented change in neuroimaging
        studies, e.g.: Hydrocephalus 25% increase in product of maximum perpendicular diameters of
        tumor The following are required in patients with optic pathway gliomas: Progressive loss
        of vision documented by an ophthalmologist, i.e.: Doubling of octaves (e.g., 20/20 to 20/40
        or 20/40 to 20/80) on 2 successive visits Loss of visual acuity not explainable by other
        causes, e.g., media abnormalities or amblyopia Greater than 3 mm increase in proptosis At
        least 2 mm increase in diameter of optic nerve on neuroimaging Increase in distribution of
        tumor involving the optic tracts or optic radiations demonstrated by CT or MRI using T1
        (with or without contrast) or T2 imaging

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Any age Performance status: Karnofsky 70%-100% Life
        expectancy: At least 12 weeks Hematopoietic: ANC at least 1,500 Platelets at least 100,000
        Hemoglobin at least 8.0 g/dL Hepatic: Bilirubin less than 1.5 times normal ALT less than
        1.5 times normal Renal: Creatinine less than 1.5 mg/dL Other: Negative pregnancy test
        required of fertile women Effective contraception required of fertile patients

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: At least 12 weeks since radiotherapy (4 weeks since other
        therapy) and recovered Prior chemotherapy allowed with subsequent disease progression
