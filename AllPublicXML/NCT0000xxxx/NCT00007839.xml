      RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as beta alethine use different ways to stimulate the
      immune system and stop cancer cells from growing.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of beta alethine in treating patients
      who have low-grade lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor effects of low-dose beta-alethine in patients with low grade
           B-cell lymphoma.

        -  Assess the effects of this regimen on delayed-type hypersensitivity in these patients.

        -  Assess the safety of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is an multicenter study.

      Patients receive low-dose beta-alethine subcutaneously once every 2 weeks for a total of 6
      doses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients with no evidence of tumor progression
      may receive additional courses of therapy.

      Patients are followed for 2 weeks from the last dose or for a minimum of 30 days if they
      withdraw due to an adverse event.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 13-37 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed low grade B-cell lymphoma

               -  Measurable residual disease after maximal response to prior chemotherapy OR

               -  Indolent disease not yet requiring therapy

          -  No primary lymphoma of the brain

          -  No active brain involvement or leptomeningeal disease NOTE: A new classification
             scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of
             &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former terminology of &quot;low&quot;,
             &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former
             terminology.
