      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and combining chemotherapy with
      surgery may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well irinotecan and cisplatin followed by
      surgery, floxuridine, and cisplatin work in treating patients with stomach cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the complete and partial response rates and time to treatment failure in
           patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with neoadjuvant irinotecan and cisplatin
           followed by surgery then intraperitoneal floxuridine and cisplatin.

        -  Determine the rate of potentially curative surgery in patients receiving this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity and tolerance of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cisplatin IV and irinotecan IV once a week for 4 weeks. This course
      is repeated 2 weeks later.

      Patients who achieve complete or partial remission or stable disease undergo resection 4
      weeks after the last chemotherapy dose.

      Patients with no residual macroscopic disease begin adjuvant intraperitoneal (IP)
      chemotherapy 1 week after surgery. Chemotherapy consists of floxuridine IP over 30 minutes on
      days 1-3 and days 22-24 and cisplatin IP on days 3 and 24.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-33 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
