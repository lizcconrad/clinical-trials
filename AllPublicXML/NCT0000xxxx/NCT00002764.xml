      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not
      yet known whether surgery plus combination chemotherapy is more effective than surgery alone
      in treating patients with lung metastases from soft tissue sarcoma.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery plus combination
      chemotherapy with that of surgery alone in treating patients who have soft tissue sarcoma
      that has spread to the lung.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare disease control, overall survival, and relapse-free survival in
      patients with lung metastases secondary to soft tissue sarcoma treated with high-dose
      doxorubicin and ifosfamide with or without filgrastim (G-CSF) before and after metastasectomy
      vs metastasectomy alone. II. Determine the safety and morbidity of this regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      location of metastases (unilateral vs bilateral). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms. Arm I: Patients are assigned to regimen A or B. Regimen A: Patients receive high-dose
      doxorubicin IV and ifosfamide IV continuously on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously
      on days 3-13. Regimen B: Patients receive chemotherapy as above without G-CSF. Treatment on
      both regimens continues every 3 weeks for 3 courses. Patients then undergo radical pulmonary
      metastasectomy via thoracotomy or sternotomy with wedge resection or lobectomy. Patients with
      responding disease after metastasectomy receive 2 additional courses on the regimen to which
      they were originally assigned. Arm II: Patients undergo radical pulmonary metastasectomy as
      in arm I. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 340 patients (170 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within approximately 4.5 years.
