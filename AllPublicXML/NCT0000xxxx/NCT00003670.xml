      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of ovarian cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      arzoxifene hydrochloride may fight ovarian or peritoneal cancer by blocking the use of
      estrogen by the tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well arzoxifene hydrochloride works in treating
      women with metastatic refractory ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate response rate to arzoxifene hydrochloride in patients with metastatic
      refractory ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer. II. Determine the time to
      progressive disease, time to treatment failure, response duration, and survival of these
      patients. III. Assess the safety of this treatment in these patients. IV. Measure changes in
      serum estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and sex hormone binding
      globulin during this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral arzoxifene hydrochloride daily at a fixed dose. Treatment
      continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified

      National Cancer Institute (NCI) registered this trial with Eli Lilly as sponsor. NCI did not
      update the record when the trial completed. In June 2012, NCI transferred the trial to
      Lilly's clinicaltrials.gov account and Lilly updated the record with the trial completion
      date. This trial is not an applicable trial under Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act
      of 2007 (FDAAA).

        cancer OR primary peritoneal cancer provided the clinical and pathological features of the
        tumor are similar to primary ovarian epithelial carcinoma Patients must have received prior
        chemotherapy including at least one platinum analogue and one taxane analogue unless
        patient is poor candidate for these treatments due to neuropathy, nephropathy, or
        hypersensitivity (to Taxol only) Bidimensionally measurable disease by x-ray, CT scan, MRI,
        or physical exam Ascites not considered measurable or evaluable Hormone receptor status:
