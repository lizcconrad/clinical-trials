      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Interferon
      alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. It is not yet known whether giving
      radiation therapy with interferon alfa-2b is more effective than giving interferon alfa-2b
      alone in treating melanoma.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus
      interferon alfa-2b with that of interferon alfa-2b alone in treating patients who have
      melanoma that has metastasized to lymph nodes in the neck, under the arm, or in the groin.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the effectiveness of postoperative hypofractionated radiotherapy in
      combination with high dose interferon in preventing regional relapse in patients with
      malignant melanoma with any number of nodes with clinical extracapsular extension or previous
      nodal basin recurrence. II. Evaluate the effectiveness of this therapy in prolonging relapse
      free and overall survival in this patient population. III. Evaluate the toxicity of this
      therapy in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to prior nodal basin
      recurrence, site of disease, and extracapsular extension. Following surgery, patients are
      randomized to receive either interferon alfa-2b alone or five treatments of radiotherapy
      followed by interferon alfa-2b. Patients receive radiotherapy 2 days a week for 2.5 weeks.
      Patients receive interferon alfa-2b IV over 20 minutes daily for 5 days for a total of 28
      days, followed by subcutaneous injections 3 times a week for 48 weeks. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 167 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
