      RATIONALE: Giving hydromorphone in different ways may relieve the pain associated with cancer
      surgery.

      PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of epidural
      hydromorphone with hydromorphone infusion in patients with prostate cancer undergoing radical
      prostatectomy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Define the duration of action of hydromorphone (spinal vs supraspinal) in
      patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy. II. Demonstrate that the duration of the
      analgesic effects of equal blood concentrations of hydromorphone is dependent on the method
      used to attain this concentration by comparing continuous epidural infusion with that of a
      continuous intravenous infusion.

      OUTLINE: This is a double blinded, randomized study. After all patients have undergone
      radical prostatectomy, hydromorphone is administered in two different ways. Patients receive
      either a hydromorphone bolus injection through an epidural catheter using a patient
      controlled analgesia pump or a hydromorphone bolus injection through an intravenous catheter
      using a patient controlled analgesia pump. Infusion for both groups is stopped at 24 hours.
      Patients are followed every 30 minutes for 6 hours.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued into this study over a 3 year
      period.
