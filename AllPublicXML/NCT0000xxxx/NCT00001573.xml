    <textblock>
      A dose escalation scale consisting of 5 dosage levels is being used to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of SU101. A minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 patients will be enrolled at
      each dose level. MTD is defined as the dose level immediately below that at which 2 or more
      patients exhibit dose limiting toxicity.

      Each treatment cycle is 21 days. Patients receive a 96 hour continuous IV infusion of SU101
      on days 1-4.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SU101 is a member of a novel class of antineoplastic agents, platelet-derived growth factor
      (PDGF) receptor inhibitors. Preclinical data suggests that SU101 might be an effective agent
      against neuroglial tumors as well as a variety of sarcomas. A pediatric phase I trial of
      SU101 in children with these malignancies will be conducted to find the maximum tolerated
      dose of SU101 and define the toxicity profile of this agent. In addition, we will define the
      pharmacokinetics of SU101 and its active metabolite SU0020 in pediatric patients and gather
      preliminary information regarding response.

        Not allergic to etoposide.

        No acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may
        increase the risks associated with study participation/study drug administration or may
        interfere with the interpretation of study results.
