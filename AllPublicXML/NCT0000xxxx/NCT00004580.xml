    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give ABT-378/ritonavir
      combination plus nevirapine plus two nucleoside transcriptase inhibitors to HIV-infected
      patients who previously have taken protease inhibitors. This study also examines how the body
      handles this combination of anti-HIV drugs.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

        - Antiretroviral regimen containing a protease inhibitor and one or two nucleoside reverse
        transcriptase inhibitors that has not changed in the last 12 weeks.

        Patients must have:

        - HIV infection with plasma HIV RNA of at least 1,000 copies/ml and less than or equal to
        100,000 copies/ml at screening.

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

        Naive to or has had less than 8 weeks of at least one nucleoside reverse transcriptase
        inhibitor and an acceptable regimen of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Medications that are contraindicated with ABT-378/ritonavir for the duration of the
             study, such as midazolam, triazolam, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide,
             ergotamine and dihydroergotamine.

          -  Over-the-counter medicine or alcohol, without knowledge or permission of the
             investigator.

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  Evidence of acute illness determined by vital signs, physical examination, or
             laboratory results.

          -  Clinically significant abnormal ECG results.

          -  Positive test result for drug abuse with the exception of cannabis, unless the
             investigator anticipates cannabis use will interfere with compliance with the study.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Investigational drugs with the exception of Amprenavir within 28 days prior to the
             initiation of study dosing.

          -  Treatment with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor.

          -  Treatment with a protease inhibitor different from the current protease inhibitor for
             more than 6 weeks prior to current regimen.

          -  Treatment with more than one protease inhibitor concurrently.

        Risk Behavior:

        Excluded:

          -  Active substance abuse, alcohol abuse, psychiatric illness.

          -  Presumption, by investigator, of poor compliance to regimen.
