  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine safety and tolerance of administering aerosolized recombinant interferon gamma
      (IFN-gamma) for 4 weeks in patients with AIDS. To examine activation of alveolar macrophages
      by aerosolized IFN-gamma administration. To determine if subcutaneous (SC) injection of
      IFN-gamma can activate alveolar macrophages in AIDS patients.
