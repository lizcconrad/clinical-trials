      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the long term outcomes in patients with giant cell arteritis after
      glucocorticoid treatment with or without methotrexate.

      II. Compare remission relapse rates in these patients after glucocorticoid therapy with or
      without methotrexate.

      III. Determine whether adjunctive use of methotrexate lowers cumulative dose and duration of
      glucocorticoid therapy and whether there is less treatment related morbidity and mortality.

      IV. Demonstrate the feasibility of long term, double blind, placebo controlled, randomized,
      multicenter trials for treatment of systemic vasculitides.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are
      randomized into initial therapy with prednisone plus weekly placebo or prednisone plus weekly
      oral methotrexate. Patients who do not respond to treatment within 5 days are taken off
      study. If methotrexate toxicity dose not occur after 2 weeks, methotrexate is increased by
      one tablet per week until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is achieved. The MTD of methotrexate
      or the matching placebo dose is continued for 12 months in the absence of toxicity. Once 12
      continuous months of remission are achieved, methotrexate or placebo is tapered to
      discontinuation.

      Patients are followed for 1-6 years.
