  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the experimental drug BG9588 can be used
      to treat lupus nephritis more effectively and with less toxicity than standard treatments,
      including cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), azothioprine (Imuran) and prednisone.

      The body's immune system naturally produces antibodies to fight foreign substances like
      bacteria and viruses. In autoimmune diseases like lupus, however, the body makes antibodies
      that attack its own tissues, causing inflammation and organ damage. Lupus antibodies attack
      and damage kidney cells. BG9588 can interfere with the production of these antibodies, and
      therefore, may lessen kidney damage in people with lupus nephritis.

      This study will look at: how BG9588 enters and leaves the blood and body tissue over time;
      adverse effects of the drug; and whether treatment with BG9588 can result in less kidney
      damage than other therapies.

      Study patients will be receive a 30-minute infusion of BG9588 into a vein every two weeks for
      three doses and then once every 28 days for four doses. Patients' steroid dosage may be
      tapered; individual adjustments will be made as required.

      Patients screened for the study will undergo a physical examination, medical history, various
      blood and urine tests, as well as complete a quality of life questionnaire. Results of a
      previous kidney biopsy and chest X ray are also required. Many of these tests will be
      repeated throughout the study.

      In a previous animal study, BG9588 treatment of mice with lupus nephritis improved their
      disease and survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies in animals and humans with lupus nephritis have demonstrated that essential role of
      CD40 ligand/CD40 interaction in the production of pathogenic autoantibodies. Anti-CD40L
      antibody treatment of mice with lupus nephritis ameliorates disease and improves survival.
      BG9588 is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to CD40 ligand
      (CD40L) expressed on the surface of activated T lymphocytes and thereby blocks the CD40L/CD40
      interaction between T and B cells that is required for the initiation for certain antibody
      responses. Available preclinical data indicates that BG9588 does not cause a global blockage
      of the immune response to pathogens and that its effects are reversible upon clearance from
      the systemic circulation. In this Phase I/II open-label, multiple-dose, multicenter study, 30
      subjects with active proliferative lupus nephritis will receive 20 mg/kg BG9588 by IV
      infusion once every 14 days for three doses, and then once every 28 days for four doses for a
      total of 7 doses. The primary objective is to determine if BG9588 can decrease proteinuria by
      greater than or equal to 50 percent from baseline without worsening renal function. The
      secondary objectives are to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of BG9588, as well as
      the effects of BG9588 on renal flares; cellular casts; C(3) levels and anti-dsDNA titers;
      requirement for prednisone; general lupus activity; and quality of life.
