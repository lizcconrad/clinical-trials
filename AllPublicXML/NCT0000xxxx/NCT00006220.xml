      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Tretinoin may help hematologic cancer cells develop into normal
      white blood cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide with or without
      tretinoin in treating patients who have hematologic cancer that has not responded to previous
      therapy.

      This is a dose escalation and efficacy study of arsenic trioxide. In the efficacy study,
      patients are stratified according to diagnosis (acute myelogenous leukemia vs acute
      lymphocytic leukemia vs myelodysplastic syndrome vs multiple myeloma vs non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease). Phase I: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 2 hours
      daily for 28 days. Treatment repeats every 42-59 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete remission (CR) or partial remission
      (PR) receive up to 4 courses. Patients who fail to achieve CR or PR or who experience disease
      progression may receive arsenic trioxide and tretinoin daily for 28 days every 42-59 days for
      up to 7 courses. Patients who fail to achieve CR or PR or experience disease progression with
      arsenic trioxide and tretinoin are removed from study. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of arsenic trioxide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.
      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose
      limiting toxicities. Phase II: Patients receive the MTD of arsenic trioxide as in phase I for
      up to 7 courses. Patients who fail to achieve CR or PR after 3 courses or experience disease
      progression are either taken off study or treated with arsenic trioxide and tretinoin as in
      phase I. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, and then every 3 months for 18 months.

        leukemia OR acute myeloid leukemia Failed to achieve complete remission (CR) with induction
        chemotherapy OR Relapsed within one year of initial CR OR Relapsed after autologous or
        allogeneic transplant OR Any subsequent relapse OR Refractory following relapse CR2 or more

        terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses
        the former terminology.
