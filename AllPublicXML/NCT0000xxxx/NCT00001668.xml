  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene has recently been identified as the genetic defect resulting
      in a syndrome of multiple neoplasias. Patients with VHL disease develop retinal angiomata,
      renal cysts and/or carcinomas, CNS hemangioblastomas as well as pancreatic cysts and
      pheochromocytomas. Investigators have shown the gene to be a tumor suppressor type
      proto-oncogene located at chromosomal locus 3p26. The gene includes three exons whose gene
      product targets a cellular transcription factor Elongin SIII. Binding of the VHL proteins to
      two subunits of this elongation factor inhibits transcription and may play a crucial role in
      the clinical development of the von Hippel Lindau phenotype.

        Patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease.

        No persons who are pregnant or lactating are eligible for the surgical arm of this protocol
        until the pregnancy and/or nursing period has reached completion.

        No patients with disorders associated with multiple abnormalities of the middle ear and
        inner ear. Specific laboratory abnormalities such as anti-HIV-1, FTA-Abs, serum ANA, and
        ANCA have been associated with AIDS, Syphilis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and Wegener's
        Granulomatosis, respectively.

        No patients currently undergoing chemotherapeutic regimen with ototoxic agents (e.g.,
        cisplatin). Other agents will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis for their potential to
        cause ototoxicity and thereby interfere with audiologic data interpretation.

        Patients with an ELST in an only hearing ear will be excluded from the protocol for
        surgical treatment of ELST's (except in cases where other medical indications necessitate
        intervention for the welfare of the patient).

        Patients with only unilateral vestibular function on the side affected by the ELST, as
        documented by caloric ENG testing, will be excluded from the surgical treatment group in
        most cases.

        No patients with the inability to understand all of the requirements of the study or
        inability to give informed consent and/or comply with all aspects of the evaluation.
