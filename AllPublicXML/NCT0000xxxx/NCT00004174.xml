      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by
      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV
      breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel when combined with high
      dose cyclophosphamide and thiotepa followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell
      transplantation and radiotherapy in patients with advanced breast cancer. II. Assess the
      overall safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of paclitaxel. Mobilization and harvest: Patients
      undergo mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) according to the protocol
      currently used or patients may be mobilized using cytokines alone or chemomobilization at the
      discretion of the attending physician. PBSC are harvested and selected for CD34+ cells. If an
      adequate number of CD34+ cells are not harvested, autologous bone marrow may be used.
      Preparative regimen: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 24 hours on day -5 and high dose
      thiotepa IV over 2 hours and high dose cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day -6, day -4
      following paclitaxel infusion, and day -2. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses
      of paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 3 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.
      Transplantation: PBSC are reinfused on day 0 or a minimum of 48 hours after completion of
      chemotherapy. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 0 and
      continuing until 3 days after blood counts have recovered. Sites of pretransplantation
      metastases greater than 3 cm are irradiated beginning after PBSC transplantation and after
      blood counts recover. Patients are followed every month for 1 year, then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
