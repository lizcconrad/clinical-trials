  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give T-20, a new type of
      anti-HIV drug, with a combination of other anti-HIV drugs. The other anti-HIV drugs used are
      abacavir (ABC), amprenavir (APV), ritonavir (RTV), and efavirenz (EFV). Three different doses
      of T-20 are tested.

    <textblock>
      Patients are assigned to one of four groups. Three dose groups receive a background
      antiretroviral regimen (ABC, APV, RTV, and EFV) and T-20, which is given at one of three
      doses on a twice-daily regimen. The fourth group (control) receives the background
      antiretroviral regimen alone. For each treatment group, 17 patients are enrolled. Treatment
      is administered for 16 weeks, followed by a 32-week treatment extension, and a 2-week
      follow-up period. The following are assessed throughout the trial: safety parameters (as
      measured by hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and treatment-emergent adverse
      events); virologic and immunologic activity; phenotypic and genotypic resistance; T-20 plasma
      levels; and pharmacokinetics of T-20 and oral antiretrovirals. The total study duration is 1
      year.

          -  Have an HIV level (viral load) between 400 and 100,000 copies/ml at the screening
             visit.

          -  Have taken at least 1 PI (protease inhibitor) for at least 16 weeks, and have had no
