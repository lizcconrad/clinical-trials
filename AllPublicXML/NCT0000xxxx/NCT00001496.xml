  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who are at high risk for breast cancer, either because of linkage to high risk breast
      and ovarian cancer families, or because of a carcinoma in the opposite breast, will be
      studied. Women will have a physical examination and mammography to ensure that no breast
      abnormalities are present. Eligible women will undergo biopsy of the breast to obtain normal
      breast tissue. Short-term cell cultures will be established from this tissue and early
      passages of the short-term cell lines will be stored. A bank of high risk normal mammary
      epithelial cells will be established. To further characterize the mammary epithelial cells in
      this population of women, cell cultures will subsequently be analyzed for their growth and
      metabolic properties, sensitivity to chemopreventive agents, steroid receptor
      characteristics, oncogene expression and regulation, and genetic changes.
