      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. It is not yet known whether paclitaxel is more effective than
      docetaxel for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel or docetaxel in
      treating women with stage IIIB or metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the response rate in women with metastatic or locally advanced, inoperable
           adenocarcinoma of the breast treated with docetaxel vs paclitaxel.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the time to disease progression, duration of response, quality of life, and
           survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 3
           weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and after courses 4 and 6.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients (200 per arm) will be accrued for this study.

          -  Histologically proven metastatic or locally advanced, inoperable adenocarcinoma of the
             breast

               -  Clinically evident metastases (e.g., clearly malignant lesions on chest x-ray or
                  CT or abdominal CT do not require histologic confirmation)

               -  Hot spots on bone scan not shown to be malignant on plain x-rays are not adequate
                  evidence of malignant disease in the absence of other lesions

          -  Must meet 1 of the following conditions:

               -  Disease progression after 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced or
                  metastatic disease (which may or may not have followed a separate adjuvant
                  regimen using chemotherapy or hormonal therapy)

               -  Locally advanced or metastatic disease during or after 1 adjuvant or neoadjuvant
                  chemotherapy regimen

               -  One of the above chemotherapy regimens must have contained an anthracycline
