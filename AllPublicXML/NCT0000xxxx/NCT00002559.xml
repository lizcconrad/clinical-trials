      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting
      of paclitaxel, cisplatin, and ifosfamide in treating patients who have ovarian or testicular
      germ cell tumors that are refractory to platinum-containing chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxicity and optimal dose of paclitaxel when combined with cisplatin and
           ifosfamide in patients with germ cell tumors with favorable prognostic features and
           resistance to cisplatin.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen as salvage therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of paclitaxel.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV continuously on day 1 and cisplatin IV over 20 minutes and
      ifosfamide IV over 30 minutes on days 2-6. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously
      (SC) on days 7-18 or until blood counts recover. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients receive paclitaxel at the
      MTD.

      After completion of chemotherapy, some patients may undergo resection of residual masses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-43 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
