  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Hematology Service provides hematology consultations for patients at the Clinical Center
      and participates in the training of hematology fellows. Patients with a broad range of
      hematologic disorders must be available in order for the senior staff of the Service to
      maintain clinical expertise and to provide the breadth of experience necessary for the
      fellowship program. The purpose of this protocol is to meet these needs by allowing the
      Hematology Service to see patients with a spectrum of hematologic diseases not studied on
      existing research protocols at the NIH. These patients will be evaluated over the course of
      several outpatient visits and returned to the care of their referring physicians.This study
      was developed to evaluate and possibly treat patients with blood disorders. The Hematology
      Service of the National Institutes of Health is responsible for the care of patients
      participating in research studies. In addition the Hematology Service also provides
      consultation for small groups of patients with blood disorders that have not been diagnosed
      or that may need special testing.

      This study will also provide doctors at the NIH the opportunity to learn more about a wide
      range of blood disorders and conditions. Patients participating in this study will be
      evaluated over the course of several outpatient visits and will continue to be cared for by
      their regular physician.
