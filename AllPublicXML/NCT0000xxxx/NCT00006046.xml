      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating
      patients who have advanced colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, and pharmacokinetics of monoclonal
           antibody Hu3S193 in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma.

        -  Determine the immune response in these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 (MAB Hu3S193) IV over 30 minutes to 4 hours
      weekly for 8 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest. Patients with stable or responding disease at
      week 10 receive maintenance MAB Hu3S193 weekly. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MAB Hu3S193 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicities.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
