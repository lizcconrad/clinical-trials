      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from papilloma virus cells may make the body build an immune
      response to and kill papilloma cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of papilloma virus vaccine in treating
      young patients with recurrent papilloma of the larynx.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the immune response in patients with juvenile papilloma of the
      larynx treated with autogenous vaccine derived from each patient's own tumor.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive autogenous papilloma vaccine intradermally and subcutaneously
      weekly for 20 weeks.
