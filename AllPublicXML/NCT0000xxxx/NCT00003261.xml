      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving methotrexate and zidovudine together
      with radiation therapy works in treating patients with HIV-related primary central nervous
      system lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the
           treatment of HIV-related primary CNS lymphoma patients.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity and overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive chemotherapy consisting of high-dose methotrexate IV administered
      on day 1 and high-dose zidovudine IV administered on days 1-3 every 2 weeks. Patients receive
      3 courses of therapy. Following chemotherapy, patients receive radiation therapy to the
      lesion site daily.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 14 patients.
