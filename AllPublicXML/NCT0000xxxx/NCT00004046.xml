      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of DX-8951f in treating women who have
      metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the antitumor activity of DX-8951f in women with metastatic
      adenocarcinoma of the breast who have failed prior therapy with an anthracycline and a
      taxane. II. Evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this drug in these
      patients. III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive DX-8951f IV over 30 minutes daily for 5 days. Courses repeat every
      21 days. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
      Patients are followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast
        Prior treatment with an anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin or epirubicin) and a taxane (e.g.,
        paclitaxel or docetaxel) either as adjuvant therapy or for advanced disease Bidimensionally
        measurable disease Sentinel lesions must be outside of any prior radiation port No resected
        disease or stage IV with no evaluable disease No brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease
        No symptomatic lymphangitic pulmonary metastases Hormone receptor status: Not specified

        100,000/mm3 Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL SGOT or SGPT no greater than 2
        times upper limit of normal (ULN) (5 times ULN if liver metastases present) Renal:
        Creatinine no greater than 2.0 mg/dL Cardiovascular: No active congestive heart failure No
        uncontrolled angina No myocardial infarction within past 6 months Neurologic: No history of

        camptothecin or its derivatives No concurrent serious infection No other malignancy within
        the past 5 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix No overt
        psychosis, mental disability, or incompetence No other life threatening disease

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: No concurrent biologic therapy No prophylactic
        colony stimulating factors to prevent neutropenia (except when neutropenia fever occurs
        despite dose reduction) Chemotherapy: See Disease Characteristics No greater than 3 prior
        chemotherapy regimens for metastatic breast cancer or as either adjuvant or neoadjuvant
        therapy At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin)

        hormonal therapy for stage IV disease and/or as adjuvant therapy allowed At least 3 weeks
        since prior hormonal therapy except for: Patients who are highly unlikely to have a
        withdrawal response to cessation of hormonal therapy (e.g., patients with disease that is
        primarily resistant to hormonal therapy, patients without prior partial response, or
        stabilization of disease lasting less than 6 months) Patients with new or extensive
        visceral metastases Patients with rapidly progressive or symptomatic metastases during
        hormonal therapy Radiotherapy: See Disease Characteristics At least 4 weeks since prior
        radiotherapy and recovered No prior radiotherapy to greater than 50% of bone marrow No
        concurrent radiotherapy Surgery: See Disease Characteristics At least 4 weeks since prior
        major surgery and recovered No concurrent surgery Other: No other concurrent anticancer
        treatment At least 28 days since other prior investigational drugs, including analgesics or
        antiemetics No other investigational drugs during and for 28 days after the study No drugs
        that induce or inhibit CYP3A enzyme
