      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, before a
      donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also
      helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the
      healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone
      marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed
      by peripheral stem cell transplant works in treating patients with leukemia or lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed by allogeneic
           peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, in terms of 6-month treatment-related
           mortality, in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prolymphocytic leukemia,
           low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or mantle cell lymphoma.

        -  Determine the 6-month and 12-month probabilities of response in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to disease progression in patients responding to this regimen.

        -  Determine the percentage of donor chimerism achieved in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the risk of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival and disease-free survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -7 to -3 and cyclophosphamide IV over
      1 to 2 hours on days -5 to -3. Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
      transplantation on days 0-1. Patients then receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily
      beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients with no signs of active graft-versus host disease and stable or progressive disease
      receive donor lymphocytes IV over 2 hours beginning after day 120. Patients may receive a
      total of 3 infusions at least 8 weeks apart if disease remains stable or progressive.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued for this study.
