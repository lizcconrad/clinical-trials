      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Combining these treatments before surgery may kill more tumor cells in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining chemotherapy with radiation
      therapy before surgery in treating patients who have stage IIB non-small cell lung cancer or
      stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate, duration of response, and survival in patients with bulky
           stage IIB or stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer treated with paclitaxel, carboplatin,
           and radiotherapy followed by surgical resection.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes weekly for 5
      weeks. Patients also undergo concurrent radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity. At approximately 4 weeks after completion of
      chemoradiotherapy, patients with stable or regressive disease undergo surgical resection. If
      disease is unresectable, patients receive an additional 2 weeks of radiotherapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 29-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
