      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs such as
      sargramostim may protect normal cells from the side effects of radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of sargramostim in
      preventing mucositis in patients who are receiving radiation therapy for laryngeal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of sargramostim (GM-CSF) in reducing the duration and severity of
           mucositis resulting from accelerated radiotherapy in patients with laryngeal carcinoma.

        -  Determine the effect of GM-CSF on quality of life aspects of these patients as assessed
           by nutritional status, analgesic use, and days in the hospital.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

      Patients receive radiotherapy in 16 fractions over 21 days. Patients are randomly allocated
      to one of two treatment arms before scheduled radiotherapy begins.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC daily for 14 days beginning on day 14
           of the course of radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients do not receive GM-CSF. Patients are followed weekly until mucositis is
           healed, as well as at weeks 2 and 6 following the end of radiotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34 patients (17 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
