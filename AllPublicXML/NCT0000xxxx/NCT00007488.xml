  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain information on how the type and amount of HIV present in
      certain places in the body and in the blood are affected when potent (powerful) anti-HIV
      drugs are given.

      Researchers know that the type and amount of HIV may differ in certain places in the body
      (called compartments) but are not sure how anti-HIV treatment affects these differences. This
      study gathers information to help understand how the virus grows and changes between blood
      and nonblood compartments in patients receiving anti-HIV treatment.

    <textblock>
      The goal of antiretroviral therapy is maximal suppression of HIV-1 replication. Yet studies
      show that there is ongoing replication of latent virus in the blood and lymphoid tissues of
      some patients receiving potent antiretroviral therapy who have had suppressed plasma HIV-1
      RNA levels for prolonged periods of time. This continued viral persistence and replication
      could eventually result in virologic failure and clinical progression as well as selection
      and transmission of resistant HIV-1. There is a need to identify, quantify, and determine
      significance of viral reservoirs in compartments other than blood. A5077 is designed to
      evaluate the relationship between viral load in blood and nonblood compartments and time to
      virologic failure in patients initiating or changing potent antiretroviral therapy.

      Patients contribute samples of blood at study entry (prior to changing or initiating potent
      antiretroviral therapy), Week 8 and every 8 weeks thereafter until Week 96, and (if
      applicable) within 30 days of confirmed virologic failure. Samples of saliva and either
      genital secretions or lymphoid tissue, or both, are collected at study entry (prior to
      changing or initiating potent antiretroviral therapy), Weeks 16, 48, and 96, and within 30
      days of confirmed virologic failure. Clinical assessments and medication updates are done at
      study visits. Blood samples are tested for HIV-1 genotypic resistance studies, HIV-1 proviral
      DNA studies, and HIV-1 quantitation. If total blood volumes exceed safe limits, blood samples
      will not be drawn for A5077 but the A5077 protocol team will request access to plasma and
      PBMC samples from any coenrolled study if applicable.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Are at least 13 years old.

          -  Are HIV-positive.

          -  Are changing or beginning anti-HIV therapy (not provided by the study). Anti-HIV
             therapy should be an approved 3-drug combination.

          -  Have a viral load of at least 2,000 copies/ml within 60 days of study entry.

          -  Have signed consent of parent or guardian if under 18 years of age.

          -  Are willing to contribute samples of blood, saliva, and either genital fluids or lymph
             tissue, or both, at study visits.

          -  Are willing to give permission to allow records from any coenrolled studies to be used
             while participating in this study.

          -  Have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry, if women able to have
             children. Women who become pregnant while on the study are allowed only to contribute
             blood and saliva samples until the pregnancy ends. After the pregnancy has ended,
             collection of genital fluids and/or lymphoid tissue will continue.

          -  Agree to receive HIV-related care at an AACTG site, if not enrolled in another AACTG
             trial.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Have had any active opportunistic (AIDS-related) infection or disease, or have another
             illness occurring at the same time, or other infections, including an active lower
             genital tract infection that requires a new drug or change in drug in 14 days or less
             before study entry. There may be an exception for some conditions.

          -  Have used immunomodulatory agents in 14 days or less before study entry.

          -  Have had an immunization in 14 days or less before study entry.
