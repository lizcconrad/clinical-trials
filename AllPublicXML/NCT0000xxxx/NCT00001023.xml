      PER 03/10/94 AMENDMENT: PART B. To determine whether there is an effect on plasma drug levels
      of azithromycin and rifabutin as measured by changes in the plasma concentration-time curve
      (AUC) when these drugs are taken concomitantly.

      ORIGINAL PRIMARY: To gain preliminary information about the safety and tolerance of
      clarithromycin and azithromycin in combination with rifabutin (three potential agents against
      Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare) in HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts &lt; 200 cells/mm3.

      ORIGINAL SECONDARY: To determine whether there is an effect on the pharmacokinetics of the
      macrolide antibiotics or rifabutin when these drugs are taken concomitantly. To monitor the
      effect of rifabutin therapy on dapsone serum levels in patients taking dapsone for PCP
      prophylaxis. To monitor the effect of macrolide/rifabutin combination therapies on AZT or ddI
      serum levels.

      Two new macrolide antibiotics, clarithromycin and azithromycin, and rifabutin (a rifamycin
      derivative) have all demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against Mycobacterium
      avium-intracellulare, a common systemic bacterial infection complicating AIDS. Further
      information is needed, however, regarding the clinical and pharmacokinetic interaction of
      these drugs used in combination.

      Two new macrolide antibiotics, clarithromycin and azithromycin, and rifabutin (a rifamycin

      avium-intracellulare, a common systemic bacterial infection complicating AIDS. Further
      information is needed, however, regarding the clinical and pharmacokinetic interaction of
      these drugs used in combination.

      AMENDED 03/10/94 (Part B): Approximately 38 HIV-infected or uninfected subjects are
      randomized to receive azithromycin or rifabutin (Groups 3 and 4) daily for 14 days, followed
      by a combination regimen of both drugs for 4 additional weeks. Patients are followed weekly.
      Pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed on days 14, 15, and 42-45.

      ORIGINAL: Sixty-eight patients are randomly assigned to one of four groups (17 patients per
      group). They receive either clarithromycin or azithromycin in combination with rifabutin on
      one of two different dosing schedules. Patients receive medication for 6 weeks and undergo
      follow-up weekly during drug administration and at week 8.
