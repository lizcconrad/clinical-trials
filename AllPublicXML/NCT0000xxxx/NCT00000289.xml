      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of various doses of ondansetron
      transdermal nicotine replacement on tobacco withdrawal symptoms.

      Previous studies have shown that cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, antagonizes the
      beneficial effects of the nicotine patch in redugin withdrawal symptoms. Studies have also
      shown that cotinine enhances serotonin levels. This study examined the effects of several
      doses of a 5HT3 antagonist, ondanstron, in combination with the nicotine patch. This
      medication has been observed to reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms in rats. These effects
      were compared to the nicotine patch alone. The results of this study produced some modest
      effects showing that the 8mg dose of ondansetron suppressed tobacco withdrawal symptoms to a
      greater extent than the nicotine patch alone.
