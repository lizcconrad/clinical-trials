  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate a dose intensive chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of locally advanced and
      metastatic breast cancer using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to
      ameliorate chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Combination chemotherapy consists of Flurouricil,
      Leucovorin, Adriamycin, and Cytoxan (FLAC) which will be given every 21 days for 10 cycles.
      This protocol will replace the phase I study of this regimen (MB-232/88-C-0207) which found
      the MTD of this regimen to be at the first dose level. This is a phase II study to determine
      response rates of this regimen in advanced breast cancer.

        All stage III or clinical T3N0 or TxN2 patients must have a histologically documented
        diagnosis of breast carcinoma and evaluate disease in the breast or axilla.

        Patients with stage III must enter this protocol within 12 weeks of the initial diagnosis.

        Patients with Stage IV (metastatic) breast cancer must have histologically proven diagnosis
        and must have evaluate disease. Patients with bone-only disease may be considered eligible
        after discussion with Dr. Kenneth Cowan.

        For Stage III disease, there must be no history of prior cytotoxic therapy.

        Stage IV patients will be eligible if they have had prior adjuvant chemotherapy and/or
        hormonal therapy provided the regimen did not included adriamycin. Patients will also be
        eligible if they have been treated with one prior Phase I or II single chemotherapy agent
        on a Medicine branch protocol. Patients who have had prior radiation therapy may be
        eligible providing there was not extensive radiation to the cardiac area.

        There must be no history of previous malignancy except for cured non-melanoma skin cancer
        (basal cell carcinoma) and cervical cancer in situ.

        Performance status (Karnofsky scale) must be greater than 70.

        WBC count greater than 4000/mm3 and platelet count 100,000/mm3, unless there is evidence of
        bone marrow involvement with tumor.

        Liver function tests (SGOT, Alk. Phosph., and T. Bilil) should be less than 1.5 times the
        upper limits of normal, and serum creatinine should be less than 1.7 or creatinine
        clearance should be greater than 45 ml/min unless these abnormalities are due to tumor
        involvement.

        The patient must give informed consent.

        No pregnant patients may be entered on this study; all patients should be informed about
        the need for contraception.

        No history of other malignant neoplasms except for curatively treated basal cell skin
        cancer or surgically cured carcinoma of the cervix in situ.

        Patients must not be in poor medical or psychiatric risks because of nonmalignant systemic
        disease which would preclude them being subjected to any treatments in this protocol.

        Patients with a history of cardiac disease must have a normal ejection fraction by MUGA
        Scan and have no angina.

        Must not have evidence of CNS metastasis.
