      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune
      cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells, allowing higher doses of
      chemotherapy to be used.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel when added to high-dose
      combination chemotherapy followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating women
      with breast cancer at high risk of relapse.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel when given with high-dose
      carboplatin/cyclophosphamide with autologous peripheral blood stem cell support in women with
      high-risk stage II/III breast cancer. II. Assess the nonhematologic toxicities associated
      with this combination. III. Assess the progression-free and overall survival of these
      patients following this treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-finding study. All patients undergo collection of peripheral blood
      stem cells (PBSC) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization prior to
      high-dose chemotherapy. Cohorts of 3-5 patients are treated at successively higher dose
      levels of paclitaxel until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is found. Paclitaxel is given as a
      single 6-hour infusion, followed by fixed doses of high-dose cyclophosphamide for 2 days,
      then carboplatin for 3 days. Four days later, patients receive PBSC and G-CSF for
      hematopoietic reconstitution. Additional patients are entered at the MTD. Patients are
      followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, then every 4-6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: It is expected that 24-30 patients will be accrued; a study duration of
      1-1.5 years is anticipated.
