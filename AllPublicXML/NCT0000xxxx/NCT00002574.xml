  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of homoharringtonine and interferon alfa in
      treating patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different
      ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Interferon alfa may
      interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Combining chemotherapy with interferon alfa may
      kill more cancer cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of homoharringtonine administered simultaneously with interferon
      alpha in achieving complete cytogenetic response in patients with chronic myelogenous
      leukemia in chronic phase.

      OUTLINE:

      Single-Agent Chemotherapy plus Biological Response Modifier Therapy. Homoharringtonine, HH,
      NSC-141633; plus Interferon alfa (Schering), IFN-A, NSC-377523.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase

          -  Clonal evolution (i.e., the presence of clones other than the Ph chromosome) allowed
             Ph chromosome variants or complex Ph chromosome translocations are not considered
             disease acceleration

          -  Ineligible for known therapy of higher efficacy or priority

          -  Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation should be considered priority therapy for CML
             patients with a matched related donor

          -  No blastic phase CML (30% or more blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow)

          -  No accelerated phase CML, defined as any of the following: 15% or more peripheral or
             marrow blasts or 30% or more blasts and promyelocytes 20% or more peripheral or marrow
             basophils

          -  Thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 100,000) unrelated to therapy

          -  Documented extramedullary disease outside of liver or spleen

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Age: 15 and over

          -  Performance status: Zubrod 0-2

          -  Life expectancy: Sufficient to fully evaluate the effects of 2 courses of therapy

          -  Bilirubin no greater than 2.0 mg/dL

          -  SGOT less than 300

          -  Creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance at least 60 mL/min

          -  No severe heart disease (class III/IV)

          -  No pregnant or nursing women

          -  Effective contraception required of fertile women

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  No prior interferon alpha

          -  At least 2 weeks since antileukemic therapy, with recovery required

          -  Patients who received hydroxyurea within the past 2 weeks and have WBC greater than
             50,000 may enter protocol after discussion with the primary investigator
