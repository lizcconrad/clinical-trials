      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the
      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's
      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of topotecan plus sargramostim in
      treating patients who have advanced cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Identify a priming schedule of sargramostim (GM-CSF) that reduces the
      percentage of progenitor cells in cycle at the time of chemotherapy administration in
      patients with advanced malignancies. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxic
      effects of topotecan when administered with sargramostim in these patients. III. Conduct a
      preliminary assessment of the activity of this topotecan regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of topotecan. Patients receive priming with
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) on days -4 through -2. On day 0, topotecan IV is administered over 30
      minutes. Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan. The maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Sargramostim resumes on day 1 following topotecan, and
      continues for 5 days or until sufficient hematologic recovery. The next course of topotecan
      is given 48 hours later. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 4 courses. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 15-25 patients will be accrued for the duration of 18 months.
