      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Giving chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that
      it can be removed during surgery.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus radiation
      therapy given before surgery in treating patients who have stage I, stage II, or stage III
      esophageal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the total response rate in patients with stage I, II, or III
      esophageal cancer treated with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and fluorouracil with concurrent
      radiotherapy followed by surgical resection. II. Determine the overall survival of these
      patients treated with this regimen. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this
      patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes on days 1 and 22, and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-42. Patients undergo
      radiotherapy concurrently with chemotherapy daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Patients then
      undergo surgical resection within 3-5 weeks following completion of therapy. Patients are
      followed every 3 months for 6 months, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 patients will be accrued for this study.
