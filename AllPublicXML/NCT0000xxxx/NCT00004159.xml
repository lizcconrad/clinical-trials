      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine plus paclitaxel in
      treating patients who have advanced non-small cell lung cancer or other solid tumor.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities of biweekly
      administration of gemcitabine and paclitaxel in patients with advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) or other solid tumor. II. Determine the response rate, duration of response,
      and disease free interval for this patient population after this therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed
      2 hours later by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29. Treatment repeats
      every 6 weeks for a maximum of 8 courses. Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of
      paclitaxel and gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 5 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicity. Once the MTD is reached, an additional 14 patients (chemotherapy naive) with
      advanced NSCLC are treated at the recommended phase II dose. Patients are followed every 8
      weeks for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 3 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion and a
      total of 14 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study.
