      RATIONALE: Green tea extract contains substances that may slow the growth of certain cancers
      and may prevent the development of new cancers.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of green tea extract in treating
      patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effectiveness and toxicity of green tea extract in patients with
      androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer. II. Determine the response rate and response
      duration in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine whether a decline in
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) coincides with evidence of disease regression in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral green tea extract six times daily for 4 months. Patients with
      a 50% decline in PSA, complete or partial response, or stable disease after 4 months continue
      treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      disease progression after 4 months receive no further treatment. Patients are followed every
      3 months for 5 years or until disease progression. If disease progression, patients are
      followed every 6 months for 5 years.
