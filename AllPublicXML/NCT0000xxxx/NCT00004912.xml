      RATIONALE: Megestrol helps improve appetite. Exercise may decrease cancer-related fatigue,
      improve strength, and build up lost muscle tissue. Exercise plus megestrol may be effective
      treatment for cancer-related weight loss.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of megestrol plus exercise to improve
      appetite, increase strength, gain lean body tissue, and decrease fatigue in patients who have
      cancer-related weight loss.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of megestrol and progressive resistance training on lean
      body mass, total body weight, functional capacity, appetite, and fatigue in patients with
      weight loss due to advanced malignancy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral megestrol once daily. Patients
      also begin progressive resistance training 3 days a week. Treatment/exercise continues for 12
      weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or progressive weight loss (greater than 5
      pounds or 5% or more over first 4 study weeks).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
