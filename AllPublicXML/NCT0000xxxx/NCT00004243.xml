      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel and oxaliplatin in treating
      patients who have metastatic or recurrent solid tumor.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel when followed by oxaliplatin
      in patients with metastatic or recurrent solid tumors. II. Describe the toxicities of this
      regimen in this patient population at each dose level studied. III. Evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of docetaxel. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1
      hour followed by oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 every 3 weeks. Treatment continues in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD
      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicities. Patients are followed for disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
