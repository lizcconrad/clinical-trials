      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures may improve the ability to detect metastatic melanoma and to
      determine the extent of disease.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to evaluate the effectiveness of PET and CT scans to detect
      metastatic disease in patients who have stage III or stage IV melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of fludeoxyglucose F 18
      (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in detecting metastatic disease in patients
      with stage III or IV melanoma considered for operative management based on the currently
      accepted diagnostic work up including CT imaging. II. Determine how often the clinical
      management of these patients is altered based on FDG PET imaging findings in addition to CT
      scan results.

      OUTLINE: Patients are required to fast for a minimum of 6 hours prior to positron emission
      tomography (PET) imaging. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) is administered IV over 15 minutes
      followed 50-60 minutes later by whole body PET imaging. Iodinated contrast dye is
      administered by IV injection and by mouth followed by CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and
      pelvis within 2 weeks of PET imaging. Whole body FDG PET imaging and CT imaging of the chest,
      abdomen, and pelvis are repeated at 6 months. Initial positive PET or CT imaging results are
      verified based on surgical and/or biopsy findings or clinical follow-up.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
