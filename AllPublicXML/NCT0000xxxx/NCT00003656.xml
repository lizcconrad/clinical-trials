      RATIONALE: Tretinoin may help kidney cancer cells develop into normal cells. Interferon alfa
      may interfere with the growth of cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal tretinoin plus interferon
      alfa in treating patients who have metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with
           tretinoin liposome and interferon alfa-2b.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Study retinoic acid receptor expression on tissue obtained from selected patients who
           have tumor biopsies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tretinoin liposome with concurrent individual
      dose escalation of interferon alfa-2b. (Phase I closed to accrual as of 9/24/03.)

      Patients receive tretinoin liposome IV over 30 minutes once weekly and interferon alfa-2b
      subcutaneously on five consecutive days (M-F) for 8 weeks. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tretinoin liposome until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) has been determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined
      additional patients are accrued and treated at that dose. (Phase I closed to accrual as of
      9/24/03.)

      During the first 3 weeks of the study, patients receive interferon alfa-2b at weekly dose
      escalations. After week 3, patients continue at the highest acceptable dose level of
      interferon alfa-2b for the remainder of the study. (Phase I closed to accrual as of 9/24/03.)

      Patients are followed at 30 days after the last treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued into the phase I portion of this
      study (Phase I closed to accrual as of 9/24/03). A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued
      into the phase II portion of this study.
