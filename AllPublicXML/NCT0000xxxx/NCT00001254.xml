  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol concerns the approach to the localization, diagnosis of MEN1 and management of
      the tumor and the tissue samples in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. It details the
      diagnostic imaging tests to be used to localize the tumor, investigations for MEN1 the
      subsequent management of the tumor and tissue samples for research.
