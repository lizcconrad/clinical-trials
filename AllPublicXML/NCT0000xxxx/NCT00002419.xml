  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give adefovir dipivoxil
      plus abacavir (ABC) plus efavirenz (EFV) plus amprenavir (APV) to HIV-infected patients who
      have failed to respond to previous treatment with protease inhibitors (PIs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive a treatment regimen of adefovir dipivoxil, abacavir, efavirenz, and
      amprenavir for 24 weeks. During the study, patients are evaluated for changes from baseline
      in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and lymphocyte subsets and for development of adverse events and
      toxicities. Patients who experience virologic failure are discontinued from the study. After
      Week 24, patients with documented virologic response are eligible to continue receiving the
      study treatment and to attend scheduled follow-up visits.
