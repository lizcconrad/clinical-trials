  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will screen patients with cerebellar ataxia to check for antibodies that indicate
      allergy to gluten (wheat protein) and will study the effect of a gluten-free diet in patients
      with these antibodies. Patients with cerebellar ataxia have problems with coordination,
      resulting in &quot;clumsiness&quot; and unsteadiness of posture and walking.

      There are many known causes of cerebellar ataxia, but in many patients the cause is unknown
      and there are no available treatments. Cerebellar ataxia has been recognized as a
      complication of celiac disease, a syndrome characterized by sensitivity to gluten.
      Recognizing gluten sensitivity in patients with cerebellar ataxia would be important for two
      reasons: it would be one of the rare causes of the disease that are potentially treatable,
      and it would identify patients at risk for developing gastrointestinal cancers, particularly
      intestinal lymphoma.

      Patients with cerebellar ataxia of known or unknown cause and normal healthy volunteers of
      any age are eligible for this study.

      All participants will have a medical history, physical examination, blood drawn (30
      milliliters, or 2 tablespoons) to check for celiac disease antibodies, and possibly other lab
      tests. This completes the participation of normal volunteers.

      All patients will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. This diagnostic tool
      uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves instead of X-rays to show structural and
      chemical changes in tissues. During the scanning, the patient lies on a table in a narrow
      cylinder containing a magnetic field. He or she can speak with a staff member via an intercom
      system at all times during the procedure. Scanning times vary from 20 minutes to 2 hours.

      Patients who have celiac disease antibodies will have an upper gastrointestinal (GI)
      endoscopy intestinal biopsy. For this procedure, a flexible tube is inserted into the mouth
      and down the throat into the stomach and duodenum (the upper part of the small intestine),
      where a small tissue sample is taken for microscopic examination. Patients with these
      antibodies will be put on a gluten-free diet and will be followed at NIH every 3 months for
      12 months. On the first visit, patients will have their ataxia evaluated using NINDS's ataxia
      scale and will meet with a dietitian for instructions for a gluten-free diet. On the second
      through fifth visits (after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively, on the gluten-free diet),
      patients will have their ataxia evaluated, speak with a dietitian to assess their nutritional
      status, weight, and compliance with the diet, and provide a blood sample for celiac disease
      antibody testing.

      At the completion of the study, patients may choose to continue or stop the gluten-free diet.
      If the ataxia assessments show improvement, patients will be advised to continue the
      gluten-free diet permanently.

      In many patients with cerebellar ataxia, the etiology is unknown. Sensitivity to gluten
      (wheat protein) has been suggested as a cause for cerebellar ataxia even in the absence of
      malabsorption symptoms or intestinal pathology. However, the prevalence of gluten sensitivity
      in patients presenting with cerebellar ataxia is unknown and the effect of gluten-free diet
      on gluten sensitivity-associated cerebellar ataxia has not been systematically studied. The
      aim of this project is: 1) To identify gluten sensitive cerebellar ataxia patients attending
      the Human Motor Control Clinic at the NIH using tests for celiac disease antibodies as a
      screening method. 2) To conduct open-label controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy
      of gluten-free diet in the patients identified using a detailed cerebellar ataxia scale as an
      objective clinical measure.
