      RATIONALE: Assessing the long-term effects of bone marrow transplant on lung function in
      patients may improve the ability to plan treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies lung function in pediatric patients who have undergone
      bone marrow transplant.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the delayed effects of bone marrow transplantation preparative regimens on
           pulmonary function in children surviving at least 5 years after transplantation for
           hematologic malignancy.

        -  Determine the relationship between pulmonary function and growth rates in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the effect of growth hormone treatment on pulmonary function in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the relationship between pulmonary function and age at time of transplantation
           in these patients.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of restrictive pulmonary disease, and whether these
           factors vary with increasing time after transplantation in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo respiratory history, signs and symptoms assessment, pulmonary
      function tests (PFT) including spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion, oxygen saturation by
      pulse oximetry, and height measurement.

      Patients are assessed at 5-10 years, 10-15 years, and over 15 years after bone marrow
      transplantation. Patients with abnormal PFTs are assessed at more frequent intervals as
      clinically indicated.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 280 patients will be accrued for this study.
