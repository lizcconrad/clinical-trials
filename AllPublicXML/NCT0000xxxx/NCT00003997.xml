      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene in treating patients
      who have refractory myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic
      leukemia, or blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy use
      different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose for 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene in patients with
      refractory myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, or
      blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this treatment in these
      patients.

      III. Determine the duration and reversibility of the qualitative and quantitative toxicities
      of this treatment in these patients.

      IV. Evaluate, in a preliminary manner, the antileukemic activity of this treatment in these
      patients.

      V. Assess relative mRNA levels of selected NER genes (ERCC1, ERCC2, and ERCC3) in tumor
      tissues of patients treated with this regimen and correlate with clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (HMAF) IV over 5 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment
      repeats every 3-4 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of HMAF. The maximum
      tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which dose limiting toxicity occurs in at least 40%
      of patients.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Diagnosis of refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
