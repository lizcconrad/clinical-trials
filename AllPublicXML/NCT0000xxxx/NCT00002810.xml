      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of plasma
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Having a peripheral
      stem cell transplant to replace the blood-forming cells destroyed by chemotherapy, allows
      higher doses of chemotherapy to be given so that more plasma cells are killed. By reducing
      the number of plasma cells, the disease may progress more slowly.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving high-dose melphalan together with
      peripheral stem cell transplant works in treating patients with primary amyloidosis or
      amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess overall and progression-free survival following high-dose melphalan and
           autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with primary
           amyloidosis.

        -  Evaluate the toxic effects associated with this treatment regimen.

        -  Evaluate the function of involved organs, especially the heart, lungs, and nervous
           system, before and after treatment with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating
      factor (G-CSF) for 5 days and then collected by leukapheresis. Patients receive high-dose
      melphalan on 2 consecutive days, followed by 1 day of rest, then by PBSC transplantation.
      G-CSF is given from 1 day after transplantation until the neutrophil count is greater than
      1,500 for 3 consecutive days.

      Patients are followed at 100 days and 1 year post-transplant.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A very small number of patients are expected to be accrued over 5-10
      years.
