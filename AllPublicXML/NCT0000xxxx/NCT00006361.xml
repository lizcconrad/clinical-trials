      RATIONALE: SU5416 may stop the growth of cancer cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of SU5416 in treating patients who have
      advanced or recurrent cancer of the head and neck.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the effect of SU5416 on survival and tumor response in patients with advanced
           or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of SU5416 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour twice weekly. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.4 years.
