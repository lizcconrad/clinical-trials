  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this double-blind placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the effect of
      Isoprinosine in a group of homogenous male volunteers who present with immunologic defects
      relative to:

        -  Comparison of total helper and suppressor T-cell number between the groups.

        -  Comparison of the phytohemagglutinins (PHA) and concanavalin A lymphoproliferative
           response and natural killer (NK) cell activity between the groups.

        -  Determination of the clinical course of the volunteers after discontinuance of
           Isoprinosine.
