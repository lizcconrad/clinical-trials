      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different way to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of perillyl alcohol in treating patients
      with metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy with androgens.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the clinical effectiveness of oral perillyl alcohol given to patients
      with androgen independent metastatic prostate cancer. II. Assess the toxicity of this
      treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral perillyl alcohol 4 times a day for 4 weeks. Patients continue
      treatment in the absence of severe toxicity and disease progression. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for survival after disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 20-40 patients in approximately 2 years.
