      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by reducing the production of estrogen. It is not yet known
      if prolonged tamoxifen is more effective than shorter tamoxifen therapy following curative
      treatment for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving tamoxifen over a prolonged period
      of time to see how well it works compared to giving tamoxifen over a shorter period of time
      in treating patients who have had a breast tumor removed.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the balance of risks and benefits in prolonging the duration of adjuvant
           tamoxifen by at least 5 years in patients with curatively treated breast cancer who have
           already had about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. After about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen,
      recurrence-free patients are randomized to stop tamoxifen treatment immediately or to
      continue tamoxifen treatment for at least 5 more years.

      Patients are followed annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20,000 patients will be accrued for this study.
