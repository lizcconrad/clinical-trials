      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: : Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gallium nitrate in young patients who
      have malignant brain tumors, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or
      refractory solid tumor.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and side effects of gallium nitrate (GAN) when used as an
      anticancer agent in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors, including malignant
      brain tumors, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Evaluate these
      side effects in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Gallium Nitrate, GAN, NSC-15200.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 3 patients will be accrued at each dose studied.
