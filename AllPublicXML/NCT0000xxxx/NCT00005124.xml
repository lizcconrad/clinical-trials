      BACKGROUND:

      In 1966, the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council (NAS-NRC) began the
      development of a twin registry. Through state birth records, a group of twins born in
      1917-1927 was ascertained and matched to veteran records to obtain a roster of 16,000 twins
      where both members of the pair were in military service. Veterans formed the basis of the
      registry because Veterans Administration files provided access to current addresses as well
      as potential for mortality follow-up. From this roster, a group of twins living within 200
      miles of the examining centers and agreeing to cooperate was examined. This procedure yielded
      a set of 514 pairs of twins where both members of the pair were examined. At the time of
      initial examination, the World War II veteran twins were 42-56 years old. Since the initial
      examination, the twins have been followed by the NAS-NRC to maintain current addresses and
      mortality information.

      The World War II veteran cohort was originally examined during the 1969-1973 period at five
      examination centers located in Framingham, Massachusetts; Davis, San Francisco, Los Angeles,
      California; and Indianapolis, Indiana. The objective of the initial examination was to
      estimate the heritability of cardiovascular risk factors. Results of the first examination
      showed significant heritability for height, weight, relative weight, systolic and diastolic
      blood pressure, glucose tolerance, uric acid, hematocrit, plasma triglycerides, and forced
      expiratory volume but not for total plasma cholesterol or any of the lipoprotein cholesterol
      fractions

      .A second exam of the cohort was completed during 1981-1982. Of the original cohort of 1028
      subjects, 792 or 77 percent were reexamined and approximately 5.5% had died. The objective of
      the second examination was to assess the change in cardiovascular risk factors over the ten
      year interval, assess the disease experience of the cohort and gather additional data on new
      cardiovascular risk factors as well as pulmonary function measurements and covariates.
      Examination two differed from examination one in that there was greater opportunity to
      standardize data collection for methods, laboratories, equipment, and time of examination.
      Greater emphasis was placed on pulmonary function testing. One objective of examination two
      that was not achieved was the determination of a sufficient number of cardiovascular events
      to do analyses of concordance of disease and analyses of disease occurrence in relation to
      risk factors. Analysis of data on 167 monozygotic pairs of twins and 176 dizygotic pairs of
      twins showed results similar to those of the first examination for systolic and diastolic
      blood pressure but, unlike the first examination, also showed significant genetic variance
      for total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. HDL cholesterol continued to show no genetic
      variance.

      The third examination of the original cohort was conducted in 1986-1987. The primary
      objective of the third examination was to assess the incidence of cardiovascular and
      pulmonary diseases for analyses relative to risk factor data and determine if the
      heritability of cardiovascular disease exceeded what was expected based on the known
      cardiovascular risk factors. Extensive pulmonary function testing was part of examination
      three as it was for examination two and provided longitudinal data for analyses of change in
      pulmonary function in relation to genetic and environmental factors. The exercise
      electrocardiogram was expanded to the entire cohort for examination three to provide
      additional data on sub-clinical disease.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study was longitudinal in design and consisted of three examinations of the cohort over a
      period of eighteen years. Data collected in examination one in 1969-1973 included: a twin
      history questionnaire; personal, family and medical histories; a diet history; a physical
      examination; numerical data on anthropometry, hematology, and pulmonary function;
      supplemental lab data; an X-ray; clinical diagnostic impression; electrocardiogram; and blood
      analysis-fasting lipids. Data collected in examination two in 1981-1982 included: a personal
      and family history; deceased twin information; residence and occupational history; Thurstone
      Activity Scale; leisure time physical activity; social support; medical history; physical
      examination; clinical diagnostic impression; job mobility and stress; retirement information;
      Jenkins Activity Survey; blood lipid measurements. Data collected in examination three in
      1986-1987 included the same data as collected in examination two plus an assessment of the
      prevalence for all twins and the incidence for a subgroup of twins of preclinical
      cardiovascular disease detected through noninvasive techniques.

      The follow-up exam in 1986-87 collected baseline data on cognitive performance in 622
      individuals, including 132 monozygotic and 134 dizygotic twin pairs. Beginning in December,
      1994, a research grant was used to conduct a fourth exam in the surviving subjects of this
      cohort that used this rich resource of available data to determine the relationship between
      cardiovascular risk factors collected over 23 years of follow-up, changes in cognitive
      function since the last exam, and brain morphology assessed by magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI). Given the mean age of this cohort (72 years) in 1995, the next several years
      represented a critical time to monitor age related changes in brain morphology and cognition.
      The addition of a fourth exam made the NHLBI Twin Study the longest longitudinal study of
      cardiovascular disease epidemiology in twin subjects (23 to 25 years of follow-up) and the
      first to investigate the contribution of genes and the environment to associations between
      CVD risk factors, cognitive performance, and brain morphology. There were five specific
      objectives of this study. The first was to evaluate the prospective and cross-sectional
      relationships of cardiovascular risk factors collected over 23 years of follow-up (e.g.,
      blood pressure, lipids, obesity, smoking) and indices of brain morphology assessed at the
      fourth exam. The second objective was to determine the extent that twins discordant for
      essential hypertension or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or cardiovascular
      disease (CHD) showed different MRI profiles. The third was to characterize the
      neuropsychological changes in performance from Exam 3 to Exam 4 and determine the
      contribution of genes and the environment to stability or change. The fourth objective was to
      use the data from exams 1 to 3 to investigate prospective relationships between CVD risk
      factors and decline in cognitive performance from Exam 3 to Exam 4. The fifth was to
      determine the heritability of the new measurements obtained for the first time at the fourth
      examination cycle (e.g., MRI measures of infarct area and localization, white matter
      hyperintensities (WMHI), and ventricular volumes).
