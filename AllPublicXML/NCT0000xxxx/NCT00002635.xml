      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of aminocamptothecin in treating patients
      with advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the antitumor activity of aminocamptothecin (9-AC) administered by
      72-hour infusion in patients with advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. II. Assess the toxic
      effects of 9-AC administered on this schedule.

      OUTLINE: Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Aminocamptothecin, 9-AC, NSC-603071.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued; if no more than 1 response is seen
      in the first 15 patients, the study will close. Probable duration of study is 18 months.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed, advanced stages IIB/III/IV cutaneous
        T-cell lymphoma Measurable or evaluable disease required Measurable disease includes: Skin
        disease evaluated by clinical assessment grid method Lesion measurable on imaging (i.e., CT
        measurement of lymph nodes) Pure osteolytic lesion Unidimensional lesion for which a normal
        measurement is available (e.g., mediastinal width on x-ray) Evaluable disease defined as
        malignant disease evident on physical or radiographic exam but not measurable by ruler or
        caliper, i.e.: Pelvic masses Confluent multinodular lung metastases Skin metastases CNS
        metastases eligible if stable for at least 4 weeks following completion of surgery or
        radiotherapy

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: At
        least 3 months Hematopoietic: ANC at least 1,500 Platelets at least 100,000 Hepatic:
        Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL AST less than 3 times normal Renal: Creatinine no
        greater than 1.5 mg/dL Other: No contraindication to indwelling central venous catheter No
        active infection including HIV No other medical condition that would preclude protocol
        compliance No pregnant or nursing women Adequate contraception required of fertile patients

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: Prior biological therapy allowed Chemotherapy:
        Prior systemic chemotherapy allowed Patients with more than 1 prior regimen analyzed
