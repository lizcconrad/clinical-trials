      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vinorelbine plus paclitaxel in treating
      patients with metastatic prostate cancer that is refractory to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the clinical benefit response (including improvement in quality of
      life) of vinorelbine and paclitaxel in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate
      cancer. II. Correlate PSA response with clinical benefit response in these patients. III.
      Determine the objective response rate and duration of remission in patients with measurable
      disease treated with this regimen. IV. Further assess the toxicity of this combination in a
      cohort of prostate cancer patients. V. Examine the survival characteristics of these patients
      undergoing this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This an open label study. Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days
      1, 2, and 3 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 3 following vinorelbine. Course repeats
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life
      is assessed before each treatment course. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued into this study over 15-30 months.

        chemotherapy No other concurrent chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: See Disease
        Characteristics At least 4 weeks since prior antiandrogens If patients have received prior
        antiandrogens, PSA levels are reassessed at 4 week intervals until there is no decrease in
