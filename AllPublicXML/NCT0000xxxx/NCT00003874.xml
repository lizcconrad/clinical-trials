      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver
      cancer-killing substances without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in
      treating patients who have lymphoma or leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficiency of tumor cell removal by immunomagnetic technique in
      patients with B cell malignancies. II. Determine toxicity of mobilized peripheral blood stem
      cell (PBSC) components of enriched CD34+ and depleted B cells in this patient population.
      III. Compare recovery with the use of this treatment regimen to the use of unmanipulated PBSC
      or CD34+ PBSC components in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to one of two treatment arms for chemotherapy (chemotherapy
      protocol following FHCRC-506.2). Patients undergo mobilization and isolation of CD34+ cells
      as described in FHCRC-506.2. Peripheral blood stem cells are collected by apheresis and the
      CD34+ cells are isolated using magnetic beads. Monoclonal antibodies to CD19 and CD20 are
      added to the CD34+ cells to sensitize any remaining tumor cells. Patients undergo
      transplantation on day 0, according to applicable transplant protocols, one month after
      mobilization. Some patients may receive posttransplant interleukin-2 after achieving durable
      engraftment. Patients are followed at day 30, 80, 180, 365, and 395.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
