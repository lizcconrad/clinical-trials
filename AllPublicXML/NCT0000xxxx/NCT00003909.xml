  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs such as motexafin
      gadolinium may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Phase I trial to
      study the effectiveness of motexafin gadolinium plus radiation therapy in treating children
      who have newly diagnosed brain stem glioma

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and schedule of motexafin gadolinium
      administered prior to radiotherapy in children with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine
      glioma.

      II. Determine the toxic effects of this drug given at the MTD in these patients.

      III. Determine the intratumor and brain distribution of this drug by magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of motexafin gadolinium.

      Approximately 2-5 hours before radiotherapy, patients receive motexafin gadolinium IV over 5
      minutes. Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of motexafin gadolinium until the MTD is
      determined. The first cohort receives motexafin gadolinium 5 days a week for 3 weeks; the
      second cohort receives motexafin gadolinium 3 days a week for 6 weeks; and subsequent cohorts
      receive motexafin gadolinium 5 days a week for 6 weeks. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
