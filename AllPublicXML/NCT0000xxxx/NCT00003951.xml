      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of DX-8951f in treating patients who have
      metastatic cancer of the pancreas that has not been previously treated or that has not
      responded to previous chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with metastatic carcinoma of
      the exocrine pancreas treated with DX-8951f. II. Determine the time to tumor progression in
      patients receiving this drug. III. Determine the survival at 6 and 12 months of patients
      receiving this drug. IV. Evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this regimen
      in this patient population. V. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this drug in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive DX-8951f IV over 30 minutes daily for 5 days. Courses repeat every
      21 days. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
      Patients are followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study.
