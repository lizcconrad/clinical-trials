      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate and duration of response to mitomycin, vinorelbine, and
           cisplatin plus tretinoin in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine survival of these patients with this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive tretinoin orally twice daily for 4 days starting days 1 and 8;
      cisplatin IV over 2 hours and vinorelbine IV on days 1 and 8; and mitomycin IV (courses 1 and
      3) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At total of 15-46 patients will be accrued for this study.
