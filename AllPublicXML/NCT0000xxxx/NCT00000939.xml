    <textblock>
      This study will look at different anti-HIV drug regimens to see which works best to keep the
      level of HIV (viral load) in the blood as low as possible during maintenance therapy. You
      will be assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to 1 of 3 groups:

      Group 1: Didanosine plus stavudine plus hydroxyurea (ddI/d4T/HU). Group 2: Didanosine plus
      stavudine plus efavirenz (ddI/d4T/EFV). Group 3: This group of patients will remain on their
      current drug regimens. This study will last approximately 3 years; you will receive study
      medications for the duration of the study.

      Anti-HIV drug regimens that include protease inhibitors (PIs) are very good at lowering viral
      load. However, some patients have a rise in HIV levels while on PI maintenance. It may be
      possible to keep HIV levels low using another class of drugs for maintenance that are easier
      to take and less expensive than PIs. If viral load increases while a patient is taking this
      second group of drugs, it may be possible to restart the PI drug regimen and again decrease
      HIV levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combination antiretroviral therapies using protease inhibitors (PIs) are capable of
      suppressing plasma HIV RNA to undetectable levels. However, approximately 10% of patients who
      achieve undetectable viral loads will experience a detectable rise in HIV RNA each year. When
      HIV replication has been suppressed to very low levels, it may be possible to consolidate
      antiretroviral therapy into a simpler and potentially less toxic &quot;maintenance&quot; regimen
      without a PI. Such a regimen would ideally be potent enough to continue to maintain viral
      suppression but use agents that are better tolerated, more easily salvaged, less expensive,
      and/or more convenient than PI-containing regimens. Subsequent rises in HIV viremia with
      non-PI maintenance regimens may respond to resumption of the pre-maintenance PI-containing
      regimen, extending the use of the potent PI class.

      Patients are randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with ddI/d4T/HU (Arm A) versus ddI/d4T/EFV (Arm B)
      versus continuation of the pre-entry PI-containing regimen (Arm C). Viral load is measured at
      Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24, then every 8 weeks for up to 3 years. Upon virologic
      failure (plasma HIV RNA greater than or equal to 200 copies/ml), or drug intolerance,
      patients on the maintenance regimens (Arms A and B) restart their pre-entry PI-containing
      regimen. Patients on Arm C are managed according to best medical judgment of their primary
      care provider in the event of virologic failure.
