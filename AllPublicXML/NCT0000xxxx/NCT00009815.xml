      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients who have advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of etoposide when combined with fixed-
      dose fluorouracil-uracil plus leucovorin calcium in patients with advanced solid tumors. II.
      Determine possible side effects and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of etoposide. Patients receive oral etoposide daily
      on days 1-10 and oral fluorouracil-uracil plus oral leucovorin calcium twice a day on days
      1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating
      doses of etoposide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined
      as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more of 6 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 months and then periodically for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
