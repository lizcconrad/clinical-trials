  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 12-week trial will compare individuals receiving naltrexone or placebo plus substance
      abuse counseling therapy versus those receiving only substance abuse counseling therapy in a
      rural, nonacademic setting. A followup period of 12 months is included. The effect on service
      utilization and the cost of the addition of naltrexone to treatment services for alcohol
      dependence also will be assessed. The study will expand existing research concerning the
      effectiveness of naltrexone in clinical trials versus a clinical setting.
