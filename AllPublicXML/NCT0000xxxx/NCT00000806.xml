      PRIMARY: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and ethanol exposure of two
      dose regimens and formulations of SC-52151.

      SECONDARY: To evaluate the preliminary anti-HIV activity of these treatment regimens and the
      relationship between day 14 plasma concentrations of SC-52151 and immunological and
      virological markers and toxicity.

      Since viral isolates with decreased susceptibility to the protease inhibitor SC-52151 occur
      in vitro after multiple passages, and since prolonged post infectious effects occur in vitro,
      comparison of two formulations, an elixir and a self-emulsifying drug delivery system
      (SEDDS), is needed to determine the appropriate dose formulation for Phase II studies.

      Since viral isolates with decreased susceptibility to the protease inhibitor SC-52151 occur
      in vitro after multiple passages, and since prolonged post infectious effects occur in vitro,
      comparison of two formulations, an elixir and a self-emulsifying drug delivery system
      (SEDDS), is needed to determine the appropriate dose formulation for Phase II studies.

      Patients are randomized to four treatment arms to receive SC-52151 elixir or SEDDS
      formulation at 1 of 2 doses for 2 weeks, with follow-up for 14 days.
