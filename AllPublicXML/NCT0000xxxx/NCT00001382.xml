      This trial will evaluate, in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, the tolerability,
      toxicities, efficacy, and immunologic effects of repeated vaccinations with a recombinant
      vaccinia virus that contains the Prostate Specific Antigen gene (PROSTVAC). Patients with
      PSA-expressing adenocarcinoma of the prostate will be evaluated for eligibility that includes
      a history of prior vaccinia (as vaccine against smallpox) and immunocompetence. We completed
      a phase I trial investigating the use of rV-CEA in adenocarcinomas of the GI tract, lung and
      breast. The toxicities encountered are local reactions to the vaccine. We did not encounter
      any myelosuppression or systemic autoimmune reaction. We would like to evaluate four doses to
      ensure safety and to decide a best biological dose. Six patients will receive 2.65 x 10(5)
      PFU and 2.65 x 10(6) PFU of vaccine by scarification. Because higher doses cannot be achieved
      by scarification, six patients will receive 2.65 x 10(7) PFU and 2.65 x 10(8) PFU
      subcutaneously. We plan to give three vaccinations at four week intervals. All six patients
      treated in each dose level must be evaluable for 4 weeks before enrolling patients at the
      higher dose level. No intrapatient escalation is planned. Toxicity, tumor response, and
      humoral and cellular immunity factors will be monitored. Optional lymphapheresis will be done
      on patients that are HLA A2. Once we determined the best biological dose, we would like to
      accrue an additional 6 patients to that level.
