  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy are diagnostic tools that create high
      quality images of the human body without the use of X-ray (radiation). MRI uses different
      levels of magnetic fields to create images of the body and organs. Occasionally, researchers
      will give patients undergoing a MRI an injection of a contrast substance. The contrast
      substance works by brightening areas of the magnetic resonance image.

      In this study researchers plan to use magnetic resonance imaging with contrast substances and
      exercise on normal volunteers in order to evaluate different aspects of its performance.
      Information gathered from this study may be used to develop more specific research studies
      involving MRI....

      Technical evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy will be performed on
      normal volunteers. These studies will be conducted in the NIH MRI systems located in Suburban
      Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. These studies may involve the intravenous administration of
      commercially available MR contrast media and exercise. The results will be used to evaluate
      the performance of various pulse sequences, gradient coils, and RF coils on human subjects
      and will provide essential ground work for specific patient protocols.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Any normal volunteer above the age 18 who is capable of giving informed consent will be
        included.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A subject will be excluded if he/she has a contradiction to MR scanning.

          1. Brain aneurysm clip

          2. Implanted neural stimulator

          3. Implanted cardiac pacemaker implanted defibrillator

          4. Cochlear implant

          5. Ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings)

          6. Insulin pump

          7. Pregnant women (when uncertain, subjects will undergo urine or blood testing).

          8. Kidney

          9. Paralyzed hemidiaphragm

         10. Morbid obesity

         11. Claustrophobia

         12. Any condition in the PI's judgement which present unncessary risk

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR GADOLINIUM ENHANCED STUDIES:

          1. Lactating women

          2. Subjects with hemoglobinopathies

          3. Asthma

          4. Renal or hepatic disease

        Subjects will be excluded if it is deemed that they have a condition that would preclude
        their use for technical development (e.g. paralyzed hemidiaphragm, morbid obesity,
        claustrophobia etc.) or present unnecessary risk (e.g. pregnancy, surgery of uncertain
        type, etc.).

        Lactating women and subjects with hemoglobinopathies, asthma, or renal or hepatic disease
        will be excluded from studies involving the adminstration of contrast agents.
