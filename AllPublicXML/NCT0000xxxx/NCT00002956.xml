      RATIONALE: Donor lymphocytes that have been exposed to Epstein-Barr virus may be able to help
      the body kill cancers associated with this virus.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of Epstein-Barr virus-specific T cells
      derived from matched donors in organ transplant patients with lymphoproliferative diseases
      associated with Epstein-Barr virus.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Examine the toxic effects of allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) specific
      cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) for the treatment of EBV lymphoproliferative diseases (LPD) in
      organ transplant recipients. II. Determine the level of in vivo expansion of allogeneic CTL
      and the period of time during which these CTL's can be detected in the blood of recipients of
      the T cell infusions.

      OUTLINE: Donors undergo leukapheresis, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) specific cytoxic T
      lymphocytes are cultivated in vitro. Patients receive infusions of EBV specific cytotoxic T
      lymphocytes over 5 to 10 minutes on weeks 0, 2, and 4. Patients with stable disease and those
      achieving partial remission are followed weekly for signs of disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 10 patients will be accrued in this study.
