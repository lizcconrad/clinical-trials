  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect medical information about HIV-positive pregnant women
      and their babies who have been (or are being) seen at study sites. This information will be
      used to help design future research studies for these patients.

      The population of HIV-positive pregnant women and their babies who are seen at study sites
      has not been officially examined. In order to design future studies to research the best care
      for these patients, this study will examine important characteristics and the general number
      of women in these trials.

      The population served at affiliated ACTG sites has not been officially described. Anecdotal
      evidence, however, has surfaced regarding the characteristics of HIV-infected pregnant women
      and the current standard of care during pregnancy. This chart abstraction study is designed
      to define, more accurately, the pertinent characteristics and general numbers of women in
      these trials.

      In this medical chart abstraction study, pertinent information is collected on all
      HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants who receive primary or consultative care at
      PACTG 367 study sites. Part A profiles all HIV-infected women who received care or
      consultation at study sites and who had a pregnancy outcome between January 1, 1998 through
      July 1, 1998. [AS PER AMENDMENT 04/12/02: Part A is closed to enrollment.] Part B profiles
      HIV-infected pregnant women who receive primary or consultative care and a pregnancy outcome
      following July 1, 1998.
