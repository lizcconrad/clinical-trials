  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the steady state pharmacokinetic features, tolerance, and safety of orally
      administered 1592U89, given alone or in combination with other antiretroviral medications, in
      HIV infected infants and children. To establish doses of 1592U89 appropriate for future
      pediatric Phase II/III clinical trials.

      On the basis of the preclinical and clinical studies, 1592U89 appears to be a promising agent
      for treatment of HIV infection in children, either as an alternative to currently employed
      agents, or in combination therapy regimens. A liquid formulation of the drug is available;
      thus concurrent development of 1592U89 for children and adults is possible.

      On the basis of the preclinical and clinical studies, 1592U89 appears to be a promising agent
      for treatment of HIV infection in children, either as an alternative to currently employed
      agents, or in combination therapy regimens. A liquid formulation of the drug is available;
      thus concurrent development of 1592U89 for children and adults is possible.

      In part 1, patients will receive 1592U89 monotherapy for 12 weeks. Patients will be assigned
      initially to a low dose of 1592U89 (Dose A). Those patients who tolerate the drug for at
      least six weeks without a toxicity of grade 3 or above attributable to study drug will have
      their 1592U89 dose increased (Dose B). If none of those patients experience a life
      threatening event attributable to study drug, subsequent enrollees will be assigned initially
      to Dose B. In part 2, each participant will be assigned randomly (1:1:1:1) within their age
      and Part 1 regimen stratum to one of the four agents: Zidovudine (ZDV), Stavudine (d4T),
      Didanosine (ddI) or Lamivudine (3TC) in combination with 1592U89.
