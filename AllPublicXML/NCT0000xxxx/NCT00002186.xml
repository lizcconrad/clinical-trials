      To evaluate the safety of topically applied SP-303 gel and to compare the efficacy of SP-303
      gel in combination with acyclovir, relative to acyclovir alone, for the treatment of
      recurrent Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) 1 and 2 infections, affecting the genital, perianal and
      neighboring areas, in patients with AIDS.

      This trial is a double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants
      are randomized to topical 15% SP-303 gel and oral acyclovir or to matching topical placebo
      gel and oral acyclovir. At presentation, patients are stratified by total lesion area within
      each treatment group. SP-303 or matching placebo is topically applied three times a day until
      all lesions are reepithelialized or for 14 days, whichever occurs earlier. Acyclovir is
      administered by mouth each day, three times a day, until all lesions are reepithelialized or
      for 14 days, whichever occurs earlier. Patients are evaluated for lesion healing and adverse
      events 3 times per week during the treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint will be
      complete lesion healing and the primary analysis will be time to complete healing.
