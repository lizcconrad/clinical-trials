        Patients must have:

          -  Serum HIV antibody positive by ELISA.

          -  KS documented by biopsy (repeat biopsy is not required for entry if KS has been
             previously confirmed histologically and the histopathology report has been reviewed).

          -  A minimum of 6 mucocutaneous KS lesions, including at least 3 raised lesions, each of
             which has been present for at least 30 days or has a longest dimension of at least
             10mm, and has not received prior local or topical therapy within 60 days of study
             entry.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

          -  Mycobacterium avium intracellulare or other mycobacterium infection; Pneumocystis
             carinii pneumonia; CMV retinitis or colitis; Toxoplasma brain abscess; Cryptococcal
             meningitis.

          -  Serious intercurrent illness or infection that would interfere with the ability of the
             patient to carry out the treatment program.

          -  Known allergy or sensitivity to retinoid class drugs.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Local or topical therapy such as, but not limited to, Vitamin A, tretinoin
             (all-trans-retinoic acid), other retinoid class drugs, or intralesional (injection)
             therapy to any KS indicator lesion.

          -  Systemic anticancer chemotherapy, systemic anticancer hormonal therapy, and/or
             systemic anticancer immunotherapy.

          -  Systemic use of retinoid class drugs, beta-carotene compounds, or Vitamin A in doses
             greater than 15,000 IU (5,000 mcg) per day (equivalent to approximately 3 times the
             RDA) for any indication.

          -  Human chorionic gonadotropin.

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Excluded:

        Radiotherapy, cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and/or laser therapy for any KS indicator
        lesion.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Systemic treatment of KS within 30 days of study entry.

          -  Systemic treatment with either Vitamin A in doses greater than 15,000 IU (5,000 mcg)
             per day (equivalent to approximately 3 times the RDA) or other retinoid class drugs
             for any indication within 30 days of study entry.

          -  Previous local or topical therapy of any KS indicator lesion such as, but not limited
             to, Vitamin A, tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid), other retinoid class drugs, or
             intralesional (injection) therapy within 60 days of study entry.

        Prior Treatment:

        Excluded:

          -  Radiotherapy, cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy and/or laser therapy within 60 days of
