      The purpose of this study is to see if adding 1 or 2 drugs to the anti-HIV therapy of
      patients whose HIV levels increased while taking their anti-HIV drugs can lower viral load
      (amount of HIV in the blood) and keep it low up to Week 24. (This study has been changed.
      Previously, only patients whose levels increased on their first round of anti-HIV drugs were
      being studied.) Anti-HIV drug treatments that contain a combination of 3 or more drugs can
      lower HIV levels, raise CD4 cell counts, and improve survival. Unfortunately, many patients
      &quot;fail&quot; their anti-HIV drug treatment when their HIV levels go above 500 copies/ml. Usually
      the next step is to switch the patient to different anti-HIV drugs. Doctors would like to see
      whether adding 1 or 2 different drugs to the &quot;failed&quot; treatment also can lower HIV levels.
      Adding 1 or 2 drugs might be better than switching all of the drugs since patients who take
      many different drugs can develop drug-resistant HIV. (This study has been changed.
      Previously, only patients taking protease inhibitors (PI) whose levels increased on their
      first round of anti-HIV drugs were being studied.)

    <textblock>
      Successful therapy following viral rebound has been problematic. Intensification of the
      existing regimen by adding 1 or 2 drugs generally has been avoided. However, successfully
      adding new drugs to an existing regimen would be advantageous since it would expose the
      patient to fewer antiretroviral agents in the overall treatment course. Recent evidence
      suggests that a significant proportion of patients who experience viral rebound while
      receiving a protease inhibitor (PI) actually have viral rebound with a PI-sensitive virus.
      Other studies have shown that treatment decisions based on resistance assays result in better
      virologic outcomes. This trial examines further the effect of resistance assay-directed
      intensification of a PI-containing antiretroviral regimen on viral load. [AS PER AMENDMENT
      04/03/01: The antiretroviral regimen need not contain a protease inhibitor.]

      Patients are stratified by baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (5,000 copies/ml or less versus
      greater than 5,000 copies/ml). Patients undergo phenotypic drug resistance testing prior to
      study entry. Based on the phenotypic results, patients are [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/9/00:
      selectively] randomized equally to 1 of 3 [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/9/00: 1 of 2] intensification
      strategies while remaining on their current, initial [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/9/00: (background)]
      antiretroviral therapy (ART). [AS PER AMENDMENT 04/03/01: ART need not be initial.] A patient
      is excluded from randomization to an arm if that arm contains a drug to which the patient has
      phenotypic resistance. Arm A adds abacavir (ABC). Arm B adds amprenavir (APV) [AS PER
      AMENDMENT 11/9/00: and ritonavir (RTV)]. Arm C adds didanosine (ddI) plus hydroxyurea (HU).
      [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/9/00: Arm C has been discontinued.] A patient's HIV must be sensitive to
      at least 3 drugs. [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/9/00: Each patient must be taking at least 3 drugs to
      which his/her HIV isolate is sensitive, including ABC or APV and at least 2 other drugs that
      are part of the current, initial (background) ART. If phenotypic resistance testing at
      screening indicates resistance to a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) drug in
      the patient's current, initial (background) ART, then the local investigator may choose to
      discontinue that drug. However, the patient and local investigator may choose to continue the
      drug but it will not be considered an active drug per this protocol.] [AS PER AMENDMENT
      04/03/01: ART need not be initial.] Patients have regular clinic visits for physical exams
      and blood tests, including CD4 and CD8 cell counts, plasma HIV-1 RNA assays, and tests for
      pharmacokinetic variability. In the event of viral rebound of 500 copies/ml or more at Week
      12 or later, phenotypic/genotypic drug resistance is assayed. In addition, phenotypic drug
      resistance is assayed at the primary endpoint (Week 24) and at the end of treatment (Week 48)
      on all patients.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Are HIV-positive.

          -  Are taking 3 or more anti-HIV drugs for at least 24 weeks. (This study has been
             changed. Previously, only patients taking their first round of anti-HIV drugs, which
             included a PI, were being studied.)

          -  Had a viral load below 500 copies/ml while on their anti-HIV drugs, and then had an
             increase in viral load to between 500 and 10,000 copies/ml. (This study has been

             anti-HIV drugs were being studied.)
