      BACKGROUND:

      Numerous observational epidemiologic studies have established ethanol intake as one of the
      most important determinants of blood pressure levels. However, data from intervention studies
      were very limited.

      The study was an inter-agency agreement involving the Veterans Administration and the
      National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). Protocol development occurred
      between October 1988 and June 1989. The protocol was approved by the VA Cooperative Studies
      Evaluation Committee in July 1989 and reviewed by a separate Data and Safety Monitoring Board
      in September 1989.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Subjects were randomized to intervention or control groups. Intervention aimed to reduce
      alcohol intake to no more than 14 drinks per week and 50 percent or less of each
      participant's baseline level. The intervention technique consisted of a cognitive-behavioral
      program, the intensive phase of which consisted of six counseling sessions over three months.
      Echocardiograms were obtained at baseline and six months after randomization. Biochemical
      markers were used to validate changes in alcohol consumption. The trial included an
      eighteen-month feasibility phase with six-month follow-up and a 36-month main trial with two
      years of follow-up. Recruitment for the full-scale trial ended in June 1993. Final study
      visits were conducted in September and October 1994.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in
      the Query View Report System (QVR).
