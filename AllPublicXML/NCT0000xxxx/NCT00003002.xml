      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from the HER2/neu antigen may make the body build an immune response
      and kill tumor cells. Colony-stimulating factors such as GM-CSF increase the number of immune
      cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of HER-2/neu vaccine plus GM-CSF in
      treating patients who have stage III or stage IV breast cancer, stage III or stage IV ovarian
      cancer, or stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of serial intradermal vaccinations of HER-2/neu derived
      peptides with sargramostim (GM-CSF) as an adjuvant in patients with stage III or IV HER-2/neu
      expressing breast, ovarian, or nonsmall cell lung cancer. II. Determine whether immunity can
      be elicited with peptides derived from the intracellular domain of the HER-2/neu protein.
      III. Determine whether immunity can be elicited with peptides derived from the extracellular
      domain of the HER-2/neu protein. IV. Determine whether cytotoxic T cells specific for the
      HER-2/neu protein can be elicited in patients with HLA-A2 by immunization with peptides
      derived from the HER-2/neu protein.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive one of three HER-2/neu peptide vaccine formulations that also
      contain sargramostim (GM-CSF) as the vaccine adjuvant. Each vaccine is studied in 20
      patients. A maximum of 3 patients receive a vaccine each month for 6 months to monitor the
      potential toxicity associated with sequential immunizations. Patients receive a follow-up
      evaluation 1 month after the last vaccination. Those patients who have an immune response
      related to the vaccine will continue to have immunologic evaluations performed every 2 months
      while immune responses can still be detected.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 60 patients will be accrued.
