  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare cognitive behavioral therapy with a time-limited motivational
      enhancement therapy to which naltrexone (Revia) or placebo medication is added. In this
      randomized clinical trial, 160 alcohol-dependent outpatients, after 5 days of abstinence,
      will receive one of the two psychosocial therapies and either naltrexone (Revia) or placebo
      for a 12-week treatment period. Abstinence rates, alcohol use, and time to alcohol relapse
      will be evaluated in all four groups along with measures of alcohol craving, biological
      measures of alcohol consumption, drinking consequences, changes in self-confidence for
      avoiding alcohol, and medication compliance. All study participants will be assessed for
      measures of outcome variables at 3 and 6 months after completing the treatment protocol.
