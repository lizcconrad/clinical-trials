  <brief_summary>

      Primary: To compare the toxicity of daily versus weekly dapsone in HIV-infected infants and
      children; to study the pharmacokinetics of orally administered dapsone in HIV-infected
      infants and children.

      Secondary: To obtain information on the rate of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP )
      breakthrough in children receiving two different dose regimens of dapsone.

      Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) is recommended for all HIV-infected
      children considered to be at high risk. Approximately 15 percent of children are intolerant
      to trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole, the first choice drug for PCP prophylaxis. Since many
      children are also unable to take or tolerate aerosolized pentamidine, dapsone is a second
      choice for PCP prophylaxis. The most favorable dose regimen for dapsone has not been
      established.

      Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) is recommended for all HIV-infected
      children considered to be at high risk. Approximately 15 percent of children are intolerant
      to trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole, the first choice drug for PCP prophylaxis. Since many
      children are also unable to take or tolerate aerosolized pentamidine, dapsone is a second
      choice for PCP prophylaxis. The most favorable dose regimen for dapsone has not been
      established.

      Ninety-six HIV-infected infants and children who are intolerant to trimethoprim /
      sulfamethoxazole ( TMP / SMX ) are randomized to receive oral dapsone in a lower dose once
      daily or at a higher dose once weekly. Treatment continues until the last patient enrolled
      has received at least 3 months of therapy. Blood samples are drawn between weeks 4 and 8, at
      weeks 12 and 24, and every 3 months thereafter during dapsone administration.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Rifampin and rifampin derivatives for up to 1 week during the study.

          -  Rifabutin or other drugs that could alter dapsone metabolism (if prescribed by the
             child's primary care physician).

        Patients must have:

          -  Evidence of HIV infection.

        PER AMENDMENT 11/16/95:

          -  Children who require prophylaxis. (Was written - Risk of developing PCP.)

          -  Known intolerance to TMP / SMX.

          -  Consent of parent or guardian. Patients entering this study may be co-enrolled in
             other ACTG pediatric studies.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms and conditions are excluded:

          -  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

          -  Known allergy to dapsone.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Rifampin, rifampin derivatives, or oxidant drugs for more than 1 week.

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  Serious or life-threatening reactions to TMP / SMX (e.g., anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson
             syndrome, hypotension) that would contraindicate therapy with sulfa drugs.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Prior dapsone.

          -  Rifampin, rifampin derivatives, or oxidant drugs within 1 week prior to study entry.

          -  TMP / SMX within 7 days prior to study entry (and toxicity must be clearly resolving).

        Prior Treatment:

        Excluded:

          -  RBC transfusion within 4 weeks prior to study entry.
