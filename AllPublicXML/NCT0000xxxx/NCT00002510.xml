      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer
      cells. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow doctors to give higher doses of
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy and kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of etoposide plus radiation therapy
      followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the overall and progression-free survival of patients with selected
      poor-prognosis non-Hodgkin's lymphomas treated with high-dose etoposide and total-body
      irradiation followed by rescue with peripheral blood stem cells. II. Determine the toxicity
      of this regimen. III. Evaluate the short-term and long-term engraftment characteristics of
      patients treated on this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients who respond on Regimen A and who have no bulk disease greater than 5 cm are
      treated on Regimen B. Regimen A: Single-Agent Chemotherapy/Stem Cell Mobilization with
      Urothelial Protection and Growth Factor Therapy. Cyclophosphamide, CTX, NSC-26271; with
      Mesna, NSC-113891; and Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (Amgen), G-CSF, NSC-614629.
      Regimen B: Sequential Radiotherapy, Single-Agent Chemotherapy, and Stem Cell Rescue.
      Total-body irradiation, TBI (equipment not specified); Etoposide, VP-16, NSC-141540; and
      Peripheral Blood Stem Cells, PBSC.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20 patients will be studied.
