      Assess the durability of treatment response in these patients, 3) Assess the improvement in
      psychiatric disability in these patients, and 4) Assess the effects of comorbid Axis I

      In this trial, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either fluoxetine or
      placebo. Treatment will consists of two phases (acute treatment and maintenance). In the
      acute treatment phase, participants will receive fluoxetine or placebo daily for 12 weeks.
      Participants will be followed every 2 weeks. In the Maintenance phase, participants showing
      significant improvement after 12 weeks may continue treatment for an additional 6 months. In
      this phase, participants are followed every 4 weeks.

      Participants who do not improve during the acute treatment phase may receive open fluoxetine,
      or another appropriate medication, for 3 months.
