      RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures, such as laparoscopic ultrasound, may improve the
      ability to detect pancreatic cancer and determine the extent of disease.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of laparoscopic ultrasound in diagnosing
      patients with stage I or stage II pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether a comprehensive laparoscopic examination of the abdomen with
      laparoscopic ultrasonography improves staging of pancreatic cancer with respect to (a) better
      assessment (compared to CT) of the extent of localized extra pancreatic disease, (b) vascular
      invasion, (c) regional lymph node involvement, and (d) metastatic deposits in liver
      parenchyma. II. Assess whether one of the newer minimally invasive imaging techniques,
      laparoscopic ultrasonography, predicts vascular invasion in pancreatic cancer. III. Develop
      an optimal cost effective strategy for assessing resectability in pancreatic cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients who have undergone routine clinical staging (CT scan, angiogram, etc.) and
      who have been classified as potentially resectable undergo laparoscopy and laparoscopic
      ultrasound (L+LUS). At the end of the L+LUS, based on the new findings patients are
      reclassified as either potentially resectable or potentially unresectable. All patient then
      undergo definitive staging: those who have metastasis to the liver that can be pathologically
      confirmed by biopsy at the time of the laparoscopy are classified as unresectable and do not
      undergo laparotomy; all others undergo laparotomy and then are classified as resectable or
      unresectable. If 8 or more patients are misclassified at the time of the L+LUS, then this
      study is terminated.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 50 patients accrued into this study with 25 patients in each
      stage. In order to accrue 50 patients, approximately 70 patients will undergo the initial
      routine clinical staging (CT scan, angiogram, etc.).
