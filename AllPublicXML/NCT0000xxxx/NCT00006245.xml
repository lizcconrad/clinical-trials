      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining flavopiridol and paclitaxel
      in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer that has not
      responded to previous paclitaxel therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with paclitaxel-refractory locally advanced or
           metastatic esophageal cancer treated with sequential paclitaxel and flavopiridol.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Obtain pharmacokinetic information about this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and flavopiridol IV continuously over 24
      hours on day 2 weekly for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after courses 1 and 2, and then every 2 courses
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-18
      months.
