  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the tolerance and safety of increasing doses of AL-721 in patients with persistent
      generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) and symptomatic HIV infection, and to obtain preliminary
      information on the effectiveness of AL-721 against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in
      HIV-infected persons with PGL and symptomatic HIV infection. Although zidovudine (AZT)
      prolongs life in certain AIDS patients, it is not a cure for AIDS and it also has toxic
      effects in many patients. Therefore, it is necessary to test other drugs in HIV-infected
      patients. AL-721 is a mixture of lipids (fats) extracted from egg yolks. Laboratory tests
      suggest that it might inhibit the infectivity of the HIV. AL-721 has been tried so far in a
      few patients for short periods of time and has been found to be well tolerated.

      Although zidovudine (AZT) prolongs life in certain AIDS patients, it is not a cure for AIDS
      and it also has toxic effects in many patients. Therefore, it is necessary to test other
      drugs in HIV-infected patients. AL-721 is a mixture of lipids (fats) extracted from egg
      yolks. Laboratory tests suggest that it might inhibit the infectivity of the HIV. AL-721 has
      been tried so far in a few patients for short periods of time and has been found to be well
      tolerated.

      Patients receive AL-721 twice daily. The first dose is taken on an empty stomach 1 hour
      before a fat-free breakfast, with specific instructions given on foods that are allowed; the
      second dose is taken at least 3 hours after the evening meal. No snacks are permitted after
      the evening meal or after the evening dose of study medication. The study is scheduled to
      last for 16 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks of follow-up. Throughout the study, frequent blood
      samples will be taken from an arm vein. The blood samples are studied to evaluate any changes
      in the patient's immune system, any toxic effects that might be detected in the blood, and
      any changes in the presence of the HIV in the blood.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) (CDC-Group III), defined as palpable
             lymphadenopathy (nodes of 1 cm or greater) at two or more noncontiguous extrainguinal
             sites persisting for &gt; 3 months in the absence of an illness other than HIV infection
             to account for the findings.

          -  AIDS related complex (ARC), defined as the presence of at least one of the following
             findings within 12 months prior to entry and the absence of a concurrent illness or
