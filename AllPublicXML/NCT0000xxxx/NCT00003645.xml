      RATIONALE: Testosterone can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy
      using leuprolide and flutamide may fight prostate cancer by reducing the production of
      testosterone. It is not yet known whether receiving leuprolide and flutamide is more
      effective than receiving no further therapy.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of hormone therapy in
      treating patients who have stage I or stage II prostate cancer that is at high risk of
      recurrence and who have already undergone surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the effect of one year of adjuvant hormonal ablation on disease-free survival
           at 5 years in node-negative radical prostatectomy patients at high risk for progression.

        -  Determine the effect of this treatment on the incidence of androgen independent prostate
           cancer and on disease specific and overall survival.

        -  Determine the impact of one year of total androgen ablation on quality of life and serum
           testosterone levels.

        -  Assess differences in quality of life between wives of patients in the androgen ablation
           condition compared to wives of patients in the control condition.

        -  Obtain blood samples from patients at high risk for failure post-prostatectomy to
           evaluate serum markers of prognosis.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive leuprolide intramuscularly once every 3 months and oral
           flutamide three times daily for 1 year.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive no initial treatment. Quality of life is assessed every 6
           months for 5 years. Quality of life of wives/partners of patients is assessed every 6
           months for two years.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 496 patients (248 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3.5 years.
