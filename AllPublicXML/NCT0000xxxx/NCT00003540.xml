      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine in treating women with
      metastatic breast cancer previously treated with doxorubicin and paclitaxel.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective response rate to gemcitabine in women with metastatic breast
           cancer previously treated with two to four chemotherapy regimens, including doxorubicin
           and paclitaxel.

        -  Characterize the nature of toxicity of gemcitabine in this patient population.

        -  Determine the response duration to gemcitabine in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks
      (days 1, 8, and 15) followed by 1 week of rest. Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects.

      Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 13 months.
