  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of trastuzumab alone and in combination
      with docetaxel in treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that is refractory to
      hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel (arm I) vs trastuzumab (Herceptin) (arm
           II), followed by a combination of docetaxel and trastuzumab in patients with
           androgen-independent or hormone-refractory metastatic, Her2/neu-positive prostate
           cancer. (Arm I closed to accrual effective 07/30/2001.)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment continues
           every 8 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. (Arm I
           closed to accrual effective 07/30/2001. Arm I patients crossover to arm II.)

        -  Arm II: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes weekly for 8
           weeks. Treatment continues every 8 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with progressive or stable disease after 2 courses of single-agent therapy receive
      docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 of each week for 6 consecutive weeks and trastuzumab IV
      over 30-90 minutes on day 1 of each week for 8 consecutive weeks. Treatment continues every 8
      weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with complete or partial response to single-agent therapy continue on that therapy
      until experiencing progressive or stable disease. The patients then proceed to combination
      therapy.

      Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 108-160 patients (54-80 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study. (Arm I closed to accrual effective 07/30/2001.)
