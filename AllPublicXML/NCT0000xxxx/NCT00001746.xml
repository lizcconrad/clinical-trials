  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetically inherited heart diseases like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are conditions
      affecting the heart passed on to family members by abnormalities in genetic information.
      These conditions are responsible for many heart related deaths and illnesses.

      Presently, there are several research studies being conducted in order to improve the
      understanding of disease processes and symptoms associated with genetically inherited heart
      diseases.

      This study is designed to determine the eligibility of patients diagnosed with or suspected
      to have inherited heart disease to participate in these research studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and other inherited cardiac diseases are
      being studied under several research protocols to determine their pathogenesis and clinical
      manifestations. The purpose of this protocol is to determine the eligibility of patients with
      known or suspected inherited heart conditions for our research protocols.
