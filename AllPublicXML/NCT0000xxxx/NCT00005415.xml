      BACKGROUND:

      In recent years, the benefits of a physically active lifestyle have been well established
      with respect to chronic health problems such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, obesity
      and osteoporosis. However, the extent to which physical activity influences health care
      utilization is less clear. If physical activity levels are inversely associated with
      utilization patterns, then policies encouraging exercise may produce short-term reduction in
      health care costs.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A multivariate regression analysis was conducted for a representative sample of more than 600
      adults who participated in a longitudinal field trial of health risk appraisal instruments.
      Using the Harvard Alumni Activity Survey as the physical activity measure, the analysis
      controlled for a variety of predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics that also
      influenced utilization behavior.
