  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two anti-HIV drugs, FTC and lamivudine (3TC), when
      given with either stavudine (d4T) or zidovudine (ZDV) and one other anti-HIV drug.

    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to one of two arms in a 2:1 ratio (weighted to Arm 1). Arm 1: Replace
      lamivudine with FTC while continuing on current background regimen. Arm 2: Continue on
      current lamivudine-containing regimen. Patients are further stratified based upon screening
      plasma HIV-1 RNA and background therapy. Stratum 1: Less than 50 copies/ml; PI (protease
      inhibitor) in treatment regimen. Stratum 2: Less than 50 copies/ml; NNRTI (nonnucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitor) in treatment regimen. Stratum 3: 50-400 copies/ml; PI in
      treatment regimen. Stratum 4: 50-400 copies/ml; NNRTI in treatment regimen. Clinic visits
      occur at regular intervals throughout the 48-week study period to determine viral load.
