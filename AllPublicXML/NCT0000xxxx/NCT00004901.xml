  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Combining more than one chemotherapy drug with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus
      radiation therapy in treating patients who have advanced mouth cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the feasibility of the administration of ethynyluracil concurrently
      with fluorouracil and radiotherapy in patients with advanced oral cancer. II. Determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of fluorouracil and hydroxyurea. Patients receive
      oral ethynyluracil every 12 hours on days 1-7 and oral fluorouracil every 12 hours on days
      2-6. Radiotherapy to the head and neck is administered twice daily on days 2-6. Treatment
      continues for 5-7 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients
      receive escalating doses of fluorouracil until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 patients experience
      dose limiting toxicities. Once the MTD of fluorouracil is determined, hydroxyurea is added to
      the treatment regimen. Patients receive fluorouracil and ethynyluracil as per the treatment
      schedule outlined above. Patients also receive oral hydroxyurea every 12 hours for 11 doses
      on days 1-6. Radiotherapy is administered as above. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of hydroxyurea until the MTD is determined. Once the MTD of fluorouracil and
      hydroxyurea are determined, an additional 10 patients receive Phase II doses of
      ethynyluracil, fluorouracil and hydroxyurea as per the treatment schedule outlined above.
      Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 4-6
      weeks, then every 6 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.
