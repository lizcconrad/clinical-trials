  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial examines whether the addition of individual sessions of a motivational
      intervention to a state-of-the art behavioral group weight loss intervention for overweight
      women with Type 2 diabetes improves the weight losses and glycemic control outcomes.

      The multi-disciplinary behavioral, group-based intervention focuses on dietary and exercise
      changes, with group meetings over an 18-month period. Participants are assessed at 6-month
      intervals (for a total of 18 months) to examine the impact of the interventions on body
      weight and blood sugar control (primary outcomes), as well as on blood pressure, cholesterol,
      quality of life and attitudes (secondary outcomes). All enrolled participants receive
      group-based weight loss intervention. Half the women enrolled also receive several individual
      sessions of motivational interviewing and the other half of enrolled women receive the same
      number of individual sessions of health education, which focus on issues relevant to women
      (e.g., mammography, sleep hygiene, menopause, etc).
