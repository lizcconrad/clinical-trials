  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are healthy adult volunteers either at high risk for HIV infection or already known
      to be seropositive, who will donate blood for in vitro tests of T-cell function and in vitro
      responses to synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences from HIV proteins.
