      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. CT-2584 may stop the growth of prostate cancer by stopping blood
      flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CT-2584 in treating patients
      who have metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of 2 different treatment
      schedules of CT-2584 in patients with hormone refractory, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
      prostate.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms: Arm I: Patients receive CT-2584 IV over 6 hours daily for 3 days every 3 weeks. Arm II:
      Patients receive CT-2584 IV over 6 hours once every 7 days for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every
      3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 80 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate
        Refractory to hormonal therapy Failed at least 1 nonhormonal therapy (prior radiotherapy
        allowed, but does not constitute nonhormonal therapy) No CNS metastases

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Performance status: 60-100% Life expectancy: Not
        specified Hematopoietic: No known or suspected red blood cell disorder (e.g., hereditary
        spherocytosis, paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria, sickle cell trait, autoimmune hemolytic
        disorder) Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL No severe liver dysfunction,
        particularly, no impaired hepatic synthetic functions as evidenced by prolonged prothrombin
        time or otherwise unexplained serum albumin less than 3 g/dL Renal: Creatinine no greater
        than 1.5 mg/dL Cardiovascular: No evidence of congestive heart failure No clinically
        significant cardiac arrhythmia No prior or concurrent symptoms of acute coronary artery
        disease No significant cardiac valve disease (e.g., aortic stenosis, valve prosthesis)
        Pulmonary: No prior asthma during adulthood that required therapy Other: No prior seizures
        or drug related anaphylactic reactions No history of microangiopathy (e.g., cavenous
        hemangioma, prior thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura)

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: At least 4 weeks since prior systemic biologic
        therapy for prostate cancer and recovered Chemotherapy: At least 4 weeks since prior
        chemotherapy (12 weeks for strontium-89 and 6 weeks for bicalutamide) and recovered
        Endocrine therapy: See Disease Characteristics Radiotherapy: See Disease Characteristics No
        concurrent radiotherapy Surgery: At least 3 weeks since prior major thoracic or abdominal
        surgery Other: At least 4 weeks since other prior investigational drugs (except
        bisphosphonates) and recovered
