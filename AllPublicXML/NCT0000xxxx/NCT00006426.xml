  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with diabetes often develop severe skin problems (ulcers) on their feet. Sometimes
      these are treated with surgery and other times by temporarily immobilizing the foot in a
      cast. This study compares the effect of surgery to lengthen the Achilles tendon and put the
      foot in a cast, to using a cast alone. The study will also examine how foot strength, joint
      movement, and overall ability to walk, balance and climb stairs is affected.

      Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and peripheral neuropathy are at high risk for forefoot
      plantar ulcers and subsequent lower extremity amputation. Total contact casting currently is
      the most effective treatment for healing neuropathic plantar ulcers but ulcer recurrence is
      high (30-50%) when patients discontinue casting and resume walking. An equinus deformity
      (limited ankle dorsiflexion range-of-motion) is associated with these recurrent ulcers.
      Although descriptive evidence indicates an Achilles lengthening procedure (which corrects the
      equinus deformity) can improve healing rates in these chronic ulcers, there have been no
      controlled studies.

      This randomized prospective controlled clinical trial will determine if percutaneous Achilles
      lengthening and total contact casting is more effective than total contact casting alone in
      healing forefoot plantar ulcers (n=30/group will allow detection of 25% effect with power of
      0.8 at alpha level of 0.05). Secondary purposes are to determine the effects of casting and
      percutaneous lengthening on measures of impairments, functional limitations, and disability
      in patients with DM and peripheral neuropathy. The specific aims of this project are to
      determine the effect of the Achilles lengthening procedure on patients with DM, peripheral
      neuropathy, a forefoot ulcer, and an equinus deformity in regards to 1) Wound healing, 2)
      Impairments (dorsiflexion range-of-motion, plantar flexor muscle performance), 3) Functional
      Limitations (Physical Performance Test, Functional Reach, walking ability), and 4) Disability
      (SF36). The results will have important implications for prevention of wound infection and
      lower extremity amputation; and improvement in impairments, functional limitations, and
      disability in this group of high risk patients with chronic disease. Approximately 30
      patients will be recruited for each of the treatment groups.
