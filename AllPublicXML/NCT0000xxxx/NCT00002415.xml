  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to add PMPA Prodrug (a new
      anti-HIV drug) to an anti-HIV drug combination taken by patients who have taken anti-HIV
      drugs in the past. Genetic response will be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to study entry patients are stratified according to HIV-1 RNA level, CD4 cell count,
      and number of antiretroviral drugs. PMPA Prodrug or placebo is added to current
      antiretroviral regimens, and is administered in one of three dosing regimens. Patients
      randomized to receive placebo are eligible to receive open-label PMPA Prodrug for the
      remainder of the 48-week study period after at least 24 weeks post randomization.
