  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current therapies for Stage IV Melanoma provide very limited benefit to the patient. The
      anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove beneficial in the
      treatment of Stage IV Melanoma.

      PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that
      Antineoplaston therapy has on patients with Stage IV Melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stage IV Melanoma patients receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston
      therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment
      continues up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Stage IV Melanoma,
           as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial response or
           stable disease).

        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Stage
           IV Melanoma.

        -  To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing MRI scans, which are
           performed every 8 weeks for the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth
           years, every 6 months for the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.

    <description>Patients with Stage IV Melanoma will receive Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal).
The daily doses of A10 and AS2-1 are divided into six infusions, which are given at 4-hourly intervals. Each infusion starts with infusion of A10 and is immediately followed by infusion of AS2-1.</description>
