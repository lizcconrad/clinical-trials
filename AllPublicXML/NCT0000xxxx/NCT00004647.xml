      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by
      participating institution.

      The first group receives oral mexiletine 3 times a day for 6 weeks. The dose is increased
      after the first week if there are no side effects.

      The second group receives a placebo. Patients cross to the alternate treatment after a 1-week
      washout.
