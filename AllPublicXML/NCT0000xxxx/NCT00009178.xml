  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bulimia Nervosa is a frequent problem for young women. It is widely assumed that this
      disorder cannot be treated effectively in a primary care setting. This assumption has never
      been tested empirically, and is probably incorrect.

      In the last 15 years, effective treatment interventions for Bulimia Nervosa have been
      developed and validated in specialized treatment centers. The broad aim of this proposal is
      to examine whether these treatments, suitably adapted, can be usefully transferred to general
      health care settings. Specifically, the proposed study will determine the relative and
      combined effectiveness of the two leading treatments for Bulimia Nervosa in a primary care
      setting. The two major interventions are treatment with an antidepressant medication,
      fluoxetine, and with a form of cognitive behavioral therapy, guided self-help, designed for
      use in primary care.
