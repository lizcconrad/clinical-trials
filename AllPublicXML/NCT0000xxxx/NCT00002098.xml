  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the tolerance and side effects of a combination of lentinan and didanosine (ddI)
      compared with ddI alone. To determine whether the combination of lentinan and ddI produces a
      significant immunorestorative effect within the study observation period (6-12 months) as
      measured by an increase in one or more of the following: neutrophil count and activity,
      T-cell subsets, and a decrease in p24 antigen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive either lentinan (40 patients) or placebo (10 patients) in
      combination with ddI for at least 26 weeks; those tolerating their dose may be offered
      continuation of therapy for an additional 26 weeks.
