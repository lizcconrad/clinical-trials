    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients
      who have recurrent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and
      either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of monoclonal antibody Hu1D10 in patients with
      previously treated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma expressing the antigen recognized by Hu1D10.

      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of monoclonal antibody Hu1D10 in these patients.

      III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics, compare the pharmacology at different dose levels, and
      determine the optimal biological dose of this drug in these patients.

      IV. Evaluate any antilymphoma effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody Hu1D10 IV over 2-4 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts
      of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody Hu1D10 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional cohort
      of 3-6 patients receive Hu1D10 IV over 2-4 hours on days 1-5.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, 50 days, and periodically thereafter until disease
      progression.
