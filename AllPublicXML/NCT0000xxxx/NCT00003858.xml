      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of mitoxantrone given after surgery in
      treating patients who have prostate cancer that is at high risk for recurrence.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the feasibility of enrolling patients with adenocarcinoma of the
      prostate at high risk for recurrence following radical prostatectomy in an adjuvant
      mitoxantrone trial. II. Determine if this adjuvant therapy results in a delay in time to
      failure or a decrease in the number of treatment failures compared to historical controls in
      this patient population.

    <description>Patients receive mitoxantrone IV over 10-30 minutes every 21 days. Treatment continues for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 3 years, and then every 6 months for the next 3 years or until disease progression.</description>

        Undetectable PSA (i.e., less than 0.1 ng/mL) within 3 months following radical
        prostatectomy and at time of enrollment Negative lymph nodes at time of radical
        prostatectomy if lymphadenectomy performed Extracapsular penetration and/or positive
