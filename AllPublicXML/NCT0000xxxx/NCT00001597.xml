      This study will attempt to develop and validate improved subjective measures of pain
      sensation and use these measures to evaluate pain sensitivity in patients.

      Normal healthy volunteers and dental patients undergoing third molar extraction may be
      eligible for this study. Participants will undergo the following procedures:

      Volunteers: Volunteers will participate in two 90-minute sessions in which they will receive
      and rate four heat stimuli per minute applied to the skin for a maximum of 36 minutes. The
      heat stimuli range from 37째 (Degree)C to 51째 (Degree)C (99째 (Degree) F to 124째 (Degree) F)
      and last 2 to 3 seconds. A drug commonly used in dental treatments may be administered during
      the second session. This will be either a maximum of 0.15 mg fentanyl, a short-acting
      narcotic pain killer, or a maximum of 5 mg saline, an inactive substance (placebo).

      Dental patients: Dental patients will participate in two 60-minute sessions. The first
      session will be on the day before the third molar extraction, and the second session will be
      immediately before the dental procedure. The heat stimulus procedure will be identical to
      that described above for normal healthy volunteers.

    <textblock>
      Mismanaged pain is still a major medical problem. Many pain syndromes have no effective
      treatment, and many are managed poorly. Basic and applied research on pain treatment is
      hampered by the unobservable nature of pain sensation and the lack of validated measures of
      this perception.

      The purpose of this protocol is to develop and validate improved subjective measures of pain
      sensation and use these measures to evaluate pain sensitivity in clinical populations. Normal
      volunteers rate experimentally-evoked pain sensations before and after double-blind
      administration of the opioid fentanyl or saline placebo. Patients rate experimentally-evoked
      pain sensations without any drug administration.

        Normal Volunteers, including NIH employees, will serve as subjects.

        No subjects with any painful disease or diseases in which altered pain sensitivity is
        suspected.

        No subjects will be included with poor general health, history of significant illness,
        history of psychotic disorder or recent emotional distress, serious heart, lung, or liver
        disease, or pregnancy.

        Subjects also will be excluded on the basis of history of allergy to any of the
        medications, history of chronic or recent drug use that may alter pain response, or chronic
        drug abuse.
