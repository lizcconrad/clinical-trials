      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of treatment with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and
      leucovorin calcium in terms of the resectability rate in patients with unresectable advanced
      colorectal carcinoma confined to the liver. II. Assess this regimen in terms of response
      rate, toxicity, and overall survival in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1, then leucovorin calcium IV
      over 2 hours with fluorouracil IV bolus, followed by fluorouracil IV over 22 hours on days 1
      and 2. Courses repeat every 2 weeks. Patients with stable disease continue treatment in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or until disease is resectable.
      Patients who achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR) with unresectable disease,
      or PR but are not surgical candidates continue treatment in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who demonstrate a response are treated until
      best response or until disease is deemed resectable. Patients who achieve a CR or PR and are
      resected may receive 2 to 4 additional courses of therapy at the discretion of the
      investigator. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2
      years.
