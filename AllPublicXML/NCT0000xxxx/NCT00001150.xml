  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of a suction blister apparatus has facilitated study of the immunologic capacity of
      human epidermal cells. We have been able to prepare purified populations of these cells after
      blister formation. Specifically, using the blister tops, we are able to enrich for epidermal
      Langerhans cells which are very potent stimulators in antigen presenting assays. Thus, this
      normal volunteer study provides an important source of fresh epidermal tissue from which we
      can study normal epidermal Langerhans cell function. In addition, we have recently used
      blister roofs in important experimental models of HIV-1 transmission. There is no other
      method available for assessing the biologic function of freshly isolated Langerhans cells
      without altering their milieu. It is a very safe and effective way to obtain human epidermal
      samples.
