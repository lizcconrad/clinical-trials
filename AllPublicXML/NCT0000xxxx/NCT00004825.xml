      OBJECTIVES: I. Confirm the inhibitory effect of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor
      I (IGF-I) on insulin secretion in children with hyperinsulinism.

      II. Define the effects of short term IGF-I therapy on postprandial blood sugar levels in this
      patient population.

      III. Characterize the effects of short term IGF-I therapy on fasting behavior, and other
      insulin dependent parameters, in this patient population.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Octreotide and/or diazoxide are discontinued on day 1, and fasting blood
      glucose is monitored. Patients receive test meals of Sustacal on days 3 and 4 and are
      assessed for insulin response.

      Beginning on day 5, patients are given recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I
      subcutaneously every 12 hours for a total of 3 doses. The first dose (on day 5) is given 30
      minutes before a Sustacal challenge, the second dose is followed by a bedtime snack, and the
      third dose (on day 6) is followed by a supervised fast.

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics--

        Diagnosis of hyperinsulinism (i.e. evidence of fasting hypoglycemia with inadequate
        suppression of insulin, normal pituitary and adrenal function, and increased insulin
        action)

        Suboptimal control of blood sugar (i.e. inability to fast at least 10 hours with a blood
        sugar of 60 mg/dL or greater)

        No suspected insulinoma

        Must be currently managed on a regimen of diazoxide, octreotide and/or frequent feedings to
        control hypoglycemia

        --Prior/Concurrent Therapy--

        See Disease Characteristics

        --Patient Characteristics--

        Hematopoietic: No anemia or other concerns of blood volume depletion

        Renal: No renal dysfunction

        Other:

          -  No known malignancy

          -  No other major medical conditions
