      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of phenylacetate in treating children with
      recurrent or progressive brain tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of phenylacetate in terms of response rate and time to
      progression in children with recurrent or progressive brain tumors, or with previously
      untreated poor prognosis brain tumors. II. Assess the toxicity of phenylacetate in these
      patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose. III. Determine the correlation between serum
      steady state phenylacetate levels and toxicity or response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by histologic type (anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma
      multiforme vs brain stem glioma vs medulloblastoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors vs
      ependymoma vs low grade glioma vs others). Patients receive phenylacetate as a continuous
      intravenous infusion on days 1-28. Courses of treatment are given continuously without rest.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      are followed weekly.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-30 patients per stratum will be accrued for this study in 2
      years.
