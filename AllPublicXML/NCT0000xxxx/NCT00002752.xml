      RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or
      deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody
      therapy in treating patients who have primary or metastatic brain cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxic effects of intracranial iodine I 131 labeled anti-tenascin
           monoclonal antibody 81C6 in patients with primary or metastatic anaplastic gliomas.

        -  Determine the objective therapeutic response of these patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of iodine I 131 labeled anti-tenascin monoclonal
      antibody 81C6 (MOAB 81C6). Patients are stratified by prior external beam radiotherapy (yes
      vs no).

      Patients receive iodine I 131 labeled MOAB 81C6 intraventricularly followed by unlabeled MOAB
      81C6 intraventricularly.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of iodine I 131 labeled MOAB 81C6 until the
      maximum tolerated dose is determined. The MTD is defined as the highest dose preceding that
      at which 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 2 years, every 2 months for 2 years, and then every 3
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-6 patients per cohort will be accrued for this study.
