  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine liver tissue to investigate the role of viral infections in fulminant
      hepatitis, liver failure, and profound bone marrow failure.

      All patients who are undergoing liver biopsy or liver transplantation may participate in this
      study. For patients undergoing liver biopsy, a small piece of liver tissue will be taken from
      the sample collected during the scheduled biopsy. For patients undergoing liver
      transplantation, a small piece of tissue will be collected from the diseased liver that is to
      be removed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our laboratory has a long-standing interest in viruses that affect the bone marrow. Many such
      viruses also may cause hepatitis. One specific syndrome, post-hepatitis aplastic anemia,
      suggests that the same agent is responsible for both severe and sometimes fulminant hepatitis
      as well as profound bone marrow failure. In investigating the role of viruses in these
      diseases, we require small amounts of liver tissue for molecular studies. We request
      permission to obtain samples from patients undergoing 1) liver transplantation or 2) liver
      biopsy at the time of surgery for purpose of virus discovery, including obtaining control
      samples. For liver transplant samples, tissue will be obtained from the removed organ; in
      other surgical circumstances, small amounts of tissue will be obtained when the liver is
      biopsied for other medical indications. No additional risk to the patient should result from
      either procedure.
