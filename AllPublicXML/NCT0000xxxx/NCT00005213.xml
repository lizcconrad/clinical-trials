      To conduct ancillary studies of sodium-stimulated lithium counter-transport in the Chicago
      components of the Coronary Heart Disease Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort and
      in the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) cohort.

      BACKGROUND:

      CARDIA was a longitudinal study of the influence of lifestyle on coronary heart disease risk
      factors during the young adult and post-young-adult years, the time period during which risk
      for cardiovascular disease was thought to undergo crucial evolution. Four centers
      participated in this study. The Chicago CARDIA population consisted of 1,100 Black and white
      men and women age 18 to 30 at baseline, of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds.

      TOMHS was a two phase double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial to determine whether
      pharmacologic therapy in conjunction with nutritional-hygienic intervention for persons with
      mild hypertension results in greater reduction of cardiovascular morbidity than
      nutritional-hygienic treatment alone. Four clinical centers were involved in Phase I.
      Participants were randomized into one of six treatment groups. Each group received
      nutritional-hygienic treatment plus one of the following: placebo, diuretic, alpha blocker,
      beta blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, calcium channel blocker. Randomization
      was stratified to assure balance within each treatment group with regard to participants'
      drug treatment status prior to randomization. The primary endpoint was cardiovascular
      morbidity.

      Abnormalities in cellular sodium metabolism have long been thought to play a role in the
      pathogenesis of hypertension. Techniques for measuring membrane electrolyte transport rates
      have been refined, providing an opportunity to characterize sodium metabolism in cells from
      hypertensives. The early clinical studies examined erythrocytes and leukocytes because of
      their easy accessibility and the possibility that they would reflect vascular tissue
      metabolism, and documented differences in sodium fluxes between hypertensives and
      normotensives. Subsequent studies have supported the early findings that abnormalities in
      membrane cation transport were associated with essential hypertension.

      The findings up to 1988 indicated that one or more transport systems might be altered in
      essential hypertension but each system was not affected similarly, nor did all hypertensives
      show the same changes in each of the transport systems studied. The most consistent findings
      have been observed for sodium-stimulated lithium countertransport (LCT). Clinical and
      population-based studies have revealed that mean LCT is significantly elevated among
      hypertensives. In contrast, increased, decreased, and normal mean values have been reported
      for sodium cotransport, and increased or normal mean values for adenosine triphosphate
      (ATP)-dependent sodium-potassium pump activity.

      The relationship between LCT and blood pressure has been examined in several studies. The
      largest of these was an epidemiological survey involving 3,800 men and women age 5 to over 75
      in Gubbio, Italy. LCT was significantly and positively associated with both systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure in this population after controlling for age, sex, and weight, but,
      after controlling also for other factors known to be related to blood pressure such as serum
      uric acid and glucose, the relationship was inconsistently significant in this
      cross-sectional study. In other cross-sectional research, LCT was found to account for three
      percent of the variation in blood pressure in a study of healthy blood donors after
      adjustment for weight and age. Other cross-sectional population-based studies involving
      smaller numbers have shown a significant relationship between LCT and diastolic blood
      pressure in adolescents and in white adults, but not among Black adults; also between LCT and
      systolic blood pressure, but not diastolic blood pressure, in Black children and white
      adolescents.

      Much of the data available in 1988 had been derived from small numbers in cross-sectional
      studies, chiefly clinical, only a few population-based. Large samples were needed to provide
      adequate power to detect relationships among LCT and demographic, dietary, and other factors.
      Prospective data were needed to assess whether LCT was an independent risk factor for future
      development of high blood pressure in people normotensive at baseline, whether LCT could be
      modified, and whether this change was associated with changes in blood pressure.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      In the cross-sectional CARDIA investigation, studies were conducted on the relationships
      among lithium countertransport, blood pressure, and factors related to blood pressure such as
      age, sex, race, weight, body mass index, pulse, dietary factors, alcohol intake, serum
      glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, uric acid, and
      ionized and total calcium. Prospective data were also collected from TOMHS to examine whether
      lithium countertransport was modified in mild hypertension by diet or by a combination of
      diet and antihypertensive drugs. Lithium countertransport was assayed in erythrocytes at the
      second examination in CARDIA and at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months in TOMHS.
