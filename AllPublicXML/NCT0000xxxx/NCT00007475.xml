    <textblock>
      Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a renal syndrome characterized by proteinuria
      (usually nephrotic range), limited response to conventional therapy, and a poor renal
      prognosis, with progression to end stage renal failure in at least 50% of patients. As a
      syndrome, FSGS likely has many specific etiologies, only a few of which are well-defined.
      Recently, it has been suggested that some idiopathic FSGS patients have elevated circulating
      levels of a protein that induces glomerular permeability in vitro and in vivo. While there
      has been no consistent term for this factor, it will be termed here FSGS permeability factor
      (FPF).

      The purposes of the present study are five fold:

        1. To identify a population of FSGS patients with elevated FPF levels

        2. To examine RNA expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in FSGS
           patients with elevated FPF levels

        3. To define the kinetics of FPF disappearance and reappearance in FSGS patients receiving
           immunomodulatory therapy and in the case of patients with recurrent FSGS following renal
           transplant, those receiving plasma exchange

        4. To identify immunosuppressive agents which are successful in inducing sustained
           reduction in FPF levels

        5. To determine in patients with FSGS who are awaiting renal transplant, whether sustained
           reduction in FPF levels is associated with reduced risk of recurrent FSGS.

      Patient participation is divided into an evaluation phase, in which FPF levels, RNA
      expression profiles, and patient eligibility for participation in treatment protocols are
      determined, and a treatment phase in which specific immunomodulatory therapy is introduced in
      an open label fashion. We propose to define carefully the relationship between elevated FPF
      and remission of proteinuria in patients with FSGS in native kidneys, following treatment
      with standard therapies (daily prednisone, cyclophosphamide) and experimental therapies
      (pulse dexamethasone, pirfenidone). In patients with recurrent FSGS in renal allografts, we
      will determine the kinetics of FPF following plasma exchange and following plasma exchange
      plus cyclophosphamide. In patients with elevated FPF levels who are awaiting renal
      transplantation, we will determine the kinetics of FPF following plasma exchange and
      following plasma exchange plus cyclophosphamide, and examine the rate of recurrent FSGS in
      these patients.

Note that provisional values (targeting current candidate molecule: cardiotrophin-like cytokine 1) were assayed for 3 of the first 4 enrollees using assay by Dr. Virginia Savin, whose lab is actively investigating a molecular identification of FPF using an isolation approach based on sequential precipitation results in a 100-fold purification, but the fraction remains a complex mixture on SDS-PAGE (Sharma 1999).

Avi Rosenberg, NCI has developed a promising ELISA-style assay, as well as some work in a mass spectrometry assay, and this is being further refined.</description>

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Patients with idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis on renal biopsy,
                  including the following categories:

                  A) Untreated FSGS

                  B) Steroid-dependent FSGS

                  C) Steroid resistant FSGS

                  D) Recurrent FSGS, with functioning allograft

                  E) FSGS in ESRD, receiving hemodialysis

               2. Adults greater than or equal to18 will be eligible for all studies.

               3. Children greater than 20 kilograms, will be eligible for all branches of the
                  study except for treatment of steroid resistant FSGS with pirfenidone, as
                  pirfenidone has not previously been administered to pediatric patients in any
                  setting. Children less than 20 kilograms will be excluded from the study for the
                  following reason: plasma exchange in patients less than 20 kilograms requires a
                  red blood cell transfusion, which significantly increases the risk of the
                  procedure by exposing the patient to the risk of transfusion associated
                  infections, and the safety of an aggressive course of plasma exchange has not
                  been established in this population.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Secondary FSGS: HIV-associated FSGS or hyperfiltration FSGS, including FSGS associated
             with congenital renal abnormalities, renal mass reduction, reflux nephropathy,
             interstitial nephritis, and sickle cell anemia are excluded.

          2. Patients with disease associated with immunosuppression, other than chronic renal
             failure.

          3. The presence of malignancy or the history of other serious, complicating illness such
             as myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident in the past six months, at the
             discretion of the investigators.

          4. For plasma exchange: A Department of Transfusion Medicine consultant will evaluate all
             potential plasma exchange patients. Those with prolonged PT, PTT, platelet count less
             than 100,000 or receiving anticoagulant therapy will undergo plasma exchange only if
             the consultant considers this to be safe.

          5. For prednisone: uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (requiring greater than 100 units of
             insulin/day with the concurrence of the Endocrinology consultant), active infection
             including hepatitis B or C (if that is the advice of the Hepatology consultant),
             infection with HIV (as these patients are at increased risk of avascular necrosis),
             other active infection (if that is the advice of the Infectious Disease consultant),
             history of avascular necrosis or bone densitometry indicating bone mass less than 2SD
             below normal, active ulcer disease, history of steroid-induced psychosis, morbid
             obesity, positive PPD or history of past positive PPD without adequate treatment are
             excluded.

          6. For Cyclophosphamide:

        A) Allergy or hypersensitivity to cyclophosphamide

        B) Leukocyte less than 3000 cells/microliter or ANC less than 1500 cells/microliter or
        evidence of bone marrow compromise

        C) Prior irradiation to the heart or therapy with doxorubicin or other cardiotoxic
        medication (may increase the risk for cardiotoxicity)

        D) Peritoneal dialysis, as there is no published evidence that cyclophosphamide metabolites
        can be safely removed.

        E) Certain drugs will be used with caution or avoided. Barbiturates and phenytoin induce
        the hepatic enzymes that metabolize cyclophosphamide and therefore if these medications are
        required, cyclophosphamide doses may need to be increased to achieve a comparable
        immunosuppressive effect. Drugs that inhibit cyclophosphamide metabolism include
        allopurinol, imipramine, and phenothiazines, chloramphenicol and chlorpromazine; these
        drugs will be avoided. NSAID increase the risk of hyponatremia; these drugs will be
        avoided.

        <title>Determine Whether Renal Transplantation in Patients Whose Elevated FPF Levels Have Been Reduced for a Sustained Period is Associated With a Reduced Prevalence of Recurrent FSGS.</title>
        <description>Provisional assay of a molecular identification of FPF (current candidate: cardiotrophin-like cytokine 1) using an isolation approach based on sequential precipitation results in a 100-fold purification.
Note: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis Permeability Factor (FPF) assay had not yet been developed to an extent that it could be applied to all enrollees in the current trial; provisional values were assayed for 3 of the first 4 enrollees using a version implemented by Dr. Virginia Savin, whose lab is actively investigating the above isolation approach, but the fraction remains a complex mixture on SDS-PAGE (Sharma 1999). Other investigators of FPF, mentioned here for interested readers of this trial report, include:
Terry Phillips at NIH developed an assay that looked promising prior to his retirement.
Avi Rosenberg, NCI has developed promising ELISA-style assay, and mass spectrometry assay, being refined.</description>
