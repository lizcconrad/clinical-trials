  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To optimize Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) prophylaxis in AIDS patients by measuring serum
      rifabutin levels and adjusting the dose accordingly. To combine rifabutin with ethambutol to
      examine the effect of combination therapy in preventing or delaying the incidence of MAC
      bacteremia in this patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive oral rifabutin alone or rifabutin/ethambutol daily for 12
      months, with possible continuation of medicine lifelong. Doses will be adjusted to maintain
      minimum blood levels of the drugs.
