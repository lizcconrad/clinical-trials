  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and immune system effects of infusing HIV-infected
      patients with multiple doses of lymphocytes (white blood cells) from their non-infected
      identical twin. It will determine whether the donated lymphocytes can improve immune function
      and reduce viral load in the infected twin.

      Identical twin pairs-one who is infected with HIV-1 and one who is negative for the virus-may
      be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with blood tests, a medical history
      and physical examination.

      Both twin participants will receive a tetanus booster shot, if needed. The non-infected twin
      will undergo apheresis to collect white blood cells. For this procedure, whole blood is
      collected, similar to the procedure for donating a unit of blood from a needle in the arm.
      The blood flows through a cell separator machine where the white cells are removed, and the
      rest of the blood (red cells, plasma and platelets) is returned to the donor through a
      catheter in the opposite arm.

      The collected lymphocytes will be given intravenously (through a vein) to the infected twin
      over a 60-minute period. This procedure-apheresis and infusions-will be repeated 4 days a
      week to complete one cycle. The cycles will be repeated about every 8 weeks for 6 cycles
      (about 1 year).

      The infected twin will have blood samples drawn on the first day of each cycle, 2 weeks after
      the beginning of each cycle, and 4 weeks after each cycle to evaluate immune status, viral
      load and other safety parameters. The frequency of these blood tests may change as the study
      progresses. The infected twin will also undergo apheresis immediately before each cycle of
      infusions and one month later to test the white cells for certain immune features. The number
      of apheresis procedures may be reduced as the study proceeds.

      This phase I/II study will evaluate the safety, immunologic effects, and potential efficacy
      of repeated infusions of syngeneic lymphocytes obtained from HIV-1 seronegative identical
      twins given in the setting of maximum anti-retroviral therapy. Unfractionated lymphocytes
      from each seronegative twin will be obtained by lymphocytapheresis and directly transferred
      to the HIV-1 seropositive twin. Four separate lymphocytaphereses and transfers will be
      performed over one week, and this cycle may be repeated as frequently as every 8 weeks for a
      total of up to 6 cycles. The recipient twin will be monitored for general health status,
      immunologic improvement, depletions within the CD4+ T-cell repertoire, and HIV-1 viral load.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Identical twin pair, one of whom is seropositive for HIV-1, the other twin HIV
        seronegative, by standard testing ELISA and Western blot testing.

        Documented nadir CD4 count of HIV-infected twin less than 100 cells/mm(3) on at least 2
        evaluations.

        Patients with Kaposi's sarcoma limited to the skin and/or mucous membranes are eligible for
        this study, but must not have received any systemic therapy for KS within 4 weeks prior to
        entry. The KS activity must be stable such that the patient is unlikely to require systemic
        therapy (either chemotherapy or radiation) over the next 4 months. The diagnosis of KS must
        have been confirmed by biopsy.

        Must be free from serious psychological or emotional illness and able to provide written
        informed consent.

        Anticipated survival of greater than 3 months.

        Must be 18 years of age or older.

        Maximal (i.e., combination) anti-retroviral therapy, including the use of agents available
        on an FDA-approved expanded access program, may be used to achieve a virologic response.
        Patients must be tolerating a stable regimen of anti-retroviral drugs for at least 4 weeks
        prior to starting study.

        DONOR AND RECIPIENT:

        No lymphoma or active, life-threatening opportunistic infection. Patients with HIV-related
        infections requiring chronic suppressive therapy are eligible for study if their condition
        has been stable for greater than or equal to 4 weeks.

        Must be willing to comply with current NIH Clinical Center guidelines concerning
        appropriate notification of all current sexual partners of an individual regarding his or
        her HIV-1 positive sero-status and the risk of transmission of HIV-1 infection.

        No recent history of substance abuse unless evidence is provided of an ongoing therapeutic
        intervention (i.e. medical therapy or counseling) to control such abuse.

        No pregnancy at entry or unwillingness to practice barrier birth control or abstinence
        during the study.

        No experimental therapy within 4 weeks of study participation. Antiretroviral agents
        available on an FDA-sanctioned, expanded access basis are permitted.

        DONOR:

        Subjects with untreated or inadequately treated medical condition (e.g., cardiopulmonary
        disease, acute infection) which, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator, precludes
        apheresis will be excluded.

        Subjects with serologic positivity for Epstein Barr virus or Cytomegalovirus if the
        recipient twin tests seronegative for the corresponding virus will be excluded.

        No serologic findings consistent with active Hepatitis B virus or Hepatitis C virus
        infection, regardless of the recipient twin's status.

        Subjects with serologic positivity for HIV-1 or HIV-2. Donors will be tested for HIV prior
        to each lymphapheresis cycle will be excluded.

        Both CD4 count and CD4% must not be below the laboratory range for normals.
