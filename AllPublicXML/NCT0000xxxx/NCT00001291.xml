      This protocol will examine blood, synovial fluid and synovial tissue from patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic inflammatory joint diseases to study genetic and
      immunologic factors involved in the cause, development and progression of these conditions.
      Synovial fluid is the lubricating fluid in joints. The synovial membrane is a delicate tissue
      lining the inner surface of joints, which, in arthritic conditions, thickens and becomes
      infiltrated with various types of cells.

      Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and certain patients with other forms of arthritis may be
      eligible for this study. Those enrolled will be followed periodically for follow-up and
      disease evaluation. They may undergo the following procedures:

        1. Synovial fluid aspiration, when medically indicated (for example, for joint swelling and
           inflammation). For this procedure, an area of skin around the joint is numbed with an
           anesthetic, and a needle is inserted into the joint to withdraw a small fluid sample.

        2. Periodic blood sampling, not to exceed 450 milliliters (15 ounces) during any 6-week
           period, for genetic studies of rheumatoid arthritis. The samples are usually taken at
           the same times that synovial fluid is withdrawn.

        3. Synovial tissues, collected by needle biopsy or during surgical procedures for
           arthroscopy (examination of the interior of the joint and repair of the joint) or total
           joint replacement. For the needle biopsy, the skin over the biopsy site is washed and
           anesthetized. A needle is inserted and fluid is aspirated. The biopsy needle is then
           inserted through the outer needle and a tissue sample is suctioned.

      Patients who qualify for other research studies may be invited to participate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood, synovial fluids and/or synovial tissues will be obtained from patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis and related chronic inflammatory arthritides. The synovial tissues will be obtained
      by one of the following methods: a) needle biopsy, or b) at the time of a total joint
      replacement or a therapeutic arthroscopic procedure. These materials will be utilized for
      laboratory studies of etiopathogenetic mechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis and related
      autoimmune joint diseases.
