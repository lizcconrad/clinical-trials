      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral iloprost, a prostacyclin analog, in patients with
      Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by
      participating institution and digital cutaneous ulcers.

      Patients receive oral iloprost or placebo twice daily for 6 weeks. Thrombolytic drugs, oral
      anticoagulants, and heparin are prohibited on study. Concurrent therapy with
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for Raynaud's is prohibited; calcium channel
      blockers for severe digital ischemia are allowed as needed.

      Patients are followed at 2 and 6 weeks.
