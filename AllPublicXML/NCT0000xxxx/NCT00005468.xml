      BACKGROUND:

      While researchers had documented some of the behavioral contributors to fluctuation in
      individuals' lipid levels (e.g., nutrition patterns, smoking, exercise), little attention had
      been given to psychosocial stress. Early reports utilizing accountants, race car drivers, and
      air traffic controllers provided some uncontrolled data associating stress with cholesterol
      increases. Yet, no empirical research on stress that concomitantly examined other related
      influences was available. This paucity of data was probably due to lack of objective measures
      of stress and difficulty in measuring lipid subfractions.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Based on the results of their pilot study, and their research observations, the investigators
      predicted significant positive associations between stress level and triglycerides. A total
      of 228 public accountants (148 men and 80 women to provide comparable power between the
      sexes) were recruited from the greater Birmingham, Alabama area. Participants were evaluated
      monthly for 18 months, across three stressful and non-stressful work intervals (i.e., tax
      seasons). The investigators also collected data (during this same time frame) to closely
      monitor the following variables that affect lipids: dietary intake (including alcohol,
      caffeine, total calories, total fat, saturated fat, and dietary cholesterol), smoking, and
      physical activity, and oral contraceptive use, pregnancy status and menstrual stage among the
      women. Additionally, a substudy presented a unique opportunity for them to investigate the
      relation between stress and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in the formation of foam cells.
