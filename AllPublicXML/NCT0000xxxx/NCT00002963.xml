      RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses light and drugs that make cancer cells more sensitive to
      light to kill tumor cells. Photodynamic therapy using aminolevulinic acid cream may be
      effective in treating patients with skin cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well photodynamic therapy works in
      treating patients with skin cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Characterize the penetration of topically applied aminolevulinic acid (ALA) into the
           lesions of patients with primary basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas.

        -  Quantitate the depth of fluorescence achievable with varying application periods of ALA
           in these patients.

        -  Compare the results of tissue fluorescence with surface fluorescence measurements in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to lesion type
      (superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) vs nodular BCC vs squamous cell carcinoma). Patients
      within each group are randomized to receive one of two application times: 4-5 or 20-24 hours
      in duration.

      Aminolevulinic acid is topically applied either in a cream mixture or an alcohol base and an
      occlusive dressing placed over the lesion. After the randomized treatment duration has
      expired, the dressing is removed and quantitative protoporphyrin IX fluorescence measurements
      from the tumor and surrounding skin are mapped using a fluorometer. Routine surgical excision
      is then performed on the carcinoma.

      Patients return after one to two weeks for a follow-up examination and suture removal.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 54 patients will be accrued within 10 years.
