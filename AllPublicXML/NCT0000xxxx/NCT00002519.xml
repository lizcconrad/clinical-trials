      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy with paclitaxel in
      combination with radiation therapy to the chest in patients with previously untreated stage
      III non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be surgically removed.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel when combined
      with standard thoracic radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer. II. Determine the plasma levels of paclitaxel in these patients. III. Determine the
      effect of this regimen on the tumor cell cycle distribution in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of paclitaxel. Patients undergo standard thoracic
      radiotherapy 5 days a week for 7 weeks. Patients receive paclitaxel IV continuously beginning
      48 hours before initiating radiotherapy and continuing until the last day of radiotherapy.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts
      of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 5
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-5 patients per dose level will be accrued for this study
      within 2 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven previously untreated non-small cell lung
        cancer that is not amenable to potentially curative surgery due to the following: Direct
        invasion of the mediastinum, heart, great vessels, trachea, esophagus, vertebral body, or
        carina by tumor (T4) Cytologically positive scalene or supraclavicular nodes Mediastinal or
        contralateral hilar nodes 3 cm or greater on CT, with or without pathological confirmation
        Pathologically positive mediastinal or contralateral hilar nodes on mediastinoscopy or
        Chamberlain procedure (N2 or N3) Medically inoperable stage IIIA disease (e.g., resection
        would result in insufficient pulmonary volume) allowed No distant metastases No pleural
        effusion (regardless of fluid cytology) Evaluable disease
