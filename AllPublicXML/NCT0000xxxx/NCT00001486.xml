      This large ongoing study at NIMH investigates the neurobiology of schizophrenia by
      identifying susceptibility genes, evaluating their impact on brain function to better
      understand how to treat and prevent this illness.

      Objective: Schizophrenia is a complex genetic disorder which likely involves many genes each
      producing a slight increase in risk. Finding weak-acting genes in complex genetic disorders
      has been challenging and will likely require a number of approaches and large clinical
      samples. Several strategies have emerged recently that appear to markedly improve the power
      of genetic studies for detecting such genes. These include using association (rather than
      linkage) and using intermediate phenotypes in addition to DMS-IV diagnosis.

      Study Population: We propose to take advantage of these techniques by studying quantitative
      traits related to schizophrenia in patients, siblings, and controls.

      Design: We will employ an association design, rather than linkage. Traits will include
      quantifiable neurobiological variables that have been implicated previously as possible
      phenotypes related to schizophrenia. These include tests of attention and cognition, and a
      variety of parameters using brain imaging and magnetoencephalography.

      Outcome Measure: We will use several statistical methods to show that specific genetic
      polymorphisms affect these phenotypes, including case control and family based association
      studies.

        -  INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Inclusion criteria for Siblings (probands and unaffected siblings):

          -  Probands must have a DSM IV-R diagnosis of schizophrenia,schizoaffective disorder,
             psychosis N.O.S. or schizophreniform disorder.

          -  Probands and Siblings must be between the ages of 18 and 55

          -  Probands and Siblings must be free of major medical illnesses, but may have controlled
             hypertension, thyroid disease, or diabetes.

          -  Probands and Siblings who do not have capacity to provide consent and are under
             guardianship can participate in the study if the guardian signs the informed consent
             and the research subject provides their written assent. A DPA is not utilized in this
             study.

          -  Fluency in English is required.

        Exclusion Criteria for Siblings (probands and unaffected siblings):

          -  Seizure disorder, mental retardation, organic brain damage or other neurological
             disease.

          -  History of any (excepting nicotine-related) DSM5-defined moderate to severe substance
             use disorder (or DSM-IV-defined substance dependence).

          -  Cumulative lifetime history of any (excepting nicotine-related) DSM5-defined mild
             substance use disorder (or any DSM-IV-defined substance abuse), either in excess of 5
             years total or not in remission for at least 6 months.

          -  Head trauma with loss of consciousness over 5 minutes from all but genetic sampling.

          -  Documented metal in the body, e.g. from fixed dental bridges, orthodontia braces, IUDs
             containing metal or surgical screws.

          -  Weight and height dimensions that result in size exceeding the capability of the MRI
             bore circumference is exclusionary.

          -  Chemotherapy.

          -  NIMH employees/staff and their immediate family members will be excluded from the
             study per NIMH policy

        Siblings who do not qualify for the 2-day or 1-day study, may participate in the limited
        phenotyping arm in which only a psychiatric interview and a blood draw for genetic analysis
        (SCID-DNA) will be performed, case control analysis or be included as part of a trio (one
        parent, one sibling, one patient) to study genetic transmission from parents to
        offsprings.. All parents are eligible for the study.

        Healthy Controls Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for this research study, healthy volunteers must be:

          -  Between the ages of 18 and 55

          -  Fluency in English is required

        Healthy Controls Exclusion Criteria:

        They will not be eligible if:

          -  They have history of DSM IV-R psychiatric diagnosis or severe chronic medical illness
             at the time of the study.

          -  They have a history of any (excepting nicotine-related) DSM5-defined moderate to
             severe substance use disorder (or DSM-IV-defined substance dependence).

          -  They have a cumulative lifetime history of any (excepting nicotine-related)
             DSM5-defined mild substance use disorder (or any DSM-IV-defined substance abuse),
             either in excess of 5 years total or not in remission for at least 6 months.

          -  They may not be eligible for the 2-day or 1-day study if they have a first-degree
             relative with history of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. However, they may be
             included in the SCID_DNA or case control analyses..

          -  Documented presence of metal such as orthodontia braces, surgical screws or IUD of
             metal composition.

          -  Healthy volunteers must be free of learning disabilities.

          -  NIMH employees/staff and their immediate family members will be excluded from the
             study per NIMH policy
