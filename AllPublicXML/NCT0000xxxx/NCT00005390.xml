      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study, which was ancillary to the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), clarified
      the extent to which and the mechanisms whereby specific family processes might be protective
      or deleterious in the adherence behaviors and treatment outcome in three groups of children
      with mild to moderate asthma: 80 children participating in the Denver site of the CAMP, 80
      children receiving asthma-related care in a large, nationally recognized health maintenance
      organization, and 60 children recruited by using school records to identify children with
      asthma receiving their care in a variety of different health care systems across the Denver
      metropolitan area. The study examined the extent to which family process variables were
      cross-sectionally associated with and longitudinally influenced adherence to asthma treatment
      and asthma treatment outcome as well as the consistency of this relationship across the three
      sites. The study also determined whether adherence with treatment mediated the relationship
      between specific family processes and asthma treatment outcome, as well as the consistency of
      this relationship across the three sites.
