      RATIONALE: AE-941 may stop the growth of kidney cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of AE-941 in treating
      patients who have metastatic kidney cancer that has not responded to biological therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare survival of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma refractory
      to immunotherapy treated with AE-941 (Neovastat) versus placebo. II. Compare the time to
      progression and one-year survival rate of patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine
      the safety of this regimen in these patients. IV. Compare the overall tumor response rate,
      duration of response, and quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to number of organs with metastases (1 vs more than 1) and ECOG
      performance status (0 vs 1). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I:
      Patients receive oral AE-941 (Neovastat) twice a day. Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo
      twice a day. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Quality of life is assessed on day 1 and then every 8 weeks thereafter. Patients
      are followed every 4 weeks until disease progression and then every 8 weeks thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 280 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
