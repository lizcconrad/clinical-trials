  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular blocking agents are commonly used to facilitate endotracheal intubation.
      Succinylcholine, an ultra short-acting, depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, is the
      most commonly used agent for paralysis in this setting because of its rapid onset and short
      duration of paralysis. In patients with contraindications to succinylcholine or in whom a
      difficult airway is anticipated, a neuromuscular blocking agent with a pharmacodynamic
      profile similar to succinylcholine would be an attractive alternative. Rocuronium, a new
      intermediate-acting nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent produces paralysis within 60
      seconds, similar to succinylcholine, but has a duration of paralysis of approximately 20 to
      30 minutes. If rocuronium-induced paralysis could be chemically reversed within 10 to 15
      minutes after the administration of an intubating dose, it may be an appropriate alternative
      in patients with contraindications to succinylcholine or in patients whom a difficult airway
      is anticipated. Neostigmine is an anticholinesterase agent which inhibits the hydrolysis of
      acetylcholine by competing with acetylcholine for attachment to acetylcholinesterase.
      Inhibition of the breakdown of acetylcholine allows the neurotransmitter to be present in the
      neuromuscular junction for a longer period of time, so that each molecule can bind repeatedly
      with the acetylcholine receptor. The purpose of this study is to determine the dose of
      neostigmine necessary for the early reversal of rocuronium-induced paralysis.
