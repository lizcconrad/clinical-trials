  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to treat HIV-infected
      patients with indinavir (IDV) plus nelfinavir (NFV), 2 anti-HIV medications.

      It is thought that IDV plus NFV will be a safe drug combination for treating HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that the administration of indinavir with nelfinavir will be generally
      safe and well tolerated.

      This is a parallel, time-lagged, 2-stage, multiple-dose, 24-week study in HIV-1 seropositive
      patients. In the 3-week, randomized, double-blind phase of Stage A, patients receive either
      indinavir plus nelfinavir (Group A1: 9 patients) or indinavir placebo plus nelfinavir placebo
      (Group A2: 3 patients) for the first week. In Week 2, patients in Group A1 have the
      nelfinavir dose increased. This dose escalation for nelfinavir is contingent upon the patient
      having completed 1 week of the study drugs without experiencing Grade 3 or worse toxicity
      and/or serious drug-related adverse events. Patients in Group A2 continue to receive placebo
      until Week 3, at which time they receive indinavir plus nelfinavir (initial dose), while
      patients in Group A1 continue with indinavir plus nelfinavir (escalated dose). At Week 4 all
      patients in Stage A (including those originally assigned to receive placebo) receive
      open-label indinavir plus nelfinavir (escalated dose) for the remainder of the 24 weeks.

      After at least 6 patients in Stage A have completed at least 2 weeks of therapy with
      nelfinavir plus indinavir with acceptable tolerability, Stage B begins. In the 2-week,
      randomized, double-blind phase of Stage B, patients receive either indinavir plus nelfinavir
      (Group B1: 9 patients) or indinavir placebo plus nelfinavir placebo (Group B2, 3 patients).
      After 2 weeks, all patients in Stage B (including those originally assigned to receive
      placebo) receive open-label indinavir plus nelfinavir for the remainder of the 24 weeks.
