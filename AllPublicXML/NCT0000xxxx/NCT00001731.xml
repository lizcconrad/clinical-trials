      This study will examine whether cyclosporin A eye drops alleviate dry eye syndrome, a
      disorder of tear deficiency or excessive tear evaporation. The condition damages the surface
      of the eye and causes discomfort.

      Age-related dry eye syndrome may result from a problem with the immune system in which cells
      called lymphocytes infiltrate the tear glands and cause a chronic, progressive inflammatory
      process. Previous studies suggest that cyclosporin A may increase tear production or decrease
      inflammation on the surface of the eye, or both, improving dry eye symptoms.

      Patients in the study will undergo a complete eye examination, and a small tear sample will
      be collected to study tear consistency and composition. A small amount of conjunctiva (the
      clear, thin covering of the eye lining the eyelids and eyeball) will be removed to study
      substances in it that might provide information on what causes dry eye. A blood sample also
      will be taken to look for antibodies found in patients with Sjogren's syndrome, a disorder
      characterized by dryness of the mouth, eyes and other mucous membranes. Patients will also
      fill out forms providing information on the extent to which their dry eyes bother them.

      Patients will be randomly divided into two treatment groups: one will take a cyclosporin 0.1%
      eye drop emulsion; the other will take the emulsion vehicle alone-that is, the same drops but
      without the active ingredient cyclosporin. Both groups will take one drop in each eye 4 times
      a day for 2 months. Neither the patients nor the doctors will know which patients are
      receiving which medication until the study ends. All patients will also be given artificial
      teardrops to use for comfort if needed.

    <textblock>
      Dry eye syndrome, also known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca or KCS, is a disorder of the tear
      film leading to damage to the ocular surface and ocular discomfort. In aqueous tear deficient
      dry eye, there is inadequate tear production. Patients with dry eye include those who have
      KCS and those with a more severe form of KCS associated with Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). In SS,
      lymphocytic infiltration of the lacrimal gland leads to destruction of acinar structures and
      impaired glandular function. Although most cases of KCS are not due to Sjogren's Syndrome,
      lymphocytic infiltration of the lacrimal glands of non-Sjogren's KCS patients has been
      demonstrated and some authors suggest that age-related atrophic changes of the lacrimal gland
      may be secondary to a chronic progressive inflammatory process. Several clinical studies have
      indicated that systemic or topical CsA improves some objective or subjective signs of KCS in
      patients with or without SS. In this protocol, patients with aqueous tear deficient KCS will
      be randomized to treatment with topical CsA 0.1% or the emulsion vehicle. To determine the
      safety and efficacy of CsA 0.1% treatment in patients with KCS, comprehensive ophthalmologic
      examinations and standardized symptom assessments will be performed. In addition, to
      determine the ability of topical CSA to alter ocular surface inflammation, pre- and
      post-treatment conjunctival biopsy specimens will be analyzed for infiltrating lymphocytes.

        Diagnosis of CS with documented symptoms and signs (as required below) despite conventional
        management which may include artificial tears, gels and ointments, sympathomimetic agents
        and parasympathomimetic agents:

        Schirmer (without anesthesia) less than or equal to 8 mm/5 min in at least one eye;
        HOWEVER, if Schirmer (without anesthesia) is zero (0) mm, Schirmer with nasal stimulation
        greater than or equal to 3 mm/ 5 min in the same eye, OR;

        Schirmer (with anesthesia) less than or equal to 10 mm/ 5 min in at least one eye and sum
        of interpalpebral staining greater than or equal to 3+ or corneal staining greater than or
        equal to 1+ in the same eye.

        Able and willing to provide informed consent.

        Willingness and ability to meet followup requirements.

        Female patients of childbearing potential must use reliable forms of contraception during
        the study.

        A negative pregnancy test result in women of childbearing potential.

        Normal lid position and closure.

        The following topical (creams, ointments or patches) or systemic medications are allowed as
        long as the patient has been on a stable dose for at least 90 days before the baseline
        visit: Estrogen-progesterone, or other estrogen derivatives.

        If using concomitant medications, and the patient's condition is stable, the patient must
        agree to remain on a stable dose of his or her concomitant medications throughout the study
        period, or if the patient's condition is not stable, then they must agree not to use
        concomitant medications.

        Review of the instructions for use of concomitant medications during the study, prior to
        the eye examination, and agreement from the patient that they will comply with the
        instructions. A copy of the instructions must be given to the patient prior to enrollment.

        Patient must not have uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) or the
        presence of any significant illness (e.g., serious gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic,
        endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic disease, cancer, AIDS, or cerebral dysfunction)
        that could, in the judgment of the investigator, interfere with interpretation of the study

        Patient must not have severe blepharitis or obvious inflammation of the lid margin which in
        the judgment of the investigator may interfere with the interpretation of the study
        results.
