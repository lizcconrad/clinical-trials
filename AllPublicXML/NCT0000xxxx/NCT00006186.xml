  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dilution of blood caused by cardiopulmonary bypass (the heart-lung machine) during open heart
      surgery is associated with decreased concentrations in the blood of coagulation factors. This
      can be extreme in infants because of their small blood volumes and can lead to impairment of
      the normal blood clotting mechanism and excessive bleeding after the operation. Transfusion
      of fresh whole blood has been shown to be an effective treatment because fresh blood is rich
      in coagulation factors. However, it is difficult to obtain truly fresh blood from a blood
      bank. We hypothesized that fresh blood drawn from the patient and given back after
      cardiopulmonary bypass would improve the clotting mechanism. In our study, the infants in the
      treatment group have some of their own fresh blood removed after they are anesthetized for
      the operation and before they are placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. This blood is then given
      back to them after completion of cardiopulmonary bypass. Infants in the control group will
      not have their own blood removed but will undergo cardiopulmonary bypass. We will compare the
      two groups by drawing blood samples that measure coagulation tests.
