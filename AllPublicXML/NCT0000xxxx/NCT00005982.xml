    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 506U78 in treating patients who
      have recurrent or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate, failure-free survival, and progression-free survival of
      patients with recurrent or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treated with 506U78.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Study the pharmacokinetics of
      this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment continues every 28
      days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
