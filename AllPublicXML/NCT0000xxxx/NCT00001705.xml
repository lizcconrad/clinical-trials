  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic melanoma who are HLA-A201+ will be immunized with a modified peptide
      from the gp100 molecule that contains a signal sequence designed to improve peptide
      presentation by antigen presenting cells. This peptide called gp100:ES209-217 (210M) will be
      administered either alone or in combination with high or low dose IL-2. Patients will be
      evaluated for clinical response, as well as undergo studies of the immunologic response to
      the peptide immunization.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Any patient age greater than or equal to 18 with measurable metastatic melanoma who has
        failed standard treatment and has an expected survival of greater than three months will be
        considered.

        Serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dl or less.

        Bilirubin 1.6 mg/dl or less.

        WBC 3000/mm(3) or greater.

        Platelet count 90,000 mm(3) or greater.

        Serum AST/ALT less then two times normal.

        ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 or 2.

        Patients of both genders must be willing to practice effective birth control during this
        trial.

        No patients who are undergoing or have undergone in the past 3 weeks any other form of
        therapy except surgery for their cancer.

        No patients who have active systemic infections, coagulation disorders, autoimmune disease
        or other major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular or respiratory systems or any known
        immunodeficiency disease. Patients with cardiovascular disease will be eligible to receive
        peptide in IFA alone.

        No patients who require steroid therapy.

        No patients who are pregnant (because of possible side effects on the fetus).

        No patients who are known to be positive for hepatitis BsAG or HIV antibody (because of
        possible immune effects of these conditions).

        No patients who have any form of primary or secondary immunodeficiency. (The experimental
        treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who
        have decreased immune competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and
        more susceptible to its toxicities).
