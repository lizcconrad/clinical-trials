      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Giving drugs in different combinations may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of cyclophosphamide,
      methotrexate, and fluorouracil with mitoxantrone in treating older patients with recurrent or
      metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and duration of response of elderly patients with
      advanced breast cancer treated with first-line chemotherapy with mitigated &quot;classical&quot; CMF
      (cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil) vs. mitoxantrone (DHAD). II. Define the
      morbidity of CMF and DHAD in elderly patients. III. Determine quality of life in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by participating institution.
      The first group receives oral cyclophosphamide on days 1 through 14 and intravenous
      methotrexate and fluorouracil on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 4 weeks for a maximum of
      6 courses. The second group receives intravenous mitoxantrone every 3 weeks for a maximum of
      8 courses. Concomitant therapy with hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., NSAIDs) or
      corticosteroids (even as antiemetics) is not permitted in either group. Radiotherapy is
      allowed provided no more than 50% of the bone marrow is irradiated and at least 1 indicator
      lesion is unirradiated. Patients who complete therapy are followed every 3 months until
      disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 60 patients will be accrued over approximately 1 year. If extreme
      differences between arms exist after entry of 30 patients, accrual may be stopped early.
