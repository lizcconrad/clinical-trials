      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from GM2-KLH and given with QS21 may make the body build an immune
      response to and kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of GM2-KLH vaccine plus QS21 in treating
      patients with breast cancer who have no evidence of disease.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether immunization with GM2-KLH vaccine plus the immunological
      adjuvant QS21 induces an antibody response against GM2 and cells expressing GM2 in disease
      free patients at high risk for recurrence of breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: GM2-KLH vaccine plus QS21 is administered subcutaneously to sites on the upper arm
      and upper leg at weekly intervals for 4 weeks. Two additional vaccines are administered at
      weeks 12 and 24. Patients are followed every 3 months after the sixth vaccination.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.

        1 of the following features: Stage I, II, or III breast cancer and have received adjuvant
        chemotherapy and remain clinically free of identifiable disease, but have rising CA15.3
        (BR2729) or CEA levels Stage III breast cancer and have completed adjuvant therapy no more

        lumpectomy/axillary dissection Stage II breast cancer with at least 4 positive axillary
        lymph nodes at 24 months following completion of adjuvant therapy Patients with isolated
        elevation of the CEA level must have a colonoscopy to rule out colon carcinoma A
