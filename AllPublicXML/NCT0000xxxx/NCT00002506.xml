      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development or recurrence of cancer. The use of isotretinoin may be an effective way to
      prevent cancer or stop cancer from growing. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of
      cancer cells. Combining isotretinoin and interferon may be an effective treatment for some
      recurrent cancers.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interferon alfa plus isotretinoin in
      treating patients with recurrent cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rates to treatment with daily subcutaneous interferon
      alpha plus oral isotretinoin in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the
      following body sites: head and neck, cervix, skin, esophagus, lung, and penis. II. Determine
      the toxicities and side effects of this treatment.

      OUTLINE: Nonrandomized study. Single-agent Chemotherapy with Biological Response Modifier
      Therapy. Isotretinoin, 13-CRA, NSC-329481; with Interferon alpha (Schering or Hoffmann-La
      Roche), IFN-A, NSC-377523 or NSC-367982.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 14-50 patients per tumor category (and any other tumor location, if
      available) will be enrolled. If none of the first 14 patients in any tumor category responds,
      or if only 1/22, 2/30, 3/37, 4/44, or 5/50 respond, the treatment will be considered
      ineffective for that tumor type.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma that has failed
        standard local modalities for local disease and/or effective systemic therapy for
        metastatic disease, or for which other forms of systemic therapy have been refused Eligible
        sites include but are not limited to: Uterine cervix Head and neck Skin Esophagus Lung

        unirradiated disease reproducibly measurable in 2 dimensions by physical exam, x-ray, CT,
        MRI, or other radiologic procedure Documented progressive disease in a previously
        irradiated site is accepted as measurable Evaluable disease includes: Any visible
        radiologic disease not measurable in 2 perpendicular diameters Elevated squamous cell
        carcinoma antigen (SCCA) No active brain metastases Previously treated brain metastases
        that have responded to therapy do not exclude, but CNS disease is not considered measurable
