  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stuttering is an abnormality in speech that affects the rhythm of speech. People who stutter
      know what they wish to say, but at the time are unable to say it because of involuntary
      repetition, unnecessary lengthening (prolongation), or early stopping (cessation). This study
      is designed to increase understanding of the genetic factors that may relate to stuttering.

      Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a protein found in the nucleus of all cells. It is responsible
      for carrying the genetic information of the organism. DNA provides the directions for making
      all of the substances in the human body. DNA can be linked together in small segments called
      genes. Genes can contain information about anything related to an organism.

      In order for researchers to determine what genes are directly related to stuttering they must
      conduct several types of studies.

      Linkage studies, are studies of families that have a lot of members who stutter from several
      generations. The linkage studies will be completed using adult individuals who are diagnosed
      as persons who stutter and persons who have never stuttered, from one or more families with
      large numbers of family members who have stuttered over several generations.

      Candidate gene studies, look closely at genes suspected to be related to stuttering in
      patients who may or may not have a significant family history of stuttering.

      By conducting these studies, researchers hope to learn more about genes related to stuttering
      and ultimately find out what causes stuttering.

      Genetic studies in developmental stuttering are important for their potential in ultimately
      determining pathophysiological basis of this disorder. This study will combine two approaches
      to examine genetic aspects of stuttering, linkage in families, and candidate gene analysis.
      Linkage studies will be completed using adult individuals who are diagnosed as persons who
      stutter and those who can be judged as never having stuttered from one or more families with
      large numbers of affected individuals within several generations. Candidate gene analyses
      will also be carried out in adults who stutter to determine if the frequency of polymorphisms
      for certain neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes differ from control populations. In
      addition, given the heterogeneity of the population of adults who stutter, other phenotypic
      probes such as motor skills, language skills, neuropsychological abilities and psychological
      responses to stuttering will also be assessed in order to identify subgroups in which the
      phenotype expression of the gene may differ.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects must be over the age of 5 and under the age of 90.

        Subjects must be in general good health, without evidence of chronic medical illness.

        Onset of stuttering in affected individuals must have occurred in childhood (between 3 and
        10 years of age), unrelated to psychological or neurological trauma.

        Subjects will not be tested for the presence of HIV antibodies. Persons with positive HIV
        antibodies will not be excluded, unless they are taking medication which may change their
        performance on tasks used for phenotypic assignment.

        Subjects will be screened for history of psychiatric illness, such as depression, anxiety
        or obsessive-compulsive disorders according to DSM-IV criteria. A history of these
        disorders will not disqualify any subject from participation, but will be noted as a
        variable in phenotypic assignment.
