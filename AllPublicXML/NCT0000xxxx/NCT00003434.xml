      Rational: White blood cells that have been treated with carcinoembryonic antigen peptide-1
      may help the body build an immune response to and kill tumor cells that express CEA.

      Purpose: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of white blood cells plus carcinoembryonic
      antigen peptide-1 in treating patients with stage I, stage II, or stage III pancreatic cancer
      that has been surgically removed.

      Objective: I. Perform a pilot study of active immunotherapy with autologous dendritic cells
      pulsed with the CEA peptide, CAP-1, after surgical resection in patients with CEA expressing
      pancreatic cancer. II. Perform laboratory analysis to monitor the presence, persistence, and
      function of CAP-1 specific T-cells in this patient population.

      Outline: Patients undergo leukapheresis for up to 4.5 hours prior to vaccination. Half of the
      collected dendritic cells are pulsed with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) peptide and the
      other half are pulsed with hepatitis B antigen peptide (HBsAg). Equal doses of CEA and HBsAg
      peptide pulsed dendritic cells are administered intravenously over 3 minutes every 4 weeks
      for a total of 6 doses each. Patients undergo a second leukopheresis 2 weeks after the last
      dose of immunotherapy to obtain specimens for immunologic tests. Patients are followed at
      weeks 22, 36, 48, and every 6 months thereafter.

      Project Accrual: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.
