      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of R115777 in treating patients who have
      recurrent or advanced colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate to R115777 in patients with disseminated
      colorectal cancer who have been previously treated for advanced disease. II. Assess the time
      to treatment failure and survival of these patients with this treatment regimen. III.
      Determine the frequency and severity of toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral R115777 twice daily on days 1-21.
      Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study over 5-7 months.
