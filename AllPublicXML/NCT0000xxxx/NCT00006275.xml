      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients apply topical calcitriol in petrolatum on a psoriatic lesion
      daily. Patients also apply petrolatum without calcitriol to another psoriatic lesion daily.

      Patients have both lesions photographed prior to therapy, monthly during therapy, and at the
      completion of therapy. Lesions are assessed weekly for 1 month and then every 2 weeks while
      on study. Blood samples are collected every 1 to 2 months and urine samples are collected
      every 2 weeks while on study.
