      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill
      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug with rituximab may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab plus combination chemotherapy
      in treating patients who have intermediate-grade or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the rate of complete response and partial response in patients with
      intermediate or high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with rituximab plus
      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP). II. Determine the toxicity
      of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the disease-free and overall survival, time
      to response, and time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to the number of risk
      factors (0-2 vs 3-5). Risk factors include age (no greater than 60 vs greater than 60), tumor
      stage (II vs III or IV), number of extranodal sites (no more than 1 vs more than 1),
      performance status (0-1 vs 2-4), and serum LDH level (no greater than normal vs greater than
      normal). Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1; cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and
      vincristine IV on day 3; and oral prednisone on days 3-7. Patients over 60 also receive
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 4 and continuing until blood counts
      recover (all other patients receive G-CSF as secondary prophylaxis). Treatment continues
      every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who respond receive 2 more courses. Patients who have no measurable disease after 6
      courses receive rituximab IV once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. This treatment continues
      every 6 months for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who have measurable disease after 6 courses of chemotherapy receive 2 more courses
      for a maximum of 8 courses of CHOP, followed by maintenance therapy with rituximab (as
      described above). Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed intermediate or high grade non-Hodgkin's
        lymphoma Stage II, III, or IV disease B-cell where lymphoid cells are CD20 or CD19 positive
        No mantle cell, lymphoblastic, or peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Measurable or
        evaluable disease No prior treatment for lymphoma No known CNS metastases A new
        classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The
        terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former terminology of
        &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former
        terminology.
