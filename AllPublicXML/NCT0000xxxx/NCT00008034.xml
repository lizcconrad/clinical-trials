      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells and shrink
      tumors so they can be removed during surgery.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy before surgery
      in treating women who have locally advanced, inflammatory, or large surgically removable
      breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity of neoadjuvant capecitabine, cyclophosphamide, and
      epirubicin in women with locally advanced or inflammatory or large operable breast cancer.
      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter dose escalation study of capecitabine. Patients receive
      neoadjuvant cyclophosphamide IV and epirubicin IV on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily
      on days 1-14. Treatment continues every 21 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating
      doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose
      limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-33 patients will be accrued for this study.
