  <brief_summary>

      To assess the separate and interactive effects of asthma severity, subspecialty practice
      variation, asthma-related psychosocial variables, and other factors on asthma outcomes,
      including asthma-specific quality of life and activity limitations, health care utilization
      for asthma, and direct and indirect costs of asthma.

      BACKGROUND:

      Asthma is both common and costly. Neither the risk factors of poor outcome nor the predictors
      of better outcome are well understood. Illness severity is clearly an important predictive
      factor in asthma, but may explain less variability in outcome than other determinants, such
      as patient-perceived asthma control, other asthma-related psychosocial measures, and the kind
      and extent of subspecialty care for asthma. By quantifying predictors of asthma-specific
      quality of life, functional status, services utilization, and the direct and indirect illness
      costs of asthma, this study addressed a major research gap in secondary and tertiary
      prevention efforts.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A random sample of pulmonary and allergy subspecialists initially enrolled 600 persons with
      asthma identified in patient visit logs. This established panel completed 45 minute baseline
      and follow-up computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI); 539 (90%) were successfully
      re-interviewed after 18 months of follow-up. A supplemental sampling frame of persons with
      asthma identified from family practitioners was completed as was a group with rhinitis but
      without asthma. Interviews assessed disease severity and other covariables using validated
      survey instruments. Pulmonary function and medical records were used to validate severity in
      a sub-sample of subjects. The study extended longitudinal follow-up study of this initial
      cohort. Its analysis tested predictive models for the asthma outcomes of interest.
