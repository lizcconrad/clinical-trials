      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of antiparasitic treatment with albendazole on the
      severity and duration of epilepsy due to neurocysticercosis.

      II. Determine the effect of a short course of albendazole on Taenia solium cysts present in
      the brain.

      III. Determine the natural regression of cerebral T. solium cysts in patients given placebo
      and their response to treatment at the end of the study.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients are randomized to
      receive either albendazole and dexamethasone or placebo.

      Patients receive phenytoin daily starting on day 1 and continuing until seizure free for 1
      year. Albendazole and dexamethasone or placebo only is administered orally once daily on days
      5-15.

      Patients are asked to maintain a diary. Patients are followed on day 15 and 30, then every 3
      months for 3 years.
