      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining fenretinide, paclitaxel, and
      cisplatin in treating patients who have solid tumors that have not responded to previous
      therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose, clinical toxicity, and recommended phase II dose
           of fenretinide when combined with paclitaxel and cisplatin in patients with refractory
           solid tumors.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the therapeutic response to this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of fenretinide.

      Patients receive oral fenretinide twice daily on days 1-7 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours
      followed by cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 2. On day 8 of course 1, patients also receive
      fenretinide once in the morning. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 8 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete
      response receive 2 additional courses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fenretinide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
