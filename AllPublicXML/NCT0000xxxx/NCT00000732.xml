  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if the pharmacokinetics of low doses of zidovudine (AZT) (that is, how fast AZT
      reaches the blood, what concentration of AZT is attained in the blood, and how long AZT
      remains in the blood) changes from day-to-day in the same patient. Also to determine whether
      the pharmacokinetics of AZT is changed by sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) given at
      the same time or whether the pharmacokinetics of SMX/TMP is altered by AZT therapy. AZT has
      been effective in treating some patients with AIDS, and SMX/TMP is an antibiotic combination
      which is useful in preventing or treating Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), which is an
      important cause of disease and death in patients with AIDS. It is important to know how drugs
      interact in patients because addition of a second drug may change the speed at which a drug
      is eliminated from the body, and cause increased toxic effects or decreased therapeutic
      effects.

      AZT has been effective in treating some patients with AIDS, and SMX/TMP is an antibiotic
      combination which is useful in preventing or treating Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP),
      which is an important cause of disease and death in patients with AIDS. It is important to
      know how drugs interact in patients because addition of a second drug may change the speed at
      which a drug is eliminated from the body, and cause increased toxic effects or decreased
      therapeutic effects.

      Patients take AZT every 4 hours and/or SMX/TMP every 12 hours by mouth for 4 days as
      outpatients and then come into the clinical research center for 2 days of studies. On day 5
      the final dose of medicine is given orally (SMX/TMP) or by intravenous infusion (AZT). Blood
      samples are drawn 10-20 times over a period of 12 hours and urine is collected for 36 hours.
      Concentrations of the drugs in the blood and urine samples are determined. This sequence is
      repeated twice, so that each patient takes AZT alone, SMX/TMP alone, and the combination of
      AZT and SMX/TMP over a period of about 3 weeks. Patients may be included in the study if they
      are asymptomatic, or have been diagnosed with ARC or AIDS, but not if they have PCP or any
      other severe opportunistic infection.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Zidovudine (AZT) for patients with AIDS.

          -  AIDS related complex (ARC). The presence of any one of the following findings within
             12 months prior to entry and the absence of a concurrent illness or conditions other
             than HIV infection to explain the findings:

          -  Fever of &gt; 38.5 C degrees persisting for longer than 3 weeks.

          -  Involuntary weight loss of &gt; 15 lbs. or &gt; 10 percent of baseline noted in a 120-day
             period prior to evaluation.

          -  Diarrhea (&gt; 2 liquid stools per day) persisting for longer than 1 month.

          -  History of clinical diagnosis of oral candidiasis or hairy leukoplakia.

          -  Patients who have AIDS-defining opportunistic infections or tumors.

          -  Patients eligible for AZT under the labeling.

          -  A positive HIV antibody test. Exceptions will be made for patients with a previously
             positive HIV antibody test with progressive disease and patients where virus isolation
             has been made.

          -  A life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Patient with stable Kaposi's sarcoma, mild herpes infection, mild or stable
             depression, asymptomatic or mild cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus infection, or a
             hepatitis B virus carrier state will be acceptable for study.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Phenytoin.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded within 30 days of study entry:

          -  Other antiretroviral agents.

          -  Patient has any severe ongoing opportunistic infections including Pneumocystis carinii
             pneumonia (PCP), cryptococcal or toxoplasmosis meningoencephalitis, disseminated
             herpes simplex or herpes zoster.

          -  Patient has significant diarrhea at entry ( &gt; 1 watery stool per day).

          -  Patient has demonstrated prior sensitivity or has experienced significant adverse
             effects during prior therapy with the drugs to be used in the study.

          -  Cannot abstain from alcohol or any other drugs during the study.
