      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging measurements the change
      in the total volume of brain parenchyma as well as its gray and white matter, T2 and enhanced
      T1 lesion volume, and the magnetization transfer ratio histogram parameters, and correlate
      these measurements with clinical measures of disability in patients with multiple sclerosis.

      II. Measure the quantity of whole brain N-acetylaspartate in patients with multiple sclerosis
      and compare these values to those from age matched controls.

      III. Determine the correlation between specific neuropsychological tests which assess global
      cognitive functioning and the quantitative measurements taken in these patients in this
      study.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy with standard gadolinium
      contrast followed by neuropsychological testing every 6 months for 5 years. An equal number
      of age and sex matched healthy patients act as a control group and undergo magnetic resonance
      imaging and spectroscopy without standard gadolinium contrast every 6 months for 5 years.
