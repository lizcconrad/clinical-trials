      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether polyethylene-glycol-conjugated interleukin 2 (PEG-IL-2) can
      reduce the number of infections in patients with common variable immunodeficiency.

      II. Determine whether this therapy can improve lung functions in these patients with
      pulmonary impairment.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are randomized to receive
      polyethylene-glycol-conjugated interleukin 2 (PEG-IL-2) or placebo.

      Patients receive PEG-IL-2 or placebo by subcutaneous injection weekly for 18 months. Patients
      maintain a daily diary for 24 months.

      Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years.
