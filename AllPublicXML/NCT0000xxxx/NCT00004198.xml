      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor
      cells. Sargramostim may stimulate a person's immune system and help to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus sargramostim
      following chemotherapy in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the ability of recombinant idiotype immunotherapy to stimulate a
      specific immune response against the B cell idiotype of the malignant clone that constitutes
      the tumor in patients with previously untreated stage III or IV indolent non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma. II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this treatment regimen using Genitope
      Corporation's molecular rescue technology in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive induction chemotherapy consisting of oral cyclophosphamide,
      vincristine, and prednisone (CVP). Treatment repeats every 3 weeks until the maximal clinical
      response is achieved followed by 2 additional courses of consolidation therapy for up to a
      maximum of 10 courses. Patients not achieving adequate response receive up to 6 courses of
      alternate chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
      prednisone. At 3 months or up to 1 year following completion of chemotherapy, patients
      achieving adequate disease response receive vaccination consisting of recombinant tumor
      derived immunoglobulin idiotype with keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate subcutaneously (SQ)
      at 2 sites immediately followed by sargramostim (GM-CSF) SQ on day 1. Patients receive GM-CSF
      alone on days 2-4. Vaccination repeats every 4 weeks for 4 doses, followed 12 weeks later by
      the fifth and final dose. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months
      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter until disease progression.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed stage III or IV, indolent non-Hodgkin's
        lymphoma Follicular small cleaved cell Follicular mixed small cleaved and large cell with
        less than 50% large cells No intermediate, high grade, or other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas
        (e.g., mantle cell, monocytoid B cell, marginal zone, small lymphocytic, chronic
        lymphocytic leukemia, or follicular large cell) Tumor sample safely accessible by biopsy,
        needle aspiration, or phlebotomy Must have adequate circulating lymphoma cells No CNS
        metastasis A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by
        PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former
        terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses
        the former terminology.

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Over 18 Performance status: Karnofsky 80-100% Life

        less than 2 times normal Renal: Creatinine less than 2 mg/dL Other: No other illness or
        condition, including innate or pharmacologic immunosuppression, that would preclude study
        No other malignancy within the last 5 years except adequately treated basal or squamous
        cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix HIV negative Not pregnant or nursing

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic: No prior biologic therapy for lymphoma Chemotherapy: No
        prior cytotoxic therapy for lymphoma Endocrine: No prior steroids for lymphoma At least 2
        months since prior nonphysiologic doses of prednisone of greater than 20 mg or equivalent
