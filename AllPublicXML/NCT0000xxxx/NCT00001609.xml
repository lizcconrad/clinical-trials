  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to discover the genes responsible for the development of
      hereditary cataracts in families. A cataract is clouding of the lens of the eye that
      obstructs the passage of light and may impair vision. Information from this study may provide
      a better understanding of why hereditary cataracts form and perhaps lead to the development
      of a test that can predict who will likely be affected and to what degree.

      Patients or family members of patients with inherited cataracts who participate in this study
      will be asked questions about their family history, especially concerning eye disease or
      cataracts, and a family tree will be drawn. They will undergo a complete eye examination,
      including photographs to document the clarity or opacity of the lens. In addition, a small
      blood sample will be drawn for use in gene mapping studies of inherited cataract.

      Although the etiology of some secondary cataracts is becoming better understood and certain
      animal models have the promise to elucidate the relationships between lens crystallin and
      hereditary cataract, little is known about the causes of congenital cataracts in humans. Even
      the classification of different types of cataracts is cumbersome and imperfect. A better
      understanding of cataractogenesis will come through an understanding of the molecular
      components of the lens of the eye and the ways in which lesions of these components are
      manifested structurally and functionally as opacity of the lens. It is well known that
      cataracts exhibit marked genetic heterogeneity. In mice and humans, hereditary cataracts have
      been shown to result from lesions at many distinct loci and those cataracts corresponding to
      one locus can be morphologically heterogeneous, implying that environmental factors may
      modify the phenotype of the cataract which a molecular lesion causes. Nonetheless, molecular
      biological characterization of cataracts in the mouse and guinea pig has suggested that
      alterations in lens crystallins can cause hereditary cataracts making them reasonable
      candidate genes for causing hereditary cataracts in humans. In addition, it is apparent that
      hereditary lesions which mimic or contribute additively to environmental stresses known to
      cause cataracts might be candidate genes for causing hereditary cataracts. This knowledge
      increases the feasibility of genetic linkage studies and provides a rationale basis on which
      to begin the molecular analysis of naturally occurring hereditary cataracts. Therefore, it is
      the purpose of this protocol to concentrate upon hereditary cataracts.
