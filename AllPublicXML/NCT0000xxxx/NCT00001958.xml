  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 12-month study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of hydroxyurea in treating
      beta-thalassemia, a type of anemia caused by defective hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying
      pigment in blood). Hemoglobin is composed of two protein chains-alpha globin chains and beta
      globin chains; patients with beta-thalassemia do not make beta globin. Patients often require
      frequent red blood cell transfusions. This leads to iron overload, which, in turn, requires
      iron chelation therapy (removal of iron from the blood).

      Some drugs, including hydroxyurea, can stimulate production of a third type of protein chain
      called gamma chains. In the womb, the fetus makes this type of protein instead of beta
      globin. It is not until after birth, when the fetus no longer produces gamma globin that the
      beta globin deficiency becomes apparent. Gamma chain synthesis improves hemoglobin and red
      blood cell production, correcting the anemia. This study will determine if and at what dose
      hydroxyurea treatment reduces patients' need for red blood cell transfusions and whether
      certain factors might predict which patients are likely benefit from this treatment.

      Patients 15 years and older with moderately severe beta-thalassemia may be eligible for this
      study. Participants will take hydroxyurea daily at a dose calculated according to the
      patient's body size. Blood will be drawn weekly to measure blood cell and platelet counts.
      The drug dosage may be increased after 12 weeks of treatment and again after 24 weeks if the
      white cell and platelet counts remain stable. Patients who respond dramatically to treatment
      may continue to receive hydroxyurea for up to 3 years.

    <textblock>
      Individuals with homozygous beta thalassemia are either severely anemic or dependent on blood
      transfusion to sustain life. Deficient synthesis of the beta chain leads to imbalanced chain
      synthesis with an excess of alpha globin. This alpha globin precipitates, causing ineffective
      erythropoiesis and shortened red cell survival. Hydroxyurea is a cell-cycle specific agent
      that blocks DNA synthesis by inhibiting ribonuclease reductase, the enzyme that converts
      ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. Administration of hydroxyurea to primates and more
      than 300 patients with sickle cell anemia has been frequently, but not invariably associated
      with a substantial increase in synthesis of gamma globin. In patients with homozygous
      beta-thalassemia, enhanced gamma globin synthesis could partially compensate for the
      deficient synthesis of beta globin rendering chain synthesis more balanced and reducing the
      relative excess of alpha chains. The purpose of this protocol is to test the hypothesis that
      chronic daily low dose administration of hydroxyurea will enhance gamma globin synthesis,
      increase red cell production and partially or substantially correct the anemia in patients
      with homozygous beta-thalassemia. The effect of treatment will be monitored by serial
      determination of the hemoglobin and hematocrit. The relationship between response to therapy
      and the specific beta-globin mutation(s) will also be analyzed. This study will therefore
      examine a cohort of patients not previously treated with hydroxyurea.
