      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of trastuzumab in treating patients who have
      previously treated, locally advanced, or metastatic cancer of the urothelium. Monoclonal
      antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to
      them without harming normal cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate in patients with previously treated, locally advanced or
      metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium treated with trastuzumab
      (Herceptin).

      II. Determine the safety of this drug in this patient population. III. Determine overall and
      progression-free survival of this patient population treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive a loading dose of trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of
      week 1. For all subsequent doses, patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes weekly.
      Treatment may continue for more than 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.
