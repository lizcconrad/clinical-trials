  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The two major types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Although most patients with
      type 2 diabetes are older than age 40, type 2 diabetes has been reported with increasing
      frequency among patients under the age of 20. This form of diabetes has been called type 2
      diabetes of youth, abbreviated type 2Y. Little is known about the etiology of type 2Y;
      however, clinicians believe that it occurs most commonly in obese children of particular
      ethnic groups. A positive family history appears to be one major risk factor for developing
      type 2Y diabetes. The individual contribution of ethnicity, obesity, and genetics to type 2Y
      have yet to be elucidated. There is no consensus regarding treatment with type 2Y diabetes.
      Observation of our Hispanic patients in the Houston area reveals a large number with type 2Y.
      The major purpose of this study is to examine the genetic and environmental risk factors such
      as family history, ethnicity, and obesity in Hispanic children with type 2Y diabetes.
      SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) To examine the genetic and environmental risk factors and clinical signs
      associated with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes of youth. 2) To compare the efficacy of
      the treatment modalities, insulin and oral agents, in type 2Y patients. METHODS: We will
      undertake a retrospective case study, to include a review of hypothesized risk factors in all
      the medical records of pediatric diabetes patients seen at University of Texas. We anticipate
      that approximately 200 patients with type 1 diabetes and 30 patients with type 2Y diabetes
      will be identified. A Sustacal challenge test will be done in patients with a suspected
      diagnosis of type 2Y in order to confirm the clinical diagnosis. Parents will be contacted by
      phone for a detailed pedigree intake. Type 1 and type 2Y patients will be compared for each
      of the studied features. A retrospective review of diabetes type 2 therapies used in type 2Y
      patients will be undertaken through further examination of the medical records in order to
      compare insulin treatment to oral agents. We will also test a subset of the patients for the
      gene identified in adult Hispanics with type 2 diabetes.
