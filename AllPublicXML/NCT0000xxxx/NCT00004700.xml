      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study.

      Patients are randomized to receive recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) or
      placebo subcutaneously twice daily for 4 weeks. After a 2 week washout period, patients are
      crossed over to the other regimen for an additional 4 weeks.

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics-- Diagnosis of hyperinsulinism (i.e., evidence of fasting
        hypoglycemia with inadequate suppression of insulin, normal pituitary and adrenal function,
        and increased insulin action) Suboptimal control of blood sugar (i.e., inability to fast at
        least 10 hours with a blood sugar of 60 mg/dL or greater) --Prior/Concurrent Therapy-- See
        Disease Characteristics --Patient Characteristics-- Performance status: Not specified
        Hematopoietic: Not specified Hepatic: Not specified Renal: Not specified Other: No other
        major medical conditions No known adverse reaction to recombinant human insulin-like growth
        factor I
