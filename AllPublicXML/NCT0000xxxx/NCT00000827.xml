  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of human anti-HIV
      immune serum globulin ( HIVIG ) at three dosage levels in HIV-infected children.

      Passive antibody therapy has been used with limited success in treating advanced HIV disease
      in adults. HIVIG is manufactured from HIV antibody-rich plasma taken from asymptomatic
      donors. It is hypothesized that HIVIG will decrease the viral burden of moderately advanced
      HIV-positive children.

      Children are randomized to receive HIVIG every 4 weeks for 6 months at one of three dose
      levels, then are followed for 3 months after the final infusion.
