      This study will evaluate the reliability of a new test called Real-Time Polymerase chain
      reaction (RT PCR) in detecting cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the blood and predicting the course
      of CMV disease in patients who have recently had a bone marrow transplant. The test's
      effectiveness will be compared with that of the &quot;pp65 antigenemia assay&quot; now routinely used
      for this purpose.

      CMV is a common virus that is transmitted from person to person by close personal contact. In
      most healthy people, CVM can remain in the body indefinitely without causing any harm. But,
      in people with weakened immune systems-including those who have just undergone bone marrow
      transplant-CMV infection can cause serious, and possibly fatal, complications. Drugs are
      available to treat this infection, however. Optimum treatment depends on early and accurate
      detection.

      Patients aged 10 to 80 years who are scheduled to undergo bone marrow transplant at the NIH
      Clinical Center as part of an NIH protocol may be eligible for this 2-phase study. In phase
      1, patients will have blood drawn for both RT PCR and antigenemia testing once before the
      bone marrow transplantation and then weekly for the first 100 days after the transplant.
      During Phase 2-which begins immediately after the end of phase 1 and continues for one year
      after the transplant-blood samples for both tests will be drawn up to once a week. The
      samples for both tests will be collected at the same time and will be taken through a
      catheter (a thin flexible tube inserted into a vein) that has already been placed for the
      transplant study. RT PCR testing will require an extra 5 milliliters (1 teaspoon) above what
      is needed for antigenemia testing, amounting to a maximum of about one-half pint extra over
      the course of the 1-year study.

      It is hoped that the new RT PCR test will prove to be more accurate in detecting CMV
      infection and predicting disease development, thus enabling doctors to plan early and
      effective treatment.

      Currently, it is the standard of care to use the pp65 antigenemia assay to guide
      anti-cytomegalovirus therapy in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. Nevertheless,
      over the past two years at our institution, only approximately 10% of antigenemia-positive
      patients went on to develop overt CMV disease and only 22% of patients with documented
      clinical CMV disease had a positive antigenemia test in the two weeks prior to diagnosis
      (data on file).

      Recently, a test called CMV Real-Time PCR has been applied to the diagnosis of CMV infection.
      Preliminary data suggests that this test may be of value in detecting active CMV replication.
      Thus, it may be able to predict CMV disease and help guide antiviral therapy.

      We propose a prospective observational study comparing CMV Real-Time PCR test and pp65
      antigenemia. This will be done by taking an extra blood sample (approximately 5 mL) for the
      CMV Real-Time PCR test from hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients whenever a sample for
      the pp65 antigenemia test is drawn. No separate venipunctures are anticipated. These samples
      will be drawn on an approximately weekly basis during the first 100 days post-transplant, as
      is currently done for the pp65 antigenemia test alone. Additionally, at any time blood is
      drawn for the pp65 antigenemia test after 100 days, we will also take blood for the CMV
      Real-Time PCR test, up to one year post-transplant. The results of the CMV Real-Time PCR test
      will not be used to guide therapy. Overt CMV disease will be identified via real-time chart
      review and patient interviews by one of the investigators in the study. The primary goal of
      the study is to evaluate the ability of the CMV Real-Time PCR test to accurately detect
      active CMV viral proliferation and predict ultimate overt CMV disease as compared to the
      currently-used pp65 antigenemia test.

        Male or female patients that are 10 years of age or older up to 80 years of age are
        included.

        Patients must be enrolled in a protocol at the NIH Clinical Center that will result in the
        patient receiving an allogeneic stem cell transplant (A-HSCT).

        Patients who have not yet received a pre-transplant chemotherapy and radiation therapy
        conditioning regimen are eligible.

        Patients must not have a negative IgG serologic test for CMV and whose hematopoietic stem
        cell donor also has a negative IgG serologic test as reported by the Bone Marrow Transplant
        staff.

        Patients must not have documentation of prior cytomegalovirus antigenemia or disease prior
        to starting the conditioning regimen.
