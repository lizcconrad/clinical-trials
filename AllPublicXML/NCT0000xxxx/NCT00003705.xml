      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-184476 in treating patients who have
      advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity, recommended
      phase II dose, and safety of BMS-184476 in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine
      the pharmacokinetic profile of BMS-184476 and its metabolites in these patients. III.
      Determine preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of BMS-184476 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive BMS-184476 IV over 1
      hour. Treatment is repeated every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. In the second part of the study, patients receive BMS-184476 IV over 1
      hour weekly. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at escalating doses of BMS-184476. The
      maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which fewer than 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until toxicity is resolved.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
