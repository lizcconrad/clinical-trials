      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of bortezomib when given together
      with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium in treating patients with solid tumors that are
      metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib
      together with chemotherapy may be an effective treatment for solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PS-341
      (bortezomib) when administered as a bolus injection two times a week (on days 1 and 4) for 2
      weeks followed by one week of rest.

      II. To evaluate the pharmacodynamics of PS-341 by determining the 20S proteasome and nuclear
      factor kappa-light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) inhibition in blood of patients
      treated with intravenous PS-341 combined with weekly fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin
      calcium (LV).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify any objective tumor response in patients treated with intravenous PS-341.

      II. To evaluate the relationship between inhibition of the 20S proteasome and NFkB and
      clinical toxicity.

      III. To obtain preliminary data on molecular correlates of response to PS-341 and 5-FU and LV
      including genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation and
      adhesion/angiogenesis based on the mechanisms of PS-341 IV. To examine the pharmacokinetics
      of 5-FU when co-administered with PS-341.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

      Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 4 and fluorouracil IV and
      leucovorin calcium IV on day 1 weekly for 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior
             to entering the study and 6 weeks from nitrosourea-containing chemotherapy; all
             patients should have recovered from all toxicities of prior chemo and radiation
             therapy

          -  Patients undergoing therapy with other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
