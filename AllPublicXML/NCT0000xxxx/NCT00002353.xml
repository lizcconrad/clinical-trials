  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate an HIV lipopeptide immunotherapeutic, P3C541b, at two dose levels administered
      subcutaneously in HIV-seropositive patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive P3C541b or placebo within each of two study groups.
      Enrollment in the first group will be independent of HLA type, whereas all but two of the
      patients enrolled in group 2 must have one or more HLA types A33, B8, B27, or Bw62. Treatment
      in group 2 will not begin until those in group 1 have reached day 14 without serious
      toxicity.
