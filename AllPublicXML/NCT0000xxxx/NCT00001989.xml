  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves GLQ223 administration to patients who have not previously been exposed to
      it, but who have received at least 9 months of zidovudine therapy. Efficacy evaluations will
      include survival, opportunistic infections, T4 cell count, and assessments of viral load.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve the randomization of patients with 200-500 T4 cells and AIDS or ARC to
      one of three treatment arms: zidovudine alone, GLQ223 alone, or GLQ223 plus zidovudine.
      Patients randomized to receive GLQ223 will receive an infusion every three weeks for 45
      weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Aerosolized pentamidine, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or dapsone for PCP
             prophylaxis.

          -  Chronic suppressive therapy for the following infections:

        Toxoplasmosis (pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, or clindamycin). Cryptococcosis (fluconazole).
        Candidiasis (ketoconazole). Herpes simplex virus (acyclovir). Mycobacterium avium
        (isoniazid, clofazimine, amikacin, rifampin, rifabutin, ethambutol, or other drug with
        written permission of the sponsor).

        Required:

          -  Patients whose CD4+ count falls below 200 at two consecutive measurements must receive
             prophylaxis for PCP and any other clinically indicated conditions.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following conditions or symptoms are excluded:

          -  An active AIDS-defining opportunistic infection.

          -  Evidence of AIDS dementia complex or active neurologic disease, including progressive

             CNS infection.

          -  Any condition which in the Investigator's opinion is sufficient to prevent adequate
             compliance with the study.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Therapeutic agents specific for HIV disease that have not received FDA approval.

          -  Biologic response modifiers, including interferon, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and leukocyte

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  An active AIDS-defining opportunistic infection.

             multi-focal leukoencephalopathy (PML), poorly controlled seizure disorder or active
             CNS infection.

          -  Participation in other clinical studies, including investigational therapy of HIV
             infection.

          -  Any condition which in the Investigator's opinion is sufficient to prevent adequate
             compliance with the study.

          -  History of prior use of GLQ223 or trichosanthin or presence of anti-GLQ223 serum IgG
             antibody as measured by Western blot.

          -  Inability to provide written informed consent.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  History of prior use of GLQ223 or trichosanthin or presence of anti-GLQ serum IgG
             antibody as measured by Western blot.

        Excluded within 30 days prior to enrollment:

          -  Use of unapproved therapeutic agents specific for HIV disease, including ddC.

          -  Use of biologic response modifiers, including interferon, interleukin-2, and leukocyte
             stimulating hormones (GM-CSF, G-CSF).

        Patients have the following:

          -  HIV positive by ELISA with confirmation by Western blot.

          -  Symptomatic with AIDS-Related Complex or AIDS by CDC classification.

          -  History of zidovudine therapy at a dose equal to or more than 300 mg daily for at
             least 9 consecutive months immediately prior to entry into study.

             one week apart).

          -  Ability to give informed consent.

        Required:

          -  Zidovudine therapy at a dose equal to or more than 300 mg daily for at least 9 months
