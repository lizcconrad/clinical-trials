  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness of an anti-HIV drug combination
      that adds capravirine in patients who have failed their first drug combination treatment.

      [Note: As of 2/28/2001, due to toxicity studies and concern for safety, changes in the
      methodology were implemented and patients need to sign new informed consents. The study is
      unblinded. Group 1 receives AG1549; Group 2 receives an AG1549 placebo. Patients who are
      taking capravirine and who currently have viral loads below 400 copies/ml may continue to
      take capravirine at 1400 mg twice daily. Capravirine will be discontinued in patients with
      viral loads greater than 400 copies/ml at their last visit and they will be switched to new
      therapies or continue with their background therapies as deemed appropriate by the
      investigators.] Both groups also receive nelfinavir mesylate and 2 NRTIs. All patients
      receive the same dose of nelfinavir mesylate. The NRTIs are selected at the investigator's
      discretion provided the patient has not previously received the chosen NRTIs. Patients have
      regular physical examinations. Blood samples are collected regularly and at 1 month
      post-treatment to determine plasma HIV RNA, pharmacokinetics, and CD4 and CD8 counts.
      Patients who complete 24 weeks of treatment will have the option to continue treatment for an
      additional 24 weeks or end participation.
