  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic tool that creates high quality images of the
      human body without the use of X-ray (radiation). MRI is especially useful when studying the
      arteries of the heart (CMRA, coronary magnetic resonance angiography).

      In this study researchers from several laboratories and hospitals will work together to
      determine the safety and effectiveness of CMRA with MS-325. MS-325 is a contrast agent. It is
      given to patients undergoing CRMA in order to improve the appearance of the arteries of the
      heart.

      In this multicenter trial, the safety and efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for
      visualization of the coronary arteries (CMRA, coronary magnetic resonance angiography) with
      MS-325. MS-325 is a new blood pool radiological contrast agent which will be assessed as part
      of a phase II feasibility study. The Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics in collaboration with
      the Department of Cardiology at the George Washington Hospital Center will be one of the six
      participating sites for this study.
