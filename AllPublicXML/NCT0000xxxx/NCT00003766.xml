      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Giving a chemotherapy drug before surgery may shrink the tumor so
      that it can be removed during surgery.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of O6-benzylguanine followed by surgery in
      treating patients who have solid tumors that can be removed during surgery.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the minimal O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG) dose required to deplete tumor
      activity to less than 10 fmol/mg protein at a specified time after administration in patients
      with surgically resectable solid tumors. II. Correlate tumor tissue AGT depletion with AGT
      depletion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained at a specified time after
      O6-BG administration in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive a single dose of O6-benzylguanine
      (O6-BG) IV over 1 hour at one of two dose levels. Patients undergo surgery 16-20 hours after
      administration of O6-BG. Up to 13 patients receive the lower dose level of O6-BG. If more
      than 3 patients have detectable AGT levels, additional patients receive the higher dose. The
      optimal biologic dose (OBD) is defined as the lowest dose level at which at least 11 of 13
      patients have AGT activity less than 10 fmol/mg protein after O6-BG dosing. Patients are
      followed at 1 and 3 weeks post surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-26 patients will be accrued for this study over
      approximately 10 months.
