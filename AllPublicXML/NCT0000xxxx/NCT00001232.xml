  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The normal menstrual cycle is produced by a series of hormonal signals that starts with the
      release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is
      located in the brain and is often referred to as the master gland. GnRH then acts on the
      pituitary gland and causes it to release two hormones, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and
      lutenizng hormone (LH). LH and FSH act on the ovary and cause it to release the hormones
      directly involved in menstruation, estrogen and progesterone.

      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis
      activity as measured by pituitary hormones, FSH and LH in response to intravenous doses of
      gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) in menstrual cycle-related hormones.

      This protocol is designed to accompany clinical protocol #81-M-0126, &quot;The Phenomenology and
      Biophysiology of Menstrually Regulated Mood and Behavior Disorders&quot;, as well as the submitted
      protocol, &quot;The Phenomenology and Biophysiology of Climacteric and Menopause-Related Mood and
      Behavioral Disorders.&quot; Its purpose will be to evaluate hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis
      regulation as measured by pituitary gonadotropin, i.e., follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
      and luteinizing hormone (LH), response to intravenous administration of gonadotropin
      releasing hormone (GnRH) in menstrual cycle-related mood disorders.
