  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, chemoprevention study. Patients receive fenretinide daily for 25 of every 28
      days for 4 months and tamoxifen daily for 23 months, beginning the second month of
      fenretinide.

      Patients are removed from study for unacceptable toxicity, the development of invasive breast
      cancer, or for dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

      This is a pilot chemo-prevention study of the combination tamoxifen and 4-HPR in persons at
      increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer. The objectives of the study are to
      determine the acute and cumulative toxicity of tamoxifen and 4-HPR in high risk persons; to
      assess the feasibility of obtaining adequate tissue to study potential intermediate
      biomarkers of proliferative disease and malignancy using nipple aspiration, four quadrant
      fine needle aspirates, and breast core needle biopsies; and to study the effects of tamoxifen
      and 4-HPR on TGF-beta isoforms and the proliferative markers ki67 and PCNA pre- and
      post-therapy.

        POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS:

        Women and men at increased risk for the development of breast cancer by at least one of the
        following criteria:

        Histologically documented ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), including DCIS with minimal
        invasion or microinvasion.

        Histologically documented lobular neoplasia, including lobular hyperplasia and lobular
        carcinoma in situ (LCIS).

        Histologically documented atypical ductal hyperplasia in postmenopausal women.

        Histologically documented atypical ductal hyperplasia in premenopausal women with 1
        first-degree relative (mother or sister) diagnosed with breast cancer.

        Histologically documented atypical ductal hyperplasia in premenopausal women with 3 or more
        relatives diagnosed with breast cancer provided at least 1 is a second-degree relative.

        3 or more first- or second-degree relatives diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer with at
        least 1 diagnosed with breast cancer.

        2 or more premenopausal (under age 50) first-degree relatives diagnosed with breast cancer.

        1 or more first-degree relatives diagnosed with breast cancer if at least 1 relative in the
        extended pedigree had ovarian cancer.

        3 or more relatives with breast cancer with at least 1 first-degree relative diagnosed with
        premenopausal breast cancer.

        Previously diagnosed Stage I breast cancer with surgery and/or radiotherapy only (without
        prior adjuvant chemo- or hormonal therapy).

        Positive for the BRCA1/BRCA2 gene.

        No history of other invasive breast cancer.

        No evidence of malignancy on breast and gynecologic exams.

        Participants with a family history of breast cancer will be seen in consultation by the
        Family Studies Branch, NCI.

        PRIOR/CONCURRENT THERAPY:

        Mastectomy or lumpectomy plus radiotherapy required prior to entry for patients with DCIS.
        Patients with DCIS who have participated in protocol NCI-MB-348 eligible.

        No participation in any other breast cancer prevention study involving pharmacologic
        intervention.

        No prior chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for invasive breast cancer.

        At least 3 months since estrogen or progesterone replacement therapy or hormonal
        contraceptives.

        etiology allowed.

        No history of retinal disease, macular degeneration, or night blindness.

        No medical or psychiatric risk due to nonmalignant systemic disease that would preclude
        study participation.
