      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining flavopiridol with irinotecan
      in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol when combined with irinotecan in
           patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the clinical pharmacokinetics of this regimen, as well as the plasma levels of
           the active metabolite SN-38 and metabolic product SN-38 glucuronide in these patients.

        -  Determine, in a preliminary manner, the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the role of p21 relative to treatment response and apoptosis in these patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, open-label, non-randomized study of flavopiridol.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 30 minutes followed 7 hours later by flavopiridol IV over
      1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment continues every 6 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. During the first week of the
      second course, patients receive flavopiridol alone on day 1 and irinotecan alone on day 2.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of flavopiridol until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more of
      6 patients in the initial cohort experience dose limiting toxicity during the first course of
      treatment. An additional 10 patients are treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
