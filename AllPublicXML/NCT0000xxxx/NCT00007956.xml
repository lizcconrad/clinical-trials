      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver
      cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating
      patients who have recurrent or refractory lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of monoclonal antibody
           mono-dgA-RFB4 in patients with recurrent or refractory B-cell lymphoma expressing CD22
           antigen.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate the pharmacokinetic parameters with the biologic effects and/or toxicity of
           this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine whether clinical responses in these patients occur at lower, equal, or higher
           doses than historical responses induced by a similar drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to number of
      circulating tumor cells in peripheral blood (more than 50/mm3 vs 50/mm3 or less).

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody Mono-dgA-RFB4 IV over 4 hours on days 1, 3, and 5.
      Patients achieving complete, partial, or minimal remission receive additional courses of
      therapy every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody mono-dgA-RFB4 until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of
      3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients achieving complete remission or stable partial remission are followed every 3 months
      for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.

             The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former
             terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol
             uses the former terminology.
