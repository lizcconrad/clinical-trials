      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine in treating patients who
      have recurrent chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the rate and duration of complete and partial remission in patients
      with recurrent B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with gemcitabine. II. Assess the
      toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks for a minimum of 3 courses. Patients achieving clinical complete remission,
      complete remission, nodular partial remission, or partial remission following 3 courses of
      therapy, receive 2 additional courses of therapy. Patients achieving complete remission or
      further improvement following the 2 additional courses of therapy, receive another 2 courses
      of therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression or relapse.
      Patients achieving complete remission are followed every 6 months for 1 year.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia manifested by all
        of the following: Minimum threshold peripheral lymphocyte count of at least 5,000/mm3 Small
        to medium sized peripheral blood lymphocytes with no greater than 55% prolymphocytes Bone
        marrow aspirate and biopsy containing at least 30% lymphoid cells Immunophenotypic and
        biopsy evaluation of peripheral blood lymphocytes demonstrating monoclonality of B
        lymphocytes B-cell markers with CD5 antigen (e.g., T-1, T-101) in the absence of other pan
        T-cell markers (e.g., CD3, CD2) Expression of CD19, CD20, and CD23 B cell surface markers
        B-cell expression of kappa or lambda light chains Active disease with at least one of the
        following criteria: One or more disease related symptoms: At least 10% weight loss within
        the past 6 months Fever greater than 100.5 F for at least 2 weeks without evidence of
        infection Night sweats without evidence of infection Evidence of progressive marrow failure
        as manifested by the development of or worsening of anemia (hemoglobin less than 11.0 g/dL)
        and/or thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 100,000/mm3) (i.e., any stage III or IV
        disease) Autoimmune anemia and/or thrombocytopenia poorly responsive to corticosteroid
        therapy Massive (i.e., greater than 6 cm below the left costal margin) or progressive
        splenomegaly (i.e., a greater than 50% increase over two months) Massive (i.e., greater
        than 10 cm in longest diameter) or progressive lymphadenopathy (i.e., a greater than 50%
        increase over two months) Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of greater than 50%
        over a 2 month period (unrelated to corticosteroids) or an anticipated doubling time of
        less than 6 months No marked hypogammaglobulinemia or the development of a monoclonal
        protein in the absence of any criteria for active disease Previously treated with at least
        a fludarabine or cladribine based regimen and a prior alkylating agent with evidence of
        recurrent or progressive disease
