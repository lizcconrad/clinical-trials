      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of suramin in treating patients who have
      refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma or Castleman's disease.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the tumor response of patients with refractory or relapsed multiple
      myeloma or Castleman's disease treated with suramin. II. Determine the effects of this
      regimen on cytokine-mediated symptoms in patients with Castleman's disease. III. Determine
      the overall and progression-free survival in patients with multiple myeloma or Castelman's
      disease treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the qualitative, quantitative, and
      cumulative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. V. Determine the effect of this
      regimen on the levels of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble IL-6 receptor, and soluble gp130
      in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive suramin on days 1-5, 8, 11, 15, 19, 22, and 29. During course 1,
      patients also receive suramin on days 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, and 78. Suramin is administered
      IV over 2 hours on day 1 of course 1 and over 1 hour on all subsequent infusion days.
      Patients undergo rest for at least 12 weeks between each course. Patients with responding
      disease after completion of course 2 may receive additional courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed weekly for 1 month, every 2 weeks for 1 month,
      at 3 months, and then monthly thereafter if indicated.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients with multiple myeloma will be accrued for this
      study within 10-20 months. A total of 20-40 patients with Castleman's disease will be accrued
      for this study within 2.9-8 years.
