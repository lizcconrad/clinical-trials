      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-214662 in treating patients who have
      advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity, recommended
      phase II dose, and safety of BMS-214662 in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine
      the pharmacokinetics of BMS-214662 in these patients. III. Assess the absolute oral
      bioavailability of BMS-214662 using a capsule and single intravenous dose in these patients.
      IV. Determine any preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of BMS-214662 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive BMS-214662 IV over 1 hour on day
      -7, followed by oral BMS-214662 daily on days 0-14 for course 1 only. Beginning with course
      2, patients receive oral BMS-214662 twice daily for 14 days. Treatment continues every 3
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients
      receive escalating doses of BMS-214662 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.
      The MTD is defined as the dose at which fewer than 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until toxicities resolve.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
