      This study will examine the feasibility of giving cell growth stimulants to granulocyte
      donors the same day of donation rather than the day before.

      People who donate granulocytes (infection-fighting white blood cells) for transfusion to
      patients with severe white cell deficiencies are often given a steroid called dexamethasone
      and a growth factor called G-CSF the day before donation. These drugs stimulate white cell
      production, allowing many more cells to be collected than would otherwise be possible. A
      single dose of G-CSF given to healthy people increases their white cells counts by four to
      five times the next day.

      It would be preferable, however, to give G-CSF the same day of donation, if possible.
      Therefore, this study will measure white cell counts in healthy people at various intervals
      after being injected with G-CSF alone and G-CSF with dexamethasone. The study will compare
      the following: granulocyte counts at seven different intervals after injection of the drug or
      drugs; the effects of G-CSF injected through a vein or under the skin; and the effects of
      giving G-CSF alone or with dexamethasone.

      Each participant will undergo four procedures, each four weeks apart as follows: donate a
      small blood sample; receive an injection of G-CSF under the skin or into a vein; and take
      either two dexamethasone tablets or two placebo tablets.

      Small blood samples will then be drawn 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after the drugs are given.
      Participants will answer questions about how they feel before the drugs are given and at the
      various intervals after taking the drugs.

      The administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to increase the white
      blood cell count in granulocyte donors prior to donation is becoming an increasingly common
      practice. G-CSF is given subcutaneously to the donor on the day prior to donation, generally
      12 to 24 hours before the start of apheresis. It would be advantageous to be able to give
      G-CSF and collect granulocytes on the same day. However, the single most important factor in
      optimizing granulocyte collection is the donor's pre-collection granulocyte count. Therefore,
      any decrease in count would result in a less cellular component. The purpose of this study is
      to assess granulocyte counts in healthy subjects during an 8-hour period after a single 5
      microgram/kg intravenous dose of G-CSF with or without dexamethasone. Sixteen subjects will
      be studied. Each donor will be studied four separate times. The four mobilization protocols
      to be studied are G-CSF 5 micrograms/kg given intravenously, G-CSF 5 micrograms/kg
      subcutaneously, G-CSF 5 micrograms/kg intravenously plus dexamethasone 8 mg orally, and G-CSF
      5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously plus dexamethasone 8 mg orally. The order of the route of
      administration will be assigned randomly. White blood cell counts, neutrophil counts and
      donor symptoms will be measured before G-CSF administration and at 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24
      hours after administration. The neutrophil counts measured within the first 8 hours after
      G-CSF will be compared with counts measured 24 hours after G-CSF.
