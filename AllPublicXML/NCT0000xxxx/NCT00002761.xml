      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by
      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether intensive idarubicin and cytarabine leads to adequate
      harvest of Philadelphia chromosome-negative peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) in patients
      with chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase. II. Determine the toxicity of this
      intensive regimen in these patients. III. Determine the graft-versus-leukemia effect induced
      in these patients by cyclosporine and interferon gamma post-PBSC transplantation. IV.
      Determine the transformation-free and overall survival in patients treated with a high-dose
      conditioning regimen comprising busulfan and cyclophosphamide followed by PBSC
      transplantation plus immunotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive idarubicin IV and cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-3. When
      blood counts recover, Philadelphia chromosome negative peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are
      harvested. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously (SC) beginning 24 hours after
      completion of cytarabine infusion and continuing until blood counts have recovered for 3
      consecutive days after harvest of PBSC. Patients with more than 5% blasts in marrow or any
      peripheral blasts, interferon resistance, interferon intolerance with poor prognosis, and
      clonal evolution proceed to conditioning followed by PBSC transplantation. Patients receive
      conditioning comprising oral busulfan every 6 hrs on days -8 to -5 and cyclophosphamide IV
      over 2 hours on days -4 and -3. PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Patients receive graft versus
      leukemia induction comprising cyclosporine IV over 4 hours every 12 hours on days 0-28 and
      interferon gamma SC beginning on day 7 and continuing every other day through day 28.
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-43 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-8 years.
