      OBJECTIVES: I. Provide epoprostenol (Flolan, prostaglandin I2) by chronic infusion to
      patients with severe primary pulmonary hypertension for whom no alternative therapy is
      available.

      II. Obtain additional safety information on continuous infusion epoprostenol. III. Obtain
      additional information on economic resource health consumption.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are treated with a chronic continuous infusion of epoprostenol.

      The highest tolerated infusion rate is determined for each patient by gradually increasing
      the rate until the target dose is reached or the patient experiences at least 1 dose-limiting
      effect.

      Patients are subsequently treated with a chronic continuous infusion, beginning at a rate
      below the highest tolerated rate. Attempts are made to increase the dose to the highest
      tolerated rate over the first 72 hours.
