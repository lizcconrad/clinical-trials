      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the Chiron vaccine human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV) p24(25 or 50 micrograms)/MF59 in healthy HIV-1 seronegative adults. To evaluate the
      immunogenicity of the HIV p24(50 micrograms)/MF59 vaccine.

      This study evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of the Chiron vaccine HIV p24/MF59. In
      Part A, 15 volunteers are randomly assigned to receive either HIV p24/MF59 or a placebo at 0,
      1, and 6 months. 10 volunteers receive the vaccine and 5 volunteers receive the placebo. If
      no serious adverse events are observed within 1 week after the first injection in these first
      15 patients, Part B is initiated. In Part B, 25 volunteers are randomly assigned to receive
      HIV p24/MF59 or a placebo at 0, 1, and 6 months. 20 volunteers receive the vaccine and 5
      volunteers receive the placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Volunteers must have:

          -  Good health as determined by medical history, physical examination, and clinical
             judgment.

          -  Negative serology for HIV infection as determined by licensed HIV ELISA test performed
             within 6 weeks prior to first immunization.

          -  In vitro Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized cell line from peripheral blood can be
             established (required for selected Part B volunteers only).

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Volunteers with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Significant acute systemic infection.

          -  Occupational or other responsibilities that would prevent completion of participation
             in the study.

          -  Any condition that might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.

        Volunteers with the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  History of immunodeficiency, autoimmune disease, or any serious chronic illness.

          -  Evidence of psychiatric or medical history or substance abuse that would adversely
             affect the volunteer's ability to participate in the trial.

          -  History of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines or vaccine
             components.

             1. Immunosuppressive medications.

          -  Live, attenuated vaccine within 60 days of study entry.

        NOTE:

          -  Medically indicated subunit or killed vaccines (e.g., influenza or pneumococcal) are
             not exclusionary but should be given at least 4 weeks before or after HIV
             immunizations to avoid potential confusion of adverse reactions.

          -  Experimental agents within 30 days of study entry.

          -  HIV vaccine or MF59 adjuvant. Blood products or immunoglobulins in the past 3 months.

        Engaging in high-risk behavior within 6 months of study entry, i.e.:

          -  injection drug use, sexual intercourse without a condom with 4 or more partners or
             with known iv drug user or HIV+ partner, or newly acquired sexually-transmitted
             disease.
