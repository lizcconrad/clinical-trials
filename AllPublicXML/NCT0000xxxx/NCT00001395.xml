  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of laser photocoagulation treatment for diabetic retinopathy has been
      demonstrated by several National Eye Institute (NEI) sponsored clinical trials. The Diabetic
      Retinopathy Study (DRS) demonstrated that scatter photocoagulation reduces the risk of
      blindness from diabetic retinopathy. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)
      extended these findings by providing information on when to initiate scatter photocoagulation
      and by demonstrating that focal treatment was effective in treating macula edema. The Krypton
      Argon Regression Neovascularization Study (KARNS) showed that scatter photocoagulation with
      krypton red laser was just as safe and effective as the argon blue-green laser in the
      treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

      Unfortunately, there is little data on the long term effects of photocoagulation on visual
      function. The first objective of this study is to assess the long term effects of
      photocoagulation for diabetic retinopathy. A second objective is to provide additional
      information on the risk of progression of cataracts in persons with diabetes. All patients
      previously treated with laser photocoagulation (focal and/or scatter) are eligible to
      participate in this long term study. The first priority will be given to patients who
      participated in the ETDRS and KARNS because of the wealth of information available regarding
      the details of their treatment and course after treatment. Study evaluations will include a
      standard ophthalmic examination, fluorescein angiography, lens and fundus photography.
