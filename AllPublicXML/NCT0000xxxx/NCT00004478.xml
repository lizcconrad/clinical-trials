      RATIONALE: Neurogenic hypotension is a fall in blood pressure that occurs when one moves from
      a lying down to a standing position or after eating a meal. It causes one to feel dizzy,
      light headed, and weak. Neurogenic hypotension is caused by a problem in the part of the
      nervous system that controls such functions as heart rate and blood pressure. Droxidopa, a
      drug that may increase blood pressure, may be an effective treatment for neurogenic
      hypotension.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of droxidopa in treating patients who have
      neurogenic hypotension.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients receive escalating doses of droxidopa or placebo for 7-14 days. Patients undergo
      blood pressure measurements hourly in both supine and standing positions.
