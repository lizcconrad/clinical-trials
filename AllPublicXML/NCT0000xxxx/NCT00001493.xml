  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the feasibility of using gene therapy to prevent some of the toxicities
      of an intensive chemotherapy regimen in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Patients who
      do not wish to participate in the gene therapy procedures will be offered identical
      chemotherapy on a different protocol. Patients will be treated initially with chemotherapy
      which is active against breast cancer, but which has a low potential to hurt blood-forming
      cells. Then, the patient will receive high dose chemotherapy, during which time blood cells
      which are capable of rebuilding patients' bone marrows will be removed from the patients'
      bloodstream. We will use these blood cell collections to isolate peripheral blood progenitor
      cells (PBPCs), those cells which are thought to be the forbears of all other blood cells.

      A portion of the PBPCs will be exposed to a disabled virus which either carries genetic
      material referred to as the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1). The virus will transfer the
      MDR1 gene into a portion of the patient's PBPCs. The purpose of putting the MDR1 gene into
      the patients' PBPCs is to try to make these blood cells and their offspring resistant to the
      toxic effects of certain types of breast cancer chemotherapy. The MDR1 protein (Pgp) that is
      made from the MDR1 gene makes cells resistant to chemotherapy in laboratory systems by
      pumping the drug out of cells before the drug is able to kill the cell. Another portion of
      the patients PBPCs will be exposed to a similar disabled virus carrying a different gene
      called the NeoR gene. The NeoR gene should not change the effects of chemotherapy on blood
      forming cells. The purpose of using the NeoR gene is that it will serve as a point of
      comparison, to see if the presence of the MDR1 drug resistance gene really helps blood
      forming cells withstand subsequent chemotherapy.

      Patients are then treated with a very high dose of another anti-breast cancer drug, one that
      is very toxic to bone marrow cells, and patients will then receive the frozen PBPCs, which
      contain the new genes, to help them recover from the chemotherapy. After recovery, patients
      will then be treated with high doses of paclitaxel (Taxol) and doxorubicin (Adriamycin)
      chemotherapy. Both of these drugs are very active against breast cancer, and the MDR1 gene
      may potentially protect bone marrow cells against these drugs. Samples of peripheral blood
      cells will be obtained before each of these doses of chemotherapy to determine whether the
      number of blood cells that contain the MDR1 gene in comparison to the number that contain the
      NeoR gene has increased in response to the chemotherapy.

      This pilot trial will determine whether retroviral-transduced peripheral blood progenitor
      cells (PBPCs) can be selected and expanded in vivo after non-ablative chemotherapy in
      patients with metastatic breast cancer. It will also examine the feasibility of administering
      induction high-dose therapy with antimetabolites, followed with consolidation using high-dose
      single alkylating agent therapy and finally intensification therapy with sequential cycles of
      very high doses of the natural product breast cancer chemotherapeutic agents (paclitaxel
      followed by doxorubicin).

      Patients will receive induction therapy with antimetabolite agents (methotrexate, leucovorin
      and 5-fluorouracil) for two to four cycles. Patients will then receive consolidation therapy
      with two cycles of high-dose alkylating agents. First, patients will receive one cycle of
      high-dose cyclophosphamide administered with growth factor support. PBPCs will be harvested
      during the recovery phase of the cyclophosphamide cycle.

      One-half of the cells to be reinfused will be transduced with a retroviral vector containing
      the gene for the multidrug resistance protein (MDRI in vector G1MD) and the other half will
      be transduced with a vector containing the neomycin resistance gene (NeoR in vector G1Na.40).
      Both of these vectors have previously been approved by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee
      for PBPC transduction in Medicine Branch protocols.

      The next cycle will consist of high-dose single agent thiotepa. Hematopoietic stem cells
      mobilized and collected during the previous cyclophosphamide cycle and transduced with the
      retroviral vectors will be reinfused following treatment with thiotepa to augment recovery of
      bone marrow function. After recovery, intensification with natural product chemotherapy will
      be administered, consisting of four cycles of paclitaxel given as a 24-hour infusion followed
      by four cycles of single agent doxorubicin. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be
      monitored following each cycle of paclitaxel and doxorubicin for the presence of the MDRI and
      NeoR transgenes. The ration of the levels of MDRI to NeoR transgenes in peripheral blood will
      determine whether in vivo expansion of the PBPCs containing the selectable MDRI marker has
      been achieved.

      This protocol combines several highly active chemotherapeutic agents in an attempt to improve
      upon response rates achieved with current combinations. Patients who do not wish to
      participate in the gene therapy procedures will be offered identical chemotherapy in a
      different protocol.
