      To evaluate the efficacy of oral acyclovir for the treatment and suppression of Epstein-Barr
      virus (EBV) related hairy leukoplakia (HL). To determine the long-term safety of acyclovir in
      the AIDS-related complex (ARC) patient with HL. To monitor the progression of HIV disease in
      the HL patient and compare to existing historical control data.
