    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver
      cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy
      use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining
      monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of the monoclonal antibody rituximab plus
      chemotherapy with vinorelbine in treating patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that
      has relapsed following autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the tolerability and toxicity of rituximab combined with vinorelbine in
           patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma following autologous peripheral blood stem
           cell transplantation.

        -  Assess the response rate and duration of response to this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab IV weekly on weeks 1-4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 and vinorelbine
      IV on weeks 2-4, 6-8, and 10-12. Patients who achieve partial response may continue on
      vinorelbine from week 14 until disease progression.

      Patients are followed until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
