      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Cyclosporine may relieve the diarrhea caused by irinotecan.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan and cyclosporine in treating
      patients who have metastatic, advanced, or locally recurrent colorectal cancer that has not
      responded to fluorouracil.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of patients with metastatic, advanced, or locally
      recurrent fluorouracil refractory adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum treated with
      irinotecan and cyclosporine. II. Determine antitumor activity, safety, tolerance, and
      toxicity of this combination treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 6 hours and
      irinotecan IV over 90 minutes weekly for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 6 weeks. Patients
      receive at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-45 patients will be accrued for this study over 14 months.
