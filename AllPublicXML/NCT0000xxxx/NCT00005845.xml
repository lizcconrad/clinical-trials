    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib in treating patients
      with myelodysplastic syndromes. Tipifarnib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity profile and antitumor activity of the farnesyltransferase
      (FTase) inhibitor R115777 (tipifarnib) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
      treated on a one week on/one week off schedule.

      II. To determine the effect on R115777 on a one week on/one week off schedule on FTase
      activity, prenylation of RAS and other substrates and on downstream effects.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive tipifarnib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7. Treatment
      repeats every 8 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
