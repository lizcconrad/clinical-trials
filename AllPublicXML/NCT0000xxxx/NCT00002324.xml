  <brief_title>The Safety and Effectiveness of Nevirapine and Zidovudine, Given Separately and Together, in HIV-1 Infected Patients Who Have No Symptoms of the Disease</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Multi-Center, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Randomized Trial Comparing the Activity, Safety, and Tolerance of 1) 400 Mg Nevirapine in Combination With 500-600 Mg Zidovudine Versus Zidovudine Alone in Asymptomatic HIV-1 Infected Patients With 3-24 Months of Prior Zidovudine Therapy and 200-500 CD4 Cells/mm3 and 2) 400 Mg Nevirapine Versus Nevirapine Placebo in Asymptomatic HIV-1 Nucleoside Naive Patients With 200-500 CD4 Cells/mm3</official_title>

      PRIMARY: To compare the effect of nevirapine versus placebo alone or in combination with
      zidovudine (AZT) on CD4 T-cell count and percentage after 3 and 6 months of treatment. To
      evaluate the safety and tolerance of nevirapine alone or in combination with AZT.

      SECONDARY: To compare the effects of the various treatment combinations on virologic and
      immunologic markers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Part I, patients who have had prior AZT therapy receive either nevirapine or placebo in
      combination with AZT. In Part II, patients who are nucleoside naive receive either nevirapine
      or matching placebo. After 6 months, patients receive open-label nevirapine.
