      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of doxorubicin and docetaxel in treating
      women who have stage III breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the clinical and pathological response rate of sequential doxorubicin and
           docetaxel chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of women with stage III breast
           cancer.

        -  Measure signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) activation before and
           after this neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in this patient population.

        -  Correlate response to chemotherapy with STAT activation before and after this
           neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine how other potential predictors of response correlate with STAT activation by
           measuring Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax protein levels, tyrosine kinase levels, growth rate of the
           tumor, and apoptotic index before and after this neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in
           these patients.

        -  Correlate response to chemotherapy with levels of STAT activation in association with
           the presence of Bcl-2 proteins and tyrosine kinases, growth rate of the tumor, and
           apoptotic index in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of this neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen given in a dose-dense
           fashion in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin IV on day 1 every 2 weeks for 3 courses. After 3 weeks
      of rest, patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 every 2 weeks for 3 courses.
      Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously on days 3-10 of each doxorubicin and
      docetaxel course. Within 6 weeks of completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo
      surgery with mastectomy or lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.

    <description>Evaluate the pathological response rate of sequential doxorubicin and docetaxel chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of women with stage III breast cancer. Pathologic response is classified as either complete pathologic response or partial pathologic response based on the size of residual tumor after treatment (complete pathologic response if 0 cm, partial pathologic response if &gt;0 cm).</description>
