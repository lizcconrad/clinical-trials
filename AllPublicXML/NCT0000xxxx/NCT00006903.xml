  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying fulvestrant to see how well it works in treating patients
      with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic endometrial cancer. Estrogen can stimulate the
      growth of cancer cells. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight cancer by blocking the
      uptake of estrogen by the tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the probability of clinical response in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive vs
      ER-negative patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic endometrial cancer treated
      with fulvestrant.

      II. Compare the relationship between response rate and intensity of receptor expression in
      patients treated with this drug.

      III. Determine the frequency and intensity of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at
      least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

    <measure>Clinical Response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria Evaluated Every 8 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Response was measured every other cycle (every 8 weeks) until disease progression is documented or adverse events preclude further treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome measured according to RECIST v1.0 Best Response:
Complete Response (CR) is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no evidence of new lesions documented by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart
Disease Progression is at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as references the smallest sum LD or the appearance of new lesions within 8 weeks of study entry.
Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest dimensions (LD) of all target measurable lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LD. There can be no unequivocal progression of nontarget lesions and no new lesions. Documentation by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart is required
Stable Disease is any condition not meeting the above criteria.
Indeterminate is defined as having no repeat tumor assessments following initiation of study therapy for reasons unrelated to symptoms or signs of disease.</description>

        <description>Primary outcome measured according to RECIST v1.0 Best Response:
Complete Response (CR) is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no evidence of new lesions documented by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart
Disease Progression is at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as references the smallest sum LD or the appearance of new lesions within 8 weeks of study entry.
Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest dimensions (LD) of all target measurable lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LD. There can be no unequivocal progression of nontarget lesions and no new lesions. Documentation by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart is required
Stable Disease is any condition not meeting the above criteria.
Indeterminate is defined as having no repeat tumor assessments following initiation of study therapy for reasons unrelated to symptoms or signs of disease.</description>
