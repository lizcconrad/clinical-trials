      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of topotecan in treating children who have
      relapsed acute leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, or blast phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of patients with relapsed acute lymphocytic
      leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, or blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with
      oral topotecan. II. Determine the toxic effects and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease type (acute lymphocytic leukemia vs acute myeloid
      leukemia). Patients receive oral topotecan once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of blasts in the blood, M3 bone marrow, or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients are followed every 6 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 2 years.

    <description>For each stratum, this trial will determine topotecan to have insufficient activity for further investigation with probability 0.10 if the true response rate is 20%. For each stratum, this trial will determine topotecan to be of sufficient activity to warrant further investigation with probability 0.12 if the true response rate is 5%. Any patient who receives at least 21 days of therapy will be considered evaluable for response.</description>

    <description>Topotecan hydrochloride (0.8 mg/m²/day) by mouth for 21 days. Bone marrow will be obtained on approximately Day 28 of Course 1 and 2 and in any course where the CBC suggests that a relapse has occurred. One additional course may be given if the blood is cleared of blasts and the bone marrow is M1, M2 or M3. The patient is off protocol therapy if blasts are still present in the blood and the marrow is M3. Subsequent courses of topotecan may be given only if the bone marrow after Course 2 is M1 or M2. If the bone marrow is M2 on Day 28 of any course, another bone marrow aspirate will be done at the end of the next course. If the patient is in CR, a bone marrow aspirate will be required only every other course unless the peripheral blood suggests that a relapse has occurred. Each subsequent course should begin within six weeks of the start of the previous course.</description>
