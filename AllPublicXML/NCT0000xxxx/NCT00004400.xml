      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether physiologic testosterone replacement can increase fat-free
      mass, therefore contributing to weight maintenance, improved muscle function, and quality of
      life in HIV-infected women.

      II. Examine the mechanism of testosterone-induced increase in fat-free mass.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are
      randomized to one of three arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive two placebo transdermal patches applied twice a week (every 3-4
      days).

      Arm II: Patients receive one testosterone transdermal patch and one placebo transdermal patch
      applied twice a week (every 3-4 days).

      Arm III: Patients receive two testosterone transdermal patches applied twice a week (every
      3-4 days).

      Patients receive 12 weeks of treatment in the absence of adverse reaction or health
      deterioration. Patients are followed on day 1, every 2 weeks during treatment, and at the end
      of the recovery period. Quality of life is assessed before treatment begins and at weeks 6
      and 12.
