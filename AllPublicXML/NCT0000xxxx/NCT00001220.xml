      This study will identify clinical signs and symptoms critical for diagnosing swallowing
      disorders and will characterize swallowing problems in various patient populations, such as
      patients with Parkinson's disease, stroke, post-polio syndrome, multiple sclerosis and other
      conditions that cause swallowing abnormalities.

      Patients with swallowing difficulties who are enrolled in NIH neurology or speech pathology
      protocols may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo the following procedures:

        1. Oral examination-A neurologist and speech pathologist examine the patient's swallowing
           function. The patient is interviewed about difficulties with food intake, chewing and
           swallowing during meals.

        2. Ultrasound examination-Ultrasound creates image of areas inside the body using sound
           waves. With the patient in a sitting position, a 3/4-inch transducer (device for
           transmitting and receiving sound waves) is placed under the chin to visualize tongue
           movements during swallowing.

        3. Modified barium swallow-While standing or sitting, the patient swallows 1/2 teaspoon of
           flavored barium (a radioactive substance) six times (a total of 3 teaspoons), while the
           tongue and pharynx (tube leading from the mouth to the esophagus) are scanned and
           videotaped. The barium is given in three consistencies-thin, medium and thick
           (pudding-like).

        4. Electromyography-A small plastic strip with wires attached is placed under the patient's
           chin. The patient then swallows 1/2 ounce of barium three times in a row, and the
           movement of the chin muscles during swallowing is displayed. Patients may also be asked
           to swallow 5/8 cup of barium twice; once with the head tilted upward and once with the
           head untilted.

      Depending on the test results, patients may be asked to return for follow-up study and
      monitoring.

      Patients with neurological or neuromuscular conditions may be silent aspirators or at risk
      for laryngeal penetration or aspiration because of abnormal oropharyngeal functioning and
      thus are at risk for aspiration pneumonia and its serious effects. By providing
      identification of the components of the abnormal swallow, and comparing swallowing across
      tasks, we may avoid aspiration and can instruct patients on preventative or compensatory
      swallowing techniques.

      We will study the oral, pharyngeal and upper esophageal phases of swallow using both
      ultrasonic imaging and videofluoroscopy in patients with neurologic, genetic, systemic, and
      neuromuscular conditions. Most of the previous studies of swallowing have utilized only one
      diagnostic imaging technique and have thus provided an incomplete swallowing assessment as
      each procedure has unique, but limited capabilities for visualizing the anatomy and
      physiology of the swallow.

      We also plan to compare discrete and continuous swallowing in these populations. While the
      motor physiology for discrete swallowing (i.e., single swallow) has been well studied, little
      is known about the details of oral, laryngeal, and pharyngeal coordination during sequential
      swallowing as a part of continuous drinking--a common event in everyday eating. A portion of
      the protocol will study the effects of fast-paced movement sequencing on the coordination of
      the tongue, velum, larynx, and pharynx during continuous drinking. Videofluoroscopy and
      ultrasound may be paired or used individually to collect data from normal subjects and
      patients with known dysphagia while they perform sequential and discrete swallowing tasks. A
      number of timing and displacement measurements of the structures activated during these tasks
      will be made from the digitized video images of each swallow, and analyses will be carried
      out subsequently across tasks and subjects.

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Any Clinical Center inpatients and outpatients with known or suspected dysphagia on any
        other NIH institute protocol can be included for study as well as patients who are admitted
        specifically for this protocol.

        Those patients at risk for oropharyngeal dysfunction will be screened initially by
        completing a self-assessment swallowing questionnaire, and by an interview with staff
        and/or family members. Patients who demonstrate appropriate signs and symptoms of dysphagia
        and oral motor impairment on the screening assessment will be considered for the protocol:

        Difficulty swallowing food or pills.

        Changed swallowing ability.

        Coughing or choking when eating.

        Shortness of breath during swallowing.

        Food backing up into the mouth or nasal passage.

        Fever or voice changes after swallowing.

        Pain when swallowing.

        Unexplained loss of weight.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients who are severely demented or severely compromised will be excluded if they do not
        have sufficient cognitive ability to follow directions.

        Patients who are non-ambulatory will be excluded if they can not be braced or supported
        within the fluoroscopy unit.

        Highly agitated individuals will also be excluded if they are unable to remain confined in
        the equipment.

        Infants and children under age 3 will be excluded due to radiation risk on the developing
        visual system.
