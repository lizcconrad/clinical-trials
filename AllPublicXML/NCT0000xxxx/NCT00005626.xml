      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating patients who
      have newly diagnosed or relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the complete and partial response rates in patients with newly
      diagnosed or relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, high risk chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia, or prolymphocytic leukemia treated with irinotecan. II. Determine the toxicity of
      this regimen in these patients. III. Correlate the level of DNA topoisomerase I mRNA and
      protein, as well as SN-38 induced topoisomerase I-DNA complex formation, with the clinical
      response and toxicity in these patients. IV. Determine if a down regulation of topoisomerase
      I or altered subcellular distribution of this enzyme is involved in the drug resistance to
      irinotecan.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment
      repeats every 6 weeks for 2-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically proven newly diagnosed or relapsed non-Hodgkin's
        lymphoma (NHL) of 1 of the following types: Low grade (diffuse small lymphocytic/marginal
        zone, grade I follicular small cleaved cell, or grade II follicular mixed cell) OR Mantle
        cell OR Histologically proven newly diagnosed or relapsed stage III or IV chronic
        lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) At least 1 measurable disease
        parameter Enlarged spleen extending at least 2 cm below the costal margin constitutes
        measurable disease provided that no explanation other than lymphomatous involvement is
        likely Enlarged liver extending at least 5 cm below the costal margin constitutes
        measurable disease Not allowable as sole indication for therapy: Isolated splenomegaly OR
        Isolated hepatomegaly No central nervous system (CNS) metastases or carcinomatous
        meningitis A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by
        PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former
        terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses
        the former terminology.
