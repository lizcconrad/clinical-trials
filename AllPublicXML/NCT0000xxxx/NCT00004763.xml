      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the beneficial effects of leuprolide depot, oral contraceptive therapy, and
      leuprolide/oral contraceptive therapy in the management of patients with ovarian

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomly assigned to a 6-month
      course of leuprolide versus ethinyl estradiol/norethindrone (Ovcon 35) versus leuprolide plus
      Ovcon 35. Leuprolide is administered intramuscularly in depot form every 28 days.
