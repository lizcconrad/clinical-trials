      To determine how much of a dose is absorbed by the body when zalcitabine ( dideoxycytidine;
      ddC ) is given orally and how long the drug stays in the body after absorption or intravenous
      (IV) administration.

      Laboratory tests have shown that ddC is effective in stopping the growth of the HIV in test
      tubes. The study will reveal the pharmacokinetic (blood levels) properties of this new drug
      and how long the drug remains in the body at each of six doses. This should be useful
      background information and should allow a simple and efficient comparative study of any new
      oral formulation, such as a tablet or capsule, since dose-related problems will already be
      known.

      oral formulation, such as a tablet or capsule, since dose-related problems will already be
      known.

      Patients are hospitalized and receive ddC twice, once by mouth and once by IV injection. Each
      patient receives the drug at one of six increasing doses, and no patient is studied at more
      than one dose level. Following each dose, toxicity is measured before the next higher dose is
      given. Several blood samples and urine specimens are taken to permit measurement of the
      amount of drug in the bloodstream and of the speed with which it is eliminated from the body.
