  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct experiments to examine subjective and reinforcing
      effects of nitrous oxide. Mood altering and psychomotor effects will be tested on non-drug
      abusers and preference procedures will be used to assess reinforcing effects. Comparisons
      between nitrous oxide, opiates, and benzodiazepine antagonists will be made. To evaluate the
      role of instructions in nitrous oxide subjective effects and choice.

    <time_frame>After 30 min inhalation of each</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects inhaled placebo and varying per centages of nitrous oxide in sampling pair, then chose for third inhalation. One group was told which of the gases they were inhaling during sampling and one group as well as the technician administering the inhalant was blinded. Psychomotor tests were done at each dose.</description>
