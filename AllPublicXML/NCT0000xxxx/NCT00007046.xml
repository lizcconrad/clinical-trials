      OBJECTIVES: I. Identify and characterize the gene causing diaphyseal medullary stenosis with
      malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the bone.

      II. Determine the clinical manifestations of this disease in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Blood samples are obtained from affected individuals and their family
      members after genetic counseling. Genetic linkage analysis is performed on these blood
      samples. Unaffected individuals undergo x-rays and technetium bone scans to detect the
      presence of bone disease. Affected individuals undergo bone densitometry, MRI studies,
      thallium scans, ophthalmologic examination, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and skin
      biopsies.

      Affected family members identified after radiologic studies receive additional genetic
      counseling.
