      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Chemotherapy drugs may have different effects in patients with
      different degrees of kidney function.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of LY231514 in treating patients who have
      locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and varying degrees of kidney function.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxic effects and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LY231514 in
      patients with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors and varying degrees of renal
      function. II. Determine the recommended dose for LY231514 in this patient population. III.
      Examine the effects of renal dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics of LY231514 in this patient
      population. IV. Examine the relationship between impaired renal function, drug exposure, and
      drug effects in these patients. V. Gather data for development of a LY231514 dosing nomogram
      based on renal function. VI. Collect preliminary data regarding antitumor effects of LY231514
      in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients are stratified according to
      renal function. Group 1 consists of patients with normal renal function, and groups 2, 3, and
      4 consist of patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment. All patients receive
      LY231514 IV over 10 minutes every 3 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated with escalating
      doses of LY231514 within each treatment group. If dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed in
      1 of 3 patients at a given dose level, then 3 additional patients are studied. The maximum
      tolerated dose is defined as the dose level at which less than 2 of 6 patients experience
      DLT. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
