      BACKGROUND:

      It has been well recognized for years that the survival rates among African-Americans with
      chronic diseases are reduced compared to their white counterparts. Recently attention has
      focussed on racial disparities in survival with chronic cardiovascular diseases. Prior to the
      widespread availability of coronary arteriography, African-Americans were thought to have a
      very low incidence of coronary artery disease. These findings appear to be inconsistent with
      the now generally accepted view that the coronary artery disease mortality rate is nearly
      equal in United States Black and white men and is increased in Black women as compared to
      white women.

      Howard University and Howard University Hospital provided a unique environment for studying
      the clinical cardiovascular outcomes of African-Americans, in light of its history. That is,
      due to the influx of blacks into the District of Columbia in 1862, Freedmen's Hospital (which
      is now known as Howard University Hospital) was established for their care. Howard University
      Hospital has had an admissions profile with greater than 95 percent African-Americans for the
      past century

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study used previously collected data to: 1) examine the trends in mortality rates at
      Howard University Hospital, based on discharge status, between 1986 - 1992, for selected
      cardiovascular diseases; 2) compare cardiovascular mortality rate trends between Howard
      University Hospital and the National Hospital Discharge data; 3) examine cardiovascular co-
      morbidity experiences using a severity of illness index at Howard University Hospital
      compared to National data by race/ethnicity, geographic location and hospital bed size; and
      4) identify a cohort of cardiovascular patients retrospectively based on repeated discharge
      data at Howard University Hospital, to analyze survival data.
