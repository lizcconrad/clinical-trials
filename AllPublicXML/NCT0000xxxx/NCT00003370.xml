      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of irofulven in treating children with recurrent or
      refractory solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells so
      they stop growing or die.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of
      6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (MGI-114) in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory solid
      tumors.

      II. Determine the incidence and severity of other toxic effects of MGI-114. III. Determine a
      safe and tolerable dose of MGI-114 to be used in phase II studies.

      IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of MGI-114 in these patients. V. Determine preliminary
      evidence of antitumor activity of MGI-114 against recurrent or refractory pediatric solid
      tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. If the dose limiting toxicity is myelosuppression
      in stratum 1, then stratum 1 is closed and stratum 2 opens.

      Stratum 2 consists of the following: patients receiving no more than 2 prior chemotherapy
      regimens; patients who have not received prior central axis radiation or bone marrow
      transplantation; and patients with no known bone marrow involvement. Patients receive
      intravenous 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene over 10 minutes daily for 5 days. The course is
      repeated every 28 days unless disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects are observed.
      Patients with stable or responding disease may receive up to 1 year of therapy. If dose
      limiting toxicity occurs in 2 of 6 patients at a given dose level, then dose escalation
      ceases and the next lower dose is declared the maximum tolerated dose. Dose escalation will
      not occur until all patients within a cohort have been observed for 28 days from day 1 of
      therapy. Patients are followed until death.
