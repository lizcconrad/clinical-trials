      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-188797 and carboplatin in treating
      patients who have advanced nonhematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose based on the maximum tolerated dose of
           BMS-188797 when administered with carboplatin in patients with advanced nonhematologic
           malignancies.

        -  Assess the dose limiting toxicities and safety of this treatment regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine any antitumor activity of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of BMS-188797.

      Patients receive BMS-188797 IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day
      1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-188797 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicities.

      Patients are followed for 4 weeks, and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 35 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months.
