      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide in
      treating patients who have stage IV colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the antitumor activity and toxicities of chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide
      in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide IV over
      1 hour weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for at least 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months.
