      To conduct a prospective study aimed at the early detection and treatment of cerebral
      vascular disease prior to irreversible brain injury in young children with sickle cell anemia

      BACKGROUND:

      Cerebral infarction is a major contributor to childhood morbidity and mortality in sickle
      cell anemia (SCA)

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The investigators tested the hypotheses that young children with SCA experienced a variable
      period of asymptomatic progressive central nervous system (CNS) vasculopathy prior to
      cerebral infarction; that pre-infarct CNS vasculopathy could be identified by non-invasive
      imaging techniques:MRI, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and transcranial Doppler (TCD);
      and that therapeutic intervention at this stage of the disease could significantly reduce the
      subsequent occurrence of cerebral infarction. MRI, MRA, TCD, and standardized neurologic and
      psychometric examinations were performed yearly in a cohort of homozygous Hb SS children
      enrolled at 2-4 years of age. Subjects without MRI evidence of cerebral infarction who had
      significant cerebral vasculopathy (cerebral arterial stenosis on MRA and/or elevated blood
      flow velocity on TCD) were randomized to receive either no therapy or chronic transfusion
      therapy, in order to determine the risk of subsequent cerebral infarction in untreated
      subjects with these abnormalities, and the extent to which transfusion therapy could
      significantly reduce the risk. Subjects with evidence of prior cerebral infarction on MRI,
      whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, were randomized to receive either chronic transfusion
      therapy alone ('standard therapy') or chronic transfusion therapy plus ticlopidine, in order
      to determine whether ticlopidine could significantly increase the efficacy of standard
      therapy in preventing recurrent cerebral infarction in SCA. Subjects with prior cerebral
      infarction were also offered the option of bone marrow transplantation if an HLA-identical
      non-SS sibling donor was available.
