      To evaluate the effects of a new statewide program to enhance identification, referral and
      provision of care to rural families of Hispanic children with moderately severe to severe
      asthma. Specifically, to determine if comprehensive medical care (CMC) plus an educational
      self-management program for rural Hispanic children and their families had an impact on
      asthma morbidity, as well as on cost and family adaptation.

      BACKGROUND:

      Because of New Mexico's large rural and heavily Hispanic population, it was an ideal setting
      to determine effective methods for case management, self-management educational programs and
      effective tertiary to primary care delivery collaboration.

      The study was part of a demonstration and education initiative &quot;Interventions for Control of
      Asthma Among Black and Hispanic Children&quot; which was released by the NHLBI in June 1989.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A randomized block design was used with random assignment of subjects by county to treatment
      groups of 1. comprehensive medical care or standard tertiary care and education, or 2.
      CMC-Plus adding a structured self-management program--Open Airways/Respiro Abierto (developed
      and tested with support of NHLBI). CMC-Plus also received in home education and intervention
      from community based Hispanic family educators trained in an empowerment model of family
      intervention, in-home support, and education. Case management was provided by CMS; CMC and
      CMC-Plus were provided at the UNM-PPP in close collaboration with and transfer of care to the
      primary physician. Additional educational contact with primary care providers and emergency
      rooms were provided through the UNM Department of Family, Community &amp; Emergency Medicine
      which utilized the National Institutes of Health National Asthma Education Program's
      Guidelines for Step-Wise Care of Asthma. Asthma morbidity, cost of care, family adaptation
      and family satisfaction were evaluated using standardized instruments.
