  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a high-quality protein food supplement will
      help HIV-positive patients maintain, and possibly gain, muscle mass.

      Many HIV-positive patients lose weight that they are then unable to regain. This may be
      because patients are not eating enough protein or are not eating the right kinds of protein.
      The protein eaten in foods (such as meat, eggs, or beans) may not be able to make up for the
      amount of protein lost due to HIV infection. This study gives patients high-quality protein
      food supplements to help them maintain and/or gain weight.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In many HIV-infected individuals with prior weight loss, the failure to regain weight and
      lean tissue is at least in part the consequence of inadequate protein intake or ingestion of
      a poor-quality protein rather than total caloric intake. Dietary sources of protein are
      presumably inadequate to meet the high metabolic needs caused by HIV infection. To achieve a
      target protein intake in the range (1.5 to 2.0 g/kg/day) demonstrated in other catabolic
      diseases necessary to achieve positive nitrogen balance and to generate substantial anabolic
      effects, this study will administer a supplement containing high-quality protein.

      Two groups of 28 patients each are randomly chosen to receive either an oral nutritional
      supplement (Optimune) containing increased amounts of high-quality protein (whey), which is
      rich in cysteine and glutamine, or an isocaloric, identical-tasting supplement without added
      whey protein or amino acid supplementation. Weight, body composition, anthropometry, dietary
      intake, and general physical health are assessed at baseline and at Weeks 6 and 12. Plasma
      cysteine, glutathione, C-reactive protein, and prealbumin, along with urine IL-6, sTNFrII,
      and IL-1ra, are assessed at baseline and at Week 12.
