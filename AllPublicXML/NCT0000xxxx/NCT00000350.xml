  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether DAT availability, assessed by WIN binding,
      in the striatum is altered in cocaine or methamphetamine dependence. To determine whether DA
      synthesis capacity, assessed by FDOPA uptake, in the striatum is altered in Coc or Meth
      dependence. To determine whether the PET tracers, WIN or FDOPA, will differentiate Meth
      induced alterations from those induced by Coc use. To determine whether the PET
      characterization of striatal alterations observed at 3-5 days since last drug use persists at
      least 3 months after last drug use.

      4-5 Day inpatient study. Participant will have scanned pictures (MRI &amp; PET scans) taken of
      their brain after being injected with a small amount of WIN, a radioactive substance.
      Participants give daily urine samples and fill out health related questionnaires. It is
      important to determine whether the alterations characterized within one week of last drug use
      persist over a longer time period. Based on results of the studies from aims 1 &amp; 2, we will
      decide which of the 2 probes, WIN or FDOPA-PET is the more sensitive index of
      stimulant-dependency-induced changes.
