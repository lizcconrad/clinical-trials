      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as lymph node mapping and biopsy, may improve the
      ability to detect the extent of colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to study the feasibility of lymph node mapping and sentinel lymph
      node biopsy in patients who have stage I, stage II, or stage III colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility of lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy
      in patients with stage I, II, or III colorectal cancer. II. Evaluate technetium Tc 99m sulfur
      colloid as a mapping agent in this patient population. III. Identify patients with
      histologically negative nodes but have positive nodes on further detailed examination.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo preoperative endoscopy with injection of technetium Tc 99m sulfur
      colloid around tumor followed by celiotomy and intraabdominal exploration. At 30 minutes
      following injection, patients undergo lymphatic mapping with a gamma probe and biopsy of the
      sentinel lymph node(s). Following biopsy and mapping, patients undergo resection of primary
      tumor. Patients are followed postoperatively, every 4-6 months for 2 years, every 6 months
      for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
