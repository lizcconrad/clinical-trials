    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to: a) evaluate the effectiveness of ondansetron (Zofran) in the
      treatment of alcohol dependent patients; b) investigate whether early versus late onset
      alcoholism predicts treatment outcome; and c) determine whether the early and late onset
      groups respond differently to treatment. Individuals will be &quot;typed&quot; into early onset and
      late onset alcoholism groups. Individuals will be randomly assigned to a 12-week outpatient
      treatment program.
