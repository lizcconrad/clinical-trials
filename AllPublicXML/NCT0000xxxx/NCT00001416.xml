      The purpose of this study is to examine how the skeleton responds to repeated doses of enzyme
      replacement therapy in patients with type I Gaucher's disease who have had their spleens
      removed.

      Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disease resulting from glycocerebroside accumulation
      in macrophages due to a genetic deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. It may occur in
      adults but occurs most severely in infants, in whom cerebroside also accumulates in neurons.
      Patients with Gaucher's disease experience enlargement of the liver and spleen and bone
      destruction. The condition is passed from generation to generation through autosomal
      recessive inheritance.

      Type I is the most common form. It is a chronic non-neuronopathic form, meaning the disease
      does not affect nerve cells. The symptoms of type I can appear at any age.

      In this study patients will be divided into three groups. Each group will receive different
      doses of enzyme replacement (Ceredase). In addition, two of the three groups will also
      receive doses of a form of vitamin D (calcitriol). Researchers believe the groups receiving
      vitamin D will have an improved response as compared to those patients only receiving enzyme
      replacement.

      Patients in each group who respond to enzyme replacement with increases in bone density will
      be compared to the other treatment groups.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the response of the skeleton to repeated infusions of
      macrophage-targeted glucocerebrosidase (CEREDASE (Trademark) ) in splenectomized patients
      with type I Gaucher's disease. The magnitude and rate of development of the skeletal response
      will be monitored non-invasively. Theoretically, an enhanced response should occur in
      patients supplemented with pharmacologic doses of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol),
      since calcium absorption and enzyme delivery to bone marrow macrophages should be increased
      in this setting. These issues will be addressed in a clinical trial that uses a modified
      factorial design. A total of 57 patients will be assigned to three treatment groups by block
      randomization.

      Group 1: CEREDASE (Trademark) (60 IU/kg q2wks; 0-6 months)

      CEREDASE (Trademark) (30 IU/kg q2wks; 7-24 months)

      Group 2: Calcitriol (0.25-3.0 micrograms/day; 0-24 months)

      CEREDASE (Trademark) (60 IU/kg q2wks; 7-12 months)

      CEREDASE (Trademark) (30 IU/kg q2wks; 13-24 months)

      Group 3: Calcitriol (0.25-3.0 micrograms/day; 0-24 months)

      CEREDASE (Trademark) (60 IU/kg q2wks; 0-6 months)

      CEREDASE (Trademark) (30 IU/kg q2wks; 7-24 months)

      The number of patients responding to enzyme replacement with a significant decrease in
      hepatic volume and a significant increase in trabecular bone density of the lumbar spine will
      be compared between the treatment groups.
