  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell anemia is the most common genetic disease affecting African-Americans. About 1 in
      every 1000 African-Americans has the disease and 1 in every 12 carry the genes that could be
      passed on to their children. People with sickle cell anemia have abnormal hemoglobin, the
      molecules responsible for carrying oxygen in the blood. The abnormal hemoglobin can cause
      damage to the red blood cells. The damaged red blood cell may then stick in the blood vessels
      and cause pain and injury to organs. Some of the complications caused by the sticking of
      blood cells are called acute pain crisis and acute chest syndrome (ACS).

      Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas that has been proposed as a possible therapy for the ACS
      complication of sickle cell anemia. Studies have shown that NO may favorably affect sickle
      cell hemoglobin molecules, thereby improving blood flow through small vessels.

      This study is designed to evaluate the effects of NO, when taken in combination with a drug
      called nitroglycerin on patients with sickle cell anemia and normal volunteers. The effects
      of these two drugs only last while the patient is receiving them. Researchers hope the
      information learned from this study will help to develop new therapies for sickle cell
      anemia.

    <textblock>
      Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder and the most common genetic disease
      affecting African-Americans. Approximately 0.15% of African-Americans are homozygous for
      sickle cell disease, and 8% have sickle cell trait. Acute pain crisis and acute chest
      syndrome (ACS) are common complications of sickle cell anemia. Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) has
      been proposed as a possible therapy for the ACS. Anecdotally, NO has been described to
      rapidly improve the hypoxemia and the clinical course of the ACS. Furthermore, a number of
      recent studies have suggested that NO may have a favorable impact on sickle hemoglobin at the
      molecular level and could improve the abnormal microvascular perfusion that is characteristic
      of sickle cell anemia.

      This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the physiologic and molecular effects of inhaled
      NO and a currently available, safe, FDA-approved medication, nitroglycerin, that is a nitric
      oxide donor (i.e., a source of NO after metabolism in the body), in study subjects with and
      without sickle cell anemia. Whole blood will be analyzed to characterize the metabolism of NO
      and NO donors, the molecular interactions between hemoglobin and NO, the duration of effect
      of these therapies on hemoglobin oxygen affinity and other properties of the erythrocyte and
      intracellular hemoglobin (including the solubility of deoxy sickle hemoglobin).

      We also plan to characterize the effect of NO delivery on microvascular perfusion in study
      subjects with and without sickle cell anemia. Measurements in study subjects will be made
      prior to and while receiving either NO, nitroglycerin, or placebo. These perfusion
      measurements will occur at rest and during concentric dorsiflexion exercise. Magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) of lower extremity skeletal muscle enhancement during first passage
      of intravenously injected gadolinium contrast will be used to evaluate regional skeletal
      muscle perfusion. Perfusion measurements will be paired with a [31]Phosphorus Magnetic
      Resonance Spectroscopy ([31]P-MRS) study of the concentration of muscle high energy phosphate
      compounds. Changes in their levels reflect the energy state of muscle and are dependent on
      the adequacy of blood flow.

      This study will allow three major assessments: firstly, the characterization of the
      microvascular perfusion at rest and during exercise in study subjects with sickle cell
      anemia. Secondly, the effects of NO on red cell and hemoglobin function and skeletal muscle
      perfusion in normal study subjects (without sickle cell anemia), and finally, the effects of
      NO on red cell and hemoglobin function and skeletal muscle perfusion in study subjects with
      sickle cell anemia. Our hypothesis is that one or more of these effects could be of potential
      therapeutic benefit to sickle cell anemia patients.
