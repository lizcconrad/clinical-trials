      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an androgen replacement hormone,
      for patients with primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease).

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by age.

      Patients are randomly assigned to androgen replacement therapy with daily
      dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or placebo for 6 months. All patients may receive 6 additional
      months of DHEA following randomized therapy.

      Women on hormonal replacement therapy may receive concurrent conjugated estrogens or oral
      medroxyprogesterone.
