  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether an HIV vaccine, ALVAC vCP205, is safe and can
      prevent HIV infection. The vCP205 vaccine will be tested with another vaccine, gp160MN/LAI-2.

      This study consists of 2 parts:

      Part A: Dose-escalation protocol using oligomeric gp160MN/LAI-2. Part B: Placebo-controlled,
      randomized, double-blind (within arm) study of vCP205 priming with gp160MN/LAI-2 boosting.

      Volunteers are followed for at least 1 year.
