  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to examine the utility of behavioral economics for
      understanding reinforcer interactions as they pertain to drug self-administration. In a
      series of 6 experiments, the researchers will attempt to quantify the effects of
      qualitatively different reinforcers (money, cigarettes, alcohol, nicotine gum) and their
      interactions. This work represents a continuation of research by this investigator in the
      area of addiction and pharmacology.
