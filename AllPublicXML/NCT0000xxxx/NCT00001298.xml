  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue has demonstrated activity in numerous
      malignancies. Although high dose methotrexate is generally well tolerated, unpredictable
      life-threatening toxicity can occur. For patients who have markedly delayed clearance of
      methotrexate secondary to renal dysfunction, therapeutic options are few and are of limited
      efficacy. Carboxypeptidase-G2 inactivates methotrexate by hydrolyzing its C-terminal
      glutamate residue. Carboxypeptidase-G2 could be used to rescue patients with renal
      dysfunction and delayed methotrexate excretion, as it provides an alternative to renal
      clearance as a route of elimination.

        Patients of any age at risk for life-threatening toxicity following MTX administration
        secondary to delayed drug excretion as defined by:

        Plasma MTX concentration at least 10 micromoles/liter more than 42 hours after the start of
        the MTX infusion; OR

        Creatinine at least 1.5 times the upper limit of normal or creatinine clearance less than
        60 ml/sqm/min and delayed MTX excretion documented by plasma MTX concentration measurements
        (at least 2 standard deviations above the mean) at least 12 hours following MTX
