      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of CC-1088 in treating patients who have
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has not responded to previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity of CC-1088 in patients with refractory, progressive,
      B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. II. Determine the response rate to this treatment in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral CC-1088 three times a day for 28 days. Treatment continues in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-20 patients will be accrued for this study.
