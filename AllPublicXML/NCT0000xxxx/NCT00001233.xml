  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A conduct disorder is characterized by repetitive and persistent patterns of behavior where
      the basic rights of others and rules are violated.

      This study investigates characteristics of children and their surroundings (environments)
      that place them at risk for the development of disruptive behavior disorders and associated
      disorders of anxiety and mood. Children ages 4 - 5 with moderate (subclinical) and severe
      (clinical) rates of misconduct during the preschool period are compared to low risk children.
      Children and their families were recruited from 1989-1991 and are being studied at five
      specific times:

        1. Preschool (4 - 5 years)

        2. Early childhood (6 - 7 years)

        3. Middle childhood (9 - 10 years)

        4. Early adolescence (13 - 14 years)

        5. Mid-adolescence (15 - 16 years)

      Researchers will look closely at biological, intellectual, emotional, and behavioral factors
      that are thought to protect against and/or increase the risk of developing a conduct problem.
      These factors have been studied in older children and are shown to be associated with
      disruptive behavior disorders.

      The goals of this research study are;

        1. Create a database showing the characteristics of the development of disruptive behavior
           problems.

        2. Identify the key risk and protective factors that contribute to the stability or change
           in behavior problems over time.

        3. Identify the ways that children interact socially and relate them to the possibility of
           developing a problem of behavior.

        4. Identify how experiences and the emotions associated with experiences may play a role in
           the development of related psychiatric conditions, like depression and anxiety.

        5. Establish measures of the different components of negative emotions associated with
           disruptive/antisocial, anxiety, and mood disorders.

      This study investigates characteristics of children and their environments that place them at
      risk for the development of disruptive behavior disorders and co-morbid internalizing
      problems (anxiety and mood disorders). Children ages 4-5 with moderate (subclinical) and high
      (clinical) rates of misconduct during the preschool period are compared with low risk
      children. Children and their families are studied again at four later time points: (a) early
      childhood (6-7 yrs.), (b) middle childhood (9-10 yrs.), (c) early adolescence (13-14 yrs.),
      and (d) mid-adolescence (15-16 yrs.). Assessments of children include dimensions of
      biological, cognitive, affective, emotional and behavioral functioning, that have been
      identified in research with older children as putative risk and protective factors in the
      development of conduct problems. Socialization experiences within and outside the family,
      also hypothesized to influence developmental trajectories are examined. Currently, Time 4
      assessments are being conducted, with three-quarters of the research subjects tested.
      Behavior problems show significant stability across the first three time periods. However,
      some children improve over time, changes that result, in part, from more optimal
      environmental conditions. Different patterns of emotion dysregulation, ANS, and HPA activity
      in antisocial preschool children predict different types of externalizing problems at later
      time points. Behavior problems and their correlates differ for young disruptive boys and
      girls: Oppositional, aggressive girls are more likely to have co-morbid internalizing
      problems, and emotion regulation patterns that may decrease risk for continued antisocial
      behavior, but increase risk for depression and anxiety later in development.
