      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Giving drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of cisplatin and epinephrine administered
      directly into the tumor in treating patients who have primary liver cancer that cannot be
      removed during surgery.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety and efficacy of cisplatin-epinephrine injectable gel
      (Intradose MPI-5010) in patients with unresectable primary hepatocellular carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, two stage, multicenter study. Patients receive intratumoral
      treatment with ciplatin-epinephrine (MPI-5010) once weekly, for up to four treatments within
      a six week period, followed by an evaluation two weeks after last treatment. Immediately
      after the first course, an optional second course of treatment may be undertaken at the
      discretion of the investigator. Patients with a complete response, partial response, and/or
      an increase in necrosis of at least 30% of total treated tumor volume will be followed
      monthly for up to 6 months. At the completion of 6 months follow up or following
      documentation of disease progression or development of new tumors, patients are monitored for
      survival in an extended follow up period. All nonresponders at the last 2 week posttreatment
      evaluation are entered in the extended follow up and monitored monthly for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 55 patients will be accrued for this study.
