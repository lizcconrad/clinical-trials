      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's cancer cells may make the body build an immune
      response to and kill tumor cells. Combining vaccine therapy with surgery may be an effective
      treatment for pancreatic cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients
      with stage I or stage II pancreatic cancer that has been surgically removed.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Study the safety of autologous tumor derived gp96 heat shock protein peptide
      complex (HSPPC-96) in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma. II. Examine the
      immune response to HSPPC-96 in this group of patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Six weeks after surgery patients are given
      autologous tumor derived gp96 heat shock protein peptide complex (HSPPC-96) subcutaneously
      once a week for 4 weeks. Five patients are initially enrolled at each of two dose levels. An
      additional three patients may be enrolled at each dose level to determine the optimal dose of
      HSPPC-96. Patients are followed at weeks 1, 4, and 12 after treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 16 patients will be accrued for this study.
