  <brief_title>The Effectiveness of Two Anti-HIV Treatments in HIV-Infected Patients</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase II Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of the Virologic Effect of Two Different Nucleoside Treatment Strategies (Zidovudine Versus Zidovudine in Combination With Didanosine) for HIV Infection in Subjects With CD4+ Counts &gt;= 550 Cells/mm3</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effects of zidovudine (AZT) alone and in combination with didanosine (ddI)
      on viral load in the lymphoid tissue and blood of antiretroviral-naive, HIV-infected patients
      with CD4 counts greater than or equal to 550 cells/mm3.

      Recent studies have shown that during the asymptomatic phase (clinical latency) of HIV
      infection, there is an extraordinarily large number of infected CD4+ lymphocytes and
      macrophages throughout the lymphoid system, both in latent and productive states. These
      findings support the belief that early intervention therapy with reverse transcriptase
      inhibitors could prolong the clinical latency period.

      Patients are randomized to receive AZT alone, AZT plus ddI, or no therapy (placebo) daily for
      48 weeks. Patients are followed at weeks 2, 4, and 8, and then every 8 weeks thereafter until
      week 48.
