      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the role of genetics in pain sensitivity.
      Pain perception varies widely among individuals, and information gained from this trial may
      lead to better methods of preventing and controlling pain. The study consists of two parts,
      described below. All enrollees will participate in part 1; patients needing oral surgery for
      removal of third molars may also participate in part 2.

      Normal volunteers, oral surgery patients, and family members of both groups may be eligible
      for this study.

      Part 1 -Sensitivity testing for hot and cold. Participants will rate their pain response to
      hot and cold stimuli on a scale from &quot;no pain&quot; to the &quot;worst pain imaginable.&quot; Heat
      sensitivity is measured using a small probe placed on the skin for a few seconds. The hottest
      temperature tested may cause pain for a few seconds but will not produce a burn. Response to
      cold is measured by placing the hand in cold water for up to 3 minutes and occasionally
      flexing the fist. Participants will rate their pain level every 15 seconds. In addition to
      the testing, a blood sample will be drawn to examine for genes related to pain.

      Part 2 - Oral surgery. Patients will have their third molar removed under a local anesthetic
      (lidocaine) injected in the mouth and a sedative (Versed) given through a vein in the arm. A
      small tissue biopsy will be taken from the tissue over one of the third molars. Patients will
      stay in the clinic for up to 7 hours after surgery while the anesthetic wears off and will
      rate any pain they may have according to the rating scale used in Part 1 of the study. Pain
      medication (ketorolac, or Toradol) will be given when needed, and patients will complete pain
      questionnaires for 3 hours after the drug is given to rate its effectiveness. Patients will
      receive additional pain relievers, if needed. A second biopsy on the side opposite the first
      will be taken under local anesthetic to measure changes in chemical signals produced in
      response to the surgery.

      Variability in pain sensitivity is a well known phenomena. Clinicians involved in the care of
      post-surgical patients are very familiar with this variation in sensitivity. The variability
      also extends to experimental pain stimuli (e.g., a thermal pulse to the forearm) and can be
      demonstrated with normal volunteers. In our clinic, variation in the intensity and onset of
      acute pain in the oral surgery model, in subjects matched for similar levels of tissue injury
      ranges from little or no post-operative pain to reports of severe pain unrelieved by standard
      analgesics. While a variety of factors may account for the variability such as race or gender
      (Gordon 1998), preclinical data indicate that genetic factors profoundly influence pain
      sensitivity. Thus, the proposed study seeks to investigate genetic contributions to acute
      experimental and clinical post-operative pain. We have recently shown a strong correspondence
      between pain reports using thermal heat stimuli and post-operative pain reports. This
      observation has given us an important quantitative screening tool for genetic analysis of a
      moderate-sized cohort of subjects that has direct clinical relevance. Normal subjects and
      their siblings and/or parents will undergo two somatosensory tests to determine pain
      phenotype and will provide a blood sample which will be analyzed for genetic polymorphisms
      contributing to sensitivity to pain. Some of these subjects will also be candidates for the
      oral surgery protocol and similar pain ratings will be obtained from them post-operatively.
      The initial study will examine known polymorphisms for candidate genes that code for pain
      sensing and pain suppressing molecules.
