  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to allow researchers to use transelectrical stimulation to explore the
      function of the human nervous system and improve diagnosis of neurological disorders.

      Transcranial electrical stimulation is a non-invasive technique that can be used to stimulate
      brain activity and gather information about brain function. Electrical stimulation involves
      placing electrodes on the scalp or skin and passing an electrical current between them. When
      this is done, an electrical field is created that activates areas of the brain that control
      muscles. Muscle activity as a result of the stimulation can be recorded and analyzed.

      This protocol application is written to permit us to use transcranial electrical stimulation,
      a safe and noninvasive method for activating the brain, spinal cord, or proximal nerves
      through the skin, in appropriate subjects. We will use this technique to explore the function
      of the human central and peripheral nervous system and to aid in the diagnosis of
      neurological disorders.

      <textblock>
        Males and females, ages 18 and over.

        Diverse racial groups.

        Amputees and others with whom we will have no patient-care relationship may also be
        considered to be volunteers.

        Patients will be recruited from those referred to the Human Motor Control Section, NINDS
        who have neurological syndromes that are of interest.

        On rare occasions we may attempt to study children as young as 10 years with TES.

        Individuals without indwelling cardiac lines and pacemakers.

        Patients recruited for study would come from those referred to the EMG laboratory and to
        the Human Motor Control Clinic who would have distinct neurologic syndromes from well
        defined peripheral and central nervous system lesions including hemiplegia from stroke,
        trauma, tumor or focal demyelination (most commonly patients would have hemiplegia from
        stroke), peripheral nerve lesions, amputations, spinal cord injury.

        Normal volunteers, including NIH employees, would be healthy adults without history of
        physical examination evidence of neurologic disease and individuals with different types of
        amputations involving upper and lower extremities.

        Volunteers may also be participants in the electrophysiological protocol (84-N-0196).

        No history of epilepsy.
