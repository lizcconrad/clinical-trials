  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if giving azidothymidine (AZT) to HIV-positive patients
      with hemophilia is safe and if it is effective in lowering HIV levels and boosting the immune
      system.

      HIV infects and inactivates certain blood cells that are part of the body's immune system.
      The damage to the body's immune system can result in unusual infections and/or unusual forms
      of cancer. A large percentage of hemophiliacs are HIV-positive and there is a clear risk for
      the development of AIDS in these patients. AZT may be effective in lowering HIV levels and
      boosting the immune system but its side effects are not understood in these patients.

      There is a clear risk for development of AIDS in hemophilic patients. AZT administration has
      been shown to inhibit HIV replication in vitro. Patients taking AZT have experienced fewer
      opportunistic infections and improvements in measures of immunity. The most common laboratory
      abnormalities observed with AZT are hematologic. However, the clinical and laboratory
      toxicity of AZT remains poorly understood in hemophiliacs. Hepatitis and liver dysfunction
      are more common in this population compared to other groups at risk for HIV infection.
      Because AZT is largely metabolized in the liver, drug pharmacokinetics needs to be evaluated
      in this patient population.

      Both hemophiliacs and non-hemophiliacs take AZT for a period of 12 weeks. The first dose is
      administered intravenously. AZT is then given orally every 4 hours while awake (5 doses per
      day). Patients are evaluated by physical examinations and laboratory assessments. These
      include HIV culture of blood and leukocyte counts, lymphocyte counts, and lymphocyte subsets
      measured at study entry and every 4 weeks thereafter. Patients are hospitalized for
      pharmacokinetic studies at study entry and at Weeks 6 and 12. Each of these studies involves
      both intravenous and oral administration within 48 hours of one another. Blood is sampled at
      0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after each administration and urine is collected
      every 2 hours for 12 hours.
