    <textblock>
      Limited research has been done on the effects of gender and menstrual cycle in response to
      drugs of abuse in humans. The main goal of this pilot study is to investigate the safety and
      tolerability of progesterone treatment in female nicotine users. In addition, plasma
      progesterone levels reached with a single 200 mg dose of progesterone treatment will be
      measured. The study will be a double-blind placebo controlled, crossover trial in which 12
      female smokers who are in the early follicular phase of their menstrual cycle will be
      enrolled. Druing the experimental sessions, subjects will be given a single 200 mg dose of
      micronized progesterone or placebo and multiple blood samples will be obtained to measure the
      plasma levels of progesterone. Starting 2 hours after progesterone or placebo treatment,
      subjects will have a self-administration period that will last around 2.5 hours. We
      hypothesize that administration of 200 mg of progesterone will achieve plasma progesterone
      concentrations similar to those found in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, 3-30 ng/ml.
