      RATIONALE: Examining biomarkers in abnormal cervical cells may improve the ability to detect
      these cells and plan effective treatment.

      PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to detect specific biomarkers in abnormal cervical cells in women
      who have abnormal Pap test results.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the detection of transferrin receptor, epidermal growth factor
      receptor, and the MaTu-MN protein in exfoliated cervical epithelial cells from women with
      abnormal Pap test using fluorescent labeled antibody probe vs histology.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a Pap test and a colposcopy. Cervical epithelial cells are
      collected from the most abnormal appearing lesion. Cells are examined for molecular markers
      using a fluorescent antibody test. The presence or absence of these markers is compared to
      results of the Pap test and the histology of the cells.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.

        Patients must have a diagnosis of an abnormal Pap test, performed as part of standard of
        care screening in the clinic. The patient's informed consent will be obtained during their
        initial interview with the clinic physician.
