      This protocol is being submitted to consolidate, update, and expand two previously approved
      protocols (77-C-0066 and 82-C-0044) into a single protocol. The purpose of this study is to
      examine the factors involved in the regulation of the immune system of healthy individuals
      and to define the abnormalities in this regulation that underlies the immunological disorders
      of patients with a variety of immunodeficiency and malignant disorders. The studies will
      include the ex vivo phenotypic and functional analysis of the network of cells involved in
      humoral and cellular immune responses, and in vivo testing for the capacity to make
      delayed-type hypersensitivity and humoral responses following immunization with a variety of
      antigens. Individuals to be studied will include patients with a variety of malignancies and
      patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiency disorders. Selected family members or
      family members known to be genetic carriers of certain immunodeficiency diseases as well as
      normal, unrelated individuals will also be studied. A small number of procedures will be used
      including analysis of blood obtained by phlebotomy, apheresis, skin testing and recall
      antigens and immunization to assess humoral immunity.

      Background:

        -  The evaluation of the cells of the immune system and HTLV-1 infection have been a
           central focus of the Metabolism Branch for the past 30 years.

        -  Blood obtained by apheresis or blood drawing, skin biopsies and other tissues will be
           evaluated for abnormalities related to immunity, HTLV-1 infection and the immune system.

        -  Advances in the characterization of acquired genetic changes in tumor samples has

      led to insights for the development of targeted therapy of malignancy

      Objective:

        -  To characterize the molecular biology and immunological features as well as the clinical
           course of individuals with suspected or known disorders of the immune system or cancer.

        -  To define the nature of the immunological, genetic and epigenetic abnormalities in the
           cells of patients with immunodeficiency diseases associated with infections and/or a
           high incidence of malignancy and in patients with cancer.

        -  To obtain whole blood, plasma, and leukocytes, as well as skin, lymph node and bone
           marrow biopsies on patients with immunodeficiency or cancer to investigate the immune
           system.

      Eligibility:

        -  Subjects with cancer.

        -  Subjects with immunodeficiency.

        -  Subjects with HTLV-1 infection.

      Design:

      -This is a natural history study that permits tissue acquisition for analysis of the immune
      system and HTLV-1 infection.

    <description>No statistical endpoints are identified for this study; the purpose of the study is to acquire information regarding various immunodeficiency syndromes, HTLV-1 infection and malignancies. The data collected will not be combined for a summary report of the entire study; however, reports for specific disease entities may be published.</description>

        Specific disorders may include but are not limited to:

          -  X-linked (severe combined immunodeficiency)

          -  Autosomal recessive SCID

          -  X-linked CD40 ligand deficiency

          -  Common variable immunodeficiency

          -  Ataxia-telangiectasia

          -  Wiskott Aldrich syndrome

          -  DiGeorge syndrome

          -  Infection with HTLV-1

        Age of birth and above for patients with suspected or known disorders of the immune system
        or cancer.

        Patient (or parent/guardian of a minor child) must be able to understand and sign informed
        consent.

        Patients who will undergo apheresis must have hematocrit greater than 28%, and platelet
        count greater than 50,000.

        Subjects for whom apheresis is desired but whose counts are lower than those above must be
        evaluated and approved by a Department of Transfusion Medicine consult physician.
