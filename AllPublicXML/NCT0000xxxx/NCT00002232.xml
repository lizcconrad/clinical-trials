  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give GENEVAX-HIV, a potential HIV
      vaccine, to HIV-negative volunteers. The study also compares the effects of GENEVAX-HIV
      injected into the muscle to the effects of the drug when injected into the skin.

      Volunteers receive either intradermal or intramuscular injections of GENEVAX-HIV; humoral and
      cellular responses are assessed accordingly.

        Patients must have:

          -  Good health.

             blood-borne infections.

          -  The following parameters within normal range:

          -  Hematopoietic:

          -  total white blood cell, lymphocyte, granulocyte, and platelet count, hemoglobin and
             hematocrit.

          -  Renal:

          -  BUN and creatinine, urinalysis.

          -  Hepatic:

          -  total serum bilirubin.

          -  Endocrine/Metabolic:

          -  Serum calcium, serum glucose, total serum CPK.

          -  Immunologic:

          -  total serum immunoglobulin and absolute CD4 count.

          -  Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C negative.

          -  Urinalysis:

          -  Normal screen with dipstick for esterase and nitrite.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  HIV-seropositive status.

          -  Any positive result for anti-DNA antibodies considered of potential clinical
             significance as measured by anti-DNA antibody and/or anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)
             assays.

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the principal investigator, might interfere
             with completion of the study or evaluation of the results.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to bupivacaine or any amide-type local anesthetic (such as
             lidocaine, dibucaine, mepivacaine, and prilocaine) or a history of anaphylaxis or
             other serious adverse reactions to vaccines.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

        Any medication which may affect immune function with the exception of low doses of
        nonprescription-strength NSAIDS, aspirin, or acetaminophen for acute conditions such as
        headache or trauma.

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  HIV-seropositive.

          -  Known or suspected history of impairment or abnormality in immune functioning.

          -  Exposure to potentially-infective HIV fluids within the prior 6 months or tested
             positive for HIV at any time.

          -  History of any prior disease or therapy which would affect immune function including:

          -  Prior malignancy, except curatively-treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix.

          -  Immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease.

          -  Acute infection or a recent (within 6 months) history of chronic infection.

          -  History of serious allergic reaction to any substance requiring hospitalization or
             emergent medical care (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, bronchospasm, or hypotension).

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

        Cytotoxic chemotherapy that may affect immune function.

        Prior Treatment:

        Excluded:

          -  Previous immunization with any experimental vaccines directed against HIV or receipt
             of any experimental agent within 30 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Receipt of any blood products or immunoglobulin within 6 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Exposure to live attenuated vaccines within 60 days of study.

          -  Radiotherapy that may affect immune function.

        Risk Behavior:

        Excluded:

          -  Active drug or alcohol abuse or uncontrolled (unstable) psychiatric disorders which,
             in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with study participation.
