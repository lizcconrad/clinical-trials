  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the cause and natural history (medical problems that appear over
      time) of certain genetic disorders. It will also try to locate the abnormal genes responsible
      for these conditions and eventually develop tests to predict who is likely to be affected and
      to what degree.

      Patients with known or suspected genetic disorders in certain categories, such as those
      involving chromosomal or metabolic abnormalities, immune system or blood disorders, abnormal
      growth, benign tumors, and others may be eligible for this study. Participants will be
      interviewed by specialists in genetics about their condition and family history. They may
      also be asked to have a physical examination and certain tests needed for study of the
      specific individual's condition. These may include collection of blood samples (up to 3
      tablespoons); imaging studies, such as computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI), ultrasound and echocardiography; skin biopsy (removal of a small sample of
      skin tissue under local anesthetic), and other procedures. DNA testing may reveal the genetic
      abnormality responsible for the disorder. Participants who so wish will have an opportunity
      to talk with experts about the health implications of the test results.

      This study may provide information that will lead to improved treatment or management of
      these inherited disorders, as well as more effective genetic counseling for families.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals and their families affected by disorders with a potentially genetic basis within
      six broad categories will be evaluated over time to characterize the natural and clinical
      history of various specific disorders. Medical and laboratory evaluations will be completed
      to identify areas of management concern that have not been previously described. Further
      protocols will be developed addressing specific disorders once a number of affected
      individuals have been investigated and is sufficient to query various aspects of those
      disorders. Issues for both diagnosis and medical management of those affected with certain
      genetic disorders will be collated and addressed within a national consensus conference
      format. In addition, phenotype to genotype correlation will be established to further
      understanding of specific molecular alterations on phenotypic expression. This broad-based
      protocol will also facilitate the training of fellows in medical genetics, graduate and post
      graduate training in genetics and genetic counseling.
