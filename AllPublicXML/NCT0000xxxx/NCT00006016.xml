  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying the effectiveness of combining thalidomide and
      chemoembolization in treating patients who have liver cancer that cannot be removed by
      surgery. Thalidomide may stop the growth of liver cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.
      Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by blocking the blood flow to the tumor and keeping
      chemotherapy drugs near the tumor. Combining thalidomide with chemoembolization may kill more
      tumor cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility and potential activity of thalidomide in patients with
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who are undergoing chemoembolization to predominant
      tumor masses.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen of these patients. III. Determine the overall
      survival of patients treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the serum levels of vascular
      endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and tumor necrosis factor alpha in
      patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral thalidomide daily beginning 4 weeks before the first planned
      chemoembolization procedure. Thalidomide administration is stopped 24 hours before each
      chemoembolization procedure, and then restarted at 24 hours after completion of each
      procedure OR when blood counts and levels of bilirubin and transaminases recover, whichever
      occurs later. Thalidomide treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo placement of a visceral arterial catheter. Patients receive doxorubicin as a
      chemoemulsion via the arterial catheter into 1 hepatic lobe only under angiographic guidance.
      Immediately after delivery of the chemoemulsion, patients undergo particulate embolization.
      The opposite lobe, if involved, is treated within 3-5 weeks of treatment of the initial lobe.
      Patients are reevaluated for repeat chemoembolization within 8-12 weeks of the last
      chemoembolization. For eligible patients, each lobe is treated separately a second time, in
      the same sequence, in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
