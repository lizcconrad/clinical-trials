      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the toxicity of amifostine in patients with bone marrow failure related to
      Fanconi's anemia.

      II. Determine the efficacy of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

      III. Evaluate the effect of this treatment regimen on bone marrow progenitor cell
      proliferation and peripheral blood mononuclear cell apoptosis in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive amifostine IV over 3-5 minutes three times a week for three weeks.

      Cohorts of 3 patients receive one of three dose levels of amifostine. The maximum tolerated
      dose is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed weekly for 3 weeks.

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics--

        Diagnosis of Fanconi's anemia by conventional diepoxybutane or mitomycin sensitivity
        assays, or molecular testing

        Bone marrow failure verified on at least 3 occasions in the preceding 3 months by any one
        of the following: hemoglobin less than 8 g/dL; absolute neutrophil count less than
        1,000/mm3; platelet count less than 30,000/mm3; symptomatic bone marrow failure (e.g.,
        exercise limitation from anemia or spontaneous bleeding from thrombocytopenia)

        Evidence consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome allowed if less than 5% blasts on bone
        marrow aspiration; clonality on bone marrow cytogenetic analysis OR morphological changes
        on bone marrow aspirate

        Refusal of or unsuccessful with prior conventional therapies

        --Prior/Concurrent Therapy--

        Biologic therapy: No prior bone marrow transplantation; no concurrent hematopoietic growth
        factors

        Endocrine therapy: No concurrent androgens

        --Patient Characteristics--

        Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 2 times normal AST no greater than 3 times normal ALT no
        greater than 6 times normal

        Renal: Creatinine no greater than 2 times normal

        Other: No prior malignancy; no active bacterial, viral, or fungal infection requiring
        therapy other than prophylaxis; not pregnant; negative pregnancy test
