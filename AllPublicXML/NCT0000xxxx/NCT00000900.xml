  <brief_summary>

      To describe the magnitude and duration of changes in HIV-1 RNA levels during and after an
      acute febrile illness. To identify factors associated with increases, i.e., type of illness
      ultimately diagnosed (bacterial, viral, fungal), CD4 cell count, and antiretroviral treatment
      regimen. To describe changes in phenotypic markers of immune activation/dysregulation of CD4
      and CD8 lymphocyte subsets and their relationship to intercurrent illness. To describe
      changes in plasma cytokines and soluble activation markers and their relationship to plasma
      HIV-1 viremia during and after the onset of intercurrent illness. To characterize the viral
      biologic phenotype and the viral drug susceptibility genotype before, during, and after the
      onset of an acute febrile illness. To characterize the expression of HIV-1 co-receptors
      before, during, and after the onset of an acute febrile illness Repeated episodes of
      intercurrent infections have been postulated to be an important stimulus for progression of
      HIV infection. The study of intercurrent illness in patients with initially undetectable
      viral load removes viral load as a possible cause for virologic and immunologic changes and
      allows for a more direct association of the intercurrent illness with changes in viral load,
      viral HIV-1 phenotypes, viral HIV-1 genotypes, and T cell phenotypes. Studying intercurrent
      illness and viral load provides an opportunity to characterize the potentially dynamic
      changes not only in viral load but also in phenotypic markers of T cell activation, plasma
      cytokine levels, phenotypic and genotypic changes in circulating virus, and HIV-1 tropisms.

      Repeated episodes of intercurrent infections have been postulated to be an important stimulus
      for progression of HIV infection. The study of intercurrent illness in patients with
      initially undetectable viral load removes viral load as a possible cause for virologic and
      immunologic changes and allows for a more direct association of the intercurrent illness with
      changes in viral load, viral HIV-1 phenotypes, viral HIV-1 genotypes, and T cell phenotypes.
      Studying intercurrent illness and viral load provides an opportunity to characterize the
      potentially dynamic changes not only in viral load but also in phenotypic markers of T cell
      activation, plasma cytokine levels, phenotypic and genotypic changes in circulating virus,
      and HIV-1 tropisms.

      This is a study to determine whether patients exhibit a temporary burst of viral replication
      or other changes in response to intercurrent febrile illness. Although there is no study
      treatment, patients on this study must be co-enrolled in at least 1 other ACTG antiretroviral
      treatment study. Plasma HIV-1 RNA and other variables are measured at the time of
      presentation, on Day 3, and at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must have:

          -  HIV-1 infection documented by any licensed ELISA test kit and confirmed by either
             Western blot, HIV-1 culture, HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA or a second antibody test
             by a method other than ELISA at any time prior to study entry.

          -  Undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA (by Roche Amplicor Assay) within 8 weeks prior to study
             entry.

          -  Documented temperature above 101degrees F during at least 1 of the 2 days prior to the
             day of screening and present on the day of screening, or documented temperature above
             101 F on the day of the screening but no fever on 1 of the 2 days prior to screening.

             either an ACTG antiretroviral therapy study or a pharmaceutical company-sponsored
             antiretroviral therapy study prior to entry. Co-enrolled in a non-ACTG pharmaceutical
             company-based study must have a baseline viral isolate accessible for use in this
             study.]

          -  Interruption of current antiretroviral therapy due to the onset of acute intercurrent
             illness.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Patients receiving IL-2.

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  Change in antiretroviral therapy combination within 8 weeks prior to study entry.

        Required:

          -  Concurrent enrollment in an ACTG antiretroviral therapy study [or, AS PER AMENDMENT
             7/7/98, in a non-ACTG pharmaceutical company-sponsored antiretroviral treatment
