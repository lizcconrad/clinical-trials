      Tumors of the spine can be described as primary, meaning that the tumor originated from cells
      normally found in the spine, or metastatic, cells from another area of the body that have
      spread to the spine. Metastatic tumors are more common than primary tumors. Tumors of the
      spine can press against the spinal cord and interfere with information traveling down from
      the brain to the nerves of the spinal cord. As a result, patients with spinal tumors can
      suffer from loss of movement and sensation within areas of the body below the tumor. In
      addition, tumors of the spine are typically painful conditions.

      Presently, the treatment of choice for spinal tumors is radiation therapy. However, many
      tumors of the spine become resistant to radiation therapy. In addition, because the spinal
      cord is often so close to the tumor it can be damaged by the radiation.

      Absolute (100%) ethanol is commonly known as &quot;alcohol&quot;. It is the same kind of alcohol found
      in alcoholic beverages. When pure alcohol is injected directly into a tumor it can destroy
      cells and blood vessels. Because of this feature, researchers would like to test the
      effectiveness of alcohol in treating patients with spinal tumors.

      Researchers believe that intratumoral ethanol injection is a treatment worth studying more
      closely because it is minimally invasive, has been proven to be an effective treatment for
      other types of metastatic tumors, can be used repeatedly, and does not interfere with other
      treatments such as surgery.

      In addition to testing the effectiveness of intratumoral ethanol injection, this study will
      attempt to determine the causes of pain associated with spinal tumors.

      Although radiation therapy is currently the treatment of choice for most spinal metastases,
      radioresistant and recurrent neoplasms remain therapeutic dilemmas. Because of the debility
      and shortened life expectancy of patients with spinal metastases, treatment that minimizes
      blood loss, convalescence, and immobility is critical. The effectiveness and safety of
      intratumoral injection of absolute ethanol in eradicating vertebral hemangiomas and hepatic
      metastases suggests that intratumoral ethanol injection may also be effective in treating
      vertebral metastases. Since most spinal metastases can now be diagnosed with MRI before they
      produce spinal instability, it may be possible to treat them with direct ethanol infusion
      while preserving spinal stability. Direct ethanol infusion may prove especially useful in
      treating symptomatic patients who have received maximal tolerable radiation doses to the
      spinal cord. Unlike radiation, which is limited by total radiation dosage, and intraarterial
      alcohol, which precludes multiple treatments by occluding the feeding arteries, intratumoral
      ethanol injection can be repeated as necessary to obliterate residual tumor. The potential
      neurotoxic effects of ethanol can be avoided by using CT-guidance to position the needle, by
      monitoring a test injection with contrast, and by injecting ethanol slowly and in small
      volumes. Intratumoral injection of absolute ethanol warrants a clinical trial because it is
      minimally invasive, has been effective in treating peripheral metastases, can be used
      repeatedly, and does not preclude other types of treatments such as open surgery.

      As well as testing the therapeutic efficacy of intratumoral ethanol for spinal metastasis,
      this protocol seeks to elucidate the pathophysiology of pain from spinal metastasis.
      Correlation of changes in pain with changes in tumor size and tumor pressure pre- and
      post-ethanol injection should indicate the relationship of pain to tumor size and pressure.

      A group of 11 patients with vertebral hemangiomas has been treated with intratumoral ethanol
      at the NIH. This protocol will accrue patients with vertebral hemangiomas who require
      treatment with intratumoral ethanol and will continue the post-treatment evaluation of
      patients previously treated with intratumoral ethanol at the NIH.

        Patients must have a vertebral tumor documented by MRI.

        Vertebral height must be at least 50 percent of adjacent vertebrae.

        Patients must be symptomatic from their spinal tumor. Treatment attempts to reduce the size
        of, or eliminate, their tumors and to relieve their symptoms. The treatment of the
        vertebral tumor must be indicated based on the patient's condition.

        Prior surgical or radiation therapy for the vertebral tumor will not result in exclusion
        from the study if there is radiographic evidence of tumor and there is evidence of
        persistent local pain, epidural compression, or neurological deterioration related to the
        vertebral tumor.

        The patient must be able to comprehend the risks of the therapy and must be able to give
        informed consent.

        Pregnancy will exclude participation due to the radiation exposure involved in this
        protocol.

        Bleeding disorders will exclude a patient from the protocol unless the disorder can be
        corrected prior to treatment.

        Patients must have no contraindications to MRI scanning.

        Patients undergoing ethanol injection in the x-ray department must be able to lay prone for
        at least one hour with intravenous sedation and analgesia.

        Patients whose tumors have not responded to radiation therapy will be candidates for
        ethanol infusion.

        Patients with tumors in areas that have received maximal radiation doses to the spinal cord
        will be candidates for ethanol infusion.

        Patients whose poor general condition precludes open surgery will be candidates for ethanol
        infusion.

        Patients who wish to avoid the morbidity and potential mortality of open surgery will be
        candidates for ethanol injection.

        Patients with radioresistant tumors such as melanoma or prostate carcinoma are candidates
        for ethanol infusion even if they have not undergone prior irradiation.

        Patients with radiation-sensitive spinal tumors such as breast, kidney, and lung carcinoma,
        lymphoma, myeloma, Ewing's sarcoma, neuroblastoma, seminoma will not be entered into the
        protocol unless their tumors have either responded to radiation or lie at spinal cord
        levels that have already received maximal tolerable radiation doses.

        Patients with less than a 2 month life expectancy will be excluded.

        Patients with symptomatic vertebral metastases at more than 3 spinal levels will be
        excluded.

        Patients with asymptomatic vertebral metastases will be excluded.
