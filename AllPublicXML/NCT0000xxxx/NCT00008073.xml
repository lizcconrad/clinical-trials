      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Octreotide may help doxorubicin kill more cancer cells by making
      tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of octreotide and doxorubicin in treating
      patients who have advanced cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of octreotide administered
      with doxorubicin in patients with advanced cancer. II. Determine the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of octreotide. Patients receive doxorubicin IV over
      5 minutes on day 1 of course 1. For all subsequent courses, patients receive octreotide SC
      continuously on days 1-7 and doxorubicin IV over 5 minutes on day 5. Treatment continues
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      stable or responsive disease after 3 courses of therapy receive a maximum of 6 additional
      courses. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of octreotide until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 21-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
