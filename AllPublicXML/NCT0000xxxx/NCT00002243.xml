  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of a new non-nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), (+)-calanolide A, in HIV-positive patients who have
      never received anti-HIV treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized into 2 cohorts, with Cohort 2 receiving a higher dosage than Cohort
      1. Patients in each cohort receive either (+)-calanolide A or a placebo for 14 days, followed
      by a 14-day follow-up period. Following study treatment, patients may elect to receive an
      open-label, 6-month course of anti-HIV drugs to be selected by and administered under the
      care of the patient's physician.
