  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of the drug interferon-alpha (IFN-A), is associated with frequent and well characterized
      side effects like neurotoxicity. Neurotoxicity can cause symptoms of depression, agitation,
      anxiety, and/or confusion.

      The NIDDK is conducting a research study called, &quot;Combination of Alpha Interferon with Long
      Term Ribavirin Therapy for Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C&quot; (98-DK-0003). Patients
      participating in it are receiving interferon-alpha in addition to an antiviral medication
      called ribavirin. Researchers at the NIMH intend to study patients to learn more about how
      different medications can influence mood, thoughts and behavior.

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with IFN-A in combination with
      ribavirin alters human brain biochemistry as measured by proton magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (MRS).

      MRS uses strong magnetic fields in order to measure biochemical products of metabolism found
      in the brain. Researchers intend to perform MRS scans before, during, and after patients
      receive their medications

      Researchers believe that the combination of IFN-A/Ribavirin will directly affect specific
      areas of the brain and as a result, some patients will develop specific mood or cognitive
      symptoms. Patients often must stop taking these medications because of the side effects.

      This study will not contribute directly to the treatment of patient's Hepatitis C condition.
      However, the information gathered from this study will help researchers better understand the
      neuropsychiatric affects associated with interferon alpha and ribavirin therapy.

      The systemic administration of interferon-alpha (IFN-A) is associated with frequent and well
      characterized neuropsychiatric toxicity. The primary purpose of this study is to determine if
      treatment with IFN-A in combination with ribavirin alters human brain biochemistry as
      measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The study population will be drawn from
      subjects simultaneously enrolled in a NIDDK protocol (98-DK-0003) that employs IFN-A and
      ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Subjects will be evaluated
      prior to IFN-A/ribavirin treatment and then followed prospectively with the specific aim of
      identifying the emergence of central nervous system (CNS) effects. The principal outcome
      measures will be as follows: determinations of specific brain metabolites as measured by
      proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), a brief, non-invasive, and minimal risk
      procedure; ratings of mood, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms.

      The hypotheses being tested in this study are as follows:

        1. Treatment with IFN-A/ribavirin will decrease measures of neuronal integrity (NAA/CRE
           ratio) in a brain region specific fashion.

        2. The degree of change in NAA/CRE in certain brain regions (e.g. prefrontal cortex) will
           correspond to the development of mood or cognitive symptoms.

      The questions being asked in this study are relevant to the clinical management of HCV
      patients, since adverse neuropsychiatric effects of IFN-A and ribavirin frequently complicate
      protocol participation and occasionally result in a subject being taken off protocol. There
      are no anticipated number of patient days per year required for this study, as all
      participants will be simultaneously enrolled in NIDDK protocol 98-DK-0003.

        No individuals who are critically ill or markedly agitated or confused.

        No individuals with implanted cardiac pacemakers or autodefibrillators.

        No individuals with implanted neural pacemakers.

        No individuals with CNS aneurysmal clips.

        No individuals with cochlear implants.

        No individuals with metallic foreign bodies in the eye or CNS.

        No individuals with any form of implanted wire or metal device which may concentrate
        radiofrequency fields.

        No pregnant women.

        No individuals with a history of moderate to severe claustrophobia.
