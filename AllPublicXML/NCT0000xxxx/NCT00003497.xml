  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current therapies for Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer provide very limited benefit to the
      patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove
      beneficial in the treatment of Stage IV lung cancer

      PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that
      Antineoplaston therapy has on patients with Stage IV lung cancer.

      Stage IV non-small cell lung cancers receive Antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 capsules orally six
      to seven times a day. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Stage IV non-small
           cell lung cancer, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response,
           partial response or stable disease).

        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Stage
           IV non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing MRI scans, which are
           performed every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for
           2 years thereafter.
