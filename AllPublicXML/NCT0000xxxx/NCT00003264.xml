      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of cisplatin plus gemcitabine in treating
      patients with advanced squamous cell head and neck cancer that cannot be treated by surgery
      or radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the response rate and toxicity of weekly cisplatin and gemcitabine in
      patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who have
      received either no prior chemotherapy or no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for
      advanced disease.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy status: chemotherapy naive
      (no prior chemotherapy, or prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy at least 6 months prior
      to recurrence, or prior biologic agents only) vs chemotherapy exposed (one prior chemotherapy
      regimen directed at recurrent or newly diagnosed metastatic disease and/or prior neoadjuvant
      or adjuvant chemotherapy less than 6 months prior to recurrence). Patients receive
      gemcitabine as a 30 minute infusion weekly for 3 weeks followed by one week of rest.
      Cisplatin is administered as a 30-60 minute infusion immediately preceding gemcitabine.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2-6 courses, depending on response. Patients with
      previously untreated metastatic disease may have treatment interrupted to receive radiation
      therapy to locoregional disease sites. Patients may continue treatment beyond 6 courses at
      the discretion of the physician. Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue approximately 36 patients.
