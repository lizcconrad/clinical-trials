      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to
      replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by autologous
      bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with glioblastoma
      multiforme or brain stem tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the overall survival, progression-free interval, and time to
      progression or recurrence in patients with nondisseminated glioblastoma multiforme or diffuse
      intrinsic brain stem tumors that are nonprogressive following surgery (if feasible) and
      involved-field irradiation and treated with intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous
      peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) or autologous bone marrow (ABM) rescue. II. Estimate the
      toxicity of myeloablative chemotherapy with thiotepa (TSPA) followed by carboplatin (CBDCA)
      in these patients. III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic interactions of high-dose CBDCA, TSPA,
      and triethylenephosphoramide (a metabolite of TSPA) and any impact on subsequent toxicity.
      IV. Evaluate the effectiveness of autologous stem cells in restoring hematopoiesis following
      myeloablative therapy.

      OUTLINE: All patients undergo bone marrow or stem cell harvest (investigator option) no later
      than 12 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. The following acronyms are used: ABM
      Autologous Bone Marrow CBDCA Carboplatin, NSC-241240 G-CSF Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating
      Factor (Amgen), NSC-614629 PBSC Peripheral Blood Stem Cells TSPA Thiotepa, NSC-6396 2-Drug
      Myeloablative Chemotherapy followed by Hematopoietic Rescue. TSPA; CBDCA; followed by ABM or
      PBSC; G-CSF.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 60 patients will be entered over 3 years. If more than 5 patients on any
      arm experience treatment-related mortality, accrual will be discontinued.
