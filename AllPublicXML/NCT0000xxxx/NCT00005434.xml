      To confirm the preliminary findings of age, race, and hypertension chronicity effects on
      opioid and cardiovascular responses to stress and to determine the opioid mechanisms
      mediating these effects using an opioid receptor blockade strategy.

      BACKGROUND:

      Opioids exert depressor effects on cardiovascular responses through sympathetic nervous
      system inhibition. Research suggests that opioid inhibition of sympathetic activity may be
      compromised in hypertension. Preliminary studies by the Principal Investigator suggest that
      the nature of this compromise may be influenced by age and race. Additionally, literature
      suggests that hypertension chronicity may modulate opioid sympathoinhibitory actions. The
      receptor mechanisms mediating the observed modulating effects of age, race, and hypertension
      chronicity on opioidergic inhibition and regulation of blood pressure remained to be
      determined.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Two double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over studies were conducted to evaluate the
      effects of naltrexone hydrochloride, an oral opiate antagonist, on adrenergically-mediated
      cardiovascular responses in older and younger, Black and White normotensives and
      hypertensives with varying lengths of hypertension duration. Cardiovascular and opioid
      responses were measured in response to a stressor combined with either placebo or naltrexone
      pretreatment. Results from these studies assisted in (a) elucidating opioidergic mechanisms
      underlying the increased rates of hypertension morbidity and mortality among Blacks and the
      elderly, and (b) ultimately optimized the design of pharmacological interventions for the
      prevention and treatment of hypertension.
