  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess whether high dose or low dose atovaquone suspension is more effective than
      aerosolized pentamidine as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in
      high-risk HIV-infected patients. To compare the safety of chronic administration of the three
      regimens in patients with advanced HIV disease. To determine the relationship between steady
      state atovaquone plasma concentrations and prophylactic efficacy against PCP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive oral atovaquone at 1 of 2 doses once daily or aerosolized
      pentamidine once every 4 weeks. Treatment continues until 18 months after the last patient is
      enrolled. Patients are stratified into primary or secondary prophylaxis strata based on prior
      occurrence of a PCP episode.

          -  Significant psychosis or emotional disorder that would preclude study compliance.

          -  Severe chronic diarrhea (e.g., &gt; five stools/day) that may negatively affect
