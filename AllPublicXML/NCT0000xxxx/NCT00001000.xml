  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the degree and sequence of immunologic enhancement and the cellular resistance to
      certain infections after a single dose of atvogen (ampligen). In addition, the relationship
      between activation of immune cells and biochemical markers of that activation will be
      studied.

      Treatment of patients with HIV infection must address both the primary viral infection and
      the subsequent immune deficiency, which is the primary cause of mortality in AIDS. In vitro
      studies of ampligen have shown it will inhibit HIV infection. Ampligen may also minimize the
      toxicity of many drugs used in the treatment of AIDS and induce an antiviral state in the
      brain that may be useful in treating neurologic symptoms of HIV infection. The time course
      and degree of immunologic response to ampligen remain unknown although they are essential for
      proper use of the drug in the treatment of HIV infection and perhaps other clinical problems.

      proper use of the drug in the treatment of HIV infection and perhaps other clinical problems.

      Ten healthy volunteers and 10 HIV-infected patients are randomized between ampligen or
      placebo group. Five volunteers in each group receive a single dose of ampligen on day 1 and a
      single dose of placebo on day 8. The other 5 volunteers receive the drug and placebo on day 8
      and 1, respectively. Seven days of observation and testing follow each administration of drug
      or placebo and also allow the body to eliminate the drug.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients' general good health should be determined by screening history, physical
        examination, and laboratory tests including CBC with differential, erythrocyte
        sedimentation rate, urinalysis, SMA-24, and drug screen within the established limits of
        normal for the hospital laboratory.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

          -  Volunteers with clinically apparent viral disease or other illnesses, including
             allergies, within 2 weeks prior to the study or conditions which predispose them to
