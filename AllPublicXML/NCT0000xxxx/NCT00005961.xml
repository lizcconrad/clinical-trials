    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of O6-benzylguanine and carmustine in treating
      patients who have unresectable locally recurrent or metastatic melanoma. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining more than once chemotherapy drug may kill more tumor cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective clinical response rate and duration of response in patients with
      unresectable locally recurrent or metastatic melanoma treated with O6-benzylguanine and
      carmustine.

      II. Compare the toxicities of this regimen in patients with no prior chemotherapy vs prior
      chemotherapy failure.

      III. Correlate clinical response to this regimen in these patients with O6-alkylguanine DNA
      alkyltransferase (AGT) depletion and baseline AGT in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and
      tumor tissue.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy
      (chemotherapy failure vs chemotherapy naive).

      Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour, followed 1 hour later by carmustine IV over
      1 hour on day 1. Treatment continues every 6 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with disease progression are followed every 6 months. All other patients are
      followed every 3 months for 1 year.
