  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the seasons change during the course of the year, many animals show major changes in their
      behavior and physiology. Many of these changes are triggered by changes in the length of time
      each night that the pineal gland produces the hormone melatonin. Melatonin is produced for a
      longer time in winter when nights are long, than in summer when nights are short.

      Some researchers believe that melatonin may play a similar role in how season effects mood of
      patients with seasonal affective disorder. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or mood disorder
      with seasonal pattern is a condition where the normal biorhythm is disturbed during a season,
      especially autumn-winter. Patients may begin experiencing or experience worsening of
      depressive symptoms. Patients complain of being constantly tired, craving sugary foods,
      overeating, and over sleeping.

      Researchers have collected some preliminary data showing that the duration of nighttime
      melatonin secretion increases in winter and decreases in summer in healthy women, but not in
      healthy men. However, men diagnosed with SAD have shown longer duration of melatonin
      secretion in the winter, similar to the duration seen in healthy women. If these early
      findings are confirmed it may explain why SAD is more common in women than in men.

      The purpose of this study is to continue researching the differences in melatonin secretion
      over the seasons in healthy men and women, and to determine how these findings may apply to
      patients with SAD.

      Changes in the duration of nocturnal melatonin secretion that are induced by seasonal changes
      in the length of the night trigger many of the dramatic seasonal changes in behavior that
      occur in animals. It has been hypothesized that melatonin plays a similar role as chemical
      mediator of the effects of season on mood in patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD).
      For such a hypothesis to be tenable, it would be necessary to show that duration of nocturnal
      melatonin secretion changes on a seasonal basis in patients with SAD. We have preliminary
      evidence that the duration (and amplitude) of nocturnal melatonin secretion increases in
      winter and decreases in summer in healthy women, but not in healthy men. This gender
      difference, if confirmed, might explain why SAD is more prevalent in women than men.
      Interestingly, all of five men with SAD that we have studied to date exhibited lengthening of
      melatonin secretion in winter, as occurs in healthy women. However, the response of women
      with SAD is less consistent. The purpose of the present protocol is to extend and confirm our
      finding of gender differences in the response of melatonin secretion to change of season in
      healthy individuals, and to determine whether and to what extent this response occurs in
      patients with SAD.
