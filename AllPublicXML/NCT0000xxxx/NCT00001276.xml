  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoglycemia is the term used to refer to lower than normal levels of blood sugar. This study
      will continue to research the causes of hypoglycemia.

      Patients involved in the study will be admitted to the Clinical Center of the National
      Institutes of Health and undergo tests for evaluating blood sugar. Patients will be required
      to refrain from eating for a set period of time and will undergo blood tests for insulin
      levels and several other specific diagnostic tests related to insulin secretion. The patients
      will be under supervision and will be provided with appropriate medical and surgical
      attention as needed....

      The purpose of this protocol is to continue our studies of the evaluation and treatment of
      patients with fasting hypoglycemia due to diverse etiologies. Patients will be admitted to
      the Clinical Research Center under this protocol and undergo supervised fasting, dynamic
      tests of insulin secretion when appropriate, medically indicated imaging studies, and
      appropriate medical and surgical treatment.
