  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a 6-month course of isoniazid ( INH ) in the
      prevention of clinical tuberculosis in anergic (having diminished or absent reactions to
      specific antigens) HIV-infected persons who are at high risk for tuberculous infection.

      A substantial number of HIV-infected persons are anergic, and thus do not respond to the only
      currently available diagnostic tool for tuberculosis infection (that is, the PPD (purified
      protein derivative) skin test). Many of these anergic persons are, however, infected with
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis and eventually develop reactivation tuberculosis, causing both
      individual illness and spread of infection to others in the community. This study examines
      the possibility of using INH prophylaxis (that is, for prevention) in anergic HIV-infected
      patients at high risk for tuberculosis as a means of decreasing the sharp rise in the
      incidence of tuberculosis due to HIV infection. INH is inexpensive and relatively safe, and
      thus may demonstrate an acceptable risk/benefit ratio as a medication that can be given over
      a limited period of time to a population suspected of having, but not proved to have, M.
      tuberculosis infection. If this study shows INH to be safe and effective in this setting, it
      could have a major effect on public health in this country.

      Patients are placed by a random selection process in either the INH or placebo group. One
      group receives INH plus pyridoxine hydrochloride ( vitamin B6 ) daily for six months.
      Patients in the other group receive placebo plus vitamin B6 daily for six months.

        Allowed:
