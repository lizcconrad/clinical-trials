  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disease resulting from glucocerebroside accumulation
      in macrophages due to a genetic deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. It may occur in
      patients of all ages. The condition is marked by enlargement of the liver and spleen
      (hepatosplenomegaly), low blood and platelet counts, and bone abnormalities. The condition is
      passed from generation to generation on via autosomal recessive inheritance. There are
      actually three types of Gaucher disease.

      Type I is the most common form. It is a chronic non-neuronopathic form, meaning the disease
      does not affect the nervous system. The symptoms of type I can appear at any age.

      Type 2 Gaucher disease presents prenatally or in infancy and usually results in death for the
      patient. Type 2 is an acute neuronopathic form and can affect the brain stem. It is the most
      severe form of the disease.

      Type 3 Gaucher disease is also neuronopathic, however it is subacute in nature. This means
      the course of the illness lies somewhere between long-term (chronic) and short-term (acute).

      Currently there is not a cure for Gaucher disease. Treatment for the disease has
      traditionally been supportive. In some severely affected patients, bone-marrow transplants
      have corrected the enzyme deficiency, but it is considered a high-risk procedure and recovery
      can be very slow. Enzyme replacement therapy is another therapy option and has been approved
      by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in type 1 patients.

      PEG-glucocerbrosidase is a drug designed to clear out the accumulation of lipid
      (glucocerebroside) from the blood stream. The drug is actually an enzyme attached to large
      molecules called polyethylene glycol (PEG). The large molecules of PEG allow the enzyme to
      remain in the blood stream for long periods of time. By modifying glucocerebrosidase with
      PEG, it is believed that smaller doses will be required, meaning a reduction in cost for the
      patient and more convenient administration of the drug. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the effects and safety of enzyme replacement therapy using PEG- glucocerebrosidase
      for the treatment of Gaucher disease.

      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the biochemical and therapeutic effects and
      safety of enzyme replacement therapy using polyethyleneglycol (PEG) modified
      glucocerebrosidase for the treatment of Gaucher disease and to evaluate the benefit to risk
      ratio. The study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy in Gaucher patients of
      recombinantly produced human glucocerebrosidase, which is PEG modified. Parameters to be
      monitored include hemoglobin, platelet counts, organ size, and extent of bony involvement.
      Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and antibody studies will also be evaluated.
