  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of SU5416 in treating patients who have metastatic
      kidney cancer that has not responded to previous therapy with interleukin-2. SU5416 may stop
      the growth of kidney cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the clinical activity of SU5416 in patients with progressive metastatic renal
      cancer failing prior biologic therapy or fluorouracil-containing regimens.

      II. Determine the changes in tumor perfusion in patients treated with this regimen.

      III. Determine the time to progression and survival in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour twice weekly. Treatment continues every 6 weeks for at
      least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      complete response (CR) receive an additional 6 months of therapy after achieving CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.
