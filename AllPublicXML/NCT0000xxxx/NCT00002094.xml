  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the time course of development of resistance to atevirdine mesylate ( U-87201E )
      in patients with HIV isolates showing in vitro resistance to zidovudine ( AZT ). To determine
      the genotype changes in HIV reverse transcriptase associated with in vitro AZT resistance to
      U-87201E. To determine the genotype and phenotype effects of treatment with a
      nondideoxynucleoside agent on the alterations of the HIV-1 population associated with in
      vitro AZT resistance. To determine whether serial passage of patient pre-drug HIV isolates in
      the presence of U-87201E will generate the resistant mutants that may subsequently emerge in
      the patients.
