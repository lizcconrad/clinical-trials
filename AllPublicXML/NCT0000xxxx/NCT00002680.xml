      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of sequential high-dose chemotherapy
      followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with metastatic breast
      cancer that is responding to chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility and efficacy of sequential high-dose
      cyclophosphamide, melphalan, and thiotepa plus autologous peripheral blood stem cell rescue
      in patients with metastatic breast cancer with ongoing objective response to prior induction
      chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive sequential therapy beginning with regimen A. Regimen A: Patients
      receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour every 6 hours or more for 4 doses within 36 hours.
      Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning 2 days after
      completion of cyclophosphamide and continuing until autologous peripheral blood stem cells
      (PBSC) are harvested. Regimen B: Beginning at least 3 weeks after initiation of regimen A,
      patients receive melphalan IV on days 1 and 2. Beginning on day 4, a portion of the PBSC are
      reinfused. Patients receive G-CSF SC daily beginning on day 4 and continuing until at least
      day 10. Regimen C: Beginning at least 3 weeks after initiation of regimen B, patients receive
      thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 2. Beginning on day 5, the remaining PBSC are
      reinfused. Patients receive G-CSF SC daily beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood
      counts recover. During regimens A, B, and C, G-CSF must be discontinued at least 2 days
      before administration of any chemotherapy. Regimen D: After recovery from chemotherapy,
      patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors and no prior refractoriness to hormonal
      therapies receive oral tamoxifen daily, while patients with prior failure on tamoxifen
      receive oral megestrol 4 times daily. Patients undergo irradiation to sites of prior
      cutaneous, nodal, bone, or soft tissue bulk disease and resection of residual lesions.
      Patients are followed weekly for 1 month, biweekly for 2 months, monthly for 5 months, and
      then bimonthly for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
