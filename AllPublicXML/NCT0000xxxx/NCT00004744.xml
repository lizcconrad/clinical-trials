      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is more
      effective than placebo in restoring neurologic function (muscle strength) in patients with
      multiple sclerosis.

      II. Determine the time to recovery following IVIG.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are treated with
      intravenous immune globulin or placebo. In the absence of a hypersensitivity reaction to a
      test dose, a total of 11 doses is administered: daily for 5 days, then every 2 weeks for 12
      weeks.

      Patients are followed at 3 months.
