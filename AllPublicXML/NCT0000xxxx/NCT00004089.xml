      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus radiation
      therapy in treating patients who have previously untreated anaplastic thyroid cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the activity of chemotherapy with hyperfractionated radiotherapy in
      terms of complete and overall response rate, time to progression, pattern of failure,
      incidence of second primary tumors, and overall survival in patients with previously
      untreated anaplastic thyroid cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral hydroxyurea every 12 hours on
      days 0-5, fluorouracil IV and paclitaxel IV continuously over days 1-5, and hyperfractionated
      radiotherapy twice daily on days 1-5. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously
      daily on days 6-12. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 5 courses. Following completion of
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy, patients with no prior initial modified neck dissection who
      have residual macroscopic nodal disease or initially staged nodal disease with no evidence of
      residual disease undergo neck dissection. Patients with macroscopic residual disease at the
      primary site undergo complete excision of disease. Patients with any progressive disease or
      recurrence of disease undergo conventional surgical management. Patients are followed at 4-6
      weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 16-46 patients will be accrued for this study.
