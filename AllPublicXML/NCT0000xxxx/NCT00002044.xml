  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy of Retrovir (AZT) in the
      treatment of AIDS-related dementia and various neuromuscular complications. HIV is both a
      lymphotropic and neurotropic virus which can affect both the central and peripheral nervous
      systems (CNS, PNS). There is evidence that the CNS and PNS may harbor the virus in a latent
      state, with the potential for continuous reinfection of other body systems. Therefore,
      effective therapeutic efforts against HIV infection should provide effective antiviral
      activity within the nervous system.

             carotene level of &gt; 75 IU/ml).

          -  Evidence of nervous system dysfunction being caused by factors other than HIV
             infection, particularly by cerebral toxoplasmosis, lymphoma, cryptococcal meningitis,
             chronic alcohol abuse, lead poisoning, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (patients with
             retinal CMV infection or other evidence of CMV dementia), syphilis, or progressive
             multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

          -  Other known causes of nerve or muscle disease.

          -  Hypersensitivity to zidovudine (AZT).

        Concurrent Treatment:

        Allowed:

          -  Electron beam therapy to an area of less than 100 cm2.

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Past or present renal disease.

          -  Significant bone marrow suppression.

          -  Blood transfusion within the past month.

          -  Liver dysfunction.

             carotene level of &gt; 75 IU/ml).

          -  All patients must have either:

          -  Dementia as defined by a progressive cognitive impairment in the absence of altered
             consciousness that is thought to be causally related to HIV infection. Patients in
             this study will fall into the lower 20 percent (or less) of a normal sample of formal
             neuropsychological testing.

          -  OR

          -  One of the following neuromuscular diseases thought to be related to HIV infection:

          -  Demyelinating polyneuropathy, axonal polyneuropathy, inflammatory myopathy, or
             unexplained progressive muscle weakness.

          -  Capacity to give informed consent or a person with durable power of attorney who can
             give informed consent.

          -  Life expectancy = or &gt; 4 months.
