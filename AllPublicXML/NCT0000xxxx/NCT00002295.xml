      To evaluate the effect of Isoprinosine in patients diagnosed as having AIDS relative to:

      Laboratory (immunologic defects):

        -  Comparison of total helper and suppressor T-cell numbers among the groups.

        -  Comparison of changes in natural killer cell activity.

        -  Comparison of other laboratory findings among the groups.

      Clinical changes:

        -  Comparison of the frequency of opportunistic infections among the groups.

        -  Comparison of the frequency of the development of AIDS-related malignancies.

        -  Comparison of other clinical manifestations relative to severity and time of onset.
