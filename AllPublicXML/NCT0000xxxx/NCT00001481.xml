      Determine whether postpartum depression is triggered by the abrupt withdrawal of estrogen and
      progesterone.

      The appearance of mood and behavioral symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum period has
      been extensively reported. While there has been much speculation about possible biologically
      based etiologies for postpartum disorders (PPD), none has ever been confirmed. Preliminary
      results from two related studies (protocols 90-M-0088, 92-M-0174) provide evidence that women
      with menstrual cycle related mood disorder, but not controls, experience mood disturbances
      during exogenous replacement of physiologic levels of gonadal steroids. The present protocol
      is designed to create a &quot;scaled-down&quot; hormonal milieu of pregnancy and the puerperium in
      order to determine whether women who have had a previous episode of postpartum major
      effective episode will experience differential mood and behavioral effects compared with
      controls and to determine whether it is the abrupt withdrawal of gonadal steroids or the
      prolonged exposure to gonadal steroids that is associated with mood symptoms.
      Supraphysiologic plasma levels of gonadal steroids will be established, maintained, and then
      rapidly reduced, simulating the hormonal events that occur during pregnancy and parturition.
      This will be accomplished by administering estradiol and progesterone to women who are
      pretreated with a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (Lupron). After eight weeks,
      administration of gonadal steroids will be stopped in one group of patients and controls, and
      a sudden decline in the plasma hormone levels will be precipitated. Another group will be
      maintained on supraphysiologic levels of estrogen and progesterone for an additional month.
      Outcome measures will include mood, behavioral and hormonal parameters as well as response to
      o-CRH (a separate protocol done in collaboration with NICHD).

             within three months postpartum;

          2. has been well for a minimum of one year;

          3. a regular menstrual cycle for at least three months;
