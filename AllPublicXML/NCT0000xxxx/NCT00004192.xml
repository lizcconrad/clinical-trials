      RATIONALE: Colony-stimulating factors may increase the number of immune cells found in bone
      marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side
      effects of chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of filgrastim-SD/01 with that
      of filgrastim to relieve the neutropenia following combination chemotherapy in patients who
      have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the effect of single dose filgrastim-SD/01 vs daily filgrastim (G-CSF)
      on the duration of neutropenia in course 1 after combination chemotherapy in patients with
      recurrent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Compare the effect of these regimens on duration of
      neutropenia in courses 2-4, absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) in courses 1-4, time to ANC
      recovery in courses 1-4, and safety in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetic
      profile of these drugs in course 1 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one
      of two treatment arms. All patients receive etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-4, cisplatin
      IV continuously on days 1-4, methylprednisolone IV over 15 minutes on days 1-5, and
      cytarabine IV over 2 hours on day 5. Treatment is repeated every 21 days for up to 4 courses.
      Arm I: Patients receive filgrastim-SD/01 subcutaneously (SQ) on day 6. Arm II: Patients
      receive filgrastim (G-CSF) SQ daily beginning on day 6 and continuing for 12 days or until
      blood counts recover.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      at least 6 months.
