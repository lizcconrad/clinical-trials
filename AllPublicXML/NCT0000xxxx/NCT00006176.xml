      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the medical problems and the genetic factors
      involved in a recently defined form of inherited dementia called &quot;familial dementia with
      neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FDNIB).&quot; Abnormal substances in nerve cells of patients with
      this disease affect brain and nervous system function, causing confusion, memory decline and
      impaired cognition (thinking ability). Patients also develop movement disorders and,
      possibly, seizures. Symptoms begin in midlife, between 45 and 55 years of age.

      Patients with FDNIB and family members 18 years of age or older at risk for the disease may
      be eligible for this 3-year study.

      Participants will have a medical and family history and review of medical records; interview
      with a medical geneticist (specialist in genetics); physical, neurological and psychiatric
      examinations; and the following tests and procedures:

        1. Blood tests to assess general health

        2. Chest and skull X-rays

        3. Electrocardiogram (EKG)-record of the electrical activity of the heart using electrodes
           placed on the chest

        4. Electroencephalogram (EEG)-record of the electrical activity of the brain using
           electrodes placed on the head

        5. Ultrasound of the abdomen-imaging of abdominal organs using sound waves

        6. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-imaging of the brain using a strong magnetic
           field and radio waves

        7. Hearing evaluation

        8. Assessment of performance of daily living activities

        9. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)-imaging of brain metabolism and blood
           flow using a radioactive substance injected into a vein

      The evaluation will be done over a 3- to 4-day period. At their completion, participants will
      meet with a physician and a genetics counselor to discuss the clinically significant
      findings. Participants may be asked to return for follow-up evaluations every 6 months to a
      year (depending on the individual's condition) for 3 years.

      This project involves the study of a novel familial neurodegenerative disorder, familial
      encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB). This disorder, which has a
      characteristic clinical course of progressive dementia and neurologic involvement, was
      initially defined in one extended family. Neuroserpin is the gene for this disorder and a
      mutation is present in this large kindred and four additional families/cases. This protocol
      will characterize the clinical phenotype, delineate the natural history of the disorder and
      explore genotype/phenotype correlations in the index family and possibly in other reported
      cases. Families with immunohistopathologically-neuroserpin positive neuronal inclusions on
      autopsy/biopsy in an affected member(s), neuroserpin mutation-positive proband, or with
      familial presenile dementia with neurologic features consistent with the original FENIB
      family will be enrolled.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with a family history of early-onset progressive dementia or decline in cognition
        and neuronal inclusion bodies which are immunohistopathologically consistent with
        neuroserpin inclusion bodies.

        Children with progressive dementia and myoclonic epilepsy which is consistent with the
        reported clinical course in pediatric patients or children with the clinical phenotype who
        on autopsy demonstrate neuronal inclusion boidies which are immunohistopathologically
        consistent with neuroserpin inclusion bodies.

        Family members at risk, of at least 18 years of age, including first degree relatives of
        affected patients and the adult offspring of these first degree relatives.

        In rare instances probands and their at risk family members with known presenile dementia
        and a neurologic course typical of that seen in FENIB will be enrolled.

        We may also enroll offsite individuals who have any of the above findings, but are too
        medically fragile to travel to the Clinical Center and for whom a durable power of attorney
        (DPA) is available. The physical examination and laboratory research studies will be
        performed by the Investigator(s) and all clinical studies will be done in a local
        accredited hospital.

        Family members either not at risk and unaffected spouses may enroll primarily for genetic
        linkage information. These individuals will contribute a blood sample for molecular
        analysis only. Those unwilling to travel may also provide a blood sample only. No clinical
        studies will be performed on individuals from this category.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Another diagnosis of presenile demential is made by a physician including but not limited
        to: 1) Huntington Disease, 2) Parkinson Disease/Diffuse Lewy Body Disease, 3) Familial
        Alzheimer Disease with known mutations in presenilin 1, presenilin 2 or beta-amyloid
        precursor protein, 4) Lafora Body Disease, 5) Pick's Disease, and 6) fronto-temporal
        dementia.

        A Durable Power of Attorney is not available in a human subject that is not medically
        competent to give consent.
