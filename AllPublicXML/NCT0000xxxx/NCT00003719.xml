      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating patients who
      have stage IV or recurrent soft tissue sarcoma that has been previously treated with
      chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of irinotecan in patients with metastatic, recurrent, or
      unresectable locally advanced previously treated soft tissue sarcoma. II. Assess the clinical
      and laboratory toxic effects and patient tolerance of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes weekly for 4 weeks, followed by 2
      weeks of rest. Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first two years, then
      every 6 months for the next two years, and every 12 months thereafter until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-27 patients will be accrued for this study in 18-36 months.
