      RATIONALE: Antiviral agents are drugs that act against viruses and may be an effective
      treatment for HIV. Peripheral stem cell transplantation or umbilical cord blood
      transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy used to kill tumor cells. Combining either umbilical cord blood
      transplantation or peripheral stem cell transplantation with antiviral therapy may be an
      effective treatment for HIV-positive patients who have hematologic cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of antiviral therapy plus either peripheral
      stem cell transplantation or umbilical cord blood transplantation in treating HIV-positive
      patients who have refractory or recurrent hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility and safety of combination antiretroviral therapy
      followed by HLA matched sibling peripheral blood stem cell or unrelated umbilical cord blood
      transplants in HIV infected adults with hematologic malignancies. II. Measure the effects of
      this treatment on HIV viral burden in the serum and tissues of these patients. III. Measure
      immune reconstitution following treatment in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a combination of 3 antiretroviral agents beginning at least 3 weeks
      prior to the initiation of the myeloablative conditioning regimen. The antiretroviral agents
      are discontinued on days -5 to -1 prior to transplant. Beginning on day 0 the antiretroviral
      agents are restarted and continue indefinitely. Patients who are given umbilical cord blood
      (UCB) transplants undergo collection of autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) prior
      to the myeloablative conditioning regimen in case there is UCB graft failure. Prior to PBSC
      or UCB transplantation on day 0, all patients receive a myeloablative conditioning regimen.
      The conditioning regimen consists of total body irradiation twice a day on days -9 to -5 and
      melphalan IV over 60 minutes on days -4 to -2. Patients receiving UCB transplant also receive
      anti-thymocyte globulin over 6 hours on days -3 to -1. Patients are followed every 3 months
      for 3 years, then annually for the next 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed intermediate or high grade non-Hodgkin's
        lymphoma, acute myelogenous leukemia, or acute lymphocytic leukemia that is refractory to
        or relapsed after prior therapy Must be HIV seropositive confirmed by Western blot Must
        have a 6/6 HLA matched sibling donor or 6/6, 5/6, or 4/6 HLA matched umbilical cord blood
        (UCB) from the New York Blood Center's Unrelated UCB Bank that is not homozygous for the
        CCR-5 mutation No active primary CNS lymphoma or chronic CNS infection No history of AIDS
        defining opportunistic infection or active invasive aspergillus infection A new
        classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The
        terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former terminology of
        &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former
        terminology.

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 to 55 Performance status: Karnofsky 70-100% Life
        expectancy: At least 6 months (unless due to hematologic malignancy) Hematopoietic:

        normal Bilirubin no greater than 2.0 mg/dL Renal: Creatinine no greater than 2.0 mg/dL
        Creatinine clearance at least 60 mL/min Cardiovascular: No myocardial infarction within the
        past 6 months Normal cardiac function (LVEF greater than 40%) Pulmonary: FVC and FEV1
        greater than 70% of predicted DLCO at least 60% of predicted Other: No other malignancy
        except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix within the past 5 years
        Not pregnant (must have negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks of therapy)

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: No prior bone marrow, peripheral blood stem
        cell, or umbilical cord blood transplant Chemotherapy: Cumulative lifetime dose of
        doxorubicin no greater than 450 mg/m2 (or equivalent dose of mitoxantrone or daunorubicin)

        No concurrent involvement in any other clinical trial that may affect hematologic
        engraftment
