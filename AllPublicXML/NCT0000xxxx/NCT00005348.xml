      To relate distribution of adipose tissue measured by a then new imaging technique, Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) to extracranial carotid atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease risk
      factors, and to more conventional measures of fat distribution such as body mass index (BMI)
      and waist/hip ratio. The primary hypothesis was that patients with extracranial carotid
      atherosclerosis (cases) had more intra-abdominal fat and a higher ratio of intra-abdominal
      fat to total or subcutaneous fat than age-sex-race matched controls.

      BACKGROUND:

      The study was ancillary to an NIH funded population-based project, the Atherosclerosis Risk
      in Communities Study (ARIC) that is ongoing in Forsyth County, North Carolina.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Using MRI, the investigators sought to demonstrate strong relationships between
      intra-abdominal fat and a number of cardiovascular disease risk factors, including history of
      hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking, family history of cardiovascular disease, plasma
      concentrations of triglyceride, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, HDL2 cholesterol,
      apo A1, Apo B, postprandial lipid response to a fat rich meal, glucose, insulin, sex hormone
      binding globulin, and total and free testosterone. Certain other risk factors were less
      certain to show a relation to intra-abdominal fat as measured by MRI, including various
      hemostatic factors, as well as certain dietary factors such as consumption of alcohol,
      dietary fat, and cholesterol, but this research afforded an opportunity to explore these
      relationships. Finally, the investigators proposed to relate intra-abdominal fat to more
      conventional measures of fat distribution (waist/hip ratio, subscapular skinfold thickness,
      etc.) in an attempt to identify strong correlates of intra-abdominal fat that could be more
      easily measured.
