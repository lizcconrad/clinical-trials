      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether the initial response to interferon alfa (IFN-A) can be
      increased by starting at a dose of 5 MU three times a week in patients with chronic hepatitis
      C.

      II. Determine whether patients who had normalized alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels can
      maintain normal ALT during stepwise dose reduction from 5 MU to 3 MU to 1.5 MU.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio.

      The first group is treated with high-dose interferon alfa (IFN-A) administered subcutaneously
      twice a week for 12 weeks. If the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level has normalized, the
      IFN-A dose is decreased in a stepwise fashion. If the ALT level decreases by more than 50%,
      IFN-A is continued at the same dose until week 24 or the ALT normalizes. If the ALT level
      decreases by less than 50%, treatment is discontinued.

      The second group is treated with standard-dose IFN-A administered subcutaneously twice a week
      for 24 weeks.
