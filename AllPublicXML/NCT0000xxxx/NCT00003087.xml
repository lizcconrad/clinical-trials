      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Combining more than one drug with radiation therapy before surgery may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy, radiation
      therapy, and surgery in treating patients with cancer of the esophagus that can be surgically
      removed.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate to preoperative induction paclitaxel/cisplatin
      followed by concurrent paclitaxel/cisplatin and radiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal
      cancer. II. Determine the toxic effects, including surgical morbidity and mortality, and
      patient survival after this combination therapy. III. Monitor the quality of life of patients
      receiving this combination therapy. IV. Determine c Jun oncogene and thymidylate synthase
      expression and p53 mutation before and after this combination therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. (Adenocarcinoma stratum closed) Patients
      receive of induction chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by
      cisplatin IV on days 1 and 22. Patients then receive radiation therapy 5 days a week for 6
      weeks, along with paclitaxel and cisplatin 4 days a week. Patients undergo surgery (complete
      or partial resection) within 4-8 weeks of completion of the chemoradiotherapy. Patients are
      followed every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 2 years, and
      annually thereafter. Quality of life is assessed for the first year of follow up only.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 25 patients will be accrued for each histology
      (adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma) within 18-24 months. (Adenocarcinoma stratum closed)
