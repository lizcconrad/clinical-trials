      RATIONALE: Green tea extract contains ingredients that may inhibit the growth of actinic
      keratosis.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of green tea extract in
      treating patients who have actinic keratosis.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of the green tea extract epigallocatechin gallate
      (Polyphenon E topical ointment) in causing complete clinical and histopathologic regression
      in patients with actinic keratoses. II. Determine duration of treatment with Polyphenon E
      necessary to cause regression in these patients. III. Describe pathophysiologic and molecular
      alterations in actinic keratoses and sun damaged skin that are not present in skin that is
      not sun damaged in these patients. IV. Determine the effects of this treatment on biomarkers
      for skin cancer in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. One of the patient's
      arms is randomized to receive topical epigallocatechin gallate (Polyphenon E), the other arm
      to receive a placebo. Patients receive topical applications daily for 12 weeks, or until
      resolution of all actinic keratoses within the treatment field.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 60 patients will be accrued for this study over 10 months.

    <description>Areas of sun damaged skin with actinic keratoses to be treated will be mapped and photographed on patient's bilateral arms. One of the patient's arms will be assigned to be treated with topical Polyphenon E, the patient's other arm with placebo vehicle in a random, double blind manner. The patient's arm treatment areas will receive daily applications of a premeasured amount of drug or placebo. Patients will be seen every other week for 12 weeks to check for effects of the applications and monitor for compliance or possible side effects.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. participants multiple sites of actinic keratosis identified by clinical examination
             and the histologic confirmation of one lesion (Grade 1-3 as defined previously in
             &quot;Clinical Grading&quot;) are eligible.

          2. No history of invasive cancer within 5 years (though non-melanoma skin cancer, stage I
             cervical cancer, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) stage 0 will not be reason to
             exclude a patient); no severe metabolic disorders or other life-threatening acute or
             chronic disease; no additional x-ray or chemotherapy anticipated.

          3. Not requiring use of topical medications in areas being studied.

          4. Subjects must meet the Southwest Oncology Group performance status criteria of 0 - 1
             (0= fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease activities without restriction
             [Karnofsky scale 90 - 100]; 1 = restricted in physically strenuous activity, but
             ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, i.e. light
             housework or office work [Karnofsky scale 70 - 80]).

          5. Signed informed consent approved by the local Human Subjects Committee (Institutional
             Review Board).

        Exclusion Criteria:

             entry into the study:

             Within 2 weeks: topical medications, e.g. corticosteroids, alpha-hydroxyacids
             (glycolic acid, lactic acid) or retinoids (Retin-A) to the target lesions Within 4
             weeks: systemic steroid therapy. Within 2 months: cryotherapy to the target lesions,
             laser resurfacing, chemical peels, topical application of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or
             masoprocol (Actinex) for treatment of actinic keratoses. Systemic treatment with
             chemotherapeutic agents, psoralens, immunotherapy, retinoids (Tegison, Accutane).

          2. Any medical condition which , in the opinion of the investigator, could preclude study
             participation

          3. Active infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) or HIV that may affect the
             patient systemically and may also affect the immune system. Localized, minor
             infections such as sinusitis, uncomplicated urinary tract infection, otitis media,
             etc. will not be criteria for exclusion from the study.

          4. Use of any investigational drug in the previous 30 days.

          5. Any history of keloid formation.
