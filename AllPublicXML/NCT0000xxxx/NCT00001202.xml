  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a continuation of two previous studies conducted at the NIH. The first study ,
      &quot;Treatment of True Precocious Puberty with a Long-Acting Lutenizing Hormone Releasing Hormone
      Analog (D-Trp(6)-Pro(9)-Net-LHRH)&quot; had less than optimal results. Some patients, all of whom
      were diagnosed with familial isosexual precocious puberty, had an inadequate response to the
      medication and were observed to have high levels of testosterone, advanced bone aging, and
      other complications of the disease. As a result these patients were enrolled in a second
      study

      In the second study, &quot;Spironolactone Treatment for Boys with Familial Isosexual Precocious
      Puberty&quot;, - the patients received another medication, spironolactone (Aldactone). The drug
      blocked the effects of testosterone, -but bone age advancement did not improve. Some patients
      began experiencing gynecomastia (an abnormal growth of the male breasts). Researchers believe
      these may be the effects of elevated levels of estrodiol (a form of the female hormone,
      estrogen).

      In the present study, testolactone is added to the drug regimen to block the production of
      estrogen. The study therefore uses spironolactone to prevent the action of the male hormones
      (androgen) and testolactone to block the production of female hormones (estrogen).
      Deslorelin, an LHRH analog which works by turning off true (central) puberty, is added to the
      drug regimen once true puberty begins. This is because it is know that boys with familial
      male precocious puberty go into true puberty too early (despite treatment with spironolactone
      and testolactone), and when that happens, the spironolactone and testolactone are no longer
      as effective. The goal of the treatment is to delay sexual development until a more
      appropriate age and prevent short adult stature (height).

    <textblock>
      Most males with precocious puberty who have been referred to NIH have been successfully
      treated under protocol 79-CH-0112 &quot;Treatment of True Precocious Puberty with a Long-Acting
      Luteinizing Hormone Releasing Hormone Analog (D-Trp6-Pro9-Net-LHRH).&quot; A subset of these
      patients, however, all of whom had familial male isosexual precocity, had an inadequate
      response to LHRH analog as demonstrated by high serum testosterone levels, rapid advancement
      in bone age, testicular growth, sperm production, and lack of regression of secondary sex
      characteristics. These patients had low baseline gonadotropin levels and lacked a pubertal
      response to LHRH, whereas the patients who had responded to LHRH analog all had clear
      evidence of central precocious puberty.

      As an alternative approach to treatment, the patients with familial male precocious puberty
      were enrolled in protocol 83-CH-0028, &quot;Spironolactone Treatment of Boys with Familial
      Isosexual Precocious Puberty&quot;. Spironolactone (Aldactone) is an antiandrogen that also
      reduced testosterone synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme 17-hydroxylase. This treatment
      decreased the plasma testosterone level and inhibited the peripheral effect of testosterone
      on target tissues. This was apparent through a decrease in acne and in the frequency of
      spontaneous erections.

      Bone age advancement, however, was not slowed by spironolactone and gynecomastia had begun to
      occur in a number of patients. Both of these processes may be the result of persisting
      elevated estradiol levels. To attempt to reduce elevated estrogen levels in these patients to
      normal prepubertal levels, we plan to use testolactone (Teslac) to inhibit aromatase, the
      last step of estrogen biosynthesis. Testolactone has previously been used for a similar
      purpose in girls with gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty (McCune-Albright Syndrome)
      under protocol 82-CH-0165, &quot;Testolactone treatment of girls with LHRH analog-resistant
      precocious puberty due to autonomous non-neoplastic ovarian estrogen secretion.&quot;

      We plan to administer combined spironolactone and testolactone treatment-spironolactone to
      inhibit the action of androgen, and testolactone to block the formation of estrogen. The goal
      of this treatment is to delay sexual maturation and to prevent early closure of the epiphyses
      and adult short stature. These goals are being partially met with spironolactone and we
      postulate that the addition of testolactone will improve response by slowing bone growth and
      preventing gynecomastia. Preliminary results using this regimen demonstrate that blockade of
      both androgen action and estrogen synthesis is an effective treatment for familial male
      precocious puberty. Throughout the therapy, patients will receive frequent clinical,
      hormonal, and toxicological monitoring.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with familial male precocious puberty will be admitted to the Clinical Center.

        In order to be eligible for the study, the following criteria will be met:

        Boys 10 years of age or less.

        Tanner II to IV pubertal development.

        Unfused epiphyses by bone films.

        Evidence that precocious puberty is not secondary to another recognized cause of
        pseudopuberty:

          1. We will exclude congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and document pretreatment androgen
             levels, by a 1-hour ACTH test, which will include measurement of 11-deoxycortisol and
             17-OH-progesterone at 0 and 60 minutes.

          2. We will exclude tumor of adrenal or testes by physical exam, ultrasound, and
             measurement of adrenal androgens (DHA, DHAS, androstenedione).

        Elevated testosterone levels measured at 10 am, 2pm, 10 pm and 2 am over a 24 hour period.
