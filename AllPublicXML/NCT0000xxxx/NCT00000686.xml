  <brief_title>A Study of d4T in Patients With AIDS or AIDS-Related Complex Who Cannot Take AZT</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine (d4T) administered to patients with AIDS or AIDS
      related complex (ARC) who are intolerant of zidovudine (AZT). The study also begins an
      assessment of the effectiveness of d4T therapy on HIV replication, on plasma levels of p24
      antigen, and clinical or immunologic parameters associated with AIDS.

      Of the methods that are being evaluated to treat HIV-infected individuals, AZT has produced
      the best results to date. Toxic effects in approximately 50 percent of patients receiving AZT
      may limit its usefulness for prolonged treatment. Long-term treatment may be necessary to
      prevent progression of early stage HIV infection to AIDS and to prevent secondary
      transmission. Other drugs that may be equally or more effective than AZT and useful in the
      long- term treatment of HIV infection must be developed and evaluated. Test-tube and animal
      studies of d4T show that the drug can inhibit replication (reproduction) of HIV at
      concentrations similar to concentrations of AZT that have anti-HIV activity. These studies
      also indicate that the drug may stay in the bloodstream longer than AZT. Thus, it may be
      possible for the drug to be as effective as AZT when taken less frequently than AZT. It also
      may have a less disturbing effect on other body functions (such as thymidine metabolism).

      Five patients are enrolled at each dose level and receive d4T for 10 weeks at their initial
      dose level. Escalation to the next higher dose level, using a different group of five
      patients, occurs after three patients in the preceding group have successfully completed at
      least 3 weeks of oral dosing.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must have:

          -  Diagnosis of AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC).

          -  Previous intolerance to daily doses of up to 1200 mg of zidovudine (AZT) demonstrated
             by a decrease in hemoglobin levels of 2 - 8.5 g/dl or AZT-related depression of
             neutrophils of 200 - 750 cells/mm3.

          -  Ability to provide informed consent.

        Prior Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Zidovudine (AZT).

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  AIDS-defining opportunistic infection on enrollment.

          -  Intractable diarrhea.

          -  History of seizures within past 2 years or currently requiring anticonvulsants for
             control.

          -  Any other clinical conditions or prior therapy which in the opinion of the
             investigator would make the patient unsuitable for study or unable to comply with the

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Systemic maintenance or chemoprophylaxis for opportunistic infection (includes
