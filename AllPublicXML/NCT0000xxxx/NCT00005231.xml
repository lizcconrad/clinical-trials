      BACKGROUND:

      Cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) is the change in a cardiovascular parameter in response to a
      discrete environmental stimulus. A leading theory linking behavior to cardiovascular diseases
      such as atherosclerosis and hypertension proposed that an exaggerated physiological response
      to a psychological challenge increased the risk for development of disease. Such a link had
      not been established conclusively in 1988. To a considerable extent, this might have been due
      to the fact that numerous approaches were devised to elicit and measure CVR. Furthermore, no
      single test or combination of tests was available which would be suitable for administering
      to large numbers of individuals who differed in age, gender, cultural or ethnic background,
      and socioeconomic status, as would be required for definitive prospective studies of
      reactivity and cardiovascular disease.

      A conference sponsored by the NHLBI and the University of Pittsburgh in 1984 comprehensively
      reviewed the concept of reactivity, its measurement, and its hypothesized relationship to a
      disease process. The value of CVR is that it provides an estimation of the changes in
      cardiovascular function in response to the challenges of daily life, and thus may serve as a
      better marker or predictor of cardiovascular disease risk than the usual 'casual'
      measurements. Essential hypertension appears to be a multi-factorially determined disorder,
      whose etiology encompasses different elements for different individuals. Physiological
      changes induced by excessive cardiovascular reactivity are among the mechanisms suggested to
      account for the transition from borderline to established hypertension. In this model,
      episodic cardiovascular activation elicited by behavioral challenges leads to autoregulatory
      adjustments culminating in elevated blood pressure. An alternative interpretation is that
      both elevated CVR and elevated blood pressure are reflections of underlying nervous system
      pathology. Prospective studies, using appropriate behavioral designs and a standardized
      protocol to assess cardiovascular reactivity could distinguish between these alternatives.

      The possible role of cardiovascular reactivity in coronary heart disease was supported by
      evidence from both basic and clinical studies. The hemodynamic forces resulting from
      turbulence and shear stress at curves and bifurcations of the coronary arteries had been
      cited as responsible for the greater degree of atherosclerosis in high heart rate, as opposed
      to low heart rate animals. Monkeys with large elevations of heart rate in response to
      psychological arousal developed significantly more atherosclerosis. Although the above
      findings had not been confirmed in humans as of 1988, a substantial majority of studies
      reported greater reactivity of Type A subjects during stress.

      Although the evidence was suggestive and the mechanism plausible, stress-induced
      cardiovascular reactivity had not been investigated as a risk factor for cardiovascular
      disease. In addition to basic research to determine the parameters and physiological
      determinants of reactivity, clinical and epidemiological studies were needed to establish
      whether this association was reliable. Especially needed were prospective, longitudinal
      studies of the association between reactivity and disease.

      The Clinical Applications and Prevention Advisory Committee of the National Heart, Lung, and
      Blood Institute recommended the development of this study in February 1987. The National
      Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council approved the concept in May 1987. A Request for
      Applications was released in August 1987 and awards made in July 1988.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Investigators at the University of Miami evaluated cardiovascular and hormonal functions at
      rest and after standardized manipulations designed to evoke autonomic nervous system arousal.
      Two hundred and fifty-six subjects were enrolled into a 2 (male, female) x 2 (Black, white) x
      2 (25-44 years, 55-64 years) x 2 (Miami, Durham) design. Subjects were compared across a
      broad range of socioeconomic status. Each subject was scheduled for three laboratory
      sessions. Sessions 1 and 2 were two weeks apart. Session 3 was six months later. During the
      sessions, individuals were subjected to a forehead cold pressor stimulus, a video game, and
      an evaluative speech stressor. Noninvasive cardiovascular measures assessed included heart
      rate, cardiac output, peripheral resistance, Heather Index, pre-ejection period, left
      ventricular ejection period, and diastolic, systolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. On
      the same day as the laboratory session, subjects wore an ambulatory impedance and
      electrocardiogram monitor at work and at home. The following day subjects wore an ambulatory
      blood pressure monitor at work and at home. Data were analyzed in terms of stability of
      baseline values, differences in laboratory reactivity between groups, differences in
      reactivity between tasks, reliability of responses to tasks across sessions, differences in
      reactivity as an individual difference variable, and generalizability of reactivity in the
      laboratory to cardiovascular function observed in more naturalistic settings. Improved
      procedures were developed for monitoring impedance cardiographic and electrocardiographic
      activity.

      Investigators at the University of Pittsburgh developed a battery of tests to elicit
      differential vascular, cardiac inotropic and chronotropic responses. Each task was based on a
      computer-driven video game which permitted a standardized task presentation and multiple
      response measurement. During the initial prototyping year, items were selected to maximize
      reliability, validity, and applicability to diverse demographic groups. Circadian ambulatory
      studies in this year established optimal baselines for reactivity assessment.
