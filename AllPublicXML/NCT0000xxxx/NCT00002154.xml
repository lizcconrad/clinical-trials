  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and effective to give thioctic acid and
      deprenyl (selegiline hydrochloride), alone or in combination, to HIV-infected patients who
      have mild to moderate dementia (a decline in their mental abilities).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized to receive thioctic acid alone, deprenyl alone, thioctic
      acid/deprenyl, or placebo alone for 10 weeks, after which all patients may receive active
      drug on an open-label basis. Patients must have seven clinic visits.
