      A variety of hormones and immune system processes are responsible for how the body responds
      to illness. This study concentrates on how the hormone cortisol effects the release of immune
      system factors called cytokines.

      Cortisol is a hormone produced in the adrenal glands as a response to stimulation from the
      pituitary gland. Abnormal levels of cortisol have been seen in several diseases such as
      depression and multiple sclerosis.

      Cytokines are factors produced by certain white blood cells. They act by changing the cells
      that produce them (autocrine effect), altering other cells close to them (paracrine), and
      effecting cells throughout the body (endocrine effect). Cytokines are important in
      controlling inflammation processes.

      In this study researchers would like to determine if changes in levels of hormones in the
      blood are associated with changes in cytokine levels. In addition, researchers would like to
      learn more about how cytokines respond to hormones in certain diseases.

      Many of the biochemical alterations observed in people suffering from major depression are
      changes in the concentrations and activity of components of the generalized stress response.
      These include the principal hypothalamic stimulus of pituitary-adrenal activation
      (corticotropin releasing hormone) and the locus ceruleus/norepinephrine system. The current
      study attempts to provide a clearer picture of the stability of changes during the acute
      illness, the treatment phase and the recovery process. We particularly wish to determine
      whether abnormalities in HPA axis perturbability in the well-state can be demonstrated, and
      if so how these are related to the acutely-ill state, since this information could provide a
      quantifiable phenotypic marker for depression.
