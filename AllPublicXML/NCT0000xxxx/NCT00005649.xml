      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel and capecitabine in treating
      women who have metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, response rate, and efficacy of combination therapy with
      paclitaxel and capecitabine as first or second line therapy in women with metastatic breast
      cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1
      and capecitabine orally twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for survival
      status every 3 months upon completion of treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
