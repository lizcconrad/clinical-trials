      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Vitamin C may increase the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide by
      making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to determine the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide plus vitamin C
      in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of arsenic trioxide when administered with ascorbic
           acid in patients with recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma.

        -  Determine the therapeutic efficacy of this treatment combination in these patients.

        -  Determine the expression of MDR and Bcl-xL genes and the intracellular levels of GSH in
           these patients before and after this treatment regimen and assess whether these measures
           have prognostic value.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of arsenic trioxide.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours and ascorbic acid IV over
           5-10 minutes on days 1-5 weekly for 5 weeks. Treatment continues every 7 weeks for up to
           6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of arsenic trioxide until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of
      3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive the MTD of arsenic trioxide with ascorbic acid as outlined
           above.

      Patients are followed monthly for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 31-43 patients (6-18 for phase I and 16-25 for phase II) will
      be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
