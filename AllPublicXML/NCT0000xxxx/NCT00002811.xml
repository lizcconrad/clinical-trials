      RATIONALE: Patients with xeroderma pigmentosum are more likely to develop skin lesions in
      sun-affected areas. These skin lesions, such as actinic keratoses, can develop into skin
      cancer. T4N5 liposome lotion may reduce actinic keratoses or other sun-induced skin damage in
      patients with xeroderma pigmentosum.

      PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to compare treatment using T4N5 liposome
      lotion with treatment using placebo in reducing actinic keratoses and other sun-induced skin
      damage in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the safety and efficacy of T4N5 liposome lotion vs. a placebo lotion
      in reducing the incidence of actinic keratoses and protecting against other ultraviolet skin
      damage in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum.

      OUTLINE: Randomized, double-blind study. Groups of 6 patients are randomly assigned in a 2:1
      ratio to Arms I and II, respectively. Arm I: Chemoprevention. Lotion composed of T4
      endonuclease V protein encapsulated in liposomes and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline
      in a hydrogel base, T4N5 Liposome Lotion, T4N5. Arm II: Control. Liposomes suspended in
      phosphate-buffered saline in a hydrogel base, Placebo, PLCB.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 6-30 patients will be entered in this multicenter study.
