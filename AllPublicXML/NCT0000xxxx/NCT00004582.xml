  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if ABT-378/ritonavir plus efavirenz is safe and effective
      in lowering the amount of HIV in the blood of patients who have been treated with more than 1
      protease inhibitor (PI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients take ABT-378/ritonavir and efavirenz; there are no placebos in this study.
      Patients take study medications for 48 weeks, during which time there will be 15 study
      visits. There is a possibility of a study extension after 48 weeks.
