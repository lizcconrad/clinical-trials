      RATIONALE: Surgery to remove the tumor may be an effective treatment for rectal cancer. It is
      not yet known whether one type of surgery is more effective than another for rectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two types of surgery in
      treating patients who have rectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare local and distant recurrences in patients with mid-rectal cancer treated with
           wide mesorectal surgical excision with straight colorectal anastomosis versus total
           mesorectal surgical excision with colonic J pouch coloanal anastomosis.

        -  Compare the functional, physiological, and anatomical outcomes in these patients treated
           with these two surgical procedures.

        -  Compare disease-free survival and overall survival in these patients treated with these
           two surgical procedures.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      treatment center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo surgical resection with a wide mesorectal excision followed by a
           straight colorectal anastomosis.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo surgical resection with a total mesorectal excision followed by
           a colonic J pouch coloanal anastomosis. Patients then receive a temporary ileostomy
           which is closed 6 weeks later.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 4-6 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years,
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 800 patients (400 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
