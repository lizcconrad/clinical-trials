      BACKGROUND:

      This was a continuation of a prospective study of the ability of ambulatory blood pressure to
      predict cardiovascular morbidity in patients with mild hypertension, which was first started
      in 1978.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Predictor variables evaluated at entry to the longitudinal study included clinic and
      ambulatory blood pressures (including measures of pressure level and variability in different
      settings), left ventricular mass index (LVMI, determined by echocardiography), renin-sodium
      profile, and other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., cholesterol and smoking). During
      follow-up, blood pressure, treatment status, BMI, and clinical course were evaluated. Outcome
      measures were definite cardiovascular morbid events, defined as sudden cardiac death,
      myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery
      revascularization. The main hypotheses tested were that ambulatory blood pressure would give
      a better prediction of outcome than clinic pressure, and that patients with white coat
      hypertension (defined as a high clinic pressure and normal ambulatory pressure) would be at
      low risk relative to patients with sustained hypertension. Initial results in 729 patients
      initially studied between 1978 and 1985 using Cox survival analysis showed that the four most
      significant predictors of morbid events were daytime blood pressure variability, age, male
      sex, and serum cholesterol. Patients with white coat hypertension appeared to be at a level
      of risk intermediate between normotensives and sustained hypertensives, but the differences
      were not yet significant. Expansion of the cohort size to include patients evaluated
      initially between 1985 and 1990 provided nearly 2,000 patients altogether, which together
      with the longer follow-up of the initial cohort provided a sufficient number of morbid events
      to identify the predictive significance of the different blood pressure measures, and their
      interaction with other risk factors.
