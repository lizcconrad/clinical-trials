      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who
      have advanced cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, tolerance, and maximum tolerated dose of TG4010 in
      patients with MUC1 positive advanced cancer. II. Determine the biological and immunological
      effects of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive TG4010 IM weekly for 4 weeks,
      every other week for 8 weeks, and then every 4 weeks. Treatment continues every 4 weeks in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of TG4010 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 patients experience treatment related
      grade 3 toxicity. If any patient experiences grade 4 toxicity, the prior dose level is
      considered the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 months.
