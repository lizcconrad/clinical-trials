  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PRIMARY: In Phase I, to define a broadly tolerable dose of isotretinoin that can be used in
      combination with interferon alfa-2a (IFN alfa-2a). In Phase II, to determine trends in
      efficacy of isotretinoin alone or in combination with IFN alfa-2a as chemoprevention
      (preventing progression or recurrence) of anal intraepithelial neoplasia ( AIN ) / squamous
      intraepithelial lesions ( SIL ) in patients with HIV infection.

      SECONDARY: To evaluate the effects of isotretinoin alone or in combination with IFN alfa-2a
      on immune function markers, human papillomavirus (HPV) type, and HPV DNA levels.

      Patients with HIV infection have a significant risk of recurrence following local ablation of
      intraepithelial neoplasia; thus, anogenital epithelial may become an increasingly important
      cause of morbidity, and possibly mortality, as the HIV epidemic matures. Clinical studies of
      non-HIV-infected subjects have established that synthetic retinoids inhibit the progression
      of epithelial preneoplastic conditions and some neoplastic states.

      Patients with HIV infection have a significant risk of recurrence following local ablation of
      intraepithelial neoplasia; thus, anogenital epithelial may become an increasingly important
      cause of morbidity, and possibly mortality, as the HIV epidemic matures. Clinical studies of
      non-HIV-infected subjects have established that synthetic retinoids inhibit the progression
      of epithelial preneoplastic conditions and some neoplastic states.

      In the Phase I portion of the study, 20 patients per site each receive isotretinoin in
      escalating doses. If a patient experiences grade 2 or worse toxicity (or grade 3 or worse
      hypertriglyceridemia), dose is reduced to the previously tolerated dose for the remainder of
      the 6 week period. Patients are then reassessed for anal neoplasia; those with no progression
      and no grade 2 or worse toxicity receive an additional 6 weeks of isotretinoin in combination
      with interferon alfa-2a. For Phase II of the study, a separate group of patients who have
      undergone ablative therapy are randomized to one of three arms (26 patients/arm):
      isotretinoin alone at the dose tolerated by at least 60 percent of patients in Phase I;
      isotretinoin plus interferon alfa-2a; or observation only. Treatment continues for 48 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  PCP prophylaxis (required for patients with CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/mm3).

          -  Chemoprophylaxis for candidiasis and herpes simplex.

          -  Metronidazole for up to 14 days.

          -  Erythropoietin.

        Patients must have:

          -  HIV seropositivity.

          -  NO active opportunistic infection requiring treatment with prohibited drugs.

          -  Phase I - Current grade 1 AIN (i.e., low grade SIL) OR treated or untreated grade 2 or
             3 AIN (i.e., high grade SIL).

        Phase II - Prior histologically confirmed grade 2 or 3 AIN / high grade SIL, with ablative
        therapy within the past 30-90 days.

          -  Capability of complying with study protocol.

        NOTE:

          -  The terms condyloma, grade 1 AIN, and low grade SIL are interchangeable. Grade 2 or 3
             AIN is interchangeable with high grade SIL.

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms or conditions are excluded:

          -  Active medical problems for which the patient is undergoing evaluations or for which
             prohibited therapy is required.

          -  Other active malignancies requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Significant symptomatic cardiac disease.

        NOTE:

          -  Patients with malignancies being managed with local therapy (e.g., Kaposi's sarcoma,
             basal cell carcinoma) may enroll at the discretion of the site investigator.
