      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effectiveness of nimodipine versus magnesium sulfate in the prevention of
      eclamptic seizures in patients with severe preeclampsia.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, international, multicenter study. Patients are
      randomized to receive either nimodipine or magnesium sulfate.

      Arm I: Patients receive nimodipine by mouth every 4 hours. Treatment is continued until 24
      hours post-partum.

      Arm II: Patients receive a loading dose of magnesium sulfate IV for 20 minutes, followed by
      continuous infusion of magnesium sulfate. Treatment is continued until 24 hours post-partum.
