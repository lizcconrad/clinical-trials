      To develop TI (pronounced 'T-sub-I'), a personal computer program to analyze time-varying
      data generated by periodic patient reports, repeatedly-observed disease signs, or serial
      biomarkers to study chronic disease.

      BACKGROUND:

      With the advent of quasi-likelihood, generalized estimating equations, and new ways to handle
      missing data, has come a striking increase in applicable models, perhaps more than after the
      1972 introduction of the Cox model for survival data. TI provided a way to analyze the data.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      TIl provided graphics for data exploration and model validation. TI ran under most current
      version of Windows, used Civilized Software's MLAB as its programming language, offered
      context-sensitive help, a dictionary of relevant terms, identification of file entries from
      their screen position, and simple animation. TI permitted the user to analyze time-varying
      data from the two perspectives of repeated measured using a variety of models and time series
      where both time and frequency domain tools were provided.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
