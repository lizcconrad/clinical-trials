      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel in treating women who have
      ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer that has not responded to previous
      treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the activity of docetaxel in women with platinum resistant, refractory ovarian
           epithelial or primary peritoneal serous cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving complete response (CR) receive a minimum of 6 courses of therapy, including 2
      courses beyond CR.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
