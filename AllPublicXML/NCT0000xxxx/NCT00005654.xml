      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether reduction of serum insulin levels by metformin increases ovulatory
      response to clomiphene or spontaneous ovulation in obese women with polycystic ovary
      syndrome.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study.
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      Patients receive oral metformin (arm I) or oral placebo (arm II) three times daily for 8
      weeks. All patients who do not ovulate by day 28 receive oral clomiphene citrate daily on
      days 36-40.
