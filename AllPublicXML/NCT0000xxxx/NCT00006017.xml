      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. It is not yet known which regimen of rebeccamycin analogue is more
      effective in treating non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of two rebeccamycin analogue
      regimens in treating patients who have stage IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy, in terms of response rate, in patients with advanced or recurrent
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with rebeccamycin analogue via 1 infusion vs 5 daily
           infusions every 3 weeks.

        -  Compare the response duration in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity profiles of these two regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      performance status (0 or 1 vs 2) and participating center. Patients are randomized to one of
      two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment for
           both arms repeats every 3 weeks for 6-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-64 patients (18-32 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      at a rate of 3-4 patients per month.
