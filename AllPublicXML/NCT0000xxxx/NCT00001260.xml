  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect and study the brain tissue of deceased individuals to
      learn more about the nervous system and mental disorders. Information gained from donated
      tissue may lead to better treatments and potential cures for nervous system and mental
      disorders.

      This study will ask relatives of deceased individuals to donate the brains of their deceased
      relatives to allow further study of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We do not accept
      prospective donations.

      The knowledge of how affected tissue deviates from normal control tissue is an integral part
      of fully understanding a neurological or psychiatric disorder. The purpose of this protocol
      is to establish a coordinating program with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in
      Washington, DC, the Virginia Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Central District, and
      Virginia the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Northern District for the donation of
      brain tissue.

      Dissected brain tissue from selected brain regions, including but not limited to the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampal formation, will be assembled from large
      cohorts of normal controls and schizophrenic subjects. The expression of mRNA and protein for
      selected molecules, chosen on the basis of their genetic association with schizophrenia, will
      be measured with a variety of assays including but not limited to qPCR and Western blots.

      Outcome measures are the statistical comparison within normal controls of mRNA and/or protein
      levels in groups segmented by genotype. Similar comparisons will be made between
      schizophrenic cohorts and normal controls, in a diagnosis by genotype analysis with an ANOVA,
      or when appropriate an ANCOVA (controlling for variables such as age, race, gender, and
      postmortem interval).

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Brain tissue is needed from individuals suffering from a variety of neuropsychiatric
        disorders, especially schizophrenia, but also anxiety disorders, suicide, bipolar disorder,
        depression, Tourette's Syndrome, drug addictions (PCP, cocaine, alcohol, heroin or the
        like) and any form of dementia. In addition, brains from normal individuals without a
        history of neuropsychiatric disease will be needed for controls.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        No living subjects are enrolled in this protocol. Tissue is obtained after death, with the
        permission of next of kin, or from existing institutions with appropriate samples via an
        MTA or other applicable agreement.

        Brain tissue is excluded from collection if there is a previously known history of strokes,
        lesions, or other major neuropathological abnormalities prior to the consenting process.
