  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phantom pain refers to the sensation of pain felt by patients who have had a limb amputated.
      The treatment of phantom pain is often disappointing and is unable to provide adequate relief
      to the patients. The area of the brain involved (posterior parietal cortex [PPC]) is found on
      the opposite side of the amputated limb. For example, if a patient has the right arm
      amputated, the left posterior parietal cortex is involved in the phantom pain.

      Researchers believe that if they can decrease activity in the posterior parietal cortex they
      may be able to reduce phantom pain.

      Researchers plan to use low frequency (1 Hz) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to
      decrease the excitability of the PPC opposite the side of the amputated limb. TMS involves
      the placement of a cooled electromagnet with a figure-eight coil on the patient's scalp and
      turning on the magnetic flux. This permits non-invasive, relatively localized stimulation of
      the surface of the brain (cerebral cortex). When an area of the brain is stimulated a period
      follows when that area cannot be stimulated again. In this case, researchers plan to use TMS
      to stimulate the PPC in order to decrease the level of excitability there.

    <textblock>
      Phantom pain is a chronic painful condition that affects patients with amputations. Treatment
      for phantom pain is often disappointing. In amputees, hyperexcitability of the posterior
      parietal cortex area (PPC) contralateral to the side of the amputation has been linked with
      the presence of phantom sensations. PPC is an area overactive in different forms of chronic
      pain too. It is therefore conceivable that downregulation of activity in PPC could improve
      phantom limb pain, a condition poorly responsive to available treatments. We have previously
      demonstrated that low frequency TMS (1 Hz) results in decreased excitability of the
      stimulated cortical regions. We plan to apply low-frequency TMS to PPC cortical areas
      contralateral to the side of the amputated limb. We expect that this intervention will result
      in amelioration of the phantom pain. Stimulation of the PPC area (target intervention) will
      be compared with a control intervention in which TMS is directed slightly away from the head.
