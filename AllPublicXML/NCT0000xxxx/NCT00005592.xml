      RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and deliver radiation to
      them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab and ibritumomab tiuxetan in
      treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy and safety of rituximab and ibritumomab tiuxetan
      radioimmunotherapy in patients with refractory or relapsed, low-grade, follicular, or
      transformed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1 and 8
      immediately followed by IDEC-In2B8 IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive
      ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes on day 8. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2
      years and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 400 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>For the first treatment, 250 mg/m2 Rituxan infusion and injection of IDEC-In2B8 (Indium- radioactive label) is given. If therapy is continued, approximately 1 week later a second infusion of Rituximab (250 mg/m2) is given followed by an infusion of IDEC-Y2B8 (Yttrium-radioactive label).</description>

    <description>IDEC-Y2B8 is a mouse monoclonal antibody with small particles of radioactivity that join to the CD20 antigens on lymphoma cells. It is used to deliver radiation therapy to kill lymphoma cells. This is a one time intravenous infusion for eligible patients and is given over a ten-minute time period.</description>

    <description>Rituxan is a mouse/human monoclonal antibody and reacts with the CD20 antigens found on lymphoma cells and causes the body's immune system to destroy the lymphoma cells. It is infused at a dose of 250 mg/m2 followed by a second infusion approximately one week later of the same dose.</description>

    <description>IDEC-In2B8 is a mouse monoclonal antibody that contains Indium, routinely used in nuclear medicine. It is given as a one-time intravenous injection over a ten-minute time period immediately following a Rituxan infusion. The physician will then be able to see and evaluate the location and concentration of the antibody in the body.</description>

        follicular, or transformed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) Prior rituximab allowed if
        no response achieved CD20-positive B-cells in lymph nodes or bone marrow required for small
        lymphocytic or transformed NHL Less than 25% of bone marrow cellularity in lymphoma cells

        myeloablative therapy with bone marrow transplantation or peripheral blood stem cell rescue

        classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The
        terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former terminology of
        &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former
        terminology.

        Radiotherapy: See Biologic therapy At least 3 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered
        No prior external beam radiotherapy to more than 25% of active bone marrow (involved field
        or regional) Surgery: At least 4 weeks since prior major surgery (other than diagnostic)
