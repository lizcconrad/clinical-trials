      The purpose of this study is to determine the HPA axis and adrenergic system activation in
      response to cocaine administration.

      The goal of this study was to investigate the role of sympathetic-adrenal medullary (SAM) and
      hy0pothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) systems in mediating the addictive effects of cocaine. A
      toal of 6 male subjects were enrolled for this 5 day inpatient study. Subjects were assigned
      to either cocaine (32mg /70kg iv) or placebo (saline iv) treatment during the first
      experimental sessions and were crossed over to the alternative treatment during the second
      experimental session. Endpoints that were followed during the experimental sessions included
      neuroendocrine (serum epinephrine, norepinephrine and cortisol levels), physological (heart
      rate/blood pressure, EKG) and subjective measures (Beck Depression Inventory, Craving
      Questionnaire). We hypothesized that cocaine administration would lead to increased blood
      levels of norpinephrine, epinephrine and cortisol in cocaine dependent subjects.
