      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of
      gemcitabine and topotecan in treating patients with refractory or recurrent ovarian or
      fallopian tube cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated doses of the combination of gemcitabine and topotecan
           administered with and without filgrastim (G-CSF) in patients with refractory ovarian or
           fallopian tube cancer.

        -  Describe and quantitate the clinical toxicities of these regimens in this patient
           population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and topotecan IV over 30
      minutes on days 2-4. Some patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 9-14.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 5-10 courses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose below that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Dose escalation of gemcitabine then continues in
      cohorts of 3-6 patients until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose below
      that at which 2 of 6 patients experience DLT.

      Patients are followed every 2-3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
