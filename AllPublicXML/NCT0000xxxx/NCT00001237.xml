  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major improvements in the treatment of childhood non-lymphoblastic lymphomas have taken place
      in the last ten years. Though the survival rate in low risk patients (i.e., those with stage
      I &amp; II disease and serum LDH of less than 350 IU/dL) was as high as 90% with the previous
      Pediatric Branch protocol, only 32% of patients in the high risk group achieved long term
      remission. The present protocol is designed to improve survival in the high risk group by
      using alternating non-cross resistant drug regimens. We plan to determine whether using
      granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in this group would increase
      dose-intensity and ameliorate myelotoxicity. We also plan to study the effect on survival of
      decreasing the duration of treatment to three months from the present year-long therapy in
      low-risk patients.

        High Risk Protocol: Patients with small non-cleaved (Burkitt or Burkitt-like) or diffuse
        large cell lymphomas except those with:

        a) Minimal extra-abdominal tumor as the sole site of disease and a serum LDH less than 1.5
        times the upper limit of normal (NIH patients, less than 350 U/L) or except those with b)
        completely resected small, localized abdominal mass (involved segmental lymph nodes
        permitted) and a serum LDH level less than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (NIH patients
        less than 350 U/L).

        All patients with small non-cleaved (Burkitt or Burkitt-like) or diffuse large cell
        lymphomas with a serum LDH level greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (NIH
        patients, greater than 350 U/L), regardless of the clinically documented extent of disease.

        All patients with small non-cleaved (Burkitt or Burkitt-like) or diffuse large cell
        lymphomas with testicular involvement.

        Low risk protocol: Patients with small non-cleaved (Burkitt or Burkitt-like) or diffuse
        large cell lymphomas with a) minimal extra-abdominal disease as the sole site of disease
        and a serum LDH less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (NIH patients, less than 350
        U/L) or b) completely resected small, localized abdominal mass (involved segmental lymph
        nodes permitted for gastrointestinal disease) and a serum LDH level less than 1.5 times the
        upper limit of normal (NIH patients, less than 350 U/L).

        No patients with lymphoblastic lymphomas, low grade or follicular lymphomas.

        No patients with peripheral T cell lymphomas that do not fall into the category of
        anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

        No patients with a previously documented lymphoma or histological evidence of co-existing
        lymphoma of other histology.

        No patients who have been previously treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

        No patients with HIV infection.

        No patients above the age of 60 years.

        No patients with a history of inherited or non-HIV acquired immunodeficiency syndromes.
