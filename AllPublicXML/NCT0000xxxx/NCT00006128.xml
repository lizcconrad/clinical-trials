      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the relationship of closed head injury (CHI) severity, focal brain
      lesions, and the age at injury to the development of working memory, inhibition, and
      metacognitive skills in children or adolescents with CHI of varying severity.

      II. Assess the development of working memory, inhibition, and metacognitive skills in
      relation to discourse functions, scholastic achievement, and adaptive behavior in these
      patients.

      III. Determine the relationship between impaired inhibition, metacognitive skills, and the
      emergence of psychiatric disorder in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to one of two study
      groups based on when the closed head injury (CHI) occurred.

      Study I (CHI that occurred at least 3 years ago): Patients undergo standardized and computer
      based testing of cognition, attention, planning ability, organizational ability, memory, fine
      motor functioning, reading and math skills, language, and behavioral and emotional
      functioning on day 1. Patients then undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the
      same day. While each patient undergoes testing, the patient's parent/guardian answers
      interview questions regarding the patient's functional and emotional status since the injury,
      and the family's functional status, exposure to stressful events, and psychiatric history.
      Prior to the visit, a questionnaire regarding classroom behaviors, such as ability to focus
      in school and perform class work, is mailed to each patient's teacher.

      Study II (recently diagnosed CHI): Patients undergo neurobehavioral and psychological testing
      as in study I once during hospitalization or soon after discharge, and then at 3, 6, 12, and
      24 months. Patients undergo brain MRI at 3 months. While each patient undergoes testing, the
      patient's parent/guardian answers interview questions as in study I. Prior to each visit, the
      same questionnaire as in study I is mailed to each patient's teacher.

      Both studies: A brief written summary of the patient's test results may be provided to the
      patient, parent/guardian, school, pediatrician, or other professional at the request of the
      patient and parent/guardian.
