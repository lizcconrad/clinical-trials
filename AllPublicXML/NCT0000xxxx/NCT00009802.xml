      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Calcitriol may increase the effectiveness of paclitaxel by making
      tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining calcitriol with paclitaxel in
      treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxic effects and maximum tolerated dose of calcitriol when combined with
           paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the effect of administration of calcitriol on the pharmacokinetics of
           paclitaxel in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of administration of paclitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of
           calcitriol in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of calcitriol.

      During course 1, patients receive oral calcitriol daily on days 1-3 of weeks 1-6 and
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 of week 1 and day 3 of weeks 2-6. During course 2 and
      subsequent courses, patients receive oral calcitriol daily on days 1-3 and paclitaxel IV over
      1 hour on day 3 of weeks 1-6. Treatment continues every 8 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of calcitriol until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the highest dose giving an estimated
      probability of dose-limiting toxicity of no more than 0.30.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
