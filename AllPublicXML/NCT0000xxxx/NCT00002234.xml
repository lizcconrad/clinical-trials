  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive a treatment regimen of adefovir dipivoxil, didanosine, efavirenz, and
      lamivudine for 48 weeks. During the study, patients are evaluated for changes from baseline
      in plasma HIV-1 RNA and lymphocyte subsets and for the development of adverse experiences and
      laboratory toxicities. At Weeks 8, 12, 24, and 48, patients are assessed for adherence to
      study treatment with a questionnaire. Patients who experience virologic failure are
      discontinued from the study. Patients who experience treatment intolerance may have their
      antiretroviral treatment regimens changed. After Week 48, patients with documented virologic
      response are eligible to continue receiving study treatment.
