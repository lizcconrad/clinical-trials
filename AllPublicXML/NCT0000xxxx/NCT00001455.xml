  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron overload (hemochromatosis) is a condition which causes the intestines to take too much
      iron into the body from food or pills. The extra iron can build up in the liver, heart,
      joints, pancreas, sex organs, and other organs. Patients with iron overload can feel well
      initially, but the iron will eventually damage organs and may lead to an early death. The
      condition is believed to be passed down from generation to generation. Many studies have been
      conducted on the condition as it affects Caucasian Americans, few have addressed the
      condition in African Americans.

      Researchers believe it is important to find out as much as possible about the iron overload
      in African Americans. The goal of this study is to determine the pattern of inheritance of
      primary iron overload in African American families and to identify the genetic defect causing
      the condition.

      The study will use various tests from simple blood testing (transferritin saturation and
      serum ferritin levels) to complex genetic tests (segregation analysis and polymerase chain
      reaction [PCR]). The tests will help researchers deterimine iron levels in the blood,
      presence of antigens that may help trace inheritance, and detect changes in genes that are
      known to cause iron overload in Caucasians.

      The study may not directly benefit the patients participating in it. However, this study may
      lead to improved methods to diagnose iron overload in the African American population as a
      whole.

      The purpose of this project is to determine the pattern of inheritance of primary iron
      overload in African American families and to identify the genetic defect. The iron status of
      index subjects and family members will be determined by measuring transferrin saturation and
      serum ferritin, and the genetic pattern will be studied with segregation analysis. The
      chromosomal localization of the iron-loading locus will be pursued by determining HLA
      haplotypes, by testing for HFE gene mutations, by sequencing portions of genes for molecules
      involved in iron metabolism, by analyzing polymorphisms in these genes by PCR, by employing
      molecular methods to screen the genome, and by testing for linkage to iron phenotype with lod
      scores. Loci for proteins important in iron metabolism will be examined as candidate genes.
