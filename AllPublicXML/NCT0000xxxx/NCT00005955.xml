      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide followed by radiation
      therapy in treating children who have newly diagnosed malignant central nervous system
      tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate to treatment with temozolomide in children with newly
           diagnosed malignant central nervous system tumors.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this treatment in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival in these patients for 18 months following the study after
           receiving this treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of disease (ependymoma vs brain stem
      glioma vs malignant glioma vs other).

      Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum
      of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a
      partial or complete response may receive an additional 8 courses of temozolomide following
      radiotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 100 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      over 24-36 months.
