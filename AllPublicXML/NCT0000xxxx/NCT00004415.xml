      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether combined intercostal muscle and diaphragm pacing can
      maintain full-time ventilatory support in patients with ventilatory dependent quadriplegia
      who are not candidates for phrenic nerve pacing alone.

      II. Evaluate the efficacy of the Medlink device to produce synchronous intercostal and
      diagram activation in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients have a Medlink spinal cord electrode surgically implanted and
      attached to a radiofrequency receiver implanted subcutaneously over the anterior chest wall.

      If substantial inspired volumes can be generated by intercostal pacing, a phrenic nerve cuff
      electrode and radiofrequency receiver are implanted, and patients undergo combined
      intercostal muscle and diaphragm pacing.
