      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin plus etoposide in
      treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity, and safety of
      nitrocamptothecin when administered with etoposide in patients with advanced solid tumors.
      II. Determine the changes in expression and activity of topoisomerase I and II which occur
      during administration of this treatment regimen in these patients. III. Determine the plasma
      pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in these patients. IV. Compare the hematologic and
      nonhematologic toxicities with this treatment regimen in patients 70 years of age and older
      versus patients younger than 70 years of age.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of nitrocamptothecin. Patients receive oral
      nitrocamptothecin on days 1-3 and oral etoposide on days 4-5 each week. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients
      receive escalating doses of nitrocamptothecin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until toxicities resolve.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40-60 patients will be accrued for this study over 18 to 24
      months.
