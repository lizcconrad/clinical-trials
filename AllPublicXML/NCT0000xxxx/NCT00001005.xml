  <brief_title>A Study of Zidovudine Plus Interleukin-2 in HIV-Infected Patients Who Have No Symptoms of Infection But Who Have Tender Lymph Nodes</brief_title>

      AMENDED: To investigate whether subcutaneous (SC) injection of IL-2 produces biological
      responses which parallel those observed with IV dosing. Original design: To evaluate the
      short-term effects of combined administration of zidovudine (AZT) and increasing doses of
      recombinant interleukin-2 (aldesleukin; IL-2) in patients infected with HIV, who have
      lymphadenopathy, but who are otherwise asymptomatic (no other symptoms). The first phase of
      this clinical trial will establish maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ). How quickly the drugs get
      into the blood and how long they remain there (pharmacokinetics) will also be studied at each
      dose as well as the effect on HIV.

      Since AZT has no effect on cells that contain inactive virus (latently infected cells) and
      these cells may act as viral reservoirs, that a second agent that can destroy these infected
      cells would be useful in combination with AZT. The different activities of AZT and IL-2, as
      well as the non-overlapping nature of their mechanisms of action and toxicity, increase the
      theoretical benefits of combining AZT, a drug which has clinically significant activity in
      HIV-related disease but cannot eliminate infected cells, with IL-2, a drug which may enhance
      anti-HIV immunity, destroy chronically infected cells, and allow immune recognition of
      latently infected cells.

      HIV-related disease but cannot eliminate infected cells, with IL-2, a drug which may enhance
      anti-HIV immunity, destroy chronically infected cells, and allow immune recognition of
      latently infected cells.

      Five patients who have already received and tolerated oral AZT for at least 8 weeks continue
      their AZT treatment and at the same time receive IL-2 on a schedule of 5 days on the drug, 2
      days off the drug. The IL-2 is administered by 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion according
      to this schedule for 4 weeks. The first week of IL-2 treatment is on an inpatient basis and
      the remaining 3 weeks are on an outpatient basis. Toxicity is monitored every week. Maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the maximum dose at which 3 out of 5 patients experience
      Grade 3 or above toxicity during the course of IL-2 administration. A second cohort of five
      patients will receive IV IL-2. If the MTD is not reached, five additional patients will
      receive IV IL-2. All five patients in a given cohort must complete a full 4-week course of
      IL-2 before subsequent patients are entered at the next higher dose level. After IV dosing is
      completed at these three levels, additional 5-patient cohorts receive subcutaneous (SC) IL-2
      according to the same schedule. Each patient is restricted to one dosage group. Patients are
      treated and followed for a total of 24 weeks. Patients receive ibuprofen for fever and
      chills.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Necessary topical agents, including nystatin or clotrimazole, as well as acyclovir.
             Patients on medications without which the patient would be placed at significant risk
             (seizures, diabetic control, respiratory embarrassment) may continue only at the
             discretion of the study pharmacologist.

        Patients must have:

          -  Asymptomatic HIV infection associated with lymphadenopathy.

          -  Walter Reed Stage II disease, with positive antibody to HIV confirmed by Western blot
             test.

             drugs or a drug likely to have antiretroviral effect.

          -  Major organ allograft.

          -  Significant cardiac or pulmonary disease or central nervous system (CNS) lesions.
