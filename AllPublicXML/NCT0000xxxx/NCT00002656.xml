      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy with pyrazoloacridine in
      treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the antitumor activity of pyrazoloacridine (PZA) administered by
      3-hour infusion to patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). II. Determine
      the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of PZA administered on this schedule. III.
      Determine the response and survival durations of NSCLC patients treated with PZA.

      OUTLINE: Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Pyrazoloacridine, PZA, NSC-366140.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: If 2 or 3 responses are observed in the first 18 evaluable patients, 12
      additional patients will be entered. Accrual is expected to take 5-12 months.

Depending on the prior cycle toxicity the dose should be escalated, maintained or reduced, utilizing levels: -1, 0 (initial dose level), 1 - Level +1 (820mg/m2); Level 0 (750mg/m2); Level -1 (600mg/m2)</description>
