      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of human botulism immune globulin (BIG) in patients with
      infant botulism by monitoring side effects (e.g., rash, fever, hypotension, and anaphylaxis).

      II. Assess the efficacy of BIG in these patients by monitoring disease severity, incidence of
      complications (respiratory arrest, aspiration, pneumonia, etc.), and length of hospital stay.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients should begin therapy
      within 72 hours of hospital admission, but may receive human botulism immunoglobulin (BIG) in
      certain circumstances after 72 hours. Patients receive (BIG) IV. Patients are monitored for
      side effects, disease severity, complications, and length of hospital stay.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks after treatment, then every 4 weeks for 6 months.
