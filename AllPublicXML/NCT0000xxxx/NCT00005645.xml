      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ILX-295501 in treating patients who
      have stage III or stage IV ovarian cancer that has not responded to previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response in patients with refractory stage III or IV
      ovarian epithelial cancer treated with ILX-295501. II. Determine the number of patients with
      at least 50% decrease in CA125 when treated with this regimen. III. Determine the time to
      tumor progression, overall survival, and toxicity profile in this patient population treated
      with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral ILX-295501 once weekly for 3
      weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3
      months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-50 patients will be accrued for this study.
