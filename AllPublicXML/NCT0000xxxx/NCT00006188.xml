    <textblock>
      This study offers evaluation and treatment for patients with inflammatory eye diseases, such
      as uveitis. The protocol is not designed to test new treatments; rather, patients will
      receive current standard of care treatments. The purpose of the study is twofold: 1) to allow
      National Eye Institute physicians to increase their knowledge of inflammatory eye conditions
      and identify new avenues of possible research in this area; and 2) to establish a pool of
      patients who may be eligible for new studies as they are developed. (Participants in this
      protocol will not be required to join a new study; the decision will be voluntary.)

      Children and adults with uveitis and other inflammatory eye diseases may be eligible for this
      study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, brief physical examination,
      thorough eye examination and blood tests. The eye examination includes measurements of visual
      acuity (ability to see the vision chart), eye pressure and dilation of the pupils to examine
      the lens and retina (back part of the eye). Patients may also undergo the following
      procedures:

        1. Fundus photography - Special photographs of the inside of the eye to help evaluate the
           status of the retina and evaluate changes that may occur in the future. From 2 to 20
           pictures may be taken, depending on the eye condition. The camera flashes a bright light
           into the eye for each picture.

        2. Fluorescein angiography - Procedure to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye
           injected into an arm vein travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the
           retina are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures
           show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood
           vessel abnormality.

      Participants will be followed at least 3 years. Follow-up visits are scheduled according to
      the standard of care for the individual patient's eye problem. Vision will be checked at each
      visit, and some of the screening tests described above may be repeated to follow the progress
      of disease and evaluate the response to treatment.

      This &quot;Evaluation and Treatment Protocol&quot; will allow the uveitis specialists and ocular
      immunologists at the NEI to identify, follow and provide &quot;standard of care&quot; treatment to
      patients with uveitis and other intraocular inflammatory disorders. A primary purpose of the
      protocol is to accumulate a cohort of patients with uveitis or other intraocular inflammatory
      diseases for possible participation in new NEI clinical trials and epidemiological protocols.
      Also, by providing long-term follow-up and treatment for a variety of uveitic or other
      intraocular inflammatory disorders, the uveitis specialists and ocular immunologists at NEI
      will be better able to identify research hypotheses about these diseases in addition to
      maintaining their clinical skills. The availability of cohorts of patients with a spectrum of
      uveitic disorders will be valuable for the training of fellows in intraocular inflammatory
      disease, an important mission of the NEI. The ability to provide long-term follow-up and care
      will also facilitate referral efforts for new NEI protocols.

      The uveitis specialists at the National Eye Institute will be free to choose those ocular
      inflammatory conditions that interest them. However, the total number of patients that can be
      enrolled in the protocol will be restricted. This protocol is not designed to test any new
      treatments. Any evaluations or treatment under this protocol will be based on the current
      standard of care for each uveitic syndrome.

      Participants in this patient evaluation and treatment protocol will be evaluated for
      potential eligibility in any new NEI clinical trials or epidemiologic protocols as they are
      developed. If eligible, patients may be asked to participate in the new protocol. However,
      they will not be required to enter any protocol and their decision to participate will be
      entirely voluntary. No more than 150 patients will be accepted in this &quot;Evaluation and
      Treatment Protocol.&quot;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients are initially screened for NEI protocols under the NEI screening protocol or from
        the closeout of another protocol. Some of these patients will have a uveitic or other
        intraocular inflammatory condition that NEI staff wishes to follow and treat. Such patients
        can the be enrolled in this evaluation and treatment protocol. Each study participant must
        have the ability to understand and sign an informed consent form.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be excluded from this study if they are unable or unwilling to give informed
        consent or the are unwilling to be followed and treated at the NEI clinical center for at
        least the next 3 years.
