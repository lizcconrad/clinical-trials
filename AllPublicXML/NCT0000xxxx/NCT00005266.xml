  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To analyze cardiovascular disease mortality and total mortality in the NAS-NRC Twin Registry
      using a new methodology that allowed for censored observations of outcomes, environmental
      covariates, and unmeasured genotype-environment interactions.

      BACKGROUND:

      Methodologically, statistical methods in genetics and epidemiology have developed largely
      independently; and as a result, there seemed to be little communication between the two
      fields. Some of the most important hypotheses regarding familial aggregation of chronic
      diseases related to gene-environment interactions which drew on both fields. The method of
      analysis used in this study dealt simultaneously with survival time nature of the outcome
      variable, multiple and continuous environmental risk factors, and correlation in outcomes
      between related individuals.

      The study was supported by the Small Grants Program established by the National Heart, Lung,
      and Blood Institute in January 1990 to extend analyses of research data generated by clinical
      trials, population research, and demonstration and education studies.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Data available from two epidemiologic questionnaires administered ten years apart were used
      to determine the extent to which an increased familial risk in cardiovascular disease
      mortality among twins was mediated by similarities in behavioral risk factors such as
      smoking, diet, weight changes, physical activity, and socioeconomic variables. The
      contributions of genetic and environmental factors to twin similarities in health behavior
      were also examined.
