  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the effectiveness of a morphine-containing gel for reducing pain caused by
      pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores or pressure sores. We will apply the gel containing
      morphine, or the gel alone, directly onto painful pressure ulcers and compare the results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will apply a morphine-containing gel (or placebo) directly onto painful
      pressure ulcers. We will take participants off of any opioid-containing medications upon
      entry into the study. This allows us to measure any morphine that may enter into the
      bloodstream from the topically applied gel.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of the gel for pressure ulcer analgesia,
      as well as the systemic absorption of morphine from the topically applied gel. We will
      document the amount of pain medications taken by participants to determine whether the gel
      decreases the need for these drugs.
