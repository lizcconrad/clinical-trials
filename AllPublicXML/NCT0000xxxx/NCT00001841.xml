  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) is a method used to evaluate arteries and veins without
      the use of invasive catheters or x-rays (radiation). MRA technique has been continuously
      improving and has become more accurate at diagnosing problems of narrowing in blood vessels.
      However, MRA has a difficult time detecting narrowing in small blood vessels, limiting its
      use to large arteries.

      The purpose of this study is to recruit patients diagnosed with or suspected of having,
      atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) to participate in a series of new
      state-of-the-art diagnostic tests using MRA.

      This study is a combined effort between the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Uniformed
      Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), and General Electric Medical Services and
      is supported a Cooperative Research Agreement is to (CRADA).

      The goal of this study is to improve MRA to the point that it can reliably replace diagnostic
      x-ray catheter angiography in the evaluation of patients with atherosclerosis.

      Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) is a developing technology that
      permits the non-invasive evaluation of arterial and venous structures without the need for
      x-ray based catheter angiography. While dramatic progress has been made in the last few
      years, there are still substantial limitations in the accuracy of MRA in judging stenoses and
      detecting small accessory vessels. The purpose of this study is to recruit patients with
      suspected or documented atherosclerotic disease for evaluation with state-of-the-art MRA
      using new surface coils, new pulse sequence designs, novel contrast administration
      strategies, and advanced image processing algorithms. This work represents a collaboration
      between NIH, USUHS and General Electric Medical Systems and is supported by a Cooperative
      Research Agreement (CRADA). The goal of this pilot study is to improve MRA to the point that
      it can reliably replace diagnostic x-ray catheter angiography in the evaluation of patients
      with atherosclerotic disease.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients must live in the Metropolitan Washington Area.

        Patients must have suspected atherosclerotic disease based on clinical findings or
        documented by angiography or doppler ultrasound performed within 3 months of the MRA.

        Patients must be willing to participate in the protocol.

        Patients must be referred by a physician who is caring for the patient and to whom the
        results will be provided.

        Patients must be clinically stable and be judged by their physician able to come to the
        Clinical Center to participate in the study.

        Patients must have serum Creatinine value less than 3.0 mg/dl.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Any contraindication for MRI including:

        (a) pacemaker or other implanted electronic device; (b) cochlear implants; (c) metal in the
        eye; (d) embedded shrapnel fragments; (e) cerebral aneurysm clips; or (f) medical infusion
        pumps.

        Allergy to Gadolinium based contrast media.

        Unsatisfactory performance status as judged by the referring physician such that the
        patient could not tolerate an MRI scan. Examples of medical conditions that would not be
        accepted would include angina, dyspnea at rest, congestive heart failure, severe
        claudication (less than 1 flight of steps).

        Intercurrent illness that requires treatment that would be jeopardized by the MRA scan.

        Subjects requiring sedation for MRI studies.

        Pregnant female.

        Patients with severe back-pain who will be unable to tolerate supine positioning within the
        MRI scanner for the duration of the examination.
