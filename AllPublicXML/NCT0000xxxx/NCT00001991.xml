      To facilitate provision of atovaquone (566C80) to patients who have mild to moderate
      Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and are intolerant and/or unresponsive to trimethoprim /
      sulfamethoxazole (TMP / SMX ); to monitor serious adverse events attributable to 566C80.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must have the following:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of acute mild to moderate Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

          -  Dose-limiting intolerance to TMP / SMX or inadequate response to TMP / SMX.

          -  Willingness and ability to give informed consent. The clinical condition of the
             patient and appropriate physiologic criteria should be used in evaluating patients for
             therapy with 566C80. Patients who are rapidly progressing in disease severity or have
             severe disease as evidenced by sustained tachypnea (e.g., sustained respiratory rate &gt;
             30 breaths/minute), rapid deterioration in (A-a)DO2 and chest radiograph may not be
             appropriate candidates for oral therapy, including 566C80. Therapy with parenteral
             pentamidine should be undertaken in these cases. Treatment with IV trimetrexate or
             primaquine / clindamycin should be considered for these patients unless the patient is
             known to have dose-limiting intolerance to these agents. Patients with severe PCP who
             are intolerant and/or unresponsive to therapy with TMP / SMX and parenteral
             pentamidine may enroll in the 566C80 open-label compassionate plea protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients with the following prior conditions are excluded: History of serious or
        dose-limiting adverse experience during previous 566C80 therapy, thought to be attributable
        to the drug.
