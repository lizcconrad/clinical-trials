      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety and efficacy of synthetic dehydroepiandrosterone (GL701)
      in women with prednisone-dependent systemic lupus erythematosus.

      II. Describe the pharmacokinetics of GL701.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by
      participating institution.

      Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 doses of oral dehydroepiandrosterone or placebo,
      administered daily for a minimum of 7 months. A prednisone taper is attempted each month in
      patients with stable or improving disease. Therapy continues until a successful prednisone
      taper is achieved and sustained for at least 2 months, or until a maximum of 9 months.

      Patients are followed for 1 year after entry.
