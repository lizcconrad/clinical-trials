      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to
      give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase III trial to study the effectiveness of melphalan followed by peripheral stem
      cell transplantation in treating patients who have multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Administer standard, high dose melphalan safely in a closely monitored setting in
           patients with responsive multiple myeloma.

        -  Determine the cost and time effectiveness in the collection of sufficient peripheral
           blood stem cells (PBSC) for two high dose melphalan therapies and PBSC transplantations
           in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients not in remission receive 3-6 courses of remission induction therapy
      consisting of either an anthracycline/glucocorticoid regimen or high dose glucocorticoids.

      At 21-45 days following induction therapy, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously
      daily for 4 days followed by daily peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection beginning on
      day 4 and continuing until the target number of cells is reached.

      At 5 days to 6 weeks following PBSC collection, patients receive high dose melphalan IV over
      2 hours for 2 consecutive days. At 36-48 hours following completion of melphalan, patients
      receive infusion of PBSC followed by G-CSF subcutaneously daily until blood counts recover.

      At 3 months to 5 years following high dose therapy and PBSC infusion, patients with evidence
      of disease progression receive an additional treatment with high dose melphalan followed by
      PBSC infusion as in the first course.

      Patients are followed at 30-45 days, 6 months, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60-120 patients will be accrued for this study over 5 years.
