      This study will examine the effectiveness of the drug neurotropin in treating chronic pain
      after injury to a limb or a large nerve.

      Two groups of patients will participate in this study: patients with complex regional pain
      syndrome type 1, or CRPS-I (also called reflex sympathetic dystrophy) and patients with
      complex regional pain syndrome type 2, or CRPS-II. CRPS-I is pain that develops after
      relatively minor injury to an arm or leg, but lasts much longer and is much more severe than
      would normally be expected. CRPS-II is pain resulting from injury to a large nerve.
      Candidates will have a history and physical examination, blood tests, and electrocardiogram.
      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:

      Patients with CRPS I and II will receive an individualized regimen of physical therapy and
      standard treatment to control their pain. In addition, they will receive neurotropin or
      placebo tablets for 5 weeks, then no trial medicine for at least 1 week, and then the other
      trial drug for the next 5 weeks. That is, patients who took placebo the first 5 weeks will
      take neurotropin the second 5 weeks and vice versa. Neither the patients nor the doctors will
      know who received which drug during the two intervals until the study is over. Patients will
      complete questionnaires about their pain, quality of life, and ability to perform daily
      living activities. They will have various tests to measure pain (such as sensitivity to heat
      and cold, to an electric current, to a mild pin prick, etc.); to provide information about
      changes in their condition (such as tests of range of motion of joints and limb size); to
      measure blood circulation and sweating in the arm or leg (such as measurements of blood flow
      to the limb, skin temperature, and sweat production), and other procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD), re-named Complex Regional Pain Syndrome,
      type I (CRPS-I), have chronic, post-traumatic pain that spreads beyond the distribution of
      any single peripheral nerve without evidence of major peripheral nerve damage. A similar
      disorder, Causalgia, re-named CRPS-II, presents with clear evidence of nerve injury. No
      successful drug treatment exists for these disorders. Neurotropin is a non-protein extract of
      cutaneous tissue from rabbits inoculated with vaccinia virus. Neurotropin has been used
      extensively in Japan to treat RSD and other painful conditions; however, the drug has not
      undergone clinical therapeutic testing in the United States. This protocol is to carry out
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies about clinical efficacy of Neurotropin
      for acute pain in dental outpatients and for chronic pain in outpatients with CRPS-I or II.

    <description>Assessments of pain severity by the patient using a McGill Pain Questionnaire which consists of 3 major classes of word descriptors-sensory, affective and evaluative - that are used by patients to specify subjective pain experience. Each word chosen from descriptor responses to 20 questions is given a value and the sum of the values of the responses provides a score which is an index of the pain severity with a minimum value of 20 and a maximal value of 78. When it is difficult to recruit the patients, the interim analysis using these data is performed after completion of the study of first 16 patients (target number is 30). The data from 16 patients was analyzed while investigators are blinded to the treatment code (drug A or B) provided by the NIH pharmacy. Only after the analysis was completed was the code unblinded.

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        CRPS patients are referred with a diagnosis of CRPS-I or CRPS-II in one limb only, based on
        pain (1) that is post-traumatic and spread beyond the region of the injury; (2) has
        persisted for more than 2 weeks; and (3) is associated with swelling, altered skin color or
        skin temperature, altered sweating, allodynia or hyperesthesia or limitation of active
        movement. Atrophic changes in skin, hair loss or nail changes, or disuse atrophy of
        skeletal muscle may be present.

        Both sexes are to be studied.

        All ethnic and racial groups can participate.

        Patients must be willing to return to NIH for follow-up evaluation under this protocol.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Pregnant and lactating women are excluded.

        Based on the oral surgeon's postoperative diagnosis, any extraction which is classified as
        producing unusual surgical trauma will result in exclusion from the remainder of the study.

        Dental subjects will also be excluded if they are not adequately sedated by midazolam alone
        and require intraoperative administration of an opioid drug such as fentanyl,
        administration of greater than 14.4 ml of local anesthetic (2% lidocaine with 1:100,000
        epinephrine), or postoperative administration of a steroid for possible injury to the
        inferior alveolar nerve.

        Patients referred with CRPS-I or CRPS II who have abnormal screening test results or who
        have non-traumatic disorders to which pain may be attributed (gout, malignancy, arthritis,
        etc.) will be excluded.

        Any patients who have had ablative procedures for treatment of their neuropathic pain
        disorder will not be eligible for inclusion in this study.

        Patients who have a positive HIV result will be excluded.

        Subjects with obviously impaired mental capacity that precludes informed consent and
        ability to provide adequate self-ratings are to be excluded.

          <description>Assessments of pain severity by the patient using a McGill Pain Questionnaire which consists of 3 major classes of word descriptors-sensory, affective and evaluative - that are used by patients to specify subjective pain experience. Each word chosen from descriptor responses to 20 questions is given a value and the sum of the values of the responses provides a score which is an index of the pain severity with a minimum value of 20 and a maximal value of 78. When it is difficult to recruit the patients, the interim analysis using these data is performed after completion of the study of first 16 patients (target number is 30). The data from 16 patients was analyzed while investigators are blinded to the treatment code (drug A or B) provided by the NIH pharmacy. Only after the analysis was completed was the code unblinded. Placebo or Neurotropin&quot; in place of &quot;drug A or drug B.</description>
