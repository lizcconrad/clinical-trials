      To provide ganciclovir on a compassionate use basis to immunocompromised patients with
      serious cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections and to study safety and efficacy in this patient

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Topical acyclovir.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Mild to moderate cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections that fail to satisfy the clinical
             severity criteria.

          -  Transplant where a trial reduction of immunosuppressive drug treatment is not
             feasible.

          -  Congenital or neonatal CMV infections where there is not documented congenital or
             acquired immunodeficiency.

          -  Neutropenia unless it is pre-existing.

          -  Thrombocytopenia unless it is pre-existing.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Other myelosuppressive drugs such as cancer chemotherapy agents, interferon,
             foscarnet, or nucleoside analogs.

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Mild to moderate cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections that fail to satisfy the clinical
             severity criteria.

          -  Transplant where a trial reduction of immunosuppressive drug treatment is not
             feasible.

          -  Congenital or neonatal CMV infections where there is not documented congenital or
             acquired immunodeficiency.

          -  Neutropenia unless it is pre-existing.

          -  Thrombocytopenia unless it is pre-existing.

        Patients must be immunocompromised with a serious cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. This
        would include pneumonia, gastrointestinal disease, hepatitis, or other organ-specific
        disease or severe wasting syndrome. Patients with pre-existing neutropenia or
        thrombocytopenia, and immediate life-threatening disease can be included if the
        investigator believes that delay in starting ganciclovir therapy is not advisable. In such
        patients, the investigator must advise the patient of the risk of further marrow
        suppression and the increased risk of infection or bleeding; and the patient must sign an
        amended informed consent form.
