      The study's purpose is to improve alcoholism treatment by investigating the combined
      effectiveness of a psychotherapy (Coping Skills Training and Cue Exposure Treatment - CSTCET)
      with naltrexone in a randomized clinical trial. Individuals will receive 2 weeks of CSTCET or
      a control treatment as inpatients followed by 12 consecutive weeks of receiving either
      naltrexone or placebo as outpatients. Followups at 24, 48, and 72 weeks after treatment is
      completed.
