      To compare the safety, tolerance and efficacy of fluconazole and amphotericin B as treatment
      for biopsy proven fungal infections in major organs, disseminated infection, suspected fungal
      infection and fungemia in adult neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients without AIDS, AIDS
      related complex (ARC), or extensive burns. HIV seropositive patients are allowed only if they
      also have a malignancy.
