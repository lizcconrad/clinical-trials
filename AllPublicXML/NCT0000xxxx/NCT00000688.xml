  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide information about the usefulness and safety of giving injections of ganciclovir
      (DHPG) for treating peripheral cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis.

      CMV retinitis is an important sight-threatening opportunistic infection which affects 1 to 2
      out of every 10 patients with AIDS. Results from an earlier study suggest that about 80
      percent of patients with CMV retinitis will be helped by receiving intravenous doses of DHPG.

      CMV retinitis is an important sight-threatening opportunistic infection which affects 1 to 2
      out of every 10 patients with AIDS. Results from an earlier study suggest that about 80
      percent of patients with CMV retinitis will be helped by receiving intravenous doses of DHPG.

      Patients are randomly placed in one of two treatment groups. In one group, patients receive
      DHPG twice a day, intravenously, for 14 days, followed by a daily dose for 14 weeks. Patients
      in the other group (the delayed-treatment group) do not receive immediate treatment with
      DHPG. Patients in both groups have regular ophthalmologic (eye) evaluations with retinal
      photographs to see if the retinitis is getting worse. Patients in the delayed treatment group
      receive DHPG if this occurs.
