  <brief_summary>

      To evaluate, in HIV-negative volunteers, the safety and immunogenicity of ALVAC-HIV
      MN120TMGNP (vCP300) followed by or combined with boosting using rgp120/HIV-1SF2. To compare
      ALVAC-HIV vCP300 with ALVAC-RG rabies glycoprotein (vCP65) as a control. To evaluate an
      accelerated immunization schedule at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months versus 0, 1, 6, and 9 months.

      The combination of a live recombinant primer followed by a subunit boost has the potential to
      induce not only cytotoxic T lymphocytes but also neutralizing antibody.

      The combination of a live recombinant primer followed by a subunit boost has the potential to
      induce not only cytotoxic T lymphocytes but also neutralizing antibody.

      Volunteers are randomized to one of seven groups to receive immunizations with either
      ALVAC-HIV vCP300 or ALVAC-RG vCP65 (control), plus simultaneous or sequential boosting with
      rgp120/HIV-1SF2 or placebo. Immunizations are given at 0, 1, 6, and 9 months or 0, 1, 3, and
      6 months. Volunteers are followed for at least 24 months.

             to a remote (&gt; 6 months) treated infection are eligible.

          -  Prior psychiatric condition (such as history of suicide attempts or past psychosis)
             that precludes compliance.

          -  History of cancer unless there has been surgical excision that is considered to have
             achieved cure.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Live attenuated vaccines within 60 days prior to study entry. NOTE: Medically
             indicated killed or subunit vaccines (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal) do not exclude if
             administered at least 2 weeks from HIV immunizations.

          -  Experimental agents within 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Prior HIV vaccines.

          -  Prior rabies immunization.

        Prior Treatment:

        Excluded:

          -  Blood products or immunoglobulin within 6 months prior to study entry. Identifiable
             high-risk behavior for HIV infection, such as

          -  injection drug use within past 12 months.

          -  higher or intermediate risk sexual behavior.
