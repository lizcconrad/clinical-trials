      To characterize the safety profile of MDL 28574A following both acute and subchronic dosing
      in HIV-positive patients. To determine the MTD of both acute and subchronic doses of this
      drug when administered as oral solution. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of MDL
      28574A and castanospermine (from which MDL 28574A is derived) following both acute and
      subchronic dosing.

      In Part A of the study, patients receive a single oral dose of MDL 28574A on day 1 and are
      followed through day 7. In Part B, patients receive single daily doses of the drug on days 1
      through 14 and are followed through day 21.
