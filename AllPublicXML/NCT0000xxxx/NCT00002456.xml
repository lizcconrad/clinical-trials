      RATIONALE: Bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were
      destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells. Sometimes the transplanted cells can make
      an immune response against normal tissues. Methotrexate and cyclosporine may prevent this
      from happening.

      PURPOSE: Phase III trial to study the effectiveness of treatment with methotrexate and
      cyclosporine after bone marrow transplantation to provide protection against acute
      graft-versus-host disease.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of a combination of methotrexate and cyclosporine,
      administered after grafting, to prevent the development of acute graft versus host disease
      (GVHD) in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive methotrexate IV on days 1,3,6, and 11. Patients also receive
      cyclosporine IV twice a day until the patient is eating, then it is administered orally twice
      a day. Cyclosporine begins on day -1 and continues until day 180. The dose is reduced
      beginning on day 50.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Accrual will continue until further notice.
