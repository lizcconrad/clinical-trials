      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal doxorubicin in treating
      patients who have advanced stomach cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine overall survival, time to disease progression, objective reponse
      rate, safety profile, and quality of life in patients with inoperable gastric adenocarcinoma
      when treated with doxorubicin HCl liposome.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour every 4 weeks. Treatment
      continues for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
      Patients with responding disease may continue therapy past the 6 courses until documented
      disease progression. Quality of life is assessed prior to every treatment course. All
      patients are followed at 1 month. Patients with stable or responding disease are then
      followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months.
