    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety of giving antiviral therapy for HIV infection in a
      once-daily dosing schedule, and assess how well patients tolerate this regimen. A once a day
      dosing schedule may be easier for some people to follow than one that requires taking
      medicine 2 or 3 times a day. The ease of treatment is important, because not following the
      prescribed dosing regimen may make therapy less effective or ineffective.

      HIV-infected patients 18 years and older who have never been treated for their infection may
      be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a history and physical
      examination, including blood tests. Participants will take the following medications once a
      day: 1200 mg of amprenavir (8 capsules); 300 mg of ritonavir (3 capsules); 600 mg of abacavir
      (2 pills); and 300 mg of lamivudine (2 pills). Patients will have routine blood tests and be
      seen by a nurse or doctor, or both, at follow-up visits at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16; then
      every 8 weeks until week 48; and then every 3 months for up to 3 years. At week 2, a special
      blood test will be done over the course of a day to measure blood drug levels. For this test,
      blood samples will be drawn 8 times over a 24-hour period. A heparin lock (a device that
      allows the needle to remain in the vein) will be used to avoid multiple needle sticks.

      The development of a once-daily anti-retroviral regimen is a priority because regimen
      simplicity might enhance regimen adherence, and because a once-daily regimen would be useful
      for directly observed therapy. Pharmacokinetic modeling suggests that plasma levels of
      amprenavir in the presence of ritonavir, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome p450, should be
      high enough to support once-daily dosing. Lamivudine is currently being explored in other
      studies in once-daily dosing. Abacavir has not been used once daily but some in vitro studies
      suggest that such dosing might be appropriate. In this uncontrolled, open-label study,
      amprenavir 1200 mg daily, ritonavir 300 mg daily, lamivudine 300 mg daily, and abacavir 600
      mg daily will be administered to up to 25 HIV-infected, anti-retroviral naive patients. The
      objectives are to assess the tolerability and safety of this regimen; the plasma
      concentrations of amprenavir; and the anti-viral response. Study evaluations include
      percentage of patients who have discontinued the regimen by weeks 16 and 24 for toxicity,
      intolerance or failure; the number of grade 3 and 4 adverse events by weeks 16 and 24; the
      antiviral response at weeks 16, 24, and 48 (change from baseline and percentage of patients
      with viral load less than 50 copies and less than 400 copies per mL), and the number
      (percent) of patients with trough plasma concentrations of amprenavir above 280 ng/mL.

        method at screening.

        CD4 cell count above 200 cells per microliter at screen.

        No prior treatment with any anti-retroviral agent.

        Laboratory values at screen: hemoglobin greater than 9 g per dl; granulocyte count greater
        than 900 cells per microliter; platelet count greater than 80,000 cells per microliter; AST
        (SGOT) less than 151 U/L; creatinine less than 2 mg/dL.

        non-hormonal methods of birth control during study participation. Pregnancy test (blood or
        urine) must be negative within two weeks prior to dosing with study medications.

        assessment or compliance.
