      RATIONALE: Vaccines may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in
      treating patients with resected or locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and toxicity of vaccination with MUC-1 antigen and
      immunologic adjuvant SB AS-2 in patients with resected or locally advanced unresectable
      pancreatic cancer. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase II dose
      of MUC-1 antigen in this patient population. III. Determine the qualitative and quantitative
      tumor response to this treatment in these patients. IV. Determine the disease-free survival
      in resected patients, progression-free survival in locally advanced unresectable patients,
      and overall survival in all patients receiving this treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of MUC-1 antigen. Patients receive vaccination with
      MUC-1 antigen and immunologic adjuvant SB AS-2 intramuscularly on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for a total of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Beginning 1 year after the last vaccination, patients without recurrent disease may
      receive booster vaccines annually. Cohorts of 4 to 8 patients receive escalating doses of
      MUC-1 antigen until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 4 or 2 of 8 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
      Patients are followed at 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-20 patients will be accrued for this study.
