      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients
      who have stage IVB or recurrent cervical cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of arsenic trioxide in patients with stage IVB or recurrent
           cervical carcinoma.

        -  Determine the safety of this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-5. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study over 10-19
      months.
