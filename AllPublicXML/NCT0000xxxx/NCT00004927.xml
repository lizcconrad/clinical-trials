      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-247550 in treating patients who have
      advanced solid tumors that have not responded to previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicities, safety, and a
      recommended phase II dose of BMS-247550 administered as a 1 hour infusion every 3 weeks in
      patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of this drug in
      this patient population. III. Determine any preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of
      this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour every 3
      weeks. Treatment continues for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-247550 until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed
      every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-12
      months.
