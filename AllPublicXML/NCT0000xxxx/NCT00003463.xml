      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of carmustine wafers plus irinotecan in
      treating patients with recurrent supratentorial high grade gliomas.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Define the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan given in combination with Gliadel wafers
           (carmustine) in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma,
           or gliosarcoma.

        -  Define the toxicity of irinotecan given in combination with Gliadel wafers in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      All patients undergo surgical resection. At the time of surgery, up to eight Gliadel wafers
      (containing carmustine) are implanted in the resected tumor cavity.

      Cohorts of 3 patients each receive escalating doses of irinotecan IV over 90 minutes once
      weekly within 3 weeks after Gliadel wafer implantation. One course of treatment consists of 4
      weeks of irinotecan and 2 weeks of rest. If 1 patient experiences dose limiting toxicity
      (DLT) at a dose level, an additional 3 patients are entered at that same dose level. If 2
      patients experience DLT, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been surpassed and a total of 6
      patients are treated at the previous dose level. The MTD is defined as the highest dose in
      which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences DLT.

      Treatment continues for up to 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease
      progression.

      Patients are followed for at least 4 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients will be accrued into this study over 9 months.
