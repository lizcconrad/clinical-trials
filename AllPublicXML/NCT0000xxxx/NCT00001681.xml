  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The factors that influence HIV disease progression are not well understood. While larger
      amounts of circulating virus (high 'viral loads') predict future adverse clinical events,
      many of the clinical factors responsible for high viral loads and disease progression remain
      unknown. Certain clinical events and defined interventions are associated with increases in
      plasma viral RNA concentrations. One of these clinical interventions is immunization;
      immunization with several vaccines have been shown to increase plasma HIV RNA concentrations.
      Even though vaccination can lead to transient increases in plasma HIV concentrations, certain
      vaccines, including influenza vaccine, are still recommended for HIV patients because the
      risks of the disease targeted by the immunization are held to be greater than the
      immunization itself. Therefore, immunization with influenza vaccine can be considered a
      model, clinically indicated intervention, given at a known time which stimulates HIV
      replication. For influenza immunization, and for other treatments leading to increases in
      viral RNA concentrations is not available. We hypothesize that immunization with influenza
      vaccine, and perhaps other immune stimulatory events, lead to an increase in HIV replication
      through a regulatory system involving cytokines, signal transduction systems, transcription
      factors, effects on the cell cycle, and increased expression of additional gene products
      needed for viral replication, such as genes of the nucleic acid biosynthetic pathways. While
      experiments aimed at investigating one or another particular part of this regulatory system
      can be performed with traditionally available technologies, such technologies cannot provide
      comprehensive information concerning a large number of the regulatory events that may be
      involved in mediating the increase in HIV RNA concentration. In this protocol, we aim to
      develop the methodologies needed to determine changes in expression of many of the genes
      which may be involved in mediating the regulation of HIV expression in HIV-infected patients
      using cDNA microarray technologies. Once the methodologies are developed, such work may
      provide new insights into the regulatory systems controlling HIV expression in HIV-infected
      patients may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of HIV disease.
