  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study proposes to evaluate cognitive development in infants four months or younger by
      functional MRI and event related potential recording. fMRI imaging will be obtained following
      an auditory stimulus inside the 4 tesla magnet at the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research
      and will be correlated with ERP response to the same stimulus.
