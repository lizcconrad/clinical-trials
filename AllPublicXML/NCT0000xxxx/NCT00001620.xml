      This study allows the evaluation of subjects in order to determine their ability to safely
      participate in other active research studies.

      After subjects complete the screening process, they will be offered the opportunity to
      participate in an active research study, or if no appropriate studies are available
      information and recommendations will be provided for other treatment options.

      This protocol is designed for screening of subjects before a decision can be made as to their
      eligibility for one of the active Hematology Branch research protocols. Its purpose is to
      allow detailed investigation into the hematologic or oncologic problems of these subjects,
      and the status of other organ systems that would determine their ability to safely tolerate
      specific aspects of active research protocols. It allows investigation as to whether a donor
      is HLA matched, fit to receive G-CSF, and fit to undergo apheresis and therefore eligible to
      participate as a donor on a bone marrow transplant protocol. It also allows the investigation
      as to whether subjects are eligible for participation as normal volunteer based on protocol
      eligibility criteria that requires generally good health status by history or physical exam
      findings, or laboratory assessments. After completion of this screening process, the subject
      will either be offered a chance to participate in an active research protocol, or if no
      appropriate protocol is identified, subjects with hematologic or oncologic disease will have
      recommendations for other treatment options relayed to the primary or referring physician.

      Primary objective is to determine subject eligibility for participation on Hematology Branch
      protocols.

      Primary endpoint is the results of clinical, imaging and laboratory assessments.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will be entered on this protocol at the time of their first visit to the NIH
        Clinical Center outpatient clinic or inpatient service if:

        The subject carries the diagnosis of a disorder for which the Hematology Branch has an
        active research protocol, and based on information received from an outside physician,
        he/she appears to meet at least preliminary eligibility criteria for that protocol.

        OR

        The subject is a donor for a subject for which the Hematology Branch has an active stem
        cell transplant protocol and based on information received from an outside physician,
        he/she appears to meet preliminary eligibility as a donor.

        OR

        The subject is a normal volunteer for which the Hematology Branch has an active study
        recruiting healthy normal volunteers and he/she appears to meet preliminary eligibility as
        a normal volunteer.

        Age greater than or equal to 2.

        Weight greater than 12 kg. (Healthy Volunteer age greater than or equal to 8)

        The subject or the subject's guardian is capable of informed consent, and willing to sign
        the consent form after initial counseling by clinical staff. Separate consent forms for all
        interventional or surgical procedures will be obtained after explanation of the specific
        procedure.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All subjects not fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be considered ineligible.
