      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Giving chemotherapy drugs in different ways may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by
      surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy in treating patients who have locally advanced
      stomach cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy and toxicity of neoadjuvant cisplatin, fluorouracil,
      and docetaxel, and postoperative intraperitoneal floxuridine and leucovorin calcium in
      patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction.
      II. Determine whether molecular markers, including thymidylate synthase, excision repair
      cross complementing gene, and tubulin isoform 4B, for sensitivity to fluorouracil, cisplatin,
      and docetaxel, respectively, are predictive of outcome (disease free survival and overall
      survival) in these patients. III. Determine the quality of life of these patients treated
      with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: During weeks 1 and 4, patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed by
      cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1, and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-5.
      During weeks 6-8, patients undergo radical subtotal or total gastrectomy with a D2 lymph node
      dissection followed by percutaneous placement of an intraperitoneal port device. Beginning
      within 5 days after resection, patients with clear margins receive floxuridine and leucovorin
      calcium intraperitoneally on days 1-3 during weeks 1, 3, and 5 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed prior to beginning study,
      prior to surgery, then monthly for 3 months beginning after completion of study therapy, then
      every 3 months through year 2, and then every 6 months through year 3. Patients are followed
      monthly for 3 months, then every 3 months through year 2, and then every 6 months though year
      3.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
