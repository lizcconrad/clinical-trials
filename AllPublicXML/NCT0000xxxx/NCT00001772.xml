  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a mood (affective) disorder characterized by the occurrence of
      alternating feelings of excitement (mania) and depression. It is a common, but serious
      condition, and potentially life-threatening. Patients are considered to have a rapid cycling
      form of bipolar disorder if they experience four or more episodes of hypomania (mild degree
      of mania), mania, and/or depression. Approximately 20% of the patients in bipolar clinics
      have the rapid cycling form of the disorder. Therefore it can be said that RCBD is not a rare
      condition and that it can severely impair a patient. These reasons alone justify studying
      RCBD. However, researchers also believe that information gathered by studying patients with
      RCBD can be used while studying other patients with different forms of bipolar disorder.

      The purpose of this study is to screen patients diagnosed as having rapid cycling bipolar
      disorder to see if they fit the criteria for the diagnosis and to see if they would be
      interested in participating in other research studies.

      Patients will undergo diagnostic interviews, physical examination, routine blood tests, EKG
      (electrocardiogram), and complete self-rating forms as part of the screening process.

      The purpose of this protocol is to allow for the medical and psychiatric screening of
      patients with rapid cycling bipolar disorder in order to ascertain (1) that they fit the
      criteria for the diagnosis; and (2) that they are interested in participating in one of our
      research projects. Patients will undergo diagnostic interviews, complete self-rating forms,
      and have a physical examination, routine blood tests, and an electrocardiogram.
