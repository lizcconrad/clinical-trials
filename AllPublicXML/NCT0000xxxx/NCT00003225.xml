      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of amifostine plus irinotecan in
      treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the toxicity profile of irinotecan and amifostine when administered
      together in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. II. Assess the total dose of
      irinotecan received per 6 week course in these patients. III. Determine the incidence of
      irinotecan-induced leukopenia, neutropenia, and diarrhea in these patients. V. Determine the
      response rate for this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Amifostine is administered by 10 minute IV infusions.
      Irinotecan is administered by IV infusions 15 minutes after completion of amifostine.
      Treatment is repeated every 2 weeks for 6 weeks. This 6 week course is repeated in the
      absence of disease progression. Treatment may be delayed up to 2 weeks after a course to
      allow for recovery from toxic effects. Patients are followed at the end of study and at 30
      days after study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 25-30 patients accrued into this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  ECOG 0-2

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer

          -  Measureable disease

          -  Have not received therapy for cancer within 4 weeks of enrollment on study

          -  Prior radiation therapy to the pelvis for treatment of colorectal cancer is allowed.
             Radiation therapy delivered elsewhere is allowed as long as the patient has been off
             treatment for at least six weeks and measurable lesions are present outside the
             radiation field

          -  Pretreatment granulocyte count of &gt; 1500/mm3, hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL (without
             transfusion), and platelet count of &gt; 100,000/um

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Adequate hepatic function as documented by a serum bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL regardless of
             whether patients have liver involvement secondary to tumor. AST must be &lt; 3x the upper
             limit of normal unless the liver is involved with tumor, in which case the AST must be

          -  Presence of clinically apparent central nervous system metastases or carcinomatous
             meningitis

          -  Any other sever concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would
             make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study

          -  Patients unable to stop taking antihypertensive medication 24 hour prior to
             administration of Ethyol (off x 1 day)
