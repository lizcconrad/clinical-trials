      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and
      carboplatin in treating patients who have primary stage III, stage IV, or recurrent
      endometrial cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients with primary stage III
           or IV or recurrent endometrial cancer treated with sequential doxorubicin, paclitaxel,
           and carboplatin.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive sequential chemotherapy comprised of doxorubicin IV once every 2
      weeks for 3 courses, followed by paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 9 courses, and
      then carboplatin IV once every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-46 patients will be accrued for this study.
