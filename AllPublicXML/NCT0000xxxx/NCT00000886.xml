  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety of HIV-1 gp120 C4-V3 hybrid polyvalent peptide immunogen (C4-V3
      peptides) formulated in mineral oil containing mannose mono-oleate (IFA) in HIV-1 uninfected
      volunteers. To evaluate the humoral and cellular immune responses to the C4-V3 peptides as
      measured by the induction of 1 or more of the following: neutralizing antibodies to HIV-1 MN
      and RF, cross-neutralizing antibodies to primary isolates of HIV-1, HIV-1 antigen-specific
      lymphoproliferation, CD8+ and CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity specific for HIV-1
      gp120 or V3 peptides corresponding to the vaccine strains of HIV-1, induction of HLA-B7 and
      HLA-A2 restricted CD8+CTLs, and induction of HIV-specific DTH responses.

      The test immunogen (C4-V3 peptides) is constructed from 4 sequences of the HIV-1 V3 gp120
      loop shared by approximately 80% of North American HIV-1 strains. Because of the critical
      role that this region plays in generating anti-HIV sequences, it is hypothesized that the
      test immunogen (C4-V3 peptides) will be capable of inducing a broad range of cross-reactive
      neutralizing antibodies in the majority of recipients.

      neutralizing antibodies in the majority of recipients.

      Twenty-eight volunteers are randomized to receive two 0.5 ml injections of C4-43 peptides in
      IFA or placebo (IFA alone) administered intramuscularly at 0, 1, 6, and 12 months. At least
      50% of all volunteers (6 per Groups I and II; 2, Group III) must be HLA-B7 phenotype.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Volunteers must have:

          -  Negative ELISA for HIV within 8 weeks of immunization.

          -  Normal history and physical examination.

          -  Normal chest x-ray within 4 weeks prior to initial immunization.

          -  Low-risk sexual behavior as defined by AVEG.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Volunteers with the following conditions are excluded:

          -  Medical or psychiatric condition that precludes compliance with the protocol,
             including recent suicidal ideation or present psychosis.

          -  Occupational responsibilities which preclude compliance with the protocol.

          -  Active syphilis (if the serology is documented to be a false positive or due to a
             remote [more than 6 months] treated infection, the volunteer is eligible).

          -  Active tuberculosis (volunteers with a positive purified protein derivative and a
             normal chest x-ray showing no evidence of TB and not requiring isoniazid therapy are
             eligible).

          -  Positivity for hepatitis B surface antigen.

        Volunteers with the following prior conditions are excluded:

          -  History of immunodeficiency, chronic illness, malignancy, or autoimmune disease. NOTE:
             Individuals with a history of cancer are excluded unless there has been surgical
             excision followed by a sufficient observation period to give a reasonable assurance of
             cure.

          -  History of suicide attempts or past psychosis.

          -  History of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines.

          -  History of serious allergic reaction to any substance, requiring hospitalization or
             emergent medical care (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, bronchospasm, or hypotension).

          -  History of lung disease.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Live attenuated vaccines within 60 days of study. NOTE: Medically indicated subunit or
             killed vaccines (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal) are not exclusionary, but should be
             given at least 2 weeks away from HIV immunizations.

          -  Experimental agents within 30 days prior to study.

          -  HIV-1 vaccines or placebo, received in a previous HIV vaccine trial.

          -  Immunosuppressive medications.

        Prior Treatment:

        Excluded:

          -  Receipt of blood products or immunoglobulin in the past 6 months.

        Risk Behavior: Excluded:

          -  Alcohol intake greater than or equal to the equivalent of 1 oz of 100 proof per day (4
             oz. glass of wine or 12 oz. of beer per day).

          -  Identifiable higher-risk behavior for HIV infection as determined by screening
             questions designed to identify risk factors for HIV infection; specific exclusions
             include a history of injection drug use within the last 12 months prior to enrollment
             and higher- or immediate-risk sexual behavior as defined by the AVEG (i.e., meeting
             the criteria for AVEG Risk Groups C and D).
