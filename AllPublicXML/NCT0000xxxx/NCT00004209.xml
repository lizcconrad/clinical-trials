      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not
      yet known whether three courses of combination chemotherapy are more effective than six
      courses of combination chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of three courses of
      combination chemotherapy with that of six courses of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the duration of symptom control, time to disease progression,
      survival, and quality of life in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer
      treated with 3 versus 6 courses of mitomycin, vinblastine, and cisplatin.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by stage of disease
      (stage IIIB vs IV). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive
      cisplatin IV over 4 hours, mitomycin IV, and vinblastine IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Mitomycin is not administered during course 3. Arm II: Patients receive chemotherapy as in
      arm I. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Mitomycin is not administered during courses 3 and 5. Quality of life
      is assessed after completion of 3 courses of chemotherapy for patients in arm I and after
      completion of 4, 5, and 6 courses for those in arm II. Patients may receive radiotherapy
      beginning after completion of chemotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 310 patients will be accrued for this study.
