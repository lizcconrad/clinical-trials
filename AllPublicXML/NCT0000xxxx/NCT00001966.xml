      This study will assess the effectiveness of mind-body therapy in relieving pain in patients
      with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This syndrome is a hereditary condition caused by a connective
      tissue defect and is often associated with chronic pain poorly controlled by medication or
      physical therapy. Mind-body therapy comprises various complementary or alternative medicine
      techniques such as meditation, guided imagery, stress management, and group psychotherapy.

      Adult patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome who have chronic pain may be eligible for this 4
      1/2 [Note: if the symbol is unreadable, it is four and one-half] to 5-month study. Patients
      not already enrolled in NHGRI's protocol 97-HG-0089 will undergo a history, physical
      examination, and brief interview before being accepted. Participants will attend 2-hour group
      sessions of mind-body therapy at NIH each week for at least 10 weeks. They will receive
      training in meditation, yoga breathing, guided imagery, and stress management in these
      sessions and will be asked to also practice the treatments at home each day. Patients may
      continue their regular medications and pain treatment with their private physicians during
      the course of the study.

      Participants will fill out a packet of questionnaires about their pain, health, and quality
      of life at three intervals: when they enroll in the study, at the end of treatment, and 12
      weeks after treatment ends. At these same time intervals, patients will come to NIH for a
      test of their physical ability to walk and climb stairs. Patients will keep a diary and pain
      symptoms and medications for 1 week before treatment begins and 1 week after it ends, and
      will fill out questionnaires about pain during the entire study period.

      Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) encompasses a spectrum of connective tissue diseases thought to
      result from defects in collagen formation. People with EDS are often affected by chronic,
      progressive pain poorly responsive to conventional treatment. We propose to investigate the
      efficacy of mind-body therapy for treatment of chronic pain in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. A
      cohort of adult subjects will be treated with mind-body therapy in a pilot study to assess
      the efficacy and acceptability of this treatment modality. The primary outcome measure will
      be change in pain as scored with a standardized inventory. We will also evaluate general
      health status, psychological variables, medication usage, and physical performance abilities.
