      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of melphalan in patients with persistent or
      recurrent neoplastic meningitis.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intrathecal melphalan (L-PAM) in
      patients with neoplastic meningitis. II. Determine the CSF and serum pharmacokinetics of
      L-PAM administered via an Ommaya reservoir to these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive melphalan (L-PAM) intrathecally
      (IT) via lumbar puncture or Ommaya reservoir twice a week for 2 weeks. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of melphalan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 4 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. At least 3 patients receive L-PAM via Ommaya reservoir at the MTD.
      Patients with objective or significant clinical response may receive additional L-PAM IT once
      a week for 2 consecutive weeks, every other week for 2 doses, and then monthly thereafter.
      Patients are followed every 12 weeks for 1 year or until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 3 children and 3 adults per dose level will be accrued for
      this study.
