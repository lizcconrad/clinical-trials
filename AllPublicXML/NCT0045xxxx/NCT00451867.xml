  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of a medication
      called CellCept in treating refractory (has not responded to other treatments) interstitial
      cystitis.

      CellCept belongs to a class of medications called immuno-suppressants. Immuno-suppressants
      work in the body by reducing the immune system's ability to produce certain reactions that
      can cause inflammation. In some people, the inflammation produced by their immune system can
      damage healthy tissues and cause symptoms of pain and discomfort. CellCept is approved by the
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients who have had an organ transplant.
      When used in combination with other drugs, CellCept helps to prevent the rejection of the
      transplanted organ and is used widely in patients who have received kidney, liver and heart
      transplants. CellCept is also frequently used but not FDA approved for the treatment of
      severe rheumatoid arthritis which is a disease caused when the body's immune system acts
      against healthy tissues in the joints.

      Due to its special activity, CellCept may be useful in treating certain inflammatory diseases
      or conditions like interstitial cystitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial Cystitis (IC) is a bladder syndrome characterized as painful, debilitating and
      chronic, with no universally successful treatment option currently available. Characteristic
      symptoms include pain with bladder filling, and marked urinary frequency (to relieve pain).
      The only FDA-approved oral medication for treatment of IC is pentosan polysulfate (Elmiron),
      recently demonstrated by our collaborative research network to perform with little more
      efficacy than placebo (ref), and which is expensive and has associated side effects. Current
      clinical treatment protocols are empiric and usually aimed at relieving pain. There is a
      pressing need for an effective oral medication for treatment of IC. The presentation of
      symptoms can be quite variable among patients, suggesting that IC is a multi-factorial
      syndrome with several proposed etiologies, some of which may be interrelated.

  <why_stopped>
    The major and primary reason for the study termination is the observed reduced efficacy of
    CellCept compared to placebo.
