  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of chronic hepatopathies is high in jail. However, the medical care of these
      hepatopathies is few developed. This study is an observational, an epidemiologic (screening
      and prevalence of fibrosing hepatopathies) and an evaluating study for a better taking care
      of these hepatopathies in jail. The aims of the study will be to evaluate the diagnostic
      performance of the FibroMeter score in the screening of the hepatic fibrosis in persons with
      multiple risk factors for liver fibrosis (alcoholism, intravenous drug users, tattoo, and
      virological status) with FibroScan速 as gold standard; to evaluate the feasibility of these
      different screening tools for chronic hepatopathies in jail and to evaluate the prevalence of
      the fibrosing hepatopathies with clinically significant fibrosis and theirs risk factors,
      alcohol and hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses in population from Angers jail.

      Primary outcome: Screening of clinically significant fibrosis with FibroMeter blood score.
      Screening for hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses.

      Secondary outcome: Clinically significant fibrosis confirmed with FibroScan速.

      The means for this study are a clinical questionnaire, a virological screening, a blood score
      for liver fibrosis: FibroMeter according to cause of the fibrosis and FibroScan速 is referent
      and independent examination.

      The expected results from this study are the knowledge of the prevalence of hepatopathies
      with hepatic fibrosis will be able to justify, possibly, a screening politic of them. This
      study will permit to evaluate the feasibility of noninvasive screening of the liver fibrosis
      in the goal to suppress the liver biopsy in a population having numerous drawbacks.
