  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is used to treat dilated heart failure with
      discoordinate contraction. Dyssynchrony typically stems from electrical delay leading to
      mechanical delay between the septal and lateral walls. Right ventricular apical pacing might
      be associated with long-term adverse effects on left ventricular function, and alternative
      pacing sites such as high septal or RVOT has been suggested. Previous studies have however
      been conflicting. The aim of this study is to determine if bi-ventricular pacing from RVOT +
      LV is better than RVapex+LV. To avoid influence from possible atrial delay only patients with
      chronic atrial fibrillation are included. All patients will receive a bi-ventricular
      pacemaker with 3 leads placed in RVapex, RVOT and via coronary sinus to pace the left
      ventricle. After a run in period (to determine if AV-junction ablation is necessary) the
      patients are randomised to one of the following pacing configurations: RVOT+LV or RVapex+LV
      with cross-over after 3 month.
