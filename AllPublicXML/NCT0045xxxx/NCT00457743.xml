      Phase I;To investigate the clinically recommended dose of Sunitinib malate (SU011248)
      following multiple oral dosing in the first cycle (4 consecutive weeks and 2 weeks rest) by
      reviewing the safety and tolerability.

      Phase II;To determine the objective tumor response and the safety of Sunitinib malate
      (SU011248) at the clinically recommended dose.

From Phase 1 part of this study, 50-mg was determined as the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended dose.</description>

Phase 1: If Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) was observed, the patients were withdrawn from the study treatment. Neither temporary discontinuation nor reduction was permitted.
Phase 2: Treatment cycles were repeated until a study treatment withdrawal criterion was met. If drug-related adverse event (grade&gt;=3) was observed, temporary discontinuation or dose reduction were taken according to the criteria.
From Phase 1 part of this study, 50-mg was determined as the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended dose.</description>

The questionnaire consists of a 13-item subscale which covers specific fatigue questions. The subject rates the intensity of fatigue and its related symptoms on a five-point scale(0 to 4). High score is indicating low fatigue. The total score of the 13 items was evaluated.

        <description>The EQ-5D questionnaires evaluates 5 dimensions of health. The subjects rates the severity of impairment for each dimensions on a 3-point scale(1 to 3). The digits for five dimensions were combined in a five-digit number describing the respondent's health state. Health states were converted into a weighted health state index. High score is indicating high health.

Phase 1: If Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) was observed, the patients were withdrawn from the study treatment. Neither temporary discontinuation nor reduction was permitted.
Phase 2: Treatment cycles were repeated until a study treatment withdrawal criterion was met. If drug-related adverse event (grade&gt;=3) was observed, temporary discontinuation or dose reduction were taken according to the criteria.
From Phase 1 part of this study, 50-mg was determined as the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended dose.</description>

The Cmax for total drug (SU-011248+SU-012662) was calculated as the mean of the Cmax of total drug from each individual subject (it is not the simple sum of means of Cmax of SU-011248 and SU-012662).</description>

The AUC0-24 for total drug (SU-011248+SU-012662) was calculated as the mean of the AUC0-24 of total drug from each individual subject (it is not the simple sum of means of AUC0-24 of SU-011248 and SU-012662).</description>

        <description>Overall Survival Time is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of the death due to any cause. For subjects whose death had not been confirmed, Overall Survival Time was censored on the last date when the patient was known to be alive.
Survival was surveyed once a year from the registration day of the first subject, for all the subjects who received the study drug at least once.</description>

Phase 1: If Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) was observed, the patients were withdrawn from the study treatment. Neither temporary discontinuation nor reduction was permitted.
Phase 2: Treatment cycles were repeated until a study treatment withdrawal criterion was met. If drug-related adverse event (grade&gt;=3) was observed, temporary discontinuation or dose reduction were taken according to the criteria.
From Phase 1 part of this study, 50-mg was determined as the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended dose.</description>
