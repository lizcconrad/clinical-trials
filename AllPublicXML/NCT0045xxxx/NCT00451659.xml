      This study is a retrospective chart review of recently deployed veterans who served during
      the Iraq conflicts and were seen at the TVAMC in the outpatient Primary Care outpatient
      clinic that was recently set-up for newly returning veterans since its inception through July
      1, 2005. Identical data will be collected on non-combat veterans that were seen in other
      primary care clinics at the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center during June 2004 and July 1, 2005.
      This information will be used for comparison with the Iraqi veterans group. The data will be
      retrieved from a computerized list of these patients. Charts will then be examined to
      determine sociodemographic, medical, psychiatric, and health care utilization
      characteristics.

      The information will also be used internally at the TVAMC to better define treatment needs
      and also used in presentations and possible publications at professional meetings and in
      journals.

      While this study is designed to be hypothesis generating for large prospective studies, we
      hypothesize that a majority of the recently deployed veterans who served in the Iraq conflict
      are in need of basic primary health care needs for illnesses that are common place among
      patients within this age group, except for a higher than expected prevalence of mood and
      anxiety disorders compared to usual primary care treatment-seeking populations.
