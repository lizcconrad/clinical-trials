  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menopausal women often complain of difficulty sleeping and the transition from pre- to
      postmenopausal status is associated with an incresase in self-reported sleep disturbance. Hot
      flashes have been associated with self-reported measures of sleep disturbance and changes in
      sleep pattern as measured by plysomnography, including an increase in stage 4 and a latency
      or shortened time in rapid-eye movement sleep. Although there are some data on the effect of
      hormone replacement therapy on self-reported sleep measures in symptomatic postmenopausal
      women, there are no data on the effect of herbal extracts on subjective or objective measures
      of sleep quality in this population group. Actigraphy, the use of a device to record movement
      generally placed on the wrist, has been used over 20 years to provide objective data
      concerning sleep/wake patterns. The advantage of actigraphy over traditional polysomnography
      is that actigraphy can conveniently record continuously for 24-hours a day for longer periods
      of time.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To determine the effect of MF101 (a combination of Chinese herbs) compared to placebo on
           change in sleep quality utilizing baseline and follow-up actigraphy obtained from a
           subset of approximately 90 women enrolled in the randomized, double-blind,
           placebo-controlled Chinese Herbs for Menopausal Symptoms (CHIMES) trial.

        2. TO identify the correlates of sleep quality as assessed by actigraphy in women with
           frequent hot flashes. We will evaluate demographic, lifestyle, anthropometric, medical
           and gynecologic history and hormonal factors that may relate to the actigraphic measures
           of sleep quality, including self-reported measures of sleep.
