      The purpose of these questionnaires is to give us an overview of how OCD has affected your
      life and perhaps also to give us some clues about things that may have set you up to
      experience OCD.

      For us to evaluate the efficacy of our treatment programs, we are interested in your
      responses before and after treatment. We use two methods to evaluate the efficacy of our
      treatments: questionnaires and interviews with a member of the Anxiety Disorders Clinic. As
      part of standard clinic procedure, each person in the program completes an in-person
      interview with a staff member who will determine your suitability for treatment. If you have
      received this questionnaire packet, it is likely that your concerns will be appropriately
      addressed in the Anxiety Disorders Clinic. The purpose of the questionnaire packet is to
      assess the severity of your obsessive-compulsive disorder; its impact on your functioning,
      and factors that may contribute to the onset or maintenance of your OCD (e.g., depression,
      personal standards). We will ask you to complete this questionnaire again when you have
      completed your treatment along with a brief telephone interview with a staff member of the
      Anxiety Disorders Clinic.
