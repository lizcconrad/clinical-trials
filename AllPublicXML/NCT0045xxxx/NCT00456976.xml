      efficacy of selegiline augmentation of antipsychotic medication to treat negative symptoms in
      inpatients with chronic schizophrenia. With randomized clinical trial two groups of patients
      will select to receive selegiline or placebo.

      Primary end point is decreasing in negative symptoms in case group. Inclusion criteria : 1-
