      The current study will investigate the effects of TF002 on cutaneous mastocytosis or
      cutaneous involvement of systemic mastocytosis as compared to clobetasol proprionate
      (positive control) and a general skin care product without active ingredient targeting
      mastocytosis (negative control) based on clinical effects on Darier´s signs and the
      histological evaluation of mast cell numbers in skin bioptic material.

      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study with
      intra-individual comparison of test areas.

      The primary study target is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TF002 for the treatment of
      cutaneous mastocytosis or systemic mastocytosis with skin involvment. The treatment period of
      14 days was adjusted to the maximum recommended treatment period for the comparator
      Dermoxinale®.

      Since there are no approved therapies for this indication a placebo controlled design was
      chosen.

      There are some reports about transient treatment effects using high potent steroids like
      clobetasol in mastocytosis. This triggered the decision to use Dermoxinale® as positive
      control.

      To validate the clinical scores used in the study, surrogate markers describing the Darier´s
      sign (thermography, volumetric test) will be evaluated optionally.
