  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a workplace cognitive
      and physical program (Intervention), in reducing the frequency of head and neck pain
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have been performed to assess the efficacy of non invasive physical
      interventions in the treatment of different types of headache and cervical pain. However the
      evidence on their effectiveness is still limited and the results of recent studies are
      conflicting.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a workplace cognitive
      and physical programme (Intervention) in reducing the frequency of pain involving the head
      and neck area. The Intervention consists of brief shoulder and neck exercises to be performed
      several times a day, a relaxation exercise and instructions of how to reduce parafunction and
      hyperfunction of the craniofacial and cervical muscles during the day.

      Comparison(s): Group of employees that will receive a cognitive/physical programme
      (Intervention), compared to a similar group of employees that will not receive the
      Intervention (Controls); (frequency of headache and neck and shoulder pain).
