      Background:

        -  Batracylin advanced through the National Cancer Institute (NCI) drug development
           pipeline until its evaluation at Stage 3 on July 1989, It was then proposed for a phase
           I investigation based on its activity against as TOPO II inhibitor in s.c. mouse colon
           38, PANC03, COLO9, and cisplatin- and doxorubicin-resistant P388 tumors.

        -  IND-directed oral toxicology studies indicated interspecies variation in toxicity. Rats
           were found to be highly sensitive to batracylin. Ames et al showed that the interspecies
           variation in toxicity was consistent with the pattern of metabolism of the compound by
           N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) to the acetylated form, N-Ac-batracylin, (a highly toxic
           molecule)

        -  We hypothesize that batracylin can be administered safely in slow acetylator NAT2
           genotype patients and can be rapidly evaluated for its potential as a tumor-suppressing
           agent.

      Objectives:

        -  Define the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicities, and toxicity profile
           associated with the oral administration of batracylin daily x7 consecutive days,
           repeated every 28 days in patients with solid tumors and lymphomas.

        -  Define the pharmacokinetics of oral batracylin administered daily x7 consecutive days
           every 28 days.

        -  Obtain preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of batracylin in patients with solid
           tumors or lymphoma.

        -  Correlate polymorphisms in slow acetylators NAT2 genotypes (NAT2 5, NAT2 6, NAT2 7, and
           NAT2 14) with pharmacokinetics results.

        -  Evaluate the inter-subject variability and toxicity ratio, (N-Ac-Batra) / (batracylin).

        -  Evaluate the effect of batracylin treatment on gamma-H2AX levels in tumor biopsies.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have a slow acetylator NAT2 genotype defined as NAT2 5, NAT2 6, NAT2 7, or
           NAT2 14.

        -  Patients with advanced, histologically confirmed malignancies refractory to standard
           therapy, or those for whom no standard therapy exists.

        -  Patients should have adequate liver, renal, and bone marrow function.

      Study Design:

        -  In accordance with the accelerated titration design 4B[3], dose levels will initially be
           increased at 100% increments, and one new patient per dose level will be treated
           according to a 4-week course.

        -  The accelerated phase ends when one patient experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT)
           during the first course of treatment, or when two different patients experience grade 2,
           batracylin-related toxicity during the first course of treatment, or when the
           N-acetyl-batra AUC value reach 0.33 uM-Hour (i.e., the lower end of the range in the
           rat).

        -  When the first instance of grade 2 batracylin-related toxicity is observed, two
           additional patients must have been treated at that dose, or a higher dose (during any
           course), without experiencing moderate (grade 2) or worse (grade 3) toxicity, in order
           for the accelerated phase to continue.

        -  When the accelerated phase ends, the dose-escalation will revert to a more conservative,
           modified Fibonacci scheme with 40% dose-step increments, with at least 3 patients
           treated per dose level.

        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed (by the NIH pathology department) solid
             tumor malignancy or lymphoma that is metastatic or unresectable for which standard
             curative measures do not exist, or are associated with minimal patient survival
             benefit.

          2. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease.

          3. Patients must have completed any chemotherapy or biologic therapy greater than or
             equal to 4 weeks prior to entering the study (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C,
             or UCN-01). Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any prior
             administration of study drug in a exploratory IND/Phase Zero study. Patients must be
             greater than or equal to 1 month since any prior radiation or major surgery. Patients
             must have recovered to eligibility levels from prior toxicity or adverse events.
             However, patients receiving bisphosphonates for any cancer or undergoing androgen
             deprivation therapy for prostate cancer are eligible for this therapy.

          4. Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          5. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to
             2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60%).

          6. Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

          7. Patients must have normal or adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/microL.

               -  Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/microL.

               -  Total bilirubin within less than or equal to 1.5 normal institutional limits.

               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 x institutional upper limit of
                  normal.

               -  creatinine less than 1.5 x upper limit of normal

             OR

             -creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with
             creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.5 times upper limit of normal.

             We will allow patients with Gilbert s syndrome with total bilirubin up to 2.5 mg/dL.

          8. The effects of batracylin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 2 months after discontinuation from the
             study. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test in order
             to be eligible. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with batracylin, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with batracylin.

          9. Patients must have a slow acetylator NAT2 genotype defined as NAT2 5, NAT2 6, NAT2 7,
             or NAT2 14. Theoretically slow acetylators will have lower Ac-BAT concentrations. A
             number of different polymorphisms in the NAT2 give rise to amino acid substitutions,
             and these have been demonstrated to result in absence of catalytic activity in vitro
             (http://www.louisville.edu/medschool/pharmacology/NAT.html). Screening for the four
             variant alleles (NAT2 5, NAT2 6, NAT2 7 and NAT2 14) results in the detection of the
             vast majority of Caucasian slow acetylators, though additional alleles are also common
             in other ethnic groups. The precise percentage of slow acetylators also varies with
             ethnic origin, ranging from 90% in North Africans to less than 10% in many Asian
             populations, with a frequency of 50% in Caucasians. The incidence of fast acetylators
             (potentially with increased toxicity) is as follow: 50% among Caucasians, 50% among
             Africans, 90% among Japanese, and 20% among Egyptians. We plan to select the slow
             acetylators NAT2 subjects and determine the batracylin MTD in this population. The
             screening will occur prior to the study start and before patients sign the informed
             consent form. Cogenics will be performing the NAT2 analysis.

         10. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients receiving any other investigational agents.

          2. Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial, with the
             exception of patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for
             greater than or equal to 6 months after treatment of the brain metastases, without
             steroids or anti-seizure medications. These patients may be enrolled at the discretion
             of the principal investigator.

          3. Patients with clinically significant illnesses which could compromise participation in
             the study, including, but not limited to, active or uncontrolled infection, immune
             deficiencies or confirmed diagnosis of HIV infection, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C,
             uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months,
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

        Inclusion of Women and Minorities

        Both men and women, and members of all races and ethnic groups, are eligible for this
        trial.
