  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to find out if, after 4 weeks of dosing, signs of the
      investigational drug AGG-523, or its effects, can be measured in urine, blood, or the knee
      joint. A secondary purpose is to evaluate the safety of taking the drug either once a day or
      twice a day for 4 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study of 2 dosing regimens of AGG-523, an investigational aggrecanase
      inhibitor that is taken orally. Potential study subjects are those with severe Osteoarthritis
      (OA) of the knee who are scheduled to undergo total joint replacement surgery.

      Study subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dosing regimens (once-daily or twice-daily
      dosing) of either 1800 mg AGG-523 or placebo, which will be taken during the 4-week period
      before having the total knee replacement. The treatments will be assigned using a 4:1 ratio
      of active to placebo treatment, which means that more subjects will receive the active
      treatment than the placebo (see below).

        -  AGG-523 1800 mg once a day (32 subjects)

        -  AGG-523 900 mg twice a day (32 subjects)

        -  Placebo once a day (8 subjects)

        -  Placebo twice a day (8 subjects)

      Study subjects will have weekly evaluations as outpatients during the 4-week dosing period.
      The purpose of these evaluations is to monitor for potential complications, ensure compliance
      with taking the study drug, ask about the use of other medications, and, when necessary,
      replenish the supply of study drug. These assessments may be conducted by telephone, as a
      home visit, or by having the subject travel to the clinic for an outpatient office visit. A
      final (in person) visit will happen 2 weeks after having total knee replacement surgery.
