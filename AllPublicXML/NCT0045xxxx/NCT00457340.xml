      To assess in patients with CAD [coronary artery disease] and an implantable defibrillator the
      effect of atorvastatin 80 mg versus placebo on the first recurrence of a ventricular
      arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation requiring ICD [implantable
      cardioverter defibrillator] intervention) within one year after randomization.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible subjects were male or female subjects, age &gt;18 years, with clinically
             documented coronary artery disease and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who
             met the following criteria:

          -  Were scheduled for an ICD implantation or had an ICD implantation within 1 month,
             according to the class I American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
             (ACC/AHA) practice guidelines for ICD therapy

        OR

          -  Were already treated with an ICD for a class I ACC/AHA indication for more than one
             month, provided they received at least one appropriate ICD intervention (shock or
             antitachycardia pacing (ATP) for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation)
             during the preceding six months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with ventricular arrhythmias in the acute phase of myocardial infarction
             (first 48 hours).

          -  Patients with incessant ventricular tachycardia.

          -  Patients with ventricular arrhythmias without underlying coronary artery disease.

          -  Patients with a transient or reversible cause of ventricular arrhythmias (including
             significant electrolyte disturbances or drug induced proarrhythmia).
