      RATIONALE: Measuring changes in glucose metabolism in patients with cancer may help doctors
      predict how patients respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying glucose metabolism in patients with non-small cell
      lung cancer treated with targeted therapy and chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the prognostic significance of changes in glucose metabolism measured by
           fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT scan in patients with
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with targeted drugs comprising gefitinib, erlotinib
           hydrochloride, or other ErbB inhibitors, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, or estrogen
           receptor blockers in combination with conventional chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan and CT scan
      at baseline and at 2 weeks and 12 weeks after receiving targeted anticancer treatment.
      Metabolic changes detected by FDG-PET and size changes identified by CT scan are related to
      patient outcome and tumor response to treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.
