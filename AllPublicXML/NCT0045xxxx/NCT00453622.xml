  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to identify if the combined use of cardiac troponin enzyme (cTnT)
      and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can predict Heart Failure (HF)improvement and all-cause
      mortality in patients implanted with cardiac pacemaker-defibrillation devices (CRT-D). Novel
      biochemical markers identifying patients with high risk cardiac mortality detected by plasma
      protein analysis will also be evaluated.

      Hypothesis #1: The combined use of cTnT and BNP at just before implant will predict and risk
      stratify all cause mortality or HF hospitalization up to 12 months.

      Hypothesis #2: The change in levels of said biomarkers at different points of follow-up can
      predict response to CRT through 12 months.

      Hypothesis #3: The levels of a panel of novel inflammatory mediators, namely chemokines, will
      be correlated with improvement in 6-minute walk testing, quality of life, and left
      ventricular ejection fraction in CRT patients.

      Primary Endpoint

      The primary endpoint is the occurrence of either death or first HF hospitalization. HF
      hospitalizations must satisfy both of the following criteria:

        1. Admission to hospital for &gt;24 hours with at least one of the following HF worsening
           symptoms:

             -  Increased CHF class

             -  Orthopnea

             -  Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea

             -  Edema

             -  Dyspnea on exertion, or

             -  Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms attributable to HF

             -  Placement on the Status I heart transplant list

           AND

        2. One or more of the following intensive treatment(s) for HF within 24 hours of admission:

             -  Intravenous (IV) diuresis

             -  IV inotropic medications prescribed during the hospitalization, or

             -  Increasing frequency of dialysis for patients with chronic renal failure

      2.3 Secondary Endpoints

      Secondary endpoints include:

        -  Cause of death

        -  Change in NYHA functional class

        -  Number of HF related hospitalizations

        -  Performance on a standard 6-minute hall walk test

        -  Quality of Life as measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLWHFQ)
           questionnaire

        -  Patient global clinical assessment

        -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measured by echocardiography

        -  LV volume measured by echocardiography

        -  LV lead placement position

        -  QRS duration at baseline and with CRT

        -  Number of AT/AF, VT/VF episodes

        -  Frequency of appropriate/inappropriate ICD therapy

        -  % Atrial and Ventricular Pacing

        -  Antiarrhythmic drug utilization

        -  Study related complications

      2.3.1 Response to CRT

        1. A positive response to CRT is defined by the following: Improvement in NYHA functional
           class by at least one grade

        2. Improvement in echocardiographic LVEF &amp; left ventricular end diastolic index (LVEDI)

        3. Improvement in patient global clinical assessment

        4. Improvement in 6-minute hall walk by 10%
