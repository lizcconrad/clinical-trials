  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Non-adherence to glaucoma medication,
      which may result in loss of vision, is known to be prevalent. Available information regarding
      adherence to prescribed medical therapy suggests that some apparent treatment failures may
      actually be due to non-adherence. The investigators' specific aim is to conduct a study that
      will examine the effect of a glaucoma educator intervention on adherence to topical glaucoma
      therapy. The investigators' hypothesis is that patient education and counseling delivered by
      a trained glaucoma educator, through both planned visits and telephone contacts, will
      increase adherence to topical glaucoma therapy.
