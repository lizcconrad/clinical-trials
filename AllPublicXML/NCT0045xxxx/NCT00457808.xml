      The purpose of this study was to determine if rapamycin reduced angiomyolipomata volume in
      patients with tuberous sclerosis complex or lam.

      The study design was an open label, phase I/II trial of sirolimus for one year followed by
      one year off therapy.Patients were seen at baseline,at two weeks to four weeks, and at
      2,4,6,9,12,18 and 24 months. Angiomyolipomata imaging was performed at all but the two to
      four week visit. Complete pulmonary function tests and six-minute walk were obtained at
      baseline,6 or 9 month, 12 and 24 month visits, while simple spirometry only was performed at
      all other visits.
