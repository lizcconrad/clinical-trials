  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of four dose regimens
      (pattern of giving treatment) of JNJ-26113100 in the treatment of adult Atopic Dermatitis
      ([AD]; skin rash, inflammation) that is moderate in severity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what
      treatment the participant is receiving), randomized (study drug assigned by chance),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is
      compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect), sequential
      cohort exploratory study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of JNJ-26113100 in the
      treatment of adult AD that is moderate in severity, including its effect on inflammatory
      biomarkers (biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a sign
      of a normal or abnormal process, or of a condition or disease). Participants will be
      sequentially assigned to 50 milligram (mg) once daily, 100 mg once daily, 100 mg twice daily
      or 250 mg twice daily cohort and randomly assigned to receive JNJ-26113100 or matching
      placebo.

      The total duration of the study will be approximately 8 weeks. Participants will be asked to
      follow-up at the end of Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. A study termination visit (Day 57) will be
      conducted at the end of Week 8. Skin biopsies from atopic dermatitis lesions will be
      collected during the study to assess changes in the inflammatory disease state. Participants
      developing flares of their disease may be treated with triamcinolone acetonide 0.1 percent
      ointment twice daily for up to 7 days. Efficacy will be assessed using Investigator's Global
      Assessment (IGA), Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Blood
      and urine samples will be collected for standard safety laboratory tests, to measure the
      level of drug and effect of the drug on inflammatory biomarkers. Participant's safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were reported for IGA. IGA is an overall assessment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD). IGA utilizes a 6-point scale (ranging from 0 to 5): 0=clear (noinflammatory signs of AD), 1=almost clear (just perceptible erythema, and just perceptible papulation/infiltration), 2=mild disease (mild erythema, and mild papulation/infiltration), 3=moderate disease (moderate erythema, and moderate papulation/infiltration), 4=severe disease (severe erythema, and severe papulation/infiltration) and 5=very severe disease (severe erythema, and severe papulation/infiltration with oozing/crusting).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>EASI measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than [&gt;] 90%-100% eruption). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. The total qualitative score is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant and summed to yield the EASI score.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score for Pruritus at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>VAS consists of 10 centimeter (cm) horizontal line and the words; 0 cm=&quot;No itch&quot; on the left side of the line and the words 10 cm=&quot;Worst possible itch&quot; on the right side of the line. Participants will be instructed to rate the severity of their pruritus within the previous 24 hours by drawing a vertical line across the 10 cm line at the point between &quot;No itch&quot; and &quot;Worst possible itch&quot; which best describes their itching during the preceding 24 hours.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Treatment Response as &quot;Clear&quot; or &quot;Almost Clear &quot;in IGA</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants achieving treatment response (decrease) in IGA were assessed. IGA is used to assess AD through a 6-point scale (Range=0-5) where, 0=clear (no inflammatory signs of AD), 1=almost clear (just perceptible erythema &amp; perceptible papulation/infiltration), 2=mild (mild erythema &amp; papulation/infiltration), 3=moderate (moderate erythema &amp; papulation/infiltration), 4=severe (severe erythema &amp; papulation/infiltration) &amp; 5=very severe (severe erythema &amp; papulation/infiltration with oozing/crusting). Success is reduction of IGA to 0 or 1. Failure is reduction of IGA to &gt;=2.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving 50% Reduction in EASI Score at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>EASI measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than [&gt;] 90%-100% eruption). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. The total qualitative score is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant and summed to yield the EASI score. Success is defined as an improvement of &gt;=50% from the baseline EASI score. An improvement of &lt;50% is considered a failure.</description>

        <description>Participants were reported for IGA. IGA is an overall assessment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD). IGA utilizes a 6-point scale (ranging from 0 to 5): 0=clear (noinflammatory signs of AD), 1=almost clear (just perceptible erythema, and just perceptible papulation/infiltration), 2=mild disease (mild erythema, and mild papulation/infiltration), 3=moderate disease (moderate erythema, and moderate papulation/infiltration), 4=severe disease (severe erythema, and severe papulation/infiltration) and 5=very severe disease (severe erythema, and severe papulation/infiltration with oozing/crusting).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score at Week 6</title>
        <description>EASI measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than [&gt;] 90%-100% eruption). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. The total qualitative score is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant and summed to yield the EASI score.</description>

        <description>EASI measures erythema (E), infiltration (I), excoriation (Ex) and lichenification (L) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no eruption) to 6 (greater than [&gt;] 90%-100% eruption). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. The total qualitative score is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant and summed to yield the EASI score. Success is defined as an improvement of &gt;=50% from the baseline EASI score. An improvement of &lt;50% is considered a failure.</description>
