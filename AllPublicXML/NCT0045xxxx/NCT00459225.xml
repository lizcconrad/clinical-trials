  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is a common disorder in infants with one working chamber of the heart that pumps
      blood. Anemia is when the level of healthy blood cells becomes too low. This may cause other
      health problems because red blood cells contain hemoglobin, which carries oxygen (needed for
      survival) to different parts of the body.

      This study will look at the role of iron in preventing anemia in infants with one pumping
      chamber. The importance of iron therapy will be examined.

      Hypothesis: Prophylactic use of iron in infants with single ventricle is effective in
      preventing anemia.

    <textblock>
      At the beginning of the study, subjects will be randomized to two different groups. One group
      will receive iron every day for the next 4 months or so (up until their Glenn surgery); the
      other group will not receive any iron. Those in the iron treatment arm of the study will
      receive iron education at discharge from their first stage surgery (Norwood or BTS surgery)
      and will be given vials of iron to take home. A patient will receive a set amount of iron
      (dose will be 3 mg/kg) once a day. Weekly follow-up phone calls will be conducted by study
      personnel to re-calculate dose of iron for parents (based on weight) as well as check on the
      status of the research subject.

      Group II will not receive iron but will be a participant in the study and follow the course
      of the non-iron randomized patients.

      Blood samples will also be drawn at the same time as standard of care labs at two time points
      during the course of the study for both groups of patients. Blood for iron study labs will be
      drawn at 72 hours prior to discharge from the first stage surgery and at the pre-Glenn
      screening. A reticulocyte count test will also be done at the pre-Glenn screening. These lab
      tests look at the number of red blood cells in the body, the type of red blood cells, their
      ability to carry oxygen and the iron status of the research subject. Additionally, data will
      be collected on the CBC count, subject's age, weight, pulse oximetry, surgical history,
      transfusion history, iron levels and therapy, and hematological indices (Hgb, Hct, MCV, RDW,
      RBC count, and reticulocyte count), as well as peripheral blood smear. Feeding history will
      be carefully documented. Descriptive demographic data and underlying diagnosis will be
      collected, along with all the above variables defined.

      The hemoglobin and iron levels at the time of pre-Glenn labs will be compared to those at the
      start of the study. The importance of iron therapy will be examined.

      Iron is a readily available medicine for both the prevention and treatment of anemia. If this
      simple cost-effective medicine can decrease the prevalence of anemia in these infants, it may
      result in more oxygen to the body's tissues and areas, less stress on the single pumping
      chamber of the heart and it may also improve their overall growth and development.

        1. Primary Aim - To achieve a higher hemoglobin level at time of second stage surgery
           (Glenn procedure).

        2. Secondary Aims - To obtain the following outcomes:

             1. Increased ferritin levels

             2. Decreased interval blood transfusions

             3. Normal MCV (red cell volume) and RDW (red cell distribution)

    <description>The parent/guardian will be educated on the iron study and provided the opportunity to ask questions. If the parent/guardian chooses to participate in the study, the parent/guardian will give informed consent for the patient to be placed in either Group I or Group II, based upon guardian/parents' choice for participation in the iron arm of the study. Group I will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio in this open label trial to either receive or not receive iron. Group II will not receive iron but will be a participant in the study and follow the course of the non-iron randomized patients.</description>

    <description>The subjects in the iron treatment arm of the study will receive 3 mg/kg of oral/enteral iron solution once a day beginning at the time of discharge until the pre-Glenn screening which is the endpoint of the study. The iron will be dispensed for the subjects upon discharge from the hospital. The subjects randomized to the no iron treatment arm and the patients in Group II of the study will not receive iron upon discharge. However, they may be started on iron therapy in an intent-to-treat anemia by their primary physician in which case this will serve as the endpoint of the study for these participants.</description>
