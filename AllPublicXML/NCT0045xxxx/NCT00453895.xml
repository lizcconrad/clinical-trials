  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although a first randomized trial in patients with advanced ACC leading to the establishment
      of a first line cytotoxic chemotherapy is ongoing (FIRM-ACT), the failure rate even of this
      FIRM-ACT study is most likely clearly above 50%. Therefore, the majority of participating
      patients urgently need a new treatment option. However, up to date there is no evidence for a
      single regimen that might be promising in these treatment-refractory patients with ACC.

      Sunitinib is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with anti-tumor and
      antiangiogenic activities, which is successfully tested in the treatment of patients with
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal and neuroendocrine tumors after
      failure of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy.

      The primary objective of this trial is to estimate the response (defined as progression-free
      survival of ≥ 12 weeks) rate associated with Sunitinib treatment in patients advanced ACC
      progressing after cytotoxic chemotherapy.

             platin-based protocol

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 3 months

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Adequate bone marrow reserve (neutrophils ≥ 1500/mm³ and platelets ≥100.000/mm³) and

          -  Ability to comply with the protocol procedures

          -  If patients have been participated in another clinical trial evaluating treatment
             options for ACC (e.g. FIRM-ACT), the patient can only be included in the SIRAC trial,
             if:

               -  the patient has discontinued study treatment of the previous trial according to
                  the protocol

               -  or the study chair of the previous trial gives written approval for inclusion of
                  this individual patient in the SIRAC trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of prior malignancy, except for cured non-melanoma skin cancer, cured in situ
             cervical carcinoma, or other treated malignancies with no evidence of disease for at
             least three years.
