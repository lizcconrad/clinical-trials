          -  Have active RA consisting of &gt; or equal to 6 tender joints and &gt; or equal to 6 swollen
             joints and one of the following:CRP or ESR levels of ULN

          -  Have an ACR functional class of I-III.

          -  Have had RA for at least 6 months.

          -  Had disease onset at &gt; 16 years of age.

          -  Aged 18 - 80 years.

          -  Currently being treated with a stable, well tolerated weekly dose of MTX between 10-25
             mg for at least 6 consecutive prior to screening visit.

          -  Currently being treated with folic/folinic acid in conjunction with their MTX
             treatment.

        (Note: Patients may begin folic/folinic acid treatment after their screening visit, but
        must remain on stable dose for two weeks before undergoing the Day 1 assessments.)

          -  Willing to remain on a constant, weekly dose of MTX and folic/folinic acid through out
             the duration of the study.

          -  Understand, sign, and date the written, voluntary informed consent form at the
             screening visit prior to any protocol - specific procedures being performed.

             tubal ligation (if performed more than 1 year before screening), or properly used
             barrier contraception. Additionally, the use of condoms is suggested as an adjunct to
             the methods previously addressed to protect against sexually transmitted diseases and
             to provide additional protection against accidental pregnancy.

          -  Sexually active men must agree to use a medically acceptable form of contraception
             during the study and continue for 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug.
