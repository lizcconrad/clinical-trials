      The purpose of this study is to determine the toxicity and anti-tumor activity of
      nab-paclitaxel 100mg/m^2 administered weekly in a 4-week cycle as first line therapy to
      patients with metastatic breast cancer who received taxanes as part of their adjuvant therapy
      and patients who did not receive taxanes as part of their adjuvant therapy.

      This is an open-label, phase II study to determine the toxicity and antitumor activity of
      ABI-007 100 mg/m2 administered weekly for 3 weeks followed by a rest week (4-week cycle) as
      first line therapy to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the following 2 cohorts:
      Patients who have received a taxane as part of their adjuvant therapy, and patients who did
      not receive a taxane as part of their adjuvant therapy. Patients will be assessed for
      antitumor response every 8 weeks.

      The last subject received study treatment 11DEC2012. The study was terminated on 31 May 2013
      via a notification letter to all investigators on 14 May 2013.

    <time_frame>Every 8 weeks from study start until disease progression; Up to 61 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate (ORR) is complete response (CR) + partial response (PR). Complete response (CR): The disappearance of all known disease and no new sites or disease related symptoms confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation. All sites must be assessed, including non-measurable sites, such as effusions, or markers. Disappearance of all non-target lesions. The normalization of tumor marker level confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation. Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline sum of the longest diameters confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation. PR is also recorded when all measurable disease has completely disappeared, but a non-measurable component (i.e., ascites) is still present but not progressing. As well as persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Disease Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 8 weeks from study start until disease progression; Up to 61 months</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control was defined as stable disease (SD) for ≥ 16 weeks or complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Response was evaluated by the Investigator and by an independent reviewer using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines version 1.0. See Outcome #1 for definitions of CR and PR. RECIST defines SD for target lesions as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, no occurrence of progression disease for non-target lesions, and no new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Study start until disease progression, death, or up to data cut off of 31 May 2013; up to 61 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to the start of progression or patient death (any cause), whichever occurred first. Participants who did not have progression or did not die were censored at the last known time the participant was progression free. Participants who initiated other anticancer therapy prior to progression were censored at the time when new anticancer therapy was initiated.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response Based on Independent Reviewer Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Initial response until disease progression; or until data cut off 31 May 2013; up to 61 months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was defined as progression-free survival in responders, i.e. as the time between the start of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) and the start of progressive disease (PD) or patient death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Participants who did not have progression or had not died were censored at the last known time the participant was progression free. Participants who had initiated other anticancer therapy prior to progression were censored at the time when new anticancer therapy was initiated. CR and PR were defined in outcome #1. Progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions; or the appearance of one or more new lesions; or the unequivocal progression of a non-target lesion. Response was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).</description>

    <description>The number of participants with dose reductions, dose interruptions and dose delays that occurred during the treatment period.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI)'s Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) was used to grade AE severity: severity grade 3= severe and undesirable AE. Severity grade 4= life-threatening or disabling AE. Severity grade 5 = death.</description>

          <description>Invasive breast cancer stages:
Stage I-cancer cells are breaking through to or invading normal surrounding breast tissue.
Stage IIa-breast tumor about 2cm and involvement of ancillary lymph nodes. Stage IIb-a larger tumor than earlier phases. Stage IIIa-axillary lymph nodes clumping together. Stage IIIb-spread further to the skin, breast bone or chest wall. Stage IIIc-expanded involvement of lymph nodes. Stage IV-cancer that has spread beyond the breast and nearby lymph nodes to other organs of the body.</description>

        <description>Overall response rate (ORR) is complete response (CR) + partial response (PR). Complete response (CR): The disappearance of all known disease and no new sites or disease related symptoms confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation. All sites must be assessed, including non-measurable sites, such as effusions, or markers. Disappearance of all non-target lesions. The normalization of tumor marker level confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation. Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline sum of the longest diameters confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation. PR is also recorded when all measurable disease has completely disappeared, but a non-measurable component (i.e., ascites) is still present but not progressing. As well as persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits</description>

        <description>Duration of response was defined as progression-free survival in responders, i.e. as the time between the start of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) and the start of progressive disease (PD) or patient death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Participants who did not have progression or had not died were censored at the last known time the participant was progression free. Participants who had initiated other anticancer therapy prior to progression were censored at the time when new anticancer therapy was initiated. CR and PR were defined in outcome #1. Progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions; or the appearance of one or more new lesions; or the unequivocal progression of a non-target lesion. Response was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).</description>

          <title>Duration of Response Based on Independent Reviewer Assessment</title>
          <description>Duration of response was defined as progression-free survival in responders, i.e. as the time between the start of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) and the start of progressive disease (PD) or patient death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Participants who did not have progression or had not died were censored at the last known time the participant was progression free. Participants who had initiated other anticancer therapy prior to progression were censored at the time when new anticancer therapy was initiated. CR and PR were defined in outcome #1. Progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions; or the appearance of one or more new lesions; or the unequivocal progression of a non-target lesion. Response was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).</description>
