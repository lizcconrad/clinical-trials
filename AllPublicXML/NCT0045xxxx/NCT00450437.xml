    <measure>Lot to Lot Consistency of MenACWY as Measured by hSBA GMT Vaccine Group Ratios, Ages 11 to 18 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The consistency of immune response for the three lots of Meningococcal ACWY (MenACWY), as measured by human serum bactericidal activity (hSBA) geometric mean titer (GMT) response using human complement (hSBA GMTs) directed against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y (healthy subjects 11 to 18 years of age)</description>

    <description>Immunogenicity of a single injection of Meningococcal ACWY (3 lots pooled) to that of a licensed meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine, defined as the percentage of subjects with seroresponse directed against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y (healthy adolescents 11 to 18 years of age).
Seroresponse to MenACWY: For a subject with hSBA titer &lt;1:4 at baseline, seroresponse is defined as a postvaccination hSBA titer ≥ 1:8; for a subject with hSBA titer ≥ 1:4 at baseline, seroresponse is defined as a postvaccination hSBA titer of at least 4 times the baseline.</description>

        <description>The consistency of the immune response for three lots of Meningococcal ACWY, as measured by the percentage of subjects with seroresponse, hSBA titer ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8, directed against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y (healthy adolescents 11 to 18 years of age).
Seroresponse to MenACWY: For a subject with hSBA titer &lt;1:4 at baseline, seroresponse is defined as a postvaccination hSBA titer ≥ 1:8; for a subject with hSBA titer ≥ 1:4 at baseline, seroresponse is defined as a postvaccination hSBA titer of at least 4 times the baseline.</description>
