    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, 2-arm, controlled, phase 2, multi-center, estimation
      clinical trial of docetaxel and cisplatin combination chemotherapy with and without
      panitumumab in the first-line treatment of subjects with metastatic or recurrent head and
      neck cancer, as well as a cross-over second-line panitumumab monotherapy of subjects who fail
      the chemotherapy only arm. This study will be conducted in the United States. Approximately
      150 subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic and/or recurrent
      SCCHN.

    <description>The time from the date of randomization to the date of first disease progression determined by the investigators per modified RECIST v1.0, or death within 60 days after the last evaluable tumor assessment or randomization date (whichever is later) during the first-line treatment phase.</description>

    <description>Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of target lesions from baseline; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR. An overall response of CR or PR must be confirmed at least 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met.

An overall response of CR or PR must be confirmed at least 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. A best overall response of SD requires a visit response of SD or better no earlier than 35 days after randomization.

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
