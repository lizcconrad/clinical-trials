  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical research study is being done because there is no effective treatment for
      advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer. This study will determine if the combination
      of medications (Taxotere and Doxil) are effective in this kind of cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each cycle of treatment will consist of four weeks. The 2 types of medicines are given
      intravenously (in a vein). Doxil is given on the first day of each cycle. Taxotere is given
      once a week for the first 3 weeks of each cycle. This is followed by a week of rest until the
      next cycle starts. Treatment is given on an outpatient basis and hospitalization is not
      anticipated.

      Prior to entry on this study, &quot;screening&quot; tests are performed to determine eligibility to
      participate. This will involve a complete history and physical examination, vital signs, pain
      assessment, blood tests including CBC (complete blood count), serum chemistry, and PSA
      (prostate specific antigen), x-rays (chest x-ray, possible plain films of bones if there are
      abnormal findings on bone scan for clarification), computerized tomography (CT) scans of the
      abdomen and pelvis, bone scans, a MUGA scan or 2-D echocardiogram, and a quality of life
      questionnaire.

      After treatment starts the following tests are done to regularly monitor for beneficial and
      toxic effect of the treatment:

      Every week: blood tests.

      Every month: physical examination, weight, vital signs (blood pressure, respiration,
      temperature and heart rate) and PSA test.

      Every 2 months: pain assessment, quality of life questionnaire, x-rays (chest x-ray and
      possible pain films of bones if positive findings are seen on bone scan), computerized
      tomography (CT) scans (abdomen and pelvis) and bone scans.

      Participants may continue with any procedures that are part of their regular cancer care. It
      is anticipated that participants will be in the study for a minimum of 2 months and as long
      as they are benefiting from the treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the
             prostate.

          -  Androgen-independent disease progression, as shown by:

          -  A castrate testosterone level of &lt; 40 ng/dl (this measurement is required only for
             patients treated with medical testicular suppression). If testicular suppression is
             achieved medically, treatment to maintain castrate levels of testosterone must be
             applied continuously.

          -  A PSA level of at least 4 ng/ml, and rising (with an absolute change of at least 1
             ng/ml) on two consecutive measurements at least 2 weeks apart prior to study entry.

          -  Patients must be off anti-androgens such as flutamide (Eulexin) or nilutamide
             (Nilandron) for at least four weeks, and six weeks for bicalutamide (Casodex), without
             evidence of response; or have evidence of progression since anti-androgen withdrawal.

          -  None or one previous cytotoxic therapy is allowed. (For this study, a combination of
             agents given at the same period of time is considered one chemotherapy treatment)

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2 (Karnofsky &gt;50%; see Appendix B).

               -  hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dl

          -  Patients must have adequate liver function as defined below:

               -  total bilirubin normal, albumin &gt; 3.0 g/dl, and no ascites

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function as defined by a creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dl or a
             creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min (measured or estimated by the Cockroft formula) for
             patients with creatinine levels above 2.5 mg/dl

          -  Patients must have recovered from acute toxicities from chemotherapy or radiotherapy
             administered prior to entering this study. Alopecia may not be resolved and peripheral
             neuropathy (grade 1) may be present.

          -  Patients must have a MUGA scan or 2-d echocardiogram indicating an ejection fraction
             of &gt; 50% within 42 days prior to first dose of study drug. The method used at baseline
             must be used for later monitoring.

          -  Patients with reproductive potential must use an adequate contraceptive method (e.g.,
             abstinence, intrauterine device, oral contraceptives, barrier device with spermicide
             or surgical sterilization) during treatment and for three months after completing
             treatment.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients who have had two or more prior chemotherapy treatment(s) (For this study, a
             combination of agents given at the same period of time is considered one chemotherapy
             treatment).

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agent(s).

          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases or actively receiving any therapy for brain
             metastasis (because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive
             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other
             adverse events).

          -  Active second malignancy in the last 5 years except for non-melanoma skin cancer or
             carcinoma-in-situ.

          -  History of cardiac disease, with New York Heart Association Class II or greater, or
             clinical evidence of congestive heart failure.

          -  History of hypersensitivity reactions attributed to a conventional formulation of
             doxorubicin HCL, the components of Doxil, docetaxel or other drugs formulated with
             polysorbate 80.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.
