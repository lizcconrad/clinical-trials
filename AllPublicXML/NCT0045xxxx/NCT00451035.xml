        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Male or female patients aged ≥ 18 years old

          -  Diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome positive, chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia

          -  Prior treatment with at least two BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors with demonstrated
             resistance to the most recent kinase inhibitor therapy.

          -  Patients with a history of intolerance to one BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors will be
             considered eligible to enter the study if they demonstrate resistance to their most
             recent BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor.

          -  Patients who are intolerant of at least 2 BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors will be considered
             eligible to enter this study if they also demonstrate resistance to or intolerance of
             interferon-alpha (IFN-α) by the same criteria defined above.

          -  Patients must have adequate laboratory values

          -  Baseline measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction [assessment of the hearts
             ability to pump effectively]

          -  Assessment of patients ability to perform every day activities. Assessment by the ECOG
             [Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group] Performance Status

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  A candidate for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

          -  Prior therapy with certain medications

          -  Patients with a prior history of accelerated phase or blast crisis CML

          -  Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases

          -  Concomitant use of certain medications

          -  Impairment of GI function or GI disease

          -  Patients with unresolved diarrhea

          -  Patients who have received chemotherapy, any investigational drugs or undergone major
             surgery &lt; 4 weeks prior to starting study drug or who have not recovered from side
             effects of such therapy

          -  Patients who have received a BCR-ABL tyrosine-kinase inhibitor within 1 week of first
             treatment with LBH589

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding or women of childbearing potential not using
             an effective method of birth control

          -  Male patients whose sexual partners are women of child bearing potential not using
             effective birth control
