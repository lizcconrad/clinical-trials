  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a correction factor which would allow ankle brachial
      indexes taken in the seated position to accurately predict an ankle brachial index taken in
      the supine position.

      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent medical condition. Patients with PAD
      are usually diagnosed on the basis of a simple diagnostic procedure know as the
      ankle-brachial index (ABI). The ABI is the ratio of ankle pressure to arm pressure after
      measurement of blood pressures in the arms and legs using a hand-held Doppler device. In
      order for the ABI measurement to be accurate, the test is conducted with the patient in the
      supine position. This eliminates the influence of hydrostatic pressure on the ankle and toes
      which can lead to a falsely elevated reading. Unfortunately, many patients are unable to lie
      supine for ABI measurement, including: the wheel-chair bound, patients with degenerative
      disease of the spine or arthritis with chronic back pain, and patients with advanced
      cardiopulmonary disease and orthopnea.

      Given the importance of detecting PAD across a broad spectrum of patients, there is a need to
      identify a mechanism for reliable measurement of the ABI for patients who cannot lie supine.
      The purpose of this study is to test a correction factor for the effects of hydrostatic
      pressure on the lower extremities to allow for accurate ABI calculation in the seated
      position.

      100 Subjects with suspected arterial disease in the vascular lab will be enrolled. Arm,
      ankle, and toe pressure measurements will be made in the supine and seated positions. The
      seated ankle pressures will be corrected for hydrostatic pressure using a mechanical formula.
      The ABI and toe brachial index (TBI) will be calculated.
