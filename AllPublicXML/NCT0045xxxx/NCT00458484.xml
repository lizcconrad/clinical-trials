      RATIONALE: Radiosurgery can send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal
      tissue.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of giving stereotactic
      radiosurgery and to see how well it works in treating patients with kidney tumors who are
      poor candidates for surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate and compare the clinical safety of utilizing four different schemes of
           radiosurgical ablative techniques for treating poor surgical candidates with renal
           tumors.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate and compare the clinical and radiographic efficacy of four different schemes
           of radiosurgical ablation of renal tumors in poor surgical candidates.

      Serum Blood Marker Objective:

        -  To determine if serum markers collected before and after radiation may give a predictive
           indication of tumor response.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients undergo placement of 2-3 fiducial markers in or near the renal tumor. Patients then
      undergo 4 fractions of stereotactic radiosurgery in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Treatment may repeat at 6 months if tumor is still present.

      After radio-surgery, follow-up will be done at 1 , 3 and 6 months and then every 6 months
      post radiosurgery for a total of 36 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Series I: Radiation will be delivered in 4 fractions. The initial dose level will be 6 Gy per fraction to a total dose of 24 Gy in 4 fractions. Doses will be escalated at 2 Gy per fraction increments to 12 Gy per fraction to a total dose of 48 Gy. The radiation treatment planning and evaluation details are appended.
Series II: The initial dose level will be 48 Gy to the target volume (tumor) in 3 fractions of 16 Gy per fraction. If acute toxicity is acceptable, then the next four patients will be escalated to 54 Gy in 3 fractions of 18 Gy. Finally if a dose limit has not been reached, the last group of four patients will be treated to 60 Gy in 3 fractions of 20 Gy each.</description>
