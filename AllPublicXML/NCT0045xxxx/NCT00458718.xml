  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of rimonabant 20 mg OD fixed dose plus
      nicotine patch 21 mg OD with the combination rimonabant 20 mg OD fixed dose plus placebo
      patch on abstinence from smoking in cigarette smokers motivated to quit.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the clinical and biological safety of rimonabant
      associated with nicotine replacement therapy during a 9-week treatment period and to evaluate
      the effect of the combination on weight and craving.
