  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biomedical and biotechnology industry is internationally regarded as the most brilliant star
      performer of the future. The development of biomedical depends on a high quality academic
      research environment, while innovation and uniqueness should be emphasized for the
      development of biotechnology industry. The successful development of biotechnology industry
      will be impossible if the development is not based on extensive and in-depth research work
      and verification acquired from clinical implementation. Based on these concepts, the
      resources of research materials, especial of human being, are going to be essential. Thus, a
      programmable and systematic collection of clinical specimen would become one of the potential
      properties in hospital. This is a two-year pilot scheme, and was designed to start collecting
      specimen from “Health Management Center” in NTUH. This pilot scheme will address important
      issues of manpower, finances, and data merging for evaluation of biotechnological related
      specimen collection, such as cell or tissue bank, in the future.

      There are 12471 persons who take the health examination in Health Management Center during
      2004 Mar -2005 Dec. Subjects agree to be invovled in the study asre assigned as &quot;respondent&quot;.
      For those who disgree to be involved in the study are assigned as &quot;non-respondent&quot;. There are
      6261 respondents and 6210 non-respondents in this study. 63% of respondents and 51% of
      non-respondents are males. There is a lower distribution in smoking, history of hypertension,
      and history of hyperlipidemia in respondents than in non-respondents. Respondents have lower
      level of triglyceride, HDL, LDL in blood than non-respondents do.
