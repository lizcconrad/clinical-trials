    <textblock>
      Obesity among Mexican-American women has the potential to become a public health crisis.
      Hispanics are one of the fastest growing minority populations in the United States and the
      prevalence of obesity in Mexican American woman is increasing at an alarming rate. Poor
      dietary practices, especially food habits that are acquired as families acculturate to the
      American food supply, and lack of exercise are thought to be associated with women's excess
      weight gain. Accordingly, interventions are needed to improve the dietary intake and physical
      activity levels of Mexican-American families.

      We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial in which women are randomly assigned to
      receive either family-based behavioral counseling (FBC) sessions and play group physical
      activity sessions or group based nutrition and exercise classes and health related activity
      worksheets to complete with their child. The FBC sessions, conducted by community health
      advisors, will use photographs of the family's food practices, taken by mothers, as visual
      aids in the counseling sessions. The control intervention will consist of group sessions
      using curricula designed to motivate women to exercise and to promote the Food Guide Pyramid
      recommendations using traditional Mexican-American foods. The primary outcome of the trial is
      mother's BMI. The secondary outcomes are dietary intake, moderate to vigorous physical
      activity and household food supplies. We hypothesize that within a one year time frame, women
      who are exposed to the FBC will have lower BMI's compared to women who receive the active
      placebo control intervention. The mechanisms through which we intend to change weight status
      are altering the type of foods purchased and cooking practices and promoting mothers to
      engage in physical activities with their children during their play. Measurements of
      secondary outcomes include three 24 hour dietary recalls, a household food inventory and
      activity monitoring using MTI actigraph monitors. In addition, mothers' reports of household
      food security level, and food purchase motives, will be collected as covariates. Measurements
      will be collected within one month of completing the interventions and at six months and one
      year follow-up.

      We propose to evaluate a family-based intervention designed to prevent obesity by increasing
      fruit and vegetable (F&amp;V) intake, decreasing fat intake and increasing physical activity. The
      target group for the intervention is low-income Mexican-American mothers of preschool aged
      children. The intervention uses family-based behavioral counseling (FBC) sessions with a
      community health advisor (CHA) to promote changing the types of foods that mothers prepare
      and consume, and increasing the time that mothers spend being active with their children. In
      previous research, we have used this approach to improve Mexican-American school aged
      children's nutritional status. The mothers of these children were extremely motivated to
      improve their children's diets, and in doing so, improved their own health behaviors and
      reduced their BMI's. Accordingly, in the proposed research, we will conduct a randomized
      controlled trial with a sample of 250 Mexican-American mothers-child dyads to evaluate a
      family based intervention designed to prevent obesity in low income Mexican-American women.
      As families enroll in the study, they will be randomly assigned to either the FBC sessions or
      an active placebo control condition. Data will be collected immediately prior to
      participation in the intervention, within one-month of completing the intervention and at six
      months and one year follow-up. Mother's body mass index (BMI) will serve as the primary
      outcome variable. Multiple 24-hour dietary recalls, a modified household food inventory and
      physical activity monitoring will be used as secondary indices of program efficacy. The
      following hypotheses will be examined in this experiment.

      Primary Hypothesis Women who receive the FBC sessions will have significantly lower BMI one
      year after randomization into the intervention compared to women whose families receive an
      active placebo control.

      Secondary Hypotheses

      Women who receive the FBC sessions will have significantly lower fat intakes and higher fruit
      and vegetable intakes, as measured by 24 hour recalls, one year after randomization into the
      intervention compared to women whose families receive an active placebo control.

      Women who receive the FBC sessions will have significantly fewer high fat foods and
      significantly more fruits and vegetables in their homes, as measured by targeted household
      food inventories, one year after randomization into the intervention compared to women whose
      families receive an active placebo control.

      Women who receive the FBC sessions will be significantly more active one year after
      randomization into the intervention, as measured by activity monitoring, compared to women
      whose families receive an active placebo control.
