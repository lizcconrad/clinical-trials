      RATIONALE: Finding certain changes in genes may help doctors predict which patients are at
      risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or invasive cervical cancer and may
      help the study of cancer in the future.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying genes that may predict which patients are at risk of
      developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or invasive cervical cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Utilize molecular assays to identify a panel of hypermethylated genes that are
           predictive of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or invasive cervical
           cancer (ICC) among patients with or without HIV infection.

        -  Perform a nested case-control study assessing the risk of developing CIN3 in
           relationship to human papillomavirus (HPV) persistence, HIV, and the presence or
           acquisition of candidate hypermethylated genes in these patients.

        -  Identify HIV-related factors (e.g., CD4 counts, viral load, and highly active
           antiretroviral therapy [HAART]) that might be associated with the presence or
           acquisition of specific hypermethylated genes in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a longitudinal, multicenter study.

      Patients undergo biopsy for removal of cervical tissue. Patients also undergo blood and urine
      sample collection. Samples are analyzed for the presence of cancer or changes that indicate
      that cancer might develop. Patients also undergo colposcopy at baseline and at 3 years.

      After completion of study procedures, patients are followed every 4 months for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,150 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Use molecular assays to identify a panel of hypermethylated genes that are predictive of CIN-3/ICC among women with and without HIV infection.
