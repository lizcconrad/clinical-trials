    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare how well three different doses of ketamine, given as
      a spray into the nose, help to sedate children and help them tolerate repairs of cuts on
      their faces.

      Procedural sedation is frequently used to facilitate distressing and painful procedures in
      the pediatric emergency department. However, administering an intramuscular medication or
      placing an intravenous line to give intravenous medications can be as distressing as the
      procedure itself. Oral medications generally take longer to work and are subject to
      first-pass metabolism. Another alternative is to give the medication by the intranasal route,
      which only requires a spray into the nose. Ketamine is a good sedative drug with favorable
      qualities, and is often used intramuscularly or intravenously. It has been used intranasally
      as a pre-induction by anesthetics, sedation for CT scans, and brief dental procedures, but
      its use has not yet been demonstrated in the setting of the pediatric emergency department
      for procedural sedation. We will be comparing three different doses of ketamine, applied
      intranasally using a mucosal atomization device, and determining if there are any differences
      in efficacy of sedation, time to onset of sedation, duration of sedation, caregiver and
      physician satisfaction, and number of adverse events. We will also use this opportunity to
      determine ketamine bioavailability when given intranasally using the mucosal atomization
      device.
