      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a structured educational program for
      hypertensive patients. The program was developed at the University of Dusseldorf, Germany.
      The contents of the program are as follows: teaching of the background of hypertension,
      techniques of self estimation of blood pressure, life style and dietary habits, some
      information concerning the different pharmacological properties to treat hypertension

    <description>We refer to the results of the DAFNE-study. This study showed the merits of an educational program in diabetics. In accordance to the protocol of DAFNE, we developed a design as follows: For each participating center patients are randomly assigned to two groups. Group I receives an early educational intervention at time of randomization, which should lead to better control of blood pressure after 6 months compared to the control group. The protocol design was chosen for proving an independent effect of the educational program despite optimal management by the GP. Group II is designated to receive the educational intervention 6 months after enrollment into the study.
