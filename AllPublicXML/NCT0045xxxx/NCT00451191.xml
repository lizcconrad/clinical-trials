  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomized phase II trial to determine whether two different doses of
      BoNT/A injection into the prostate gland demonstrate sufficient improvement in the management
      of lower urinary symptoms due to BPH to warrant more extensive research. Subjects will
      receive either a 100U or 300U dose. Participation will last 1 year.

    <measure>Improvement in the AUA Symptom Score Index by 30% From Baseline Within the First 12 Weeks After Injection.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome was treatment success at 3 months post-treatment, defined as (1) improvement in the AUASI by at least 30% and/or (2) Qmax improvement of more than 30%, each determined from baseline to 3 months after injection. In addition, two safety criteria also had to be met; a dose failed if (1) any reported event was determined to be related to the onabotulinum toxin A injection and was considered life threatening, disabling, or fatal or (2) &gt;=40% of the participants reported a moderate or severe side effect related to the botulinum toxin injection.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male at least 50 years of age.

          -  Voided volume =&gt; 125 ml.

          -  Maximum urinary flow &lt; 15 ml/sec.

          -  AUA symptom severity score =&gt; 8.

          -  Patient signed informed consent prior to the performance of any study procedures.

          -  Patient able to complete the study protocol in the opinion of the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any prior surgical intervention for BPH.

          -  Current diagnosis of acute or chronic prostatitis (which may cause LUTS that mimic
             BPH).

          -  Overactive bladder without bladder outlet obstruction.

          -  Enrolled in another treatment trial for any disease within the past 30 days.

          -  Men interested in future fertility.

          -  Previous exposure to botulinum toxin.

          -  On alpha-blocker within the past 48 hours.

          -  On any 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor within the past month.

          -  Post void residual &gt; 350 ml.

          -  On phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine, imipramine, an anticholinergic, or cholinergic
             medication within the past 2 weeks.

             between 4-8 ng/ml, the PSA elevation must be considered to be from a benign cause in
             the opinion of the PI. This decision can be based on PSA velocity, previous TRUS
             biopsy, percent free PSA, or other clinical estimations in keeping with sound urologic
             care.

          -  Active urinary tract disease or biopsy of the prostate within the past 6 weeks.

          -  Penile prosthesis or artificial urinary sphincter.

          -  History or current evidence of carcinoma of the prostate or bladder, pelvic radiation
             or surgery, urethral stricture, or bladder neck obstruction.

          -  Known primary neurologic conditions such as multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis or
             Parkinson's disease, or other neurological diseases known to affect bladder function.

          -  Documented bacterial or acute prostatitis within the past year.

          -  Two documented urinary tract infections of any type in the past year (UTI defined as &gt;
             100,000 colonies per ml urine from midstream clean catch or catheterized specimen).

          -  History of bladder calculi.

          -  Patients must be off aspirin, NSAIDS, and Coumadin for 7 or more days prior to
             botulinum toxin injection.

          -  Cancer that is not considered cured, except basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of
             the skin (cured defined as no evidence of cancer within the past 5 years).

        <title>Improvement in the AUA Symptom Score Index by 30% From Baseline Within the First 12 Weeks After Injection.</title>
        <description>The primary outcome was treatment success at 3 months post-treatment, defined as (1) improvement in the AUASI by at least 30% and/or (2) Qmax improvement of more than 30%, each determined from baseline to 3 months after injection. In addition, two safety criteria also had to be met; a dose failed if (1) any reported event was determined to be related to the onabotulinum toxin A injection and was considered life threatening, disabling, or fatal or (2) &gt;=40% of the participants reported a moderate or severe side effect related to the botulinum toxin injection.</description>
        <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>By the last 12-month follow-up visit, 15 men (22%) in the 100 U dose arm and 11 (17%) in the 300 U dose arm had withdrawn due to dissatisfaction with treatment results or continued to attend study follow-up but received additional alternate treatment prior to 12 months.</population>

            <groups_desc>Simon’s optimal two-stage design was applied to determine whether there was sufficient activity at either of the two dose levels to warrant further investigation. Each patient was considered either a successful or failed response. The response rate or proportion of patients treated successfully was examined in two stages. At both stages, the two dose levels were compared to pre-determined critical cut-off values. Sample size was based on significance level α=0.05 and power 90%.</groups_desc>

    <limitations_and_caveats>First, this study was not designed to compare the effect of onabotulinum toxin A to placebo. Second, we assessed our primary outcome, treatment efficacy, at 3 months post-injection. The long-term safety of this product should also be evaluated.</limitations_and_caveats>
