      This study will determine the effectiveness of a peer support system in increasing physical
      activity and effecting health behavior change in people with serious mental illnesses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with serious mental illnesses (SMIs) are, by definition, significantly functionally
      impaired by the illness for an indefinite period of time. Schizophrenia, major depression,
      and bipolar disorder are considered SMIs. Severe anxiety disorders, cognitive disorders, and
      some personality disorders are sometimes categorized as SMIs, as well. The rate of obesity
      among people with SMIs is higher than that of people without mental illnesses. This disparity
      may be due to the negative symptoms that people with SMIs experience, such as vulnerability
      to stress, extreme dependency, and lack of motivation. This study will design and test a
      culturally appropriate physical activity intervention based on a peer support model for
      people with SMIs in an urban community psychiatry program. The intervention will be evaluated
      to determine its effectiveness in increasing physical activity and effecting health behavior
      change in people with SMIs.

      Participants in this 4-month, open-label study will be randomly assigned to participate in
      either a physical activity intervention with peer support (PA+PS) or a physical activity
      intervention without peer support (PA). Participants in the PA+PS group will have three
      exercise sessions each week, which will include group exercise classes and open gym hours for
      supervised individual exercise. They will also meet with a peer educator once a week for 15
      minutes. Peer educators will provide emotional, informational, instrumental, and appraisal
      support that is aimed to motivate participants to partake in the exercise sessions.
      Participants in the PA group will attend the three weekly exercise sessions but will not
      attend meetings with the peer educator. All outcomes will be assessed at a follow-up visit at
      the end of the intervention.
