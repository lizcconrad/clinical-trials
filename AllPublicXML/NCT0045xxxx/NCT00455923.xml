    <textblock>
      An 18 months randomised double-blind study with two parallel arms with start dose of inhaled
      SERETIDE 50/100mcg BD or FLIXOTIDE 100mcg BD, Phase I is 6 months where the patient will be
      up-titrated until well controlled is achieved, After 6 months the treatment continues without
      changes during 9 months = PhaseII. The aim is to investigate and evaluate the assumption that
      the combination therapy with SERETIDE controls mild persistent asthma better than inhaled
      corticosteroids(FLIXOTIDE) alone.

    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>During the first 6 months, when the asthma was unstable/uncontrolled, dose of Seretide (Sal/FP) was increased from 50/100 mcg in a stepwise fashion to 50/250 mcg and 50/500 mcg (if still unstable). Also, dose of Flixotide (FP only), was increased from 100 mcg to 250 mcg and 500 mcg (if still unstable). After the initial 6 months, the treatment was fixed without further changes. The total treatment period was 18 months. Number of participants in each arm with a need for an increase in study medication are presented.</description>

          <description>Eligible participants received a starting dose of 50/100 mcg Seretide (combination of Sal/FP) via Diskus inhaler, twice daily. During the first 6 months, when the asthma was unstable/uncontrolled, dose was increased in a stepwise fashion to 50/250 mcg and 50/500 mcg (if still unstable). After the initial 6 months, the treatment was fixed without further changes. The total treatment period was 18 months.</description>
