      The purpose of this study is to describe the characteristics of patients with amyloidosis and
      severe heart failure being evaluated for cardiac and stem cell transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic amyloidosis is a progressive disease leading to organ failure and death. Treatment
      has improved survival with stem-cell transplantation. Unfortunately, patients with
      amyloidosis and severe heart failure are not eligible for stem-cell transplantation.

      The average rate of survival for patients with amyloidosis who receive a heart transplant is
      decreased.

      Previous trials have raised the possibility that survival may be increased in patients with
      amyloidosis, if chemotherapy and stem-cell transplantation is performed after a heart
      transplant.

      We plan to review data of patients with amyloidosis and heart failure who were being
      evaluated for a heart transplant.
