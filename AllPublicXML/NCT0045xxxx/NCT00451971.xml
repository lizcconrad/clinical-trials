      Primary Objectives

        1. To test the feasibility, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis, of using an
           'aggressive' treatment algorithm to bring a short term treatment objective (STO) within
           the normal or an arbitrarily defined 'desirable' range.

        2. To determine whether patients with active rheumatoid arthritis randomly allocated to a
           particular STO show a reduced rate of Magnetic resonance imaging damage progression at
           two years compared to those randomly allocated to usual care.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To establish the relationship between achieving a given STO or combination of STOs and
           damage progression.

        2. To identify the characteristics of responders and non-responders with respect to STO
           achievement and predictors of greater and lesser degrees of damage progression.
