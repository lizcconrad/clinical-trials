  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is the most common cause of death in patients requiring intensive care. The
      kidney is one of the first organs to fail, stressing the importance to search for clinical
      interventions that may protect the kidneys during sepsis.

      Alkaline phosphatase functions as a host defence molecule and is present in many cells and
      organs (e.g. intestine, placenta, liver, kidney and bone). Alkaline phosphatase has a dual
      mode of action. First, it binds to and, subsequently, dephosphorylates lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS). Second, the enzymatic reaction product monophosphoryl-LPS is a non-toxic substance for
      mammals which acts as a partial antagonist on the LPS receptor complex. In several animal
      studies, administration of alkaline phosphatase attenuates the inflammatory response and
      reduces mortality.

      It is unknown whether these results can be extrapolated to septic patients . We studied the
      effects of alkaline phosphatse administration on kidney damage and function in patients with
      severe sepsis or septic shock.
