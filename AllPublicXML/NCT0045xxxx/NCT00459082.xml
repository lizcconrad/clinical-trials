  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blind randomized trial of a single bolus dose of dexmedetomine followed by a continuous
      infusion (CIVI) for up to 24 hours in infants who immediately post-operative from cardiac
      surgery and require tracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation in the post-operative
      period. Three bolus and infusion dose will be administered to a total of 36 patients.

      This clinical trial of three dose rates of dexmedetomine will determine the pharmacokinetics
      of the drug in infants who remain tracheally intubated postoperatively. An exploratory
      pharmacodynamic study of a non-invasive device measuring sedation will be performed. Although
      the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomine have been described for pediatric patients, the drug
      disposition in infants has not been well described. A range of doses has been studied, yet
      there are no reports describing the optimal dose for post-operative pediatric patients. This
      study will provide data that may allow for improved dosing recommendations in this critically
      ill population of children.
