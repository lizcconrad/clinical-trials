      The basic cognitive function and QOL of 150 oncologic patients that undergone Radiotherapy or
      Radiosurgery treatment to the brain due to primary tumor, metastases or increased risk of
      brain metastases, will be assessed at 3 time points: before the treatment, immediately after
      the treatment, and on the next follow up visit. The assessment tools that will be used are
      Neurotrax standard cognitive computerized tests and 2 short questionnaires.Patients that will
      receive a one-day treatment will be tested on 2 time points only- before the treatment and on
      FU.The research will reveal the positive and the negative influences of the Radiotherapy,
      along with the assessment of norms for the cognitive function and quality of life of
      oncologic patients being treated by RT.Eligibility criteria:oncologic patients of both
      genders, with primary brain tumors, metastases or with increased risk of brain metastases,
      that are referred to conformal/palliative or preventive Radiotherapy treatment or to
      Stereotactic Radiosurgery, who are able to follow instructions in Hebrew.The participants
      will be 20-80 years old.Main comparisons will be performed between the cognitive tests
      results on 3 time points mentioned. The study will continue until the needed number of
      participants will be achieved.
