  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxaliplatin has a more manageable toxicity profile than cisplatin, with no renal toxicity and
      a lower incidence of hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities. The combination of
      gemcitabine-oxaliplatin is attractive in NSCLC patients as it may improve the therapeutic
      index. Given the potential advantages of oxaliplatin and th finding that the addition of
      chemotherapy improves survival in the postoperative adjuvant setting, we conduct a phase II
      trial to compare adjuvant gemcitabine-oxaliplatin with gemcitabine-cisplatin in patients with
      completely resected stage IB, II or IIIA NSCLC

      This study is a randomized phase II study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms:
      patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine-oxaliplatin or gemcitabine-cisplatin.
      Chemotherapy should be started within 8 weeks after complete surgical resection. Patients are
      followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years.

      Gemcitabine-Oxaliplatin (GemOx) chemotherapy:

      Gemcitabine (1,250 mg/m2)+Oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2) is given on day 1 and 15 q 4weeks. maximum 4
      cycles.

      Gemcitabine-Cisplatin (GemCis) chemotherapy:

      Gemcitabine (1,250 mg/m2) + Cisplatin (40 mg/m2) is given on day 1 and 15 q 4weeks. maximum 4
      cycles.
