      CFDI NATIONAL REGISTRY

      Fabry disease is a rare, inherited, genetic condition due to a deficiency of an enzyme called
      alpha-galactosidase A. This enzyme deficiency causes the small blood vessels to accumulate a
      substance called glycolipid. Without sufficient levels of the enzyme, alpha-galactosidase A,
      persons with Fabry Disease develop severe neuropathic pain, kidney disease, heart disease,
      stroke and/or premature death; often before the age of 60.

      Fabry Disease is estimated to affect approximately one out of every 40,000 males and up to
      twice as many females in Canada. We do not have the exact number of persons in Canada who
      have this disease. A common problem in studying rare conditions is the difficulty in
      identifying the majority of people suffering from such a disease. Gathering their health
      information in order to better understand the natural disease progression and its response to
      treatment is difficult.

      Early ERT studies involving humans had small numbers of subjects and the studies were of
      short duration. The results of these clinical studies did lead to approval of the therapy in
      many countries around the world including Canada. To date though, evidence of the usefulness
      of ERT and its direct impact on the natural course of Fabry disease has been limited, while
      its cost continues to be very high. As a result of these issues, there will need to be
      continued and long-term collection of information related to the effectiveness of ERT and
      other treatments to better document its true clinical outcomes in Canadian people with Fabry
      disease.

      The Canadian Fabry Disease Initiative National Registry (CFDI-NR) is an observational,
      voluntary registry designed to collect outcomes data on Fabry disease from people living in
      Canada.

      CFDI NATIONAL REGISTRY: Canada-Wide Patient Recruitment

      There are over 600 people in Canada known to have Fabry Disease. For more details about Fabry
      Disease, please refer to the &quot;Brief Summary.&quot;

      The goals of this nation-wide study are as follows:

        1. To maintain an established national registry which will collect information related to
           the identification and monitoring of all persons with Fabry disease in Canada;

        2. To determine clinical outcomes of patients with Fabry disease including those on
           treatment;

        3. To determine if urine and plasma Gb3 and globotriasylsphingosine (LysoGb3) and their
           analogues can be biomarkers for Fabry disease and can predict clinical outcomes.

      Data will be collected at baseline and every 12 months, as follows:

        -  Medical History

        -  Physical examination

        -  Neurological exam

        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) - an electrical tracing of one's heart rhythm

        -  Echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart)

        -  Holter monitor

        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or CT Scan of the head

        -  Lab tests (including alpha-galactosidase levels)

        -  Review of current medications

        -  24-hour urine collection or a random spot urine test

        -  Biomarker samples

      To date though, evidence of the usefulness of ERT and its direct impact on the natural course
      of Fabry disease has been limited, while its cost continues to be very high (approximately
      $300,000 CDN per year per patient). As a result of these issues, there will need to be
      continued and long-term collection of information related to the effectiveness of ERT and
      other treatments to better document its true clinical outcomes in Canadian people with Fabry
      disease.
