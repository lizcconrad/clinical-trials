    <textblock>
      The CAP-KD trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, two-arm, parallel
      group comparison clinical trial and will be conducted as a researcher-directed study to
      assess the efficacy of Kremezin in preventing the progression of CKD. We compare two groups
      of patients: those receiving conventional treatment alone and those receiving such treatment
      paired with Kremezin.

      A clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the oral carbonaceous adsorbent Kremezin in
      preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease (the Carbonaceous Oral Adsorbent's
      Effects on Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease [CAP-KD] trial) in predialysis patients. In
      the trial we are comparing two treatments: conventional treatment comprising an ACEI and/or
      ARB together with a low-protein diet, and combination treatment comprising the conventional
      treatment paired with Kremezin. Furthermore, we will compare the QOL in both groups of
      patients

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is an outpatient.

             study.

          -  The subject's serum creatinine value is 5.0 mg/dl or less at the time of case
             registration.

          -  The inverse serum creatinine value, calculated using measurements at four or more time
             points during an observation period that occurs within 48 weeks of case registration,
             is decreasing, on average, according to linear-regression analysis performed at the
             case registration center.

          -  The subject's blood pressure is well controlled before the initial serum creatinine
             measurement during the observation period.

          -  The subject has been treated with an ACEI and/or ARB before the initial serum
             creatinine measurement during the observation period.

          -  The subject has undergone low-protein diet therapy (&gt; 0.8 g/kg per day) before the
             initial serum creatinine measurement during the observation period.

          -  The subject has not changed the type or dose of medication for renal failure for 4
             weeks prior to case registration.

          -  The subject has participated in thorough consultation and has been informed as to the
             purpose, description, expected adverse effects, and risks of this study according to
             the consent form, and has voluntarily signed the informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a passage disorder of the gastrointestinal tract.

          -  The subject has been treated with Kremezin within the period from the initial
             measurement of the serum creatinine level prior to case registration to the time of
             study commencement.

          -  The subject has rapid progressive glomerular nephritis, hydronephrosis, occlusive
             urinary tract injury, drug-induced nephropathy, or transplanted kidney.

             infection, class III or above New York Heart Association (NYHA) congestive heart
             failure, severe arrhythmia, or unstable angina.

             within the past 6 months.

          -  The subject presents with severe nephrotic syndrome (serum albumin &lt; 2 g/dl).

          -  The subject has significant difficulty in controlling his/her blood sugar level within
             3 months of case registration (hemoglobin [Hb]A1c &gt; 8.0% on one occasion).

          -  The subject has a progressive malignant tumor.

          -  The subject is not available for study visits at least once per 2 months to provide
             urine samples.

          -  The subject is inappropriate for participation in the study for other reasons, as
             determined by an investigator.
