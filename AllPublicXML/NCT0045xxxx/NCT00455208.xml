  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the Phase I/II trial, which monitors both safety and efficacy of Cura-100 in subjects
      with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis at one clinical study center. The open-label
      clinical study will be used in the study. The study is expected to last for one and a half
      year after it has been officially started, which include recruitment, study treatment and
      follow-ups. The healthy volunteers are also included to study the safety of the intervention.
