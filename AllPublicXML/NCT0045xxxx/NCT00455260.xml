    <description>The hGH-ViaDerm™ System is a transdermal delivery system for somatropin (hGH, rDNA origin).
The ViaDerm System™ consists of a medical device component and a printed dry hGH patch component. The device component is comprised of two primary elements: a reusable, computer mouse-like electronic controller and a disposable sterile array, which is inserted onto the base of the controller, delivers RF-current to ablate cells and creates microscopic throughways, termed RF-MicroChannels™, across the stratum corneum into the upper epidermis. The drug component consists of a unique circular transdermal dry hGH patch formulated specifically for use with the ViaDerm™ device. hGH is delivered by passive diffusion through the RF-MicroChannels™ into the systemic circulation system.</description>

             following criteria:

               -  Three or more additional pituitary hormone deficiencies, based on well documented
                  medical history from up to 10 years prior to screening, and/or serum IGF-1 levels
                  below 2 SD from normal level, measured up to 4 months prior to screening.

               -  One or two additional pituitary hormone deficiencies with one GH stimulating test
                  performed within 10 years prior to screening: Insulin Tolerance test with GH
                  levels less than 5.1 µg/L or ARG-GHRH with GH levels less than 4.1 µg/L.

               -  Isolated GH deficient subjects with two well-documented GH stimulating tests

             participation. Conditions may include cardiovascular, vascular, pulmonary, hepatic,
             renal, or neurological disease, as determined by medical history, physical
             examination, laboratory tests or ECG.

             requirements.

         22. Unstabilized antidepressant or antipsychotic medication therapy within 2 months prior
             to screening.
