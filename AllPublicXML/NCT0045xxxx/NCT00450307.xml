      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as 3F8, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Colony-stimulating factors, such as GM-CSF,
      may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Giving
      monoclonal antibody therapy together with GM-CSF may be an effective treatment for
      neuroblastoma.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of monoclonal antibody
      3F8 when given together with GM-CSF in treating young patients with high-risk, refractory or
      relapsed neuroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of monoclonal antibody 3F8 when administered with
           sargramostim (GM-CSF) in young patients with high-risk, refractory or relapsed
           neuroblastoma.

        -  Assess anti-neuroblastoma effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of monoclonal antibody 3F8.

      Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously once daily on days -5 to 11 and
      monoclonal antibody 3F8 IV over 30 minutes on days 0-4 and 7-11. Treatment repeats every 4-6
      weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody 3F8 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.

    <description>One cycle has 5 days of 3F8 treatment. Each day, patients receive GM-CSF subcutaneously ~1.5 hr before the start 3F8 infusion. To limit side-effects, patients receive analgesics, antihistamines, and a small dose (IV, over ~5 minutes) of heat-modified 3F8. Cycles can be repeated after a 2-4 week interval, up to a total of two cycles.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of NB as defined by international criteria,45 i.e.,
             histopathology (confirmed by the MSKCC Department of Pathology) or BM metastases plus
             high urine catecholamine levels.

          -  Patients must have refractory or relapsed high-risk NB (including MYCNamplified stage
             3/4/4S and MYCN-nonamplified stage 4 &gt;18 months old) resistant to standard therapy.

          -  Prior treatment with 3F8 is allowed.

          -  Age &lt;21 years.

          -  Signed informed consent indicating awareness of the investigational nature of this
             program.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Existing major organ dysfunction should be grade 2 or less, with the exception of
             myelosuppression (neutrophil count &gt;500/ul and platelet count &gt;10,000/ul are
             acceptable), alopecia, hearing loss. Patient cannot be taking antihypertensive
             medication.

          -  History of allergy to mouse proteins.

          -  Active life-threatening infection.

          -  Human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) titer &gt;1000 ELISA units/ml.

          -  Prior treatment with 3F8 is NOT an exclusion criterion.

          -  Inability to comply with protocol requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded for fear of danger to the fetus. Therefore negative
             pregnancy test is required for all women of child-bearing age, and appropriate
             contraception is used during the study period.
