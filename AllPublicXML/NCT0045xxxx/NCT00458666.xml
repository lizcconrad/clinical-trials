    <textblock>
      Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare devastating thromboembolic event, which is probably caused
      by the entrance of amniotic fluid (AF) to the maternal circulation. While AF contains
      coagulation activators, their role during pregnancy has not been elucidated. The current
      study aimed to evaluate coagulation parameters in AF during human pregnancy.
