  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate, in 18-55 year old adults, the consistency of
      different manufactured lots of meningococcal vaccine GSK134612, the non-inferiority of
      GSK134612 compared to licensed meningococcal vaccine Mencevax™, the non-inferiority of
      GSK134612 when given in an experimental co-administration with Fluarix™ compared to GSK134612
      given alone and the immunogenicity of GSK134612 given with Fluarix™.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multicentre study with 5 treatment groups. Three groups will receive three different
      manufactured lots of GSK134612, one group will receive one lot of GSK134612 given in an
      experimental co-administration with Fluarix™, the control group will receive Mencevax™. The
      study will be conducted in a double-blind manner with respect to the 3 lots of GSK134612
      vaccine. The study will be 'open' between the groups receiving GSK134612 and the group
      receiving GSK134612 + Fluarix™ and the Mencevax™ group.

      Each subject will have 2 blood samples taken for immunogenicity analyses, one prior to
      vaccination and one taken 30 days later.

        <title>Number of Subjects With a Vaccine Response for rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY Antibody, for Subjects in the Flu Vaccine Cohort</title>
        <description>Vaccine response was defined as a rSBA titer of at least 1:32 in initially seronegative subjects (&lt;1:8) and as 4-fold increase in titer in initially seropositive subjects (≥ 1:8). A seronegative subject had antibody titer &gt;1:8 and a seropositive subject had antibody titer ≥1:8 prior to vaccination.
