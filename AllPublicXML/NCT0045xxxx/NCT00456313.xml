  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi centre, double blind, comparator controlled, parallel group study is to determine
      whether asthma treatment with high doses of fluticasone propionate (FP) redirects a Th2/
      eosinophil response towards a more treatment resistant neutrophil/ monocyte response and
      whether this occurs to a lesser extent in asthmatic subjects treated with the combination
      product of salmeterol and fluticasone propionate (SFC). The primary endpoint is the mean
      change in priming of blood neutrophils assessed by marker A17. After a run-in period of 4
      weeks subjects will enter a 24 weeks high dose treatment (FP 500 mcg bd) or a 12 week
      medium-dose treatment with FP 250 mcg bd followed by a 12 week treatment with SFC 50/ 250
      mcg. At the visits lung function measurements, ACT, eNO measurements and a blood sample will
      be performed. A total of 50 randomised subjects are planned to be recruited in this study
