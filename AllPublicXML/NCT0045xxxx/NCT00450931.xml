      RATIONALE: The way in which information about a drug is provided may affect the ability of
      patients and doctors to understand how a drug works and the side effects of the drug.

      PURPOSE: This randomized trial is studying how well a drug facts page works compared with a
      standard brief summary in helping patients and doctors understand medical information.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the effect of a prescription drug summary (one-page summary of drug information
           that includes a table with data on drug benefit and side effects) vs standard brief
           summary in direct-to-consumer advertisements on the comparisons of two drugs for the
           same indication, knowledge of drug efficacy and side effects of each drug.

      Secondary

        -  Comprehension of information contained in the drug facts box and rating of the usability
           of the drug information.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Participants are contacted by phone via random-digit
      dialing for initial interview using the computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI)
      system. Eligible participants are then randomized to 1 of 4 intervention arms.

        -  Arm I: Participants receive 2 advertisements for a drug to treat heartburn with a drug
           facts second page.

        -  Arm II: Participants receive 2 advertisements as in arm I for drugs to treat heatburn
           with the standard second page (i.e., brief summary).

      Participants in both arms complete the self-reported questionnaire mailed with the
      advertisement intervention.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 participants will be accrued for this study.
