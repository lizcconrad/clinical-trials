  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects red blood cells (RBCs).
      People with sickle cell disease frequently experience anemia, or a low number of RBCs. RBCs
      are responsible for carrying oxygen to the brain and other body tissues that need oxygen to
      function properly. The purpose of this study is to determine what changes, which were
      possibly caused by anemia, exist in the brains of individuals with sickle cell disease.

      The role of RBCs is to carry oxygen from the lungs to the brain and other body tissues.
      Individuals with anemia have unusually low numbers of RBCs. They also often have difficulty
      concentrating and remembering information, which is likely caused by a reduced oxygen supply
      to the brain. Previous research has shown that correcting anemia in patients without sickle
      cell disease improved their memory and attention. The purpose of this study is to examine any
      abnormal changes in the brains of individuals with sickle cell disease and to determine
      whether these changes are related to reduced memory and attention capabilities.

      Participants will attend one study visit. During this visit, a brain magnetic resonance image
      (MRI) will be performed while participants complete neuropsychological tests that measure
      memory, attention, and organizational ability. There will be no follow-up visits.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in
