  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well pazopanib works in treating
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Pazopanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the therapeutic efficacy of pazopanib hydrochloride, as measured by 6-month
      progression-free survival (PFS), in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

      II. Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of this drug, as measured by radiographic response, time to
      progression, and overall survival, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 2 years.

    <measure>Overall Radiographic Response (ORR) Rate</measure>

    <description>The Macdonald criteria, roughly similarly to other systems, divides response into 4 types of response based on imaging (MRI) and clinical features
1: complete response; 2: partial response; 3:stable disease; 4:progression
Complete response imaging features: disappearance of all enhancing disease (measurable and non-measurable) sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions clinical features; no corticosteroids; clinically stable or improved
Partial response imaging features: 50% or more decrease of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks: no new lesions clinical features: stable or reduced corticosteroids; clinically stable or improved
Stable disease imaging features: does not qualify for complete response, partial response or progression clinical features: clinically stable
Progression imaging features: 25% of more increase in enhancing lesions; any new lesions clinical features: clinical deterioration</description>

        <title>Overall Radiographic Response (ORR) Rate</title>
        <description>The Macdonald criteria, roughly similarly to other systems, divides response into 4 types of response based on imaging (MRI) and clinical features
1: complete response; 2: partial response; 3:stable disease; 4:progression
Complete response imaging features: disappearance of all enhancing disease (measurable and non-measurable) sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions clinical features; no corticosteroids; clinically stable or improved
Partial response imaging features: 50% or more decrease of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks: no new lesions clinical features: stable or reduced corticosteroids; clinically stable or improved
Stable disease imaging features: does not qualify for complete response, partial response or progression clinical features: clinically stable
Progression imaging features: 25% of more increase in enhancing lesions; any new lesions clinical features: clinical deterioration</description>

          <title>Overall Radiographic Response (ORR) Rate</title>
          <description>The Macdonald criteria, roughly similarly to other systems, divides response into 4 types of response based on imaging (MRI) and clinical features
1: complete response; 2: partial response; 3:stable disease; 4:progression
Complete response imaging features: disappearance of all enhancing disease (measurable and non-measurable) sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions clinical features; no corticosteroids; clinically stable or improved
Partial response imaging features: 50% or more decrease of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks: no new lesions clinical features: stable or reduced corticosteroids; clinically stable or improved
Stable disease imaging features: does not qualify for complete response, partial response or progression clinical features: clinically stable
Progression imaging features: 25% of more increase in enhancing lesions; any new lesions clinical features: clinical deterioration</description>
