      An observational safety follow up trial will be conducted to monitor the occurrence of
      cardiovascular events and all cause mortality in subjects who participated in selected
      torcetrapib/atorvastatin Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials. No hypotheses will be tested.

      Study A5091075, an observational study in subjects who had previously been treated with
      torcetrapib, was terminated on 20 Dec 2007. The study was terminated following reviews of
      final safety information from prior torcetrapib studies and the low participation rates
      observed during the recruitment period for study A5091075 . On the basis of this new
      information the Sponsor determined that it was unlikely that this study would result in new
      and scientifically valid information.
