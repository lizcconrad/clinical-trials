          -  More than 28 days (from Study Day 1) must have elapsed since any previous treatment
             (including Revlimid®) for MDS with anemia, other than transfusion(s).

          -  An ECOG Performance status of 0, 1 or 2 • Able to adhere to the study visit schedule
             and other protocol requirements.

          -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must agree to use two reliable forms of
             contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual
             intercourse for at least 28 days before starting study drug, while on study drug,
             during dose interruptions, and 28 days after the last dose of study drug. The two
             methods of reliable contraception must include one highly effective method (i.e.
             intrauterine device, hormonal [birth control pills, injections, or implants], tubal
             ligation, partner's vasectomy) and one additional effective (barrier) method (i.e.
             latex condom, diaphragm, cervical cap). FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider
             of contraceptive methods, if needed.

        Before starting study drug:

          -  FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL) prior
             to starting study drug. The first test must be performed within 10 - 14 days and the
             second negative pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug. The
             subject may not receive study drug until the Investigator has verified a negative
             pregnancy test.

          -  Will be counseled about pregnancy precautions, potential risks of fetal exposure.

        Male Subjects:

          -  Must agree to use a latex condom during any sexual contact with females of
             childbearing potential during study drug treatment, during dose interruptions, and for
             at least 28 days following discontinuation of study drug even if they have undergone a
             successful vasectomy.

          -  Agree to abstain from donating semen or sperm while taking study drug and for 28 days
             after stopping study drug.

        While on study and during dose interruptions:

          -  FCBP with regular cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly for the first 28
             days and then every 28 days while on study drug, during dose interruptions and at day
             28 day following discontinuation of study drug. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the
             pregnancy testing must occur every 14 days.

          -  The subject may not receive study drug until the Investigator has verified a negative
             pregnancy test.

          -  No more than a 28-day supply of study drug is to be dispensed at a time.

          -  In addition to the required pregnancy testing, the Investigator must confirm with FCBP
             that they are continuing to use the two reliable methods of birth control at each
             visit.

          -  Counseling about pregnancy precautions must be done at a minimum of every 28 days.
             Subjects must be reminded of the potential risks of fetal exposure at each visit and
             to not share drug.

          -  Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a subject missed her period or
             if there is any abnormality in her pregnancy test or in her menstrual bleeding. Study
             drug treatment must bediscontinued during this evaluation.

          -  Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding while on study, during dose
             interruptions and for 28 days after last dose of study drug.

        Male Subjects:

        -Counseling not to share drugs, donate blood, sperm or semen, and on contraceptive use,
        including counseling on emergency contraception must be done at a minimum of every 28 days.

        Upon discontinuation of study drug:

          -  Pregnancy test will be performed for FCBP at study termination and at day 28 after
             last dose of study drug.

          -  Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding for 28 days after last dose of study
             drug.

          -  Male and FCBP subjects must follow all birth control requirements as those required
             while on study drug for 28 days after last dose of study drug.

          -  Both males and females must agree to abstain from donating blood or ova (for females)
             while taking study drug and for 28 days after stopping study drug.

          -  Males must not donate sperm or semen for 28 days after last dose of study drug.

        If pregnancy does occur during treatment, study drug must be immediately discontinued. Key
