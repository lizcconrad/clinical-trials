    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a single or repeat intra-articular injection of
      Gel-200 is safe and effective in subjects with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee and to
      determine if original SI-6606/01 Gel-200 therapy is durable beyond the original study.
