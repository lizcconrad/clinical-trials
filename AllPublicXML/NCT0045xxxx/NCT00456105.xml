  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a very common illness. Approximately 4% of British Columbians have diabetes.
      However, at least 20% of people admitted to acute care hospitals have diabetes. People with
      diabetes are at a higher risk for developing complications after surgery including infection
      and prolonged hospital stay, especially if blood sugars are high.

      The researchers are testing a Diabetes Action Team to see if their involvement in patient
      care after surgery improves blood glucose control, duration of stay in hospital, and
      infection rates.

      This trial will randomize subjects with diabetes who plan to undergo elective infrainguinal
      bypass surgery to receive either standard diabetes care by their admitting physician, or
      diabetes care under the direction of the Diabetes Action Team post operatively until hospital
      discharge and post discharge in the community. Subjects without diabetes will have their
      blood glucose levels monitored while in the hospital. The Diabetes Action team will consist
      of a nurse coordinator who is a Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE) and a team of physicians
      specialized in the management of diabetes. The study will not increase the length of the
      hospital stay.
