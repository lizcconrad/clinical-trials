      This study is to compare intraindividually the functional vision provided by two different
      posterior chamber intraocular lenses: AMO Tecnis Z9000 and Alcon SA60AT Acrysoft. To see if
      the aspherical intraocular lenses provide better functional vision than traditional spherical
      intraocular lenses.

      In this prospective study, 20 patients with bilateral catarct presenting for cataract surgery
      are randomly assigned to recieve an aspherical intraocular lens(AMO Tecnis Z9000) in one eye
      and a spherical intraocular lens(Alcon SA60AT Acrysof)in the other. All surgeries are
      performed by one experienced surgeon(Fung-Rong Hu,MD)with clear cornea small incision
      phacoemulsification and in-the-bag posterior chamber intraocular implantation.

      The patients are followed for 3 months, and postoperative contrast sensitivity, contrast
      acuity, corneal &amp; total ocular high-ordered aberrations are measured and compared
      intraidividually between two different IOL groups.

      Outcome Measurement:

        1. Contrast sensitivity testing: measured with spectacle correction for the target distance
           of three meters using wall-mounted FACT sine-wave grating chart with nine levels of
           contrast.The graphic contrast sensitivity is recorded as a log functional units on the
           y-axis and displayed for five spatial frequency targets (1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18 cycles per
           degree (cpd))on x- axis.

        2. Contrast acuity testing: measured with spectacle correction for the target distance of
           three meters using logMAR letter chart(Precision Vision®)represented on a wall-mounted
           illuminator cabinet.Two types of contrast charts are used, high contrast(Cat.No.2103
           SLOAN translucent chart)and low contrast(Cat.No.2132 10% SLOAN translucent chart),and
           are tested under both photopic and mesopic conditions.

        3. Pupil diameters: measured by Colvard infrared pupillometer (Oasis. Medical, Glendora,
           CA, USA )under both photopic and mesopic luminance levels.

        4. Corneal aberration analysis: performed with TMS-4 (Tomey, Japan).The corneal HOAs are
           described with Zernike polynomials of 3rd-to 5th- order root-mean-square(RMS)of central
           6mm diameter using VOLPro 6.89 software(Fa. Sarver and Associates, Carbondale. Ill,
           USA).

        5. Total ocular aberration analysis: performed with a Hartmann-Shack aberrometer(Zywave,
           Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc., Rochester, New. York)under maximal mydriasis with
           Mydrin-P(phenylephrine hydrochloride 0.5% and tropicamide 0.5%, Santen).The wavefront
           errors were described using Zernike polynomials RMS for total HOA at pupil diameter of 5
           mm and 6 mm, primary spherical (Z 4,0) and 3rd-to 5th-order aberration at pupil diameter
           of 6 mm.

      Data Analysis:

        -  Mann-Whitney U matched-paired test was used with STATA software

        -  P values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant

Two types of contrast charts were used, high contrast (Cat.No.2103 SLOAN translucent chart) and low contrast (Cat.No.2132 10% SLOAN translucent chart), and these were tested under both photopic (250 Lux) and mesopic (0.5 Lux) conditions. The contrast acuity tested ranges from 20/160 to 20/20(from worse to best), which equals LogMAR(Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution)0.9 to -0.3. All of the visual acuity and functional vision testing examinations mentioned above were performed by a single ophthalmologist. The outcomes were recorded as average of three post-operative measurments.</description>

    <description>Contrast sensitivity testing was measured with spectacle correction for the target distance of three meters using a wall-mounted FACT sine-wave grating chart with nine levels of contrast (Stereo Optical Inc.)and five spatial frequency targets (1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18 cycles per degree (cpd)) at 250 lux. The last correct grating seen for each spatial frequency is recorded and translated by the &quot;EYEVIEW™ Functional Analysis Software&quot; into a log contrast sensitivity unit. The outcomes were recorded as average of the three post-operative measurements.
( physiological range of contrast sensitivity: 1.5 cpd : 25~82.5 ; 3 cpd: 30~150 ; 6 cpd: 65 ~ 200 ; 12 cpd: 20 ~130 ; 18 cpd: 6.5 ~ 65 )</description>

    <description>Corneal topography was performed with a TMS-4 corneal tomographer (Tomey, Japan).

Corneal HOAs were described with Zernike polynomials of 3rd- to 5th-order root-mean-square (RMS) of central 6mm diameter using VOLPro 6.89 software (Fa. Sarver and Associates, Carbondale.

The wavefront errors were described using the RMS of Zernike polynomials for total HOA at pupil diameters of 5 mm and 6 mm, primary spherical (Z 4,0) and 3rd-to 5th-order aberration at the pupil diameter of 6 mm.</description>

        <title>Best Corrected logMAR Contrast Acuity at Photopic/Mesopic Condition</title>
        <description>Contrast acuity testing was measured with spectacle correction for the target distance of three meters using a logMAR letter chart (Precision Vision®) represented on a wall-mounted illuminator cabinet. Two types of contrast charts were used, high contrast (Cat.No.2103 SLOAN translucent chart) and low contrast (Cat.No.2132 10% SLOAN translucent chart), and these were tested under both photopic (250 Lux) and mesopic (0.5 Lux) conditions. The contrast acuity tested ranges from 20/160 to 20/20(from worse to best), which equals LogMAR(Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution)0.9 to -0.3. All of the visual acuity and functional vision testing examinations mentioned above were performed by a single ophthalmologist. The outcomes were recorded as average of three post-operative measurments.</description>

          <title>Best Corrected logMAR Contrast Acuity at Photopic/Mesopic Condition</title>
          <description>Contrast acuity testing was measured with spectacle correction for the target distance of three meters using a logMAR letter chart (Precision Vision®) represented on a wall-mounted illuminator cabinet. Two types of contrast charts were used, high contrast (Cat.No.2103 SLOAN translucent chart) and low contrast (Cat.No.2132 10% SLOAN translucent chart), and these were tested under both photopic (250 Lux) and mesopic (0.5 Lux) conditions. The contrast acuity tested ranges from 20/160 to 20/20(from worse to best), which equals LogMAR(Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution)0.9 to -0.3. All of the visual acuity and functional vision testing examinations mentioned above were performed by a single ophthalmologist. The outcomes were recorded as average of three post-operative measurments.</description>

We used the 31-rings placido-based system that covers 10.9 mm of corneal diameter which is sufficient for the study of aberrations up to the fifth order for 6 mm diameter. Corneal HOAs were described with Zernike polynomials of 3rd- to 5th-order root-mean-square (RMS) of central 6mm diameter using VOLPro 6.89 software (Fa. Sarver and Associates, Carbondale.

        <title>Best Corrected Contrast Sensitivity in Photopic Condition</title>
        <description>Contrast sensitivity testing was measured with spectacle correction for the target distance of three meters using a wall-mounted FACT sine-wave grating chart with nine levels of contrast (Stereo Optical Inc.)and five spatial frequency targets (1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18 cycles per degree (cpd)) at 250 lux. The last correct grating seen for each spatial frequency is recorded and translated by the &quot;EYEVIEW™ Functional Analysis Software&quot; into a log contrast sensitivity unit. The outcomes were recorded as average of the three post-operative measurements.
( physiological range of contrast sensitivity: 1.5 cpd : 25~82.5 ; 3 cpd: 30~150 ; 6 cpd: 65 ~ 200 ; 12 cpd: 20 ~130 ; 18 cpd: 6.5 ~ 65 )</description>
