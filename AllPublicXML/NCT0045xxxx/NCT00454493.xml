  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is a difference in endothelial
      function, heart rate variability and carotid intimal media thickness in patients with
      coronary artery disease who are receiving fish oil therapy.

      One hundred patients with established coronary artery disease by coronary angiography will
      undergo randomization for enrollment in the study. Baseline evaluation will include
      assessment of brachial artery endothelial function, heart rate variability and carotid
      intimal media thickness. Evaluation of the endothelial function of the brachial artery will
      be elucidated by inflation of a blood pressure cuff around the arm for five minutes and
      measuring blood vessel dynamics after release of the cuff. Heart rate variability will be
      evaluated by 24 hour holter monitoring and analysis by standard protocol. Carotid intimal
      media thickness will be evaluated by ultrasound measurements guided by predetermined
      protocol. Patients will then be randomized to a highly purified fish oil, Omacor, 1 gram
      twice a day or placebo. Brachial artery ultrasound and holter monitoring will be repeated at
      2 months. Carotid ultrasound will be repeated at the end of the study at 12 months.
