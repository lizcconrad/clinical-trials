  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Responsiveness of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) is known to be related with body
      fatness in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Adiponectin (ADPN) is inversely associated with body
      fat mass, and in healthy subjects, low ADPN is a predictor of mortality. Recently, higher
      rHuEPO dose itself is demonstrated to be associated with poor prognosis. So, in this study,
      we prospectively examined the relationship between rHuEPO dose, serum ADPN, and mortality in
      patients beginning HD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We selected 85 patients (51 men/34 women, age; 64±15 years) who survived for more than 3
      months after the start of HD. After determining initial rHuEPO dosage, we followed the
      patients for 3 years, and examined an association between rHuEPO dose, serum ADPN, and
      all-cause mortality.

      We could follow totally 74 out of 85 patients for 3 years; 59 patients were survived, but 15
      patients expired. Dosage of rHuEPO was significantly and negatively correlated with body mass
      index (BMI) (r=-0.44, p&lt;0.01) and positively with serum ADPN (r=0.29, p&lt;0.02), but not with
      leptin. Cox-hazards regression analysis adjusted by age, sex and underlying kidney disease
      revealed that rHuEPO dose and serum ADPN, as well as nutritional parameter such as protein
      catabolic rate became significant determinants of 3-year mortality. There was a 12.7% risk
      increase for 10U/kg/week increase in rHuEPO dose and 1.3% increase for 1µg/ml increment of
      serum ADPN for the 3-year of follow-up.
