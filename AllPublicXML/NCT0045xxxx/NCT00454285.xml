      The major purposes of this prospective, randomized, clinical study are to:

        1. Determine and compare the true incidence, nature, magnitude, and duration (INMD) of
           bacteremia (bacteria found in the bloodstream) resulting from a highly invasive dental
           office procedure (tooth extraction) and a minimally invasive and naturally occurring
           source of bacteremia (tooth brushing);

        2. Measure the effect of the American Heart Association's guidelines for amoxicillin
           prophylaxis (preventive treatment) on the INMD of bacteremia resulting from a single
           tooth extraction.

    <textblock>
      The use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent distant site infections (DSI) from oral
      pathogens remains a controversial issue in clinical practice. Little is known about the
      incidence, nature, and duration (IND) of bacteremia resulting from dental extractions or
      tooth brushing, either in the presence or absence of prophylactic antibiotic coverage. The
      purpose of this prospective, randomized, clinical study of 300 subjects is to characterize
      the bacteremia resulting from a highly invasive (single extraction) dental office procedure
      and a minimally invasive and naturally occurring source of bacteremia (i.e., tooth brushing).
      Subjects will be randomized into three equal groups: extraction with amoxicillin, extraction
      with placebo, and oral hygiene. The major goals are to: 1) improve our understanding of the
      IND of bacteremias from 10 specific oral pathogens (S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. oralis, S.
      intermedius, S. mutans, S. salivarius, F. nucleatum, A. Actinomycetemcomitans, E. corrodens
      and P. gingivalis) that have been reported to cause DSI; 2) measure the effect of the
      American Heart Association's guidelines for amoxicillin prophylaxis on the IND of bacteremia
      resulting from a single dental extraction. Blood for aerobic and anaerobic cultures will be
      drawn at six time points before, during, and following these oral procedures. We will employ
      a highly sensitive broth-based culturing system (i.e., BACTEC) and improve the specificity of
      the BACTEC results with the use of PCR sequence analysis. Detailed clinical information on
      the extent of disease in and around the involved teeth will determine the significance of
      local disease factors on the IND of the bacteremia from oral pathogens. Data from this study
      should have implications regarding future guidelines and standards of care concerning
      antibiotic prophylaxis for individuals currently felt to be at risk for DSI.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Subjects must have at least 10 teeth and the need for a dental extraction.

          -  Subjects will be accepted into the study regardless of the extent of their odontogenic
             and/or periodontal disease, to include Type I through IV American Association of
             Periodontists classification.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Subjects who need surgical extractions that require initial removal of bone overlying
             the surface of a tooth.

          -  Subjects who have taken systemic antibiotics within the previous 2 weeks.

          -  Subjects who require antibiotic coverage, based on current practice guidelines, prior
             to invasive dental procedures (e.g., cardiac valve abnormalities).

        .Subjects with active viral infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis).

          -  Subjects who are immunocompromised (e.g., organ transplant, HIV).

          -  Subjects classified as American Society of Anesthesiology Class III or higher (i.e., a
             patient with poorly-controlled systemic disease).

          -  Subjects with facial cellulitis.

          -  Subjects who have had any manipulation of the gingiva within 1 hr prior to the
             study(e.g., eating, tooth brushing, chewing gum).

          -  Subjects with a history of penicillin allergy.

          -  Subjects deemed by the clinician to have a bacterial infection.

          -  Subjects with a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or above.

          -  Venous access unavailable in non-dominant arm.
