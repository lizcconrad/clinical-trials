      The purpose of the study is to examine the impact of hot flushes on sleep, mood, and
      well-being. Hot flushes (or &quot;hot flashes&quot;) are a feeling of being overheated, and often are
      followed by heavy sweating, skin becoming red and hot, and discomfort. Sometimes hot flushes
      are followed by chills. Some women experience a rapid heart rate. Hot flushes that happen at
      night are called night sweats, and they may interfere with sleep.

      The investigators will cause hot flushes by giving study participants a hormone medication
      called leuprolide (Lupron). Hormones are chemicals that are naturally produced in the body.
      Leuprolide is a manufactured (artificial) hormone that will make the body think that it has
      reached menopause temporarily. Most women begin to have hot flushes within 4 weeks after
      taking leuprolide.

      The investigators will also evaluate changes in sleep, mood, and feelings of well-being over
      the course of the study. The investigators will use questionnaires to measure these changes.

      Hot flushes are common in peri/postmenopausal women and women receiving breast cancer
      therapies. Every year in the United States, 1.3 million women are expected to reach
      menopause.(1, 2) Hot flushes occur in &gt;85% of menopausal women, typically persisting for
      several years.(3) In addition, over 200,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the US
      each year.(4) Hot flushes are the most common side effect of anti-estrogen therapies used to
      treat estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. Widely used anti-estrogen therapies are
      used continuously for many years, and include tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors (AI), and
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists.(5) Hot flushes persist with ongoing use of
      these cancer treatments.(6) The number of women with hot flushes has been increasing because
      many women have declined estrogen therapy since the results of the Women's Health Initiative
      were published and because anti-estrogen therapies are now used more widely over longer
      periods of time in women with breast cancer.(7) Hot flushes impair quality-of-life by
      producing discomfort, disrupting sleep, diminishing mood, and reducing overall well-being in
      menopausal women and breast cancer patients.(5, 8) They are the primary reason for
      discontinuation of anti-estrogen therapies.(9) Recent advances have identified non-hormonal
      therapies for hot flushes (e.g., serotonergic agents and gabapentin),(8, 10-16) but such
      agents are effective in only 60% of women with hot flushes.(8) Better therapies are needed.
      Current studies are limited by reliance on populations with hot flushes that vary in
      frequency and intensity, biases in perceptions that influence self-reporting of hot
      flushes,(17) and a 30% placebo-response rate.(8, 18) Utilizing an experimental model to
      induce hot flushes will advance the discovery of novel hot flush therapies through the use of
      a robust and reproducible system in which to test potential therapies. An experimental model
      will also permit greater understanding of the effects of novel therapies on hot flushes and
      of hot flushes on sleep, mood, and quality-of-life. This work will accelerate the development
      of more effective therapies to prevent and alleviate hot flushes, thereby improving adherence
      to anti-estrogen therapies in women with breast cancer and quality-of-life in all women with
      hot flushes.

      Etiology of hot flushes: Withdrawal of estrogen is central to the pathophysiology of hot
      flushes,(18) with estrogen possibly exerting its effects on hot flushes in the hypothalamic
      thermoregulatory center.(18) Evidence supporting estrogen's role derives from women in whom
      hot flushes occur spontaneously or iatrogenically. Hot flushes are caused by oöphorectomy or
      GnRH agonists, which lead to rapid estrogen withdrawal,(19) SERMs (e.g., tamoxifen), which
      antagonize the estrogen receptor,(5) and AI, which block peripheral conversion of
      androstenedione to estrone,(20, 21) the primary estrogen source in postmenopausal women.(22)
      GnRH agonists: GnRH agonists such as leuprolide are effective treatments for premenopausal
      breast cancer and prostate cancer in men, and are also used in women with endometriosis,
      fibroids, and infertility.(23-27) On GnRH agonist therapy, hot flushes develop within the
      first 2-3 weeks of treatment and are present in at least 80% of women by 4 weeks of use.(19,
      28-31) An average of 1 to 6 hot flushes per day can occur while on GnRH agonist therapy, and
      may continue up to 3 months after discontinuation.(19, 28-31) GnRH agonists initially
      stimulate release of gonadal steroids (estradiol [E2], estrone [E1], leutinizing hormone
      [LH], follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]) then suppress their secretion within 1-2 weeks of
      treatment.(19, 30, 32) E2 and E1 are suppressed to levels seen after oöphorectomy and, like
      LH, remain persistently suppressed, while FSH rises after 4 weeks of ongoing GnRH agonist
      therapy.(19, 30, 32) Osteopenia is not seen until GnRH agonists are used for 6 months.(33)
      Impact of hot flushes on sleep, mood, and quality-of-life: Sleep disruption is common and
      strongly associated with hot flushes in peri/postmenopausal women (3, 34, 35) and breast
      cancer patients.(5, 36) Hot flushes that occur at night (night sweats) lead to repeated,
      brief awakenings, abnormal sleep architecture, and poor sleep quality.(37-39) Depression
      symptoms occurs in 10% of perimenopausal women.(40) Depression symptoms in
      peri/postmenopausal women are strongly linked to hot flushes.(41, 42) Impairment of sleep,
      mood, and quality-of-life are also seen with GnRH agonists and AI.(43-46) However, it is not
      known whether sleep and mood problems that occur with GnRH agonists and AI are caused by hot
      flushes or are a consequence of estrogen withdrawal.

      Neuro-anatomical correlates of hot flushes: Hot flushes are thought to be induced by changes
      in estrogen that disrupt the thermoregulatory region in the hypothalamus through estrogen
      inputs to the hypothalamus. (3, 18) Other evidence suggests that changes in the insular
      cortex correlate with hot flushes.(48) However, changes in the hypothalamic and insular
      regions that occur in women with GnRH agonist-induced hot flushes have not been extensively
      investigated. Only one published study to date has utilized functional neuro-imaging to
      examine the neuroanatomic correlates of hot flushes.(48) Using functional MRI testing, this
      study found activation in the insular cortex but not the hypothalamus during an individual
      hot flush event. Our study will utilize PET technology to explore hypothalamic and insular
      changes that occur in women who develop hot flushes on leuprolide.

      PET Imaging of the CNS: Dr. Hall, one of the co-investigators, has used PET scan techniques
      to examine changes in hypothalamic activity in an estrogen infusion study. Her work has shown
      that estrogen negative feedback occurs in the hypothalamus and inferior thalamus.(49) These
      data were collected in collaboration with 2 other co-investigators on this project, Drs.
      Dougherty and Fischman, and demonstrate that PET scanning can be used to detect changes in
      hypothalamic activity that occurs when serum levels of estrogen are altered. The current
      study will use a similar PET scan method.

      Of the neuroimaging methods currently available, PET offers the best combination of
      resolution, sensitivity, ability to study subcortical and midline structures such as the
      hypothalamus, range of feasible experimental designs, and well-validated analytical tools.
      Early studies documented changes in regional cerebral blood flow in the presence of
      estrogen.(50) Previous cross-sectional studies using FDG PET have demonstrated significant
      effects of estrogen administration on brain regions associated with memory that are sensitive
      to cognitive changes in normal aging and in Alzheimer's Disease.(51-53) [18F]
      2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG) has also been used successfully to measure changes in
      local cerebral glucose utilization rate elicited by pharmaceutical or cognitive
      challenge.(54) As with native glucose, FDG is transported in brain across the capillary
      endothelium and cell membrane by facilitated diffusion and phosphorylated to FDG-PO4.
      However, FDG-PO4 does not undergo further metabolism because the cerebral activity of
      glucose-6-phosphatase is very low, causing no significant dephosphorylation. Thus, after
      intravenous injection, the local cerebral concentration of FDG rises to a plateau level that
      is directly proportional to glucose utilization rates.
