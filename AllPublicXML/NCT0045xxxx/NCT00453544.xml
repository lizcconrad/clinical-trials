  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an enhanced consent procedure for
      patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease, and to identify factors and patient
      characteristics that predict the degree to which enhanced consent is more beneficial than
      routine consent procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer disease can impair the capacity of patients to give informed consent for research
      participation. Studies of informed consent involving other patient populations suggest better
      understanding of consent-relevant information may be achieved through modifications in the
      consent delivery process, including incorporation of multimedia learning tools into the
      consent discussion.

      In the present study, participants with Alzheimer disease and age-comparable healthy
      participants will be randomly assigned to review a hypothetical research protocol via routine
      or enhanced consent procedures. Participants will also complete standard cognitive and other
      rating scales so that we can characterize the sample, as well as evaluate the degree to which
      specific characteristics may be associated with need for enhanced consent procedures.
      Advances in the methods to optimize the informed consent process should enable future
      research participants to make more fully informed decisions.
