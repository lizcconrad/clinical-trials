  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The underlying goal of this study is to assess 123-I MNI-187 SPECT imaging as a tool to
      detect ß-amyloid deposition in the brain of AD research participants and age- and
      gender-matched healthy subjects.

      Approximately 14 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 12 healthy controls will be
      recruited to participate in this study. Healthy controls will be examined to ensure that
      there is no evidence of neurodegenerative changes including cognitive decline.

      All subjects will undergo written informed consent and a screening evaluation including
      baseline clinical laboratory testing, a baseline physical and neurological evaluation and
      baseline cognitive evaluations.

      Subjects will be asked to undergo a bolus injection of 123-I MNI-187. Subjects will undergo
      serial SPECT imaging scans and serial venous plasma sampling for measurement of 123-I MNI-187
      in plasma (both protein bound and free) over a period of up to 6 hours.

      Subjects may be asked to undergo a second imaging visit between 2 and 6 weeks following the
      initial imaging visit following similar procedures to the initial imaging visit to evaluate
      the reproducibility of the imaging measure using this procedure. The imaging analyses will be
      performed by an image-processing specialist who will remain masked to the procedures employed
      with each imaging acquisition.

      The primary imaging outcome measure will be the brain regional distribution volumes expressed
      as a brain tissue to plasma ratio of the radioligand, 123-I MNI-187. Time to the peak uptake
      and amplitude of the peak uptake will be evaluated for all brain regions and the results for
      the AD patients and controls will be compared.

      For those subjects undergoing repeat imaging visits, the data from the initial scan will be
      compared to the second scan to determine which offers the reproducibility of the imaging
      outcome measure.
