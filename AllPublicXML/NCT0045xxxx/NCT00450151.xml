  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the focus will be on correlating the levels of platelet activation markers
      (proteins that are released when blood cells are activated)to the duration of cardiopulmonary
      bypass, temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass and the weight of the patient.

      This research is being done because we would like to learn more about platelet dysfunction in
      children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.

      It has been an established fact that cardiopulmonary bypass causes dysfunction in platelets.
      Activation of platelets during cardiopulmonary bypass is implicated as being a major factor
      in causing platelet dysfunction.

      For all participants, approximately 3.15 ml of blood will be collected in special tubes
      called CTAD tubes, before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (6.30ml in total). This amount of
      blood draw is well within the guidelines of NIH (National Institute of Health).

      Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will be performed using this plasma to make
      quantitative assessment of Platelet factor 4 and Transforming growth factor beta.

      For all patients, after obtaining written consent, 3.15ml of blood will be collected in CTAD
      tubes, from arterial line pre cardiopulmonary bypass and post cardiopulmonary bypass. Blood
      sample will be cooled in ice bath, centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 30 minutes, and supernatant
      plasma sample will be collected. This plasma will be stored at -20 degrees celcius or below.
      Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will be performed using the plasma to make
      quantitative assessment of platelet factor 4 and transforming growth factor beta.
