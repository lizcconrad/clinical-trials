      Phase I: A study to see what doses of Enzastaurin and Erlotinib are best tolerated by
      participants with solid tumor cancer.

      Phase II: A study to see how long participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      treated with Enzastaurin and Erlotinib live.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Phase 1: Any incurable solid malignancy, with no more than 3 prior systemic treatment
             regimens.

             Phase 2: Histologic diagnosis of advanced NSCLC, Stage IIIB with malignant pleural
             effusion or Stage IV per American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Criteria for
             NSCLC. Participants must have failed 1 or 2 prior systemic treatment regimen(s).

          2. Performance status of 0, 1, or 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)

          3. Prior chemotherapy must be completed at least 2 weeks prior to study enrollment, and
             the participant must have recovered from acute toxic effects (except alopecia) prior
             to enrollment.

          4. Prior radiotherapy is allowed to &lt;25% of the bone marrow. Prior radiotherapy must be
             completed at least 2 weeks before study enrollment, and the participant must have
             recovered from acute toxic effects (except alopecia) prior to enrollment.

          5. Non-measurable or measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors [RECIST, version (v) 1.0].

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants who

          1. Are unable to swallow tablets.

          2. Unable to discontinue use of carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin.

          3. Have previously been treated with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
             inhibitor, including erlotinib.

          4. Are receiving concurrent administration of any other antitumor therapy.

          5. Have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug (not including study drug)
