  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will explore the usefulness of a series of questions asking about views of
      research from the perspective of minority and economically disadvantaged research
      participants. Racial and ethnic minorities are consistently under-represented in clinical
      research. This under-representation has been attributed primarily to an unwillingness to
      participate in research because of mistrust in the research establishment, especially in
      light of widely known historical examples of abuse. However, more recent data suggests that
      not being invited to participate in research, or stringent entry criteria, may contribute
      substantially to the low numbers of ethnic minority research participants. The perspectives
      of racial and ethnic minorities who are knowledgeable about or participating in research are
      important to understanding the kinds of vulnerabilities that exist and any important barriers
      to participation.

      People 18 years of age and older from the Cardozo clinic in Washington, D.C., who are
      enrolled in the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Studies' natural history study
      are eligible to participate in this protocol.

      Participants are interviewed with questions about their own experiences in clinical research
      as well as some hypothetical research studies. Questions include participants' general views
      of clinical research, perceived risks and benefits of research, alternatives to research
      participation, the limits of what they would be willing to accept in research and types of
      research or research procedures they might perceive as unfair.

      In an effort to better understand ethical concerns about clinical research, this pilot study
      aims to explore the utility of a series of questions asking about views of research from the
      perspective of minority and economically disadvantaged research participants. Cognitive
      interviews will be conducted in English and Spanish with 10 participants of the NIAMS CHC at
      the Upper Cardozo Clinic in Washington DC. The interviewer will ask participants about their
      own experiences as well as some hypothetical research studies. Questionnaires will ask
      participants about their general views of the clinical research, perceived risks and benefits
      of research, alternatives to participation, the limits of what they would be willing to
      accept in research and types of research or research procedures they might perceive as
      unfair.
