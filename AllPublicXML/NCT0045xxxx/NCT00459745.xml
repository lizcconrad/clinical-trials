  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double blind, prospective, longitudinal, randomized, 12-week study
      with a 52-week open-label follow-up to evaluate the safety and efficacy of daily
      administration of Pravastatin 40 mg or Fenofibrate 160 mg or Pravafen (the combination of
      both Pravastatin and Fenofibrate 40/160 mg) in the treatment of combined hyperlipidemia.
      There will be an open-label, 8-week, Selection Phase prior to randomization in which all
      patients will be stabilized on Pravastatin 40 mg/day. Following the Selection Phase, and if
      the patients meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will be randomized to a three arm,
      double blind, 12-week Efficacy Phase during which they would receive either Pravastatin 40 mg
      or Fenofibrate 160 mg or Pravafen (the combination of Pravastatin and Fenofibrate 40/160 mg).
      The 12-week Efficacy Phase will be followed by an open-label, 52-week, Safety Phase in which
      all patients will receive Pravafen.

      After the 8-week Selection Phase, patients that still meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria
      will be randomized on a 1:1:2 ratio to Pravastatin 40 mg or Fenofibrate 160 mg or Pravafen
      (the combination of both Pravastatin and Fenofibrate 40/160 mg) for 12 weeks. After the
      completion of the 12-week double-blind phase of the study, all patients that haven't had
      changes in their well being, will be allowed to roll-over into the 52-week, open-label,
      follow-up portion of the study. During the 52 week, open label, Safety Phase of the study,
      all patients will receive Pravafen (the combination of Pravastatin and Fenofibrate 40/160
      mg).

      Patients will be evaluated at baseline and every three weeks thereafter throughout the
      initial 12-week Efficacy Phase of the study. Patients that roll-over into the 52-week,
      open-label, follow-up Safety Phase will be evaluated at 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks.

      Participation in the study can be up to 72 weeks.
