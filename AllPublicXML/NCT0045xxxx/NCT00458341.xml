  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In some patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the disease is caused by a nonsense mutation
      (premature stop codon) in the gene that makes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator
      (CFTR) protein. PTC124 has been shown to partially restore CFTR production in animals with CF
      due to a nonsense mutation. The main purpose of this study is to understand whether PTC124
      can safely increase functional CFTR protein in the cells of patients with CF due to a
      nonsense mutation.

    <textblock>
      In this study, patients with CF due to a nonsense mutation will be treated with a new
      investigational drug called PTC124. Evaluation procedures (history, physical examination,
      blood and urine tests to assess organ function, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest x-ray, and
      CF-specific tests) to determine if a patient qualifies for the study will be performed within
      21 days prior to the start of treatment. Eligible patients with nonsense-mutation-mediated CF
      will receive two repeated 28-day cycles, each comprising 14 days on therapy and 14 days off
      therapy. In a crossover design, patients will be randomized to receive PTC124 treatment in
      Cycle 1 by either of the following regimens:

        -  PTC124, given 3 times per day (TID) with a regimen of 4 mg/kg at breakfast, 4 mg/kg at
           lunch, and 8 mg/kg at dinner, or

        -  PTC124, given 3 times per day (TID) with a regimen of 10 mg/kg at breakfast, 10 mg/kg at
           lunch and 20 mg/kg at dinner.

      In Cycle 2, patients will then receive the drug according to the regimen opposite from that
      given in Cycle 1.

      There will be a 2-night stay at the clinical research center at the beginning and at the end
      of each 14 days of PTC124 treatment, which means that there will be four 2-night stays at the
      clinical research center during the study. During the study, PTC124 efficacy, safety, and
      pharmacokinetics will be evaluated periodically with measurement of transepithelial potential
      difference (TEPD), nasal mucosal brushing to assess for cellular CFTR mRNA and protein,
      medical history, physical examinations, blood tests, sputum test, urinalysis, ECGs, chest
      x-ray, and pulmonary function tests.

        Inclusion Criteria: Patients must meet all of the following conditions to be eligible for
        enrollment into the study:

          1. Diagnosis of CF based on conclusively abnormal sweat test (sweat chloride &gt;35
             mEq/liter.

          2. Abnormal nasal epithelial TEPD total chloride conductance (a more electrically
             negative value than 5 mV for Δchloride-free+isoproterenol).

          3. Presence of a mutation in both alleles.

          4. Documentation that a blood sample has been drawn for reconfirmation of the presence of
             a nonsense mutation in the cftr gene.

          5. Age ≥6 years.

          6. Body weight ≥25 kg.

          7. FEV1 ≥40% of predicted for age, gender, and height.

          8. Oxygen saturation ≥92% on room air.

          9. Willingness of male and female patients, if not surgically sterile, to abstain from
             sexual intercourse or employ a barrier or medical method of contraception during the
             study drug administration and follow-up periods.

         10. Negative pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential).

         11. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan,
             study procedures (including TEPD measurements, clinical laboratory tests, pulmonary
             function tests, and PK sampling), and study restrictions.

         12. Ability to provide written informed consent and/or assent.

         13. Evidence of signed and dated informed consent document (by the patient or a legal
             guardian) indicating that the patient and/or the legal guardian has been informed of
             all pertinent aspects of the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria: The presence of any of the following conditions will exclude a patient
        from enrollment in the study:

          1. Prior exposure to PTC124.

          2. Prior or ongoing medical condition (eg, concomitant illness, alcoholism, drug abuse,
             psychiatric condition), medical history, physical findings, ECG findings, or
             laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could adversely affect the
             safety of the patient, makes it unlikely that the course of treatment or follow-up
             would be completed, or could impair the assessment of study results.

             pulmonary disease other than CF, or new, significant abnormalities such as atelectasis
             or pleural effusion which may be indicative of clinically significant active pulmonary
             involvement secondary to CF.

          6. Positive hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody test, or HIV test.

             ipratropium bromide, phenylephrine, or oxymetazoline) within 14 days prior to start of
             study treatment.

         17. Change in treatment with systemic or inhaled corticosteroids within 14 days prior to
             start of study treatment.
