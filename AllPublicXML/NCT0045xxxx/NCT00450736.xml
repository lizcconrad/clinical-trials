      RATIONALE: Celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy uses
      high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving celecoxib together with radiation therapy
      after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of celecoxib when
      given together with radiation therapy in treating patients with stage II or stage III soft
      tissue sarcoma of the arm, hand, leg, or foot that has been removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of adjuvant celecoxib administered with
           radiotherapy in patients with resected stage II or III soft tissue sarcoma of the
           extremity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of celecoxib.

      Beginning within 10 weeks of the most recent resection, patients undergo standard
      radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, in weeks 1-7. Patients also receive oral celecoxib
      twice daily in weeks 1-7 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of celecoxib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A maximum of 6 patients are treated at the
      MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
