    <textblock>
      Controlled and randomized study comparing combined treatment (nadolol and endoscopic
      ligation) versus nadolol associated with isosorbide mononitrate or prazosin according to
      hemodynamic response, in the prevention of esofagic verices rebleeding.

    <textblock>
      The present is a prospective, randomized, open label study, in parallel groups, in which the
      patients with hemorrhage caused by esofagic varices will be randomized in two groups of
      treatment, after control of acute hemorrhage.

      All the patients included will receive standard medical treatment with beta - blockers and
      endoscopic ligation of the esofagic varices.

      The control group will be constituted by the patients assigned to receive endoscopic ligation
      and nadolol (N).

      The experimental group will be constituted by patients assigned to receive treatment
      according to the hemodynamic response.

      All patients included in the experimental group will receive pharmacologic treatment with
      nadolol combined with Isosorbide Mononitrate (MNI) or Prazosin (PZ).

      In both groups it will practice a basal hepatic hemodynamic study in the 4th-5th day after
      their admitance (after achieve hemodynamic stability for at least 48 h and with hemorrhage
      controlled) and a second control hepatic hemodynamic study 3-4 weeks after the beginning of
      the pharmacologic treatment, once adjusted doses.

      In the experimental group, the responders to N + MNI will keep on this treatment, but
      nonrespondent in the hemodynamic study will switch treatment to N + PZ and a third hepatic
      hemodynamic study will be performed 3 to 4 weeks after the dosage adjustement.

      The randomization will be stratified according to the degree of hepatic failure measured by
      Child-Pugh classification (classes A and B versus C) The design is random to avoid bias in
      the selection of the patients.
