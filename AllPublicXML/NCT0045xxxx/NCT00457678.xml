  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that Visudyne-Lucentis-dexamethasone (V-L-D)
      triple therapy will give similar efficacy and safety results as Lucentis monotherapy.

      Study Design:

      Patients who have received 2-6 previous treatments with Lucentis monotherapy and who have
      exudative activity associated with the choroidal neovascularization (CNV) lesion, as
      confirmed by fluorescein angiography (FA) or optical coherence tomography (OCT), will be
      eligible. Patients will be randomly assigned at 4-8 weeks after the previous Lucentis
      treatment to either

        1. continuation of Lucentis monotherapy

        2. triple therapy with half fluence Visudyne (300 mW/cm2 for 83 seconds) followed within 2
           hours by intravitreal Lucentis 0.5 mg (first injection) and then dexamethasone 0.5 mg
           (second injection) (V-L-D).

      Both groups will receive treatment at baseline and then as needed (PRN), according to
      retreatment criteria, with monthly assessments thereafter for 12 months. In the triple
      therapy group, patients may only be retreated with the V-L-D combination at intervals of no
      less than 3 months; if retreatment is needed 1 or 2 months after a previous V-L-D treatment,
      the patient will receive a Lucentis injection at that visit; however, if retreatment is
      needed and the previous V-L-D treatment was at least 3 months prior, then V-L-D treatment is
      mandatory. OCT, visual acuity (VA) testing, and possibly FA will be conducted at each
      assessment visit to define the need for retreatment.

        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with subfoveal CNV due to AMD who, after 2-6 previous treatments with
             Lucentis monotherapy, continue to have exudative activity associated with the CNV
             lesion 4-8 weeks after the last treatment. Exudative activity is defined as one or
             more of:

               -  CNV leakage confirmed by FA

               -  New hemorrhage associated with the CNV lesion

               -  Subretinal fluid or cystoid macular edema by OCT showing retinal thickness ≥ 230
                  μm

          -  All lesion composition types with a lesion greatest linear dimension (GLD) ≤ 5400
             microns (approximately ≤ 9 disc areas [DA])

          -  Best corrected ETDRS VA score of 25-73 letters (approximate Snellen equivalent of
             20/40-20/320)

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subfoveal geographic atrophy or subfoveal fibrosis in the study eye

          -  Intraocular surgery within 3 months of enrollment

          -  Inability to attend the protocol-required visits

          -  Known allergies or hypersensitivity to any of the study treatments
