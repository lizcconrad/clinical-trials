    <measure>Clinical Response 7 to 14 Days After Completion of Study Drug Therapy in Per Protocol (PP) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>7 - 14 days after completion of study drug therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical cure was defined as: Reduction of the tenderness score (modified McCormack) by &gt; 70% and apyrexia (rectal/tympanic/oral temperature value &lt; 38.0°C or axillary temperature value &lt; 37.5°C) and white blood cell count &lt; 10,500/mm^3.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Response 7 to 14 Days After Completion of Study Drug Therapy on Intent To Treat (ITT) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>7 - 14 days after completion of study drug therapy</time_frame>
    <description>For any subject in the ITT population also valid for the PP analysis, same clinical response as in the PP analysis was applied to the ITT analysis. For those subjects in the ITT population invalid for the PP analysis, any clinical response different from clinical cure was set to &quot;non-success&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Response on Treatment for Per Protocol Population</measure>
    <time_frame>4 - 7 days after start of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>At the During Therapy (Day 4 to 7) assessment, the clinical response was graded as clinical Improvement (severity score reduced by &gt;30% with improvement in temperature, clinical failure (reduction in severity score of &lt; or equal 30% and/or no improvement in temperature) or indeterminate (clinical assessment not possible to determine).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Response on Treatment for Intent To Treat Population</measure>
    <time_frame>4 - 7 days after start of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response during treatment was analyzed exploratively in the same way as the primary efficacy variable. At the During Therapy (Day 4 to 7) assessment, the clinical response was graded as clinical Improvement, clinical failure or indeterminate accordingly. Clinical improvement was considered success, all other outcomes as non-success.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bacteriological Response at Test Of Cure (TOC) Visit Microbiologically Valid</measure>
    <time_frame>7 - 14 days at TOC visit</time_frame>
    <description>The bacteriological responses was based on the results of appropriate cultures taken before and, if necessary, during treatment, at the TOC visit and within the follow-up period. Bacteriological response at the TOC visit would also be based on repeated PCR tests for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bacteriological Response at Test Of Cure (TOC) Visit in Intent To Treat Population With Causative Organism</measure>
    <time_frame>7 - 14 days at TOC visit</time_frame>
    <description>Bacteriological response at the TOC was analyzed exploratively in the same way as the primary efficacy variable based on the subgroup of microbiologically valid subjects. At the TOC visit, eradication was considered a bacteriological success, and persistence, presumed persistence and superinfection were considered bacteriological failures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Response at Follow-up Visit on Per Protocol Population</measure>
    <time_frame>28 - 42 days after completion of study drug therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response at follow up was analyzed exploratively in the same way as the primary efficacy variable. At Follow-up, the clinical response was graded as continued cure, clinical relapse, or indeterminate, of which only continued cure was considered success. Failures from end of treatment were carried forward.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Response at Follow-up Visit on Intent To Treat Population</measure>
    <time_frame>28 - 42 days after completion of study drug therapy</time_frame>
    <description>All successfully treated subjects and subjects evaluated as&quot;indeterminate&quot; at TOC, who were not administered an additional antibiotic therapy would have their clinical response rate assessed at the follow-up visit. Patients with missing or indeterminate outcome were treated as non-successes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bacteriological Response at Follow-up Visit Microbiologically Valid</measure>
    <time_frame>28 - 42 days after completion of study drug therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects with at least one causative organism identified in the pre-therapy culture or a positive pre-therapy PCR result and an appropriate post-therapy bacteriological evaluation available were analyzed. Bacteriological responses at follow-up visit was analyzed exploratively in the same way as the primary efficacy variable.</description>

      <recruitment_details>A total of 463 females with uncomplicated PID were enrolled on the basis of a complete evaluation (interview, medical history and physical examination and laboratory tests). 460 subjects were randomized, 412 completed study treatment (whole medication), and 384 subjects were valid for the primary efficacy analysis.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The efficacy results in ITT are consistent with those in PP, supporting that this is a non-inferiority study and the primary efficacy population was PP not ITT. 76 subjects were excluded from primary efficacy analysis mainly due to essential data missing or invalid, violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria and insufficient duration of therapy.</pre_assignment_details>
