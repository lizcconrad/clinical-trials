        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Will initiate study drug treatment in the hospital;

          -  Has a life expectancy exc. 1 month.Is male or a non-pregnant, non-lactating female,
             who is post-menopausal, surgically sterilized; or has been using one or more birth
             control methods for at least two months prior to study entry.

          -  Effective contraception must continue for at least 30 days after treatment
             discontinuation;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a history of suspected or documented Type I hypersensitivity reaction (e.g.
             anaphylactic or anaphylactoid shock, respiratory distress from bronchospasm or rash)
             to glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin), aminoglycosides, b-lactams or
             cephalosporins

          -  Has renal dysfunction requiring dialysis ;

          -  Has neutropenia associated with a syndrome that is not generally thought to be
             associated with a high risk of bacterial infection (e.g., chronic benign neutropenia);

          -  Is in blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia;

          -  Has a known underlying immunocompromising disease likely to interfere with the
             evaluation of therapeutic response, such as infection with human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV) ;

          -  Had isolation and identification of a specific pathogen suspected to be responsible
             for fever ;Has documented colonization with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium
             or with Enterococcus faecalis

          -  Had received more than one dose of a systemic (whether oral or parenteral) antibiotic
             within 3 calendar days preceding the initial therapy for this episode of fever;

          -  Has received oral vancomycin for prophylaxis of Gram-positive infection;

          -  Requires addition of anti-viral, anti-anaerobic or anti-fungal coverage at the same
             time as study medication; however, antiviral or antifungal prophylaxis is allowed,
             provided that it is not started at the same time than study medication.

          -  Has suspected, invasive fungal disease (e.g. image of necrotic pneumonia), peri-rectal
             infection, liver abscess, or necrotizing enterocolitis (typhlitis).

          -  Had a negative serum or urine laboratory pregnancy test (for all women except those
             post-menopausal or surgically sterilized).

          -  The patient has one of the following:Leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, solid
             tumors or who had undergone bone marrow transplantation (for any reason)

          -  Had neutropenia at the time of initiation of initial empiric antibiotic therapy,
             defined as &lt;500 neutrophils/mm3 of blood; or if Â³500 but &lt;1,000 neutrophils/mm3 and
             expected to fall below 500 neutrophils/mm3 within 48 hours.

          -  Has at least one of the following conditions:

          -  clinically obvious, serious catheter-related infections. For a patient with documented
             catheter-related infection due to an organism other than coagulase negative
             staphylococci, the catheter has been removed within 24 hours of identification
             (removal over a guidewire is permitted).

          -  Intensive chemotherapy that produces substantial mucosal damage (i.e., high-dose
             cytarabine (&gt; 1 g/m2/day, which increases the risk for penicillin resistant
             streptococcal infections, particularly those due to viridans streptococci);

          -  prophylaxis with quinolones before the onset of the febrile episode; known
             colonization with pneumococci that are resistant to penicillin and -cephalosporins or
             methicillin-resistant S. aureus; a blood culture positive for gram-positive bacteria
             before final identification and susceptibility
