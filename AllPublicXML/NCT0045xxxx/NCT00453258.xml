  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The significance of our study is in the importance of understanding the quality and quantity
      of proteins in the human tear film from diseased and non-diseased patients. This pilot study
      will provide data to plan prospective research to better delineate the utility of tear
      proteins in diagnosing and following disease status in a non-invasive fashion.
