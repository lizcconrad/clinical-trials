  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is common in the elderly; by the age of 70, approximately 25% of the population will
      have diabetes. Unfortunately, currently available medications are often not as effective or
      not well tolerated in older adults. Sitagliptin is a new medication in a new class of agent
      called incretins. Incretins have many potential advantages for the treatment of diabetes in
      the elderly. They stimulate insulin secretion, which is impaired in all older people with
      diabetes. The incidence of hypoglycemia with currently available medications increases with
      age, and incretins rarely cause hypoglycemia . They assist with weight loss, whereas many
      current medications used to manage diabetes result in weight gain in the elderly. They
      improve insulin action, and insulin resistance is a major problem in older people with
      diabetes.

      To date, no clinical trials have been conducted specifically in the elderly, but the data
      noted above from our laboratory would imply that inhibitors of this enzyme could be more
      effective in the elderly patient population. In addition, we have convincingly demonstrated
      that diabetes in the elderly is metabolically distinct from diabetes in middle aged patients
      (1). Thus, it is clear further studies are warranted to determine the effectiveness of drugs
      in this class in elderly patients with diabetes. We propose a series of studies with your DP4
      inhibitor sitaglipitin to determine its efficacy and safety in an elderly patient population
      with diabetes.
