             aged between 18 and 70 years of age.

          -  BASDAI greater than or equal to 40 (all scores on a scale of 0 to 100).

          -  Negative result of serum human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy test taken at
             screening in all women except those surgically sterile or at least 1 year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Complete ankylosis (fusion) of spine.

          -  Previous receipt of etanercept, antibody to TNFα, or other TNFα inhibitors.

          -  Use of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) other than hydroxychloroquine,
             sulphasalazine, and methotrexate within 4 weeks of baseline. Patients treated with
             hydroxychloroquine, sulphasalazine, and methotrexate may continue these drugs during
             this study but doses must be held stable for 4 weeks before baseline examination and
             for the duration of the study.
