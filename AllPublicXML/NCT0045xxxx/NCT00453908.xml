  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate if 14 days of treatment with Alfuzosin
      compared to placebo, will increase the number of patients with satisfying spontaneous voiding
      after acute urinary retention treated with Clean Self-Catheterization.

      Furthermore is investigated the safety of the medical treatment and self-catheterization.
