      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of Aquamin F alone or in combination
      with glucosamine sulfate versus placebo on symptoms of joint pain, stiffness and immobility
      in subjects with painful osteoarthritis of the knee. The following hypotheses were tested:

      (Hypothesis 1) After 12 weeks of treatment, subjects taking Aquamin F alone or in combination
      with glucosamine sulfate will have significantly less joint pain, stiffness and immobility
      compared to subjects taking glucosamine sulfate alone or placebo alone.

      (Hypothesis 2) No significant differences will be seen for adverse events between the
      subjects taking Aquamin F, glucosamine sulfate, Aquamin F + glucosamine sulfate or placebo.

      Method: Subjects were randomized to receive 12 weeks of Glucosamine sulfate vs Aquamin F vs
      Placebo vs Aquamin F + Glucosamine sulfate while controlling for pain with acetaminophen.
      Subjects were then followed for blood chemistry measurements only over an additional 12-week
      period specifically to assess blood calcium levels post treatment. All participants were
      subjected to the same diet and exercise regimen and measurements included: WOMAC scores
      (pain, stiffness, mobility, total score), 6 Minute Walking Distances, active and passive
      range of motion measurements, DXA scans, blood chemistry, hematology, CRP levels and lipid
      profiles as well as rescue medication diary measurements and adverse event assessments. An
      independent statistician analyzed the data using independent t-tests and ANCOVA for
      between-group comparisons and matched-pair t-tests for within-group comparisons of patients
      included in ITT-LOCF and completer analyses.
