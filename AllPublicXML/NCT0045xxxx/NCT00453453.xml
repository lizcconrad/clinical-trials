    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that patients admitted to an emergency department (ED)
      observation unit will have a decreased rate of hospital admissions and ED recidivism when
      treated with nesiritide versus standard therapy. The investigators also hypothesize that
      decreasing B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) levels during treatment in an ED observation unit
      will predict improved patient outcomes.

    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a growing problem in the United States. The increasing
      number of decompensated heart failure patients presenting to emergency departments (ED) for
      treatment is worsening the burden on already strained and limited health care resources. In
      addition, many of these patients will return to the ED for treatment within three months of
      being treated for decompensated heart failure. The emergence of ED observation units has
      provided a viable and cost effective alternative to inpatient treatment for many diseases
      including CHF. It has been shown that intensive, directed therapy in ED observation units has
      decreased the revisit rates for CHF patients. In addition, the introduction of nesiritide has
      shown promising results in the treatment of decompensated congestive heart failure.

      The primary aim of this study is to compare nesiritide versus standard heart failure therapy
      in an ED setting. A secondary aim is to determine if serial BNP levels during this
      observation unit stay will predict clinical outcomes.

      The treatment of heart failure in the ED places a tremendous burden on already limited
      resources. The costs of treatment as well as the morbidity and mortality associated with the
      disease are worsening and are predicted to increase as the general population ages. The
      ability to safely treat and discharge patients from an ED observation unit while reducing
      return visits would be invaluable in managing the growing number of heart failure patients.

    <description>The BNP levels per subject will be plotted to their return rate to the emergency department. Pearson correlation coefficient will be calculated to explore their relationship. Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear correlation (dependence) between 2 variables, giving a value between +1 and −1 inclusive, where 1 is total positive correlation, 0 is no correlation, and −1 is total negative correlation.</description>
