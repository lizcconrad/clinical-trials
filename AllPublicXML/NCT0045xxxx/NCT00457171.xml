      The aim of this double blind, placebo controlled, study is to evaluate activity consistent
      with efficacy provided by 14 days administration of GI270384X, and to provide preliminary
      pharmacokinetics and safety/tolerability of 14 days administration of GI270384X in patients
      with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis (UC).

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Females can be of childbearing or non-childbearing potential

          -  Subjects who have relapsing (relapsed = 6 weeks ago; this being at least a second
             episode) mild to moderate UC (score of 4 - 11 on the MTWI at Screening and with an
             endoscopy score of = 2). Diagnosis of UC originally must be established by
             sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and have compatible histology.

          -  As confirmed through signed informed consent, the subject must understand and be able,
             willing and likely to fully comply with study procedures and restrictions

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Subjects with severe UC according to the MTWI (score &gt;11) and subjects who have been
             in relapse for &gt; 6 weeks.

          -  Subjects are not eligible for this study if they have Crohn's Disease, proctitis
             (where the extent of inflammation = 15 cm), bleeding disorders, or active ulcer
             disease.

          -  Positive stool culture for enteric pathogens (including Salmonella, Shigella,
             Yersinia, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas or Campylobacter).

          -  Presence of Clostridium difficile toxin present or with ova or parasites as detected
             by microscopy.
