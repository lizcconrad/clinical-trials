      There are still few studies on the effects of positive intra-thoracic pressure on ventricular
      function and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity changes. Aim of the study is to evaluate, in
      patients with chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction &lt; 40%, the modifications of
      ventricular function induced by CPAP (Continuos Positive Airway Pressure) application. All
      the measurament will be made in basal condition (without CPAP) and with CPAP administration
      at 10 cmH2O via an oro-nasal mask.

      Echocardiograpich evaluation: morphologic and hemodynamic evaluation is obtained with an
      echocardiographic exmination. Left ventricular measurement will be assessed in M-mode, under
      two dimensional guide) according to American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. Left
      ventricular ejection fraction will be assessed with Simpson method.

      Right ventricle morphology will be evaluated categorizing dimensions in a) normal, b) mild
      enlargement, c) severely increased and d) reduced. Right ventricle area will also be
      quantified in tele-diastole and in meso-sistole in apical 4 chamber and parasternal
      short-axis.

      Baroreflex control of heart rate was assessed by &quot;sequence method&quot; analysis of continuous
      blood pressure recordings obtained in basal condition and during CPAP. Data obtained by non
      invasive assessment of arterial pressure will be analized and values of arterial systolic,
      diastolic pressure and pulsatory period for each cardiac cicle will be registered.

      Assessment via &quot;sequence method&quot; is founded on identification, every 10 minutes, on sequences
      characterized by a progressive increase both in pressure both in RR interval or, conversely,
      by a progressive reduction of pressure and RR interval evaluated on 4 or more cardiac cicles.
