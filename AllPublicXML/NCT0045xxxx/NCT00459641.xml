    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, controlled, open-label study of a single intralesional administration
      of I-040302 or a single bone marrow aspirate or a single steroid injection
      (methylprednisolone). Subjects will undergo screening with X-ray and magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of a solitary bone cyst.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects 6 - 16 years of age

          2. Diagnostic evidence of unicameral bone cysts based on one or more of a combination of
             any of the following methods:

               -  Cyst fluid examination

               -  Plain radiographs

               -  MRI

          3. Subjects with the following types of cysts:

               -  Intact cysts that are either growing or at risk of fracture, requiring surgical
                  intervention

               -  Persistence of a cyst cavity following cyst fracture that has received
                  conservative treatment/s to repair the fracture

               -  Persistence of a cyst cavity despite repeated interventions

          4. Subjects with bone cyst volumes &lt; 30 mL

          5. Subjects must be appropriately communicative to verbalise pain.

          6. Subjects must be able to understand and be willing to comply with the protocol
             procedures.

          7. Subjects who have provided written informed consent to participate in the study

          8. The legally authorised representative of the child must give written informed consent
             after the child has agreed to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A history of/or presence of active cancer

          2. Family history of retinoblastoma

          3. Indication of aneurysmal bone cyst on MRI, cyst aspiration or histology

          4. Possible presence of osteosarcoma or uncertain histology

          5. Systemic or localised infection at time of surgery

          6. Evidence of immune-suppression

          7. Evidence of hypercalcemia

          8. Cyst volume &gt; 30 mL

          9. Fracture present in the cortical bone surrounding the cyst

         10. Evidence of rapid venous drainage from the cyst determined by rapid disappearance of
             X-ray contrast medium during the surgical process.

         11. Suspected or known evidence of allergic reactions towards any of the components of
             I-040302

         12. Known clinically significant organ or systemic diseases such that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, the significance of the disease will compromise the subject's
             participation in the study

         13. Pregnant or lactating females

         14. Participation in another clinical trial within 3 months prior to trial start
