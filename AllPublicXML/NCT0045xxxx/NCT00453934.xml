  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare patient preference of the h-Patch as
      delivery device for insulin lispro compared with either an insulin pen or needle and syringe
      in patients with diabetes, either Type 1 or Type 2, on stable multiple daily injection
      regimens. This will be assessed using an accepted preference scale.

    <textblock>
      Patients with Type 1 Diabetes have an absolute deficiency in insulin production and benefit
      from physiologic insulin replacement, defined as administration of background and mealtime
      insulin. More than half of patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have less than 50% of their
      beta cell function at the time of diagnosis. Because of this, these patients would also
      benefit from the physiologic delivery of insulin. Currently, 4 or more injections per day are
      required to deliver the various different available insulins in a physiologic manner.
      Valeritas has developed the h-Patch, a device suitable to make the delivery of basal and
      bolus insulin effective, simple and discrete. This study will measure patient preference,
      glucose control and safety of the h-Patch compared with patients' previous therapy. Patients
      previous therapy will be multiple daily injections delivered either by pens or needle and
      syringe.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of Type 1or Type 2 diabetes mellitus for at least a year

          2. Stable insulin regimen for at least 3 months consisting of multiple daily injections
             of human regular or rapid acting insulin at meal times and long or intermediate acting
             insulin as basal. In this protocol multiple daily injections requires at least three
             injections daily.

          3. Total daily insulin dose between 50 and 80 units.

          4. If patient is Type 2, can be treated with metformin and/or a thiazolidinedione and/or
             a sulfonylurea, but other diabetes drugs including α-glucosidase inhibitors,
             meglitinides, pramlintide exenatide, and DPP-IV's are excluded.

          5. HbA1c &gt; 7.0% and &lt; 9.0%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Recurrent major hypoglycemia or prolonged unstable blood glucose control (as judged by
             the Investigator).

          2. Use of other diabetes drugs including α-glucosidase inhibitors, meglitinides,
             pramlintide, exenatide or DPP-IV inhibitors (metformin and/or a thiazolidinedione
             and/or a sulfonylurea are allowed).

          3. Intend to use any other concomitant drug therapy (prescription or over-the-counter
             medications) that can affect blood glucose levels.

          4. Have used systemic glucocorticoids within 1 month prior to Screening or currently on
             glucocorticoids.

          5. Have a history of drug or alcohol abuse within 1 year prior to Screening Visit.

          6. Have a history or presence of cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal,
             gastrointestinal, or neurological disease that would, in the investigator's opinion,
             preclude safe participation in the study.

          7. Have a history of major surgery, e.g. laparotomy, thoracotomy, open orthopedic
             procedure, etc. within 3 months prior to Screening Visit.

          8. Evidence of significant neuropsychiatric disease.

          9. Have participated in a medical, surgical, or pharmaceutical investigational new
             drug/device study in the last 30 days or ≤ 5 half-lives of the investigational drug,
             whichever is longer, prior to Screening Visit.

         10. Blood donation of 500 ml or more in the last 2 months prior to Screening Visit.

         11. Evidence of significant active hematological disease.

         12. Acute infection with fever.

         13. Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL; AST, ALT ≥ 1.5 times the upper reference limit at Screening.

         14. Uncontrolled treated/untreated hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 155 mmHg and
             diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg).

         15. History of proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring acute treatment

         16. Mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barrier precluding adequate understanding
             or co-operation.

         17. Any condition that the Investigator and/or Sponsor feel would interfere with trial
             participation or evaluation of results

         18. Pregnancy, breast-feeding, intention of becoming pregnant for female patients of
             child-bearing potential.
