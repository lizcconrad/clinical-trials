      This amended expansion phase of the protocol is to further the experience at a dose level of
      150 mg CPT eq/m2 in patients with Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell
      lung cancer (SCLC) and to test for preliminary anti-tumor activity in these tumor types. The
      MTD was initially defined as 113 mg CPT equivalents(eq)/m2 in the dose escalation part of the
      study. However, in the initial expansion phase (Protocol Amendment 11), 11 patients (10 NSCLC
      patients and 1 gastric cancer patients) were dosed at 113 mg CPT eq/m2 and less bone marrow
      toxicity was observed as compared to more heavily pre-treated patients in the dose escalation
      part of the study. Therefore, this amended expansion phase will investigate the safety and
      anti-tumor effects of a dose of 150 mg CPT eq/m2.

      The study will also determine:

        -  The safety and tolerability of XMT-1001 at 150 mg CPT eq/m2

        -  The pharmacokinetics (PK) of XMT-1001 (how XMT-1001 behaves in the body) in patients
           Stage IV non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer

        -  Evidence of XMT-1001 anti-tumor activity at 150 mg CPT eq/m2

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study of XMT-1001 administered intravenously over 4 hours every 21 days
      (1 Cycle). Blood sampling for PK analyses will be performed immediately prior to dosing, and
      9 times after dosing. Patients will be assessed for toxicities known to occur with other
      drugs of this class, such as bone marrow suppression, elevated liver function enzymes,
      hemorrhagic cystitis, and diarrhea. Tumor imaging will be performed every 2 cycles.

The first dose level is 17 mg/m^2, the next dose level is 30 mg/m^2, followed by dose levels: 50 mg/m^2, 80 mg/m^2, 120 mg/m^2, 150 mg/m^2, and 190 mg/m^2 until disease progressions or unacceptable side effects are experienced.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. At least 18 years old

          2. Have histological or cytological documentation of one of the following:

             A. NSCLC with Stage IV disease according to the American Joint Cancer Commission TNM
             Staging (7th Edition)

               -  Have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen but no more than two
                  chemotherapy regimens for their advanced disease (not containing irinotecan or
                  topotecan).

               -  Adjuvant chemotherapy will be considered as a prior chemotherapy regimen only if
                  it is completed less than 6 months prior to enrollment.

               -  Treatment with erlotinib or crizotinib as single agents will not be considered as
                  a chemotherapy regimen for purposes of this trial OR B. SCLC with Stage IV
                  (extensive) or recurrent disease after definitive treatment for limited stage
                  disease according to the American Joint Cancer Commission TNM Staging (7th
                  Edition)1

               -  Have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen but no more than two
                  chemotherapy regimens for their advanced disease (not containing irinotecan or
                  topotecan).

               -  Adjuvant chemotherapy will be considered as a prior chemotherapy regimen only if
                  it is completed less than 6 months prior to enrollment.

          3. Patients must be refractory or resistant to standard therapy or for whom standard
             therapy is not anticipated to be curative and who have progressed through prior
             regimens.

          4. Patients must have measurable disease with at least one lesion that can be accurately
             measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The lesion size

             patient is stable for at least two weeks and does not require steroids (at least one
             week off steroids). Anti-seizure medication is allowed at the discretion of the
             treating physician.

          6. At least 42 days since administration of mitomycin or nitrosoureas, and 28 days since
             any other chemotherapy, investigational agent, and/or radiation therapy.

          7. Have the following laboratory values:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500 cells/mm3

               -  Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL

               -  Adequate renal function (serum creatinine ≤2 mg/dL) and creatinine clearance ≥45
                  mL/min (Calculated by Cockroft and Gault method)

               -  Adequate hepatic function (bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 times
                  the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN, or

                    -  5 times the ULN if liver metastases are present)

               -  Albumin of &gt;3.0 g/dL

               -  PT and PTT ≤1.5 times the ULN
