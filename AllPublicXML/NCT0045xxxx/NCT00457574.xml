  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GMX1777 is a water-soluble, intravenously-administered prodrug of GMX1778. GMX1777 is rapidly
      converted to GMX1778 in vivo. GMX1778 has potent anti-tumor activity against a variety of
      cell lines and models from different tumor origins.

      This is a single-center, open-label, Phase I study of single-agent GMX1777 administered every
      3 weeks to patients with CLL, MM, refractory solid tumors or lymphomas. No investigational or
      commercial agents or therapies other than those described may be administered with the intent
      to treat the patient's malignancy.
