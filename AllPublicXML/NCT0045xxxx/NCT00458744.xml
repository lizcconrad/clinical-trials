      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as talotrexin, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of talotrexin in
      treating young patients with recurrent solid tumors or leukemia that is recurrent or does not
      respond to treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose of talotrexin in
           younger patients with recurrent solid tumors or recurrent or refractory leukemia.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Assess the tolerability of the defined MTD of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      diagnosis (solid tumor vs leukemia).

        -  Stratum 1 (recurrent solid tumor): Patients receive talotrexin IV over 10 minutes on
           days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of talotrexin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

        -  Stratum 2 (recurrent or refractory leukemia): A cohort of 3-6 patients with leukemia
           receive treatment as in stratum 1 at the MTD determined in stratum 1. If 2 or 3 or 2 of
           6 patients experience a DLT at the solid tumor MTD, accrual is stopped.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
