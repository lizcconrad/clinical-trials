  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate clinical efficacy of the investigational
      trifunctional bispecific antibody ertumaxomab for treatment of patients with HER-2/neu 1+ or
      2+ (FISH-) expressing advanced or metastatic breast cancer (stage III b/IV) which has
      progressed after endocrine therapy.

      Ertumaxomab is a trifunctional bispecific antibody targeting Her-2/neu and CD3 on T cells.
      Trifunctional antibodies represent a new concept for targeted anticancer therapy. This new
      antibody class has the capability to redirect T cells and accessory cells (e.g. macrophages,
      dendritic cells [DCs] and natural killer [NK] cells) to the tumor site. According to
      preclinical data, trifunctional antibodies activate these immune cells, which can trigger a
      complex anti-tumor immune response.

      An open-label, non-randomized, uncontrolled, one-stage, phase II study evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of the investigational trifunctional bispecific antibody ertumaxomab
      (anti-Her-2/neu x anti-CD3) for the treatment of hormone therapy refractory advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer tumours (stage IIIb or IV) which are known to express HER-2/neu (1+
      or 2+/FISH negative).Ertumaxomab will be administered at 7 day intervals by constant rate 3
      hour intravenous (i.v.) infusions according to the following sequential dose schedule: 10 µg
      (day 0) and thereafter 100 µg flat doses once every 7 days (± 1 day) for a maximum of up to
      12 weeks or until disease progression or any other unacceptable toxicity.
