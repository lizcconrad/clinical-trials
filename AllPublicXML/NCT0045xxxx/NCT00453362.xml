  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, international pilot study to evaluate changes
      that occur in 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG)- and
      3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine(FLT)-PET (Positron Emission Tomography) imaging as a result
      of treatment with erlotinib in patients with recurrent or refractory non−small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). The study will enroll approximately 30 patients at approximately 4 sites in
      Australia and 2 sites in the United States.
