  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The emergency department (ED) constitutes a high-risk environment for errors and poor quality
      of care. Pediatric patients are at increased risk of medical errors. We postulate that
      implementation of a patient-centered health information technology - ParentLink - can address
      system-level deficiencies and the unique “just-in-time” information needs of ED physicians
      and the parents of ill children. The proposed work delivers an innovative product – an
      electronic interface linked to a pediatric knowledge base that integrates parent-derived data
      with best practices for safe and effective emergency care across common pediatric disease
      conditions: otitis media, urinary tract infections, asthma, and head trauma. The study has
      two aims, the first of which addresses critical gaps in data capture: to evaluate the
      completeness and accuracy of information on symptoms, disease condition, medications and
      allergies generated by parents using ParentLink versus information documented by ED
      physicians and nurses, using structured telephone interviews as a gold standard. The second
      aim measures the ParentLink’s impact on ED patient safety and quality, specifically: a) the
      error rate for ordering and prescribing of medications during ED care, and b) the percent of
      ED visits that adhere to national evidence-based guidelines. Parentlink will be rigorously
      evaluated in a clinical trial at two diverse ED sites and will use a sequential,
      non-randomized observational design with two intervention and two control periods to measure
      the effects of ParentLink on data capture and safety and quality of patient care.
