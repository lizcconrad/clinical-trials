      Linear flow during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) frequently induces renal damage.

      We will evaluate whether automatic intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) induce pulsatile
      perfusion preserves renal function in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization at
      different risk for renal damage.

      100 patients undergoing preoperative IABP will be stratified for renal function.

      Intervention. The patients will be randomized to non-pulsatile CPB during cardioplegic arrest
      or automatic IABP induced pulsatile CPB.

      Renal function, daily diuretics, complication rate, lactatemia and other biochemical indices
      will be compared in patients.

      We will prospectively enrolle 100 patients undergoing isolated primary high-risk coronary
      artery bypass grafting for severe left main stem disease (70% narrowing) or left-main
      equivalent three-vessels coronary disease. On admission to our institution, the patients will
      be stratified for renal function according to KDOQI and randomly assigned to Group A or Group
      B. We will exclude from the study patients older than 75 years, and/or with kidney disease ≥
      Stage 4 (GFR 15 – 29 ml/min/1.73 m2), and/or with other splanchnic organ comorbidities (liver
      or mesenteric impairment, abdominal aortic aneurysm, abdominal arteries vasculopathy), and/or
      severe autoimmune disease.

      The patients randomized to Group A (n=50) will receive a preoperative IABP treatment before
      induction of anesthesia, with IABP turned off during cardioplegic arrest, and restarted with
      a 1:1 IABP mode immediately after cross-clamp removal (as is the traditionally adopted
      perioperative IABP support); the other 50 (Group B) will receive standard preoperative
      treatment with IABP, which will switche into an automatic 80 bpm mode during cross-clamp
      time, and switche again into a 1:1 IABP after cross-clamp removal, in order to achieve a
      pulsatile perfusion during the entire intra-operative time-course.

      The patients will be stratified in 2 subgroups according to the preoperative renal function:
      a subgroup will include 64 patients (32 allocated in Group A and 32 in Group B) with stage 1
      or 2 [Stage 1: GFR ≥90 ml/min/1.73 m2 – Stage 2: GFR 60 - 89 ml/min/1.73 m2] and therefore
      considered at lower-risk for post-CPB renal damage; the remaining 36 (18 for each group) with
      KDOQI Stage 3 of kidney disease (GFR 30 – 59 ml/min/1.73 m2) will be considered at
      higher-risk for perioperative renal complications [19].

      KDOQI Stage 3 of kidney disease (GFR 30 – 59 ml/min/1.73 m2) will be considered at
      higher-risk for perioperative renal complications [19].

      The study protocol has been approved by the institution’s Ethical Committee/Institutional
      Review Board, and informed consent will be obtained from each patient.

      Anesthesia Anesthetic technique will be standardized: induction will consiste of i.v.
      propofol infusion (3 mg/kg) combined with fentanyl (0.10 mg/Kg). Neuromuscular blockade will
      be achieved by 4 mg/h pancuronium bromide, and lungs will be ventilated to normocapnia with
      air and oxygen (45-50%). Propofol infusion (150-200 μg/Kg per min) and isoflurane (0.5%
      inspired concentration) will maintaine anesthesia. Inotropes will be started immediately
      after aortic cross-clamp removal to maintain adequate mean systemic pressure, always starting
      with enoximone at a dosage of 5 μg/Kg/min. The need for further increase in inotropes will be
      record: inotropes will be defined as “low-dose” when enoximone will be administered at a
      dosage 5 μg/Kg/min, “medium-dose” when enoximone will be between 6 and 10 μg/Kg/min, or
      dobutamine will add at a dosage between 5 and 10 μg/Kg/min, and “high-dose” when enoximone or
      dobutamine will be &gt;10 μg/Kg/min or epinephrine add at any dose.

      Surgical technique and cardiopulmonary bypass According to our Institutional policy we will
      insert IABP (7.5 or 8 Fr, 34 or 40 ml according to the body surface area; balloon Datascope
      Corp., Fairfield, NJ, connected to a Datascope pump [Datascope Corp, Fairfield, NJ])
      percutaneously with the “sheetless” technique, through the best femoral artery, before
      induction of anesthesia, in order to better support the perioperative hemodynamic of patients
      undergoing surgery for severe left main stem or 3-vessels left-main equivalent disease. The
      correct placement of IABP will be always assessed by postoperative chest X-ray or
      transesophageal echocardiography. Patients will receive anticoagulation with enoxaparin, with
      a target activated partial thromboplastin time &gt;40 seconds, starting when the postoperative
      bleeding was controlled (usually within 6 hours). IABP will be withdrawn when hemodynamic
      stability will restore (i.e., a cardiac index 2.0 L/m2 per minute with only minimal
      pharmacologic inotropic support, dobutamine or enoximone at 5 µg/kg per minute). CPB and
      surgical techniques will be standardized and not changed during the study period. Heparin
      will be given at a dose of 300 IU/kg to achieve a target activated clotting time of 480
      seconds or above. Blood recovery with an autotransfusion device (Autotrans Dideco, Mirandola,
      Modena, Italy) will be performed intraoperatively in all cases. A level of hemoglobin lower
      than 8 g/dl will be used as an indication for blood transfusion. Standard CPB circuit will be
      used. The extracorporeal circuit will be primed with 1000 ml of Ringer’s Lactate solution and
      40 mg of heparin. Systemic temperature will be kept between 32 and 34° C. Myocardial
      protection will be achieved with intermittent antegrade and retrograde hyperkalemic blood
      cardioplegia. Total CPB flow will be maintained at 2.6 L/min-1/m-2. In Group A patients, IABP
      will be turned off during cardioplegic arrest, maintaining a standard non-pulsatile CPB;
      Group B patients will undergo IABP-induced pulsatile CPB during cardioplegic arrest, with
      pulsatile flow maintained by an automatic 80 bpm mode until aortic declamping.

      Endpoints The primary endpoint of this study is the evaluation of the renal function as
      assessed by measuring GFR in the perioperative period. In all patients will be evaluated
      perioperative renal function, in-hospital mortality and morbidity, and complications,
      in-hospital and intensive therapy unit (ITU) stay, IABP-related complications. Renal function
      is primarily evaluated by GFR calculated using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal
      Disease (MDRD) study equation, recommended by KDOQI as the preferred equation for the
      calculation of GFR in adults (taking into account serum creatinine, age, race, gender) [22]
      and, secondarily, by other indices, such as urine output, need for diuretics, blood urea
      nitrogen (BUN). Plasma lactate concentrations will be measured to indirectly assess the
      adequacy of tissue perfusion [20] Acute renal insufficiency (ARI) is defined as a decrease
      greater than 50% over preoperative value of calculated GFR. Acute renal failure (ARF) is
      defined as any postoperative renal insufficiency requiring first-time hemofiltration,
      dialysis or any other renal replacement therapy (RRT). In-hospital mortality is defined as
      any death occurring during hospital stay or in the first 30 postoperative days. Hospital
      morbidity is defined as any complication requiring specific therapy or causing a delay in
      hospital or ITU discharge. IABP-related complications is defined as any aortic dissection or
      perforation, limb or mesenteric ischemia, or infection or hemorrhage at the balloon entry
      point.

      Biochemical analysis All patients will undergo pre- and perioperatively routine laboratory
      investigations, including standard hemogram, serum levels of creatinine, urea nitrogen,
      calcium, phosphate, glucose, albumin, electrolytes, albumin, transaminases,
      -glutamyl-transpeptidase, lactic acid dehydrogenase, bilirubin, acid-base parameters,
      troponin I and lactic acid. The determinations of the majority of these parameters will be
      conducted preoperatively before anesthetic induction, and at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours
      postoperatively. In order to evaluate the adequacy of myocardial protection techniques,
      Troponin I will be measured on coronary sinus blood samples, obtained from the retrograde
      cardioplegic cannula, 10 minutes following completion of proximal anastomoses. The Troponin I
      assays will be carried out using diagnostic kits provided by Beckman Coulter (Fullerton,
      California; AccuTnITM Access Immunoassay System).

      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be performed by the SPSS program for Windows,
      version 10.1 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Continuous variables will be presented as mean ±
      standard deviation, and categorical variables as absolute numbers and/or percentages. Data
      will be checked for normality before statistical analysis. Normally-distributed continuous
      variables will be compared using the unpaired t test, whereas the Mann-Whitney U test will be
      used for those variables that are not normally distributed. Categorical variables will be
      analyzed using either the chi-square test or Fischer's exact test. Comparison between and
      within groups will be made using two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures.
      Comparisons will be considered significant if p&lt;0.05.
