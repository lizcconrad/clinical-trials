      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the potential side-effects of artemether /
      lumefantrine and other antimalarials on the auditory function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Artemisinin based combination therapies (ACT) currently are the most promising treatment
      options for uncomplicated falciparum malaria. There have been controversial reports about
      possible ototoxicity of artemether / lumefantrine (Coartem®) from retrospective studies. In
      this investigation treatment of uncomplicated malaria with artemether / lumefantrine,
      quinine, where side-effects on hearing are known, or atovaquone / proguanil, where no such
      effects have been reported, are compared. Auditoy function is examined (Auditory Brainstem
      Response, Pure-tone Audiometry, Otoacustic Emissions) before treatment, after 7, 28, and, for
      determination of irreversibility, after 90 days.
