  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to identify and maintain a registry of well-characterized
      limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) patients. Patients seen as part of this study may be
      candidates for future treatment trials based on their defined genetic classification of LGMD.
      In the course of this study, the investigators will perform a muscle biopsy and DNA testing
      in an unlimited number of patients with clinically diagnosed LGMD. The genetic testing will
      be extended to the family of the study subject in order to better understand true genetic
      defect.
