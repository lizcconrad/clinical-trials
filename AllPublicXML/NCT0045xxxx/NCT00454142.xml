    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well pazopanib hydrochloride works in
      treating patients with stage IV or recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer. Pazopanib hydrochloride
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and
      by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of pazopanib hydrochloride in patients with stage IV or recurrent
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

      II. Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug. III.
      Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the effect of this drug
      on angiogenesis inhibition using dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan.

      V. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients. VI. Correlate the
      effect of this drug on angiogenesis inhibition with the clinical benefit rate and
      pharmacokinetics.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 12
      months.
