      The purpose of this study is to investigate the muscle activity of gluteus medius and tensor
      fascia lata in health control group and patients with PFPS during submaximal isometric muscle
      contraction.The research question :Is there any difference of muscle activity of gluteus
      medius and tensor fascia lata between health control group and patients with PFPS during
      submaximal isometric muscle contraction ？Null hypothesis:There is no difference of muscle
      activity of gluteus medius and tensor fascia lata between health control group and patients
      with PFPS during submaximal isometric muscle contraction.
