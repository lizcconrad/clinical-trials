    <textblock>
      A dietary intervention study in patients with Follicular Lymphoma (FL) Stage III/IV to assess
      the ability of several dietary factors to induce apoptosis, inhibit cell proliferation and
      modulate tumor cell infiltrate in vivo.

      Dietary factors plays an important role in the prevention of several diseases. The
      cardiovascular disease mortality have dropped dramatically the last 20 years, but the
      relative death rates from cancer remains fairly stable. There is reason to believe that
      factors in the tumors microenvironment is of great importance for the outcome of many
      malignant diseases, including FL. Factors predicting a poor outcome are associated with
      inflammation, oxidative stress which both impair the hosts immune response and produces
      growth stimulatory signals. In this open study with 45 patients to be included we seek to
      perform a dietary intervention with comparison of apoptosis rate, proliferation rate and
      immune cell infiltrate before and after the intervention period.
