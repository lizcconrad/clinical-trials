  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The beneficial effect of statins to prevent cardiovascular events in patients at risk is well
      established. Recent trials demonstrated that statins can exert a number of vascular actions
      independent of lipid lowering. Short-term simvastatin therapy recently has been reported to
      reduce mortality in 2 different animal models of sepsis. Pleiner and coworkers could
      demonstrate potent vasoprotective properties of simvastatin during Escherichia coli endotoxin
      induced endotoxemia in healthy volunteers. In a population-based cohort analysis it was
      demonstrated that administration of statins was associated with a reduced risk of subsequent
      sepsis. Thus, simvastatin treatment may offer a new therapeutic strategy for clinical
      conditions associated with inflammation like severe sepsis and septic shock. The aim of the
      present study is to test the hypothesis that short term treatment with simvastatin may
      mitigate the detrimental vascular effects of acute inflammation in patients admitted to the
      intensive care unit requiring treatment for septic shock.
