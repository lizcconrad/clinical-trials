      In this research project the investigators want to figure out whether ultrasound (a
      non-invasive method) can be used to assess how the fetus is doing during labor.

    <textblock>
      When you are in labor, the heart beat of your fetus is monitored continuously. The normal
      pattern is reactive and suggests that the fetus is doing well. When the pattern is different
      from reactive, it is difficult to say if the fetus is doing well or not. Previous
      investigators have shown that even with the most worrisome fetal heart rate pattern, only
      2/1000 cases would require immediate delivery. Currently, we use invasive procedures like
      taking a drop of blood from fetal head to further assess how the fetus is doing or just
      proceed with the fastest way of delivery (which could increase the risk associated with
      surgery). In this research project we want to figure out whether ultrasound (a non-invasive
      method) can be used to assess how the fetus is doing during labor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Spontaneous or induced labor

          -  Gestational ages between 35 - 42 weeks

          -  Singleton pregnancy

          -  Intrapartum non-reassuring or uninterpretable FHR tracing defined as any tracing that
             the Labor and Delivery obstetrician is uncomfortable about or feels does not
             absolutely provide fetal reassurance. Inclusive FHR patterns will be repetitive late
             decelerations, recurrent moderate to severe variable decelerations, reduced long or
             short-term variability, prolonged bradycardia (&lt;120/min) that resolves, persistent
             fetal tachycardia (&gt;160/min for &gt;60 min,) or any other FHR patterns necessitating
             further fetal well being evaluation (like scalp pH or scalp stimulation).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Multiple gestation

          -  Gestational age &lt; 35 weeks

          -  Patient denial to undergo ultrasound examination during labor

          -  Abnormal FHR tracing requiring stat delivery
