        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of chronic musculoskeletal pain of at least six months duration secondary to
             FMS using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and with the minimum of 11
             of 18 defined tender points, measured by dolorimeter at a threshold of up to 4 kg of
             pressure

          -  Males and females, 18 years and older

          -  Able to complete assessment index forms unaided by caregiver/interpreter

             Baseline Period scores recorded on the 7 days immediately prior to randomization

          -  Demonstration of stabilized pain scores as measured on the NRS during the Baseline
             Period (Days -7 to -1)

          -  Able to tolerate prohibition of all medications for pain, depression and sleep
             disorders except for acetaminophen (up to 4 g/day) and cardiac aspirin (up to 325
