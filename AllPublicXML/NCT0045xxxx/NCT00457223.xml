      The purpose of this study is to compared between conventional pterygium excision and AMT
      transplantation with suture and with fibrin glue.

      There are few studies about use of fibrin glue in pterygium surgery with conjunctival
      auto-graft with promising outcome. Less recurrent rate, less discomfort and halve surgical
      time were reported.

      Up to our knowledge,there is no report of fibrin glue in pterygium excision with amniotic
      membrane transplantation(AMT). There is conventional technique to use AMT in King
      Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital because some benefits over conjunctival auto-graft e.g.

        -  Preserve healthy superior conjunctiva for future glaucoma filtering surgery

        -  Can use in big or 2-headed pterygium

        -  Not contract as conjunctival graft esp. in case of fibrin glue

        -  Potential easier to use with fibrin glue

        -  Available from Thai Red Cross Eye Bank Comparison(s): amniotic membrane transplantation
           using fibrin glue compare to suture after pterygium excision.
