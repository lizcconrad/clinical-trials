  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key regulator of growth, differentiation,
      and survival of epithelial cancers. In a small subset of tumors, the presence of activating
      mutations within the ATP binding site confers increased susceptibility to gefitinib, a potent
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR. Agents that can inhibit EGFR function through different
      mechanisms may enhance gefitinib activity in patients lacking these mutations. Mevalonate
      metabolites play significant roles in the function of the EGFR; therefore, mevalonate pathway
      inhibitors may potentiate EGFR-targeted therapies. Targeting HMG-CoA reductase, the
      rate-limiting enzyme of mevalonate pathway, using lovastatin induces a potent apoptosis in a
      variety of tumor types. In an in vitro study, combining gefitinib and lovastatin treatment
      showed synergistic cytotoxic activity through enhanced inhibition of AKT activation by EGF in
      NSCLC and head &amp; neck cancer cell lines. Therefore, the investigators would like to compare
      the combination effect of gefitinib and simvastatin, the specific and protein inhibitor of
      HMG-CoA reductase, with gefitinib alone in previously treated patients with NSCLC.
