      The purpose of this study is to determine whether iobenguane I 131 is safe and effective in
      patients with malignant pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.

      This was originally designed as a phase 1/2 study. The phase 1 patients received a small dose
      of study drug to see if the tumors absorb the drug. If the patient's tumors absorbed the
      drug, then the patient received one therapeutic dose. In the phase 1 portion, the study
      employed a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. Enrollment in the phase 1 portion was to be
      completed once researches believed that they found the highest dose that they could give
      patients without causing unacceptable toxicity. This dose is called the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD). Following discussions with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that occurred
      during the dose escalation stage of the study, the protocol was amended to conclude the trial
      upon the identification of the MTD. The Phase 2 safety/ efficacy stage of the study was
      conducted with modifications of the primary endpoint as Protocol MIP IB12B, with Special
      Protocol Assessment Agreement with the FDA in March 2009.

    <description>Dosing of Ultratrace iobenguane I 131 began at 6.0 mCi/kg and escalated in 1.0 mCi/kg increments in order to establish the MTD. The MTD is the dose immediately below the level at which escalation stops due to dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). An additional 3 patients are to be treated at the MTD, for a total of 6.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>24 patients with confirmed pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma were recruited for participation in the trial at 3 US sites. 21 patients received Ultratrace Iobenguane I 131 while 3 patients failed to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria and were therefore not dosed.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Planned Doses: 6, 7, 8 &amp; 9 mCi/kg. Dose reductions in 7, 8 &amp; 9 mCi/kg cohorts were made so total activity administered to pts would not greatly exceed allowed total activity of 525, 600, &amp; 675 mCi for these groups, respectively. Thus, pts were subsequently analyzed in 2 groups of ≤500 mCi and &gt;500mCi, consisting of 7 &amp; 14 patients, respectively.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Although no primary efficacy endpoint was defined for this study, the MTD of Ultratrace iobenguane I 131 in patients with malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (a safety rather than an efficacy parameter) is the primary objective.</description>
        <time_frame>6 weeks post therapy dose</time_frame>
        <population>24 patients with confirmed pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma were recruited for participation in this trial. Of the 24 consenting patients, 21 patients were administered Ultratrace iobenguane I 131. Three patients did not meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and were not allowed into the study.</population>

            <description>Each patient was to first receive an imaging dose of 5 mCi of Ultratrace iobenguane I 131 to confirm tumor uptake of the test article. If at least one tumor on a baseline CT/MRI scan was also visualized on the Ultratrace iobenguane I 131 scan, the patient was administered a therapeutic dose of Ultratrace iobenguane I 131. Dosing began at 6 mCi/kg for an initial cohort of 3 patients, and escalated in 1.0 mCi/kg increments until the MTD was established.</description>
