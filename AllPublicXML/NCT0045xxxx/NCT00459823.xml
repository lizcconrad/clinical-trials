      Two-centre, open-label, non-randomized, dose-finding phase I study to determine the MTD of
      E7107 administered by intravenous infusion (as a 2-5 minutes bolus) on days 1, 8 and 15 every
      28 days in patients with solid tumors, for whom therapy of proven efficacy does not exist or
      is not longer effective.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients must meet all of the inclusion criteria outlined below in order to be eligible to
        participate in the study.

          1. Patients with histologically and/or cytologically confirmed solid tumours who have
             progressed after receiving approved therapies for their disease and for whom no
             curative therapies are available.

          2. Surgery and radiotherapy must have been completed at least four weeks prior to study
             entry, and prior chemotherapy and other anti-cancer therapy, excluding bisphosphonates
             at a steady dose level, must have been discontinued for at least two weeks previously.
             All acute toxicities related to these treatments must have resolved.

          3. Aged &gt;= 18 years.

          4. ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1.

          5. Written informed consent prior to any study specific screening procedures, which will
             include voluntary additional consent to provide specimens specifically for
             pharmacogenomic analysis, with the understanding that the patient may withdraw consent
             at any time without prejudice.

          6. Willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study.

          7. Anticipated life expectancy &gt; three months.

          8. After MTD has been reached: patients must have measurable disease according to RECIST
             criteria.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with the following characteristics will not be eligible for the study:

          1. Symptomatic or progressive brain tumours or brain or leptomeningeal (CNS) metastases
             requiring clinical intervention, except if they have completed local therapy and have
             discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this indication for at least two weeks
             before starting treatment with E7107.

          2. Any of the following laboratory parameters:

               1. haemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL (5.6 mM)

               2. neutrophils &lt;1.5 x 10^9/L

               3. platelets &lt;100 x 10^9/L

               4. serum bilirubin &gt;25 ìM (1.5 mg/dL)

               5. liver function tests (defined as AST and ALT) with values &gt;3 x ULN (5 x ULN if
                  liver metastases are present)

               6. serum creatinine &gt; 105µM (or &gt;1.5 mg/L) or creatinine clearance &lt; 40 mL/min

          3. Positive history of HIV, active hepatitis B or active hepatitis C or
             severe/uncontrolled intercurrent illness or infection.

          4. Clinically significant cardiac impairment or unstable ischemic heart disease (greater
             than Class III according to NYHA classification) including a myocardial infarction
             within six months of study start.

          5. Bleeding or thrombotic disorders, or using therapeutic dosages of anticoagulants.

          6. History of alcoholism, drug addiction, or any psychiatric or psychological condition
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would impair study compliance.

          7. Pregnancy or lactation (all women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test before inclusion in the study; peri-menopausal women must have been
             amenorrheic for at least 12 months, otherwise pregnancy test is required).

             forms of contraception including a barrier method).

          9. Patients with a marked screening or baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (i.e.,
             repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt; 450 msec); a history of additional factors
             of TdP (i.e., heart failure, hypokalaemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome).

         10. Legal incapacity.

         11. After MTD has been reached: Second malignancy within the past 5 years, except for
