      for freezing and thawing human eggs for future use in assisted reproductive technology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ViaCell's product is an investigational product intended to broaden reproductive options for
      women through freezing and thawing of human eggs. The egg is a large cell with a high water
      content, historically making it difficult to freeze. It uses a choline chloride-based media
      designed to protect the cells from damage during the freezing process with the goal of making
      it possible to successfully store and thaw eggs for future use.

      Following informed consent, female subjects will be screened according to the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria of the protocol and eligible subjects will undergo hormonal
      stimulation using standard IVF drugs.
