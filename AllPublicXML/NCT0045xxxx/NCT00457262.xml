  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      paraoxonase 1 is involved to prevent LDL and HDL oxidation,so increase of it's activity leads
      to lower risk of coronary heart disease.In postmenopausal women ,we have decrease of
      paraoxonase1 activity and soy proteins may increase paraoxonase1 activity

    <textblock>
      In a double blind clinical randomised clinical trial with parallel design this study was
      done.52 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to 50 g/d soy protein or placebo for 10
      weeks.serum lipoproteins and pon1 activity were measured at baseline and 10th week.There were
      significant increase in PON! activity and significant decrease in LDL-C,LDL-C/HDL-C,TC/HDL-C
      and TG/HDL-C in soy group compare to placebo group.
