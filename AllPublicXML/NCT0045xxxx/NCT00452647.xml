      The purpose of this study is to observe and analyze variation of diastolic blood pressure
      measurements at third trimester of pregnancy and when they present for delivery in comparison
      to healthy volunteers.

      When patients present for delivery, we expect blood pressure to be lower than normal. However
      this is not the case. We aim to determine where this trend occurs throughout to duration of
      pregnancy, and propose possible explanation as to the source of this event.

      After discharge, the information recorded includes each patient's blood pressure upon
      admission to the labor floor, and several blood pressure measurements from prior clinical
      visits.
