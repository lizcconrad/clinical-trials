  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral
      therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder can be increased by combining it with
      D-cycloserine (TCC/D-cycloserine) by comparing with a placebo (TCC/placebo).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most frequent anxiety disorder in the
      general population (Kessler and al., 2005). Currently, the treatment of choice for PTSD is
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; Foa, Davidson and Frances, 1999). Based on remission rates
      after treatment, successful outcomes of CBT for PTSD vary between 46 and 54 % when dropouts
      are considered, and between 56 and 70% among those who completed their therapy (Bradley and
      al., 2005). Thus, there is room for improvement.

      Recently, the results of two published studies on the treatment of phobia of heights (Ressler
      and al., 2004) and social phobia (Hofman, 2006) indicated that the efficacy of CBT was
      increased by adding D-cycloserine. The superior efficacy of CBT/D-cycloserine over
      CBT/Placebo in the treatment of anxiety disorders can result from a greater release of
      glutamate, a substance facilitating the extinction of fear (Davis, Myers, Ressler and
      Rothbaum, 2005; Richardson, Ledgerwood an Cranney, 2004). However, to our knowledge, no study
      has yet compared CBT/D-cycloserine to CBT/Placebo in the treatment of PTSD. The main
      hypothesis of the current study is that the efficacy of CBT for PTSD will be increased when
      combined with D-cycloserine compared to a placebo.
