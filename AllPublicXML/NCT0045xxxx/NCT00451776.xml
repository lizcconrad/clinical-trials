  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of its hemodynamic safety, etomidate is widely used for anaesthesia induction of
      cardiac surgery. It can also cause adrenal insufficiency during the following 48 hours ( 11
      betahydroxylase inhibition ). So it could increase hemodynamic dysfunction caused by the SIRS
      following cardiopulmonary bypass.

      A previous observational study found more adrenal insufficiency and need for vasopressive
      support therapy in the etomidate group versus another propofol induced group.

      The aim of our work is to compare hemodynamic dysfunction following induction with etomidate
      for cardiac surgery with ECC. The control group would be induced by Propofol. 94 patients
      would be included.

      Information will be given at the anaesthetic consultation, few weeks before planed cardiac
      surgery. Eligibility and exclusion criteria will be checked. Patient will receive an
      informative written consent notice and all questions will be answered. A standard
      pre-operative blood collection will be sampled.

      In order to minimize the potential confusing effect of daily cortisol variation, only
      surgical procedure performed early morning will be considered. The day before surgery
      definitive inclusion will be decided as the order of procedure is not known before. Only
      patients operated in the morning will be included because of cortisol daily variations. At
      this time, consent and information notice will be signed and checked in the medical record.

      On the morning of surgery, during venous catheter insertion an additional blood sample will
      be collected to asses basal cortisolemia.

      Randomisation will be carried out centrally after patient operative theatre admission, by
      phone call from ICU to randomisation office. Hypnotic drug will be prepared in the ICU
      department next to the operative room and blindly administered to patient ( same volume per
      weight ). All other anesthetic procedures will be standardised : opioid drugs, vasopressive
      support, antifibrinolytics and hemodynamic monitoring.

      After surgery patients are admitted to surgical ICU. They will undergo standard post
      operative exams plus two corticotrophin tests and a dosage of SIRS markers ( IL6 and TNF
      alpha ). These results will only be known at the end of the study.
