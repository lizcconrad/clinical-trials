  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if a certain type of hormone therapy,
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH agonist), affects the way the body produces and
      responds to insulin. The investigators will evaluate the changes in insulin sensitivity
      during and after GnRH agonist treatment for prostate cancer. The investigators are assessing
      the possibility that treatment-related insulin resistance may contribute to the risk of
      diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease in men with prostate cancer.

      -  The study will be divided into 2 groups: one group (Cohort A) will consist of men
           undergoing GnRH agonist therapy for at least 24 months. The second group (Cohort B) will
           consist of men undergoing the same treatment but who are scheduled to receive only 6
           months of treatment.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed when the participant joins the
           study, then at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months thereafter. (All visits will take place at the
           General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at the Massachusetts General Hospital.) Height
           and weight; blood and urine samples; Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), Dual energy
           X-ray Absorptiometry scan; medical history; and physical examinations.
