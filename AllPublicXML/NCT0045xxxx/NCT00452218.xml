      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of sorafenib in patients
      with PAH already on existing therapy with a prostacyclin [epoprostenol (Flolan)],
      treprostinil (Remodulin), or iloprost alone, or with or without sildenafil (Viagra/Revatio).

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an angioproliferative vasculopathy resulting from
      abnormal endothelial and smooth muscle cell interactions. Idiopathic and familial PAH
      (formerly known as primary pulmonary hypertension) occurs more often in women than in men,
      with a median survival of 2.8 years if untreated and a mean age at diagnosis of 35 years. The
      key features of this vasculopathy causes a progressive narrowing of the pulmonary artery and
      their branches, resulting in right heart failure and death. Proliferating endothelial cells
      obliterate medium-sized precapillary arteries, thereby forming the characteristic &quot;plexiform&quot;
      lesions. When combined with the expansion of both vascular smooth muscle cells and
      adventitial cells in pulmonary arteries, these observations evoke comparisons to cancer
      pathobiology. Currently, FDA-approved therapies for PAH such as prostacyclins (epoprostenol,
      treprostinil, and iloprost), endothelin receptor blockers (bosentan) and phosphodiesterase
      inhibitors (sildenafil) all produce functional improvement (6 minute walk distance- 6MW) with
      minimal change in hemodynamic measurements at cardiac catheterization. Only epoprostenol has
      provided survival benefit with the 5-year survival, remaining at 50% without demonstrable
      reversal of the vasculopathy. Clearly there is a critical need for novel targets and
      therapies for PAH.

      In this protocol, the principal investigator (PI) will leverage a large PAH referral practice
      with an established clinical database to assess the potential utility of kinase inhibitors as
      a new class of agents for protease-activated receptor (PAR). These drugs inhibit processes
      important to pathological blood vessel branching and growth and have been a focus for the
      internationally renowned University of Chicago Phase I/II trials unit in oncology led by Dr.
      Mark Ratain (Co-Investigator). The University of Chicago has had a major role in the drug
      development of the recently (12/05) FDA-approved drug, sorafenib, for advanced renal
      carcinoma. Sorafenib inhibits Raf-1 kinase, a regulator of endothelial apoptosis, and
      inhibits angiogenesis growth factor receptors VEGFR-2, PDGFR-B, and VEGFR-3.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  PAH defined as IPAH, FPAH, or PAH associated with collagen vascular disease

          -  Baseline 6MW &gt; 150 meters

          -  PAH as defined by hemodynamics at diagnosis by right heart catheterization defined as:
             mean PAP &gt; 25 mmHg with a normal PCWP &lt; 15 mm Hg at rest and a PVR &gt; 3 Wood units

          -  Receiving conventional therapy as clinically indicated (oxygen, diuretics, aldosterone
             antagonist, calcium channel blockers, digoxin) with dose that is unchanged in the
             preceding 30 days prior to enrollment. This is excluding anticoagulants (warfarin) as
             the patient's dose may not be stable if the patient is having a cardiac
             catheterization at baseline within 30 days of enrollment and warfarin is being held.
             The dose of warfarin needs to be stable for 7 days or therapeutic with an INR = 2.0
