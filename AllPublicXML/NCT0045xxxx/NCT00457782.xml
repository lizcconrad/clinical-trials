  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and dose-limiting toxicities
      of KW-2478 and to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose and recommended Phase II dose for
      patients with relapsed/refractory MM, CLL or B-cell NHL.

      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of KW-2478 in patients with
      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or B-cell Non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma who have no established therapeutic alternatives. Up to 42 patients will be enrolled
      at up to six investigational sites over a period of approximately 12 months until an MTD is
      reached. An additional 12 patients may be enrolled at the MTD in an expanded cohort of one or
      more of the eligible conditions.
