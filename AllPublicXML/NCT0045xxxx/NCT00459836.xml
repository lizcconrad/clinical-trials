      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as PR-104, docetaxel, and gemcitabine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of PR-104 when given
      together with docetaxel or gemcitabine in treating patients with solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of PR-104 in combination with docetaxel or
           gemcitabine hydrochloride in patients with solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of PR-104 in combination with docetaxel or gemcitabine
           hydrochloride in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of these regimens using disease-specific parameters,
           such as exams, scans, and tumor markers, in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of PR-104 and its alcohol metabolite in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and gemcitabine hydrochloride when
           administered with PR-104.

        -  Collect plasma samples for assessment of potential biomarkers of tumor hypoxia from
           these patients.

        -  Examine metabolic changes in tumors using fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission
           tomography (PET) and PET imaging with fluoromisonidazole F 18 (a hypoxia-targeted
           radiopharmaceutical) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter, dose-escalation
      study of PR-104. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups according to patient's
      malignancy and prior treatment history.

        -  Group 1: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 60 minutes and PR-104 IV over 60 minutes on
           day 1.

        -  Group 2: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes and PR-104 IV
           over 60 minutes on days 1 and 8.

      In both groups, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each group receive escalating doses of PR-104 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Blood is collected at baseline and periodically during course 1 for pharmacokinetic analysis.
      Plasma samples are analyzed for biomarkers of tumor hypoxia at baseline and on days 2 and 8.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
