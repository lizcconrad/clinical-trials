    <textblock>
      This Phase 2b study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BG9924 given
      subcutaneously (SC) versus placebo in participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who
      have previously had an inadequate response to treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor
      (anti-TNF) therapy.
