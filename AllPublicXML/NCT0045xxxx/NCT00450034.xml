  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized trial has been designed to determine if this complex intervention can
      significantly decrease the risk of unplanned readmissions in this very elderly population,
      compared with usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drug treatment in elderly is not yet optimal. 20 to 30% of admissions of elderly aged over 80
      are related to drug problems, most of them being preventable. To decrease drug related
      hospitalizations need iatrogenic prevention, compliance improvement, and underuse decrease. A
      multifaceted intervention has been designed, included three dimensions : 1/ drug optimization
      2/ patient and/or caregiver education and 3/ better coordination with home health
      professionals before discharge.

      A randomized trial has been designed to determine if this complex intervention can
