  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the impact of a brief psychosocial intervention delivered to
      children or adolescents who are hospitalized for an unintentional injury. The intervention is
      designed to promote psychological recovery and enhance functional outcomes after injury. The
      study will also provide preliminary data concerning cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

      The core study hypotheses are that children receiving the intervention will (1) have lower
      severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms at follow-up; (2)
      show greater adherence to discharge instructions and better health-related quality of life at
      follow-up, and (3) have higher rates of attendance at scheduled follow-up appointments and
      lower rates of emergency room utilization and re-hospitalization in the 6 months post-injury,
      compared to those receiving usual care.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a stepped care model for
      prevention of psychosocial distress (especially posttraumatic stress) after injury. The model
      includes screening for risk, standard follow-up with those at risk, and additional
      evidence-based interventions matched to individual need.

      The study will evaluate the impact of the intervention on psychosocial outcomes (PTSD and
      depression symptoms); as well as health outcomes (adherence to discharge instructions,
      health-related quality of life), and will provide preliminary data to inform
      cost-effectiveness analyses by describing the costs of providing the intervention and
      examining its impact on subsequent health service utilization.

      Study Design: 180 children at risk for persistent psychosocial distress post-injury, based on
      a screening assessment, will be randomized to the Stepped Preventive Care intervention or
      usual care. An additional comparison group of 90 low risk children will also receive usual
      care and be followed for assessment.

    <measure>PTSD Symptoms in Children 6 Weeks Post-injury</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS) is a 24-item self-report instrument that yields both a continuous severity score and a determination of likely PTSD diagnostic status according to symptom presence. 17 items corresponding to of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV symptom criteria (and are assumed to yield a PTSD symptom severity score range 0-51) and 7 items assess impairment from those symptoms. The 17 symptom items were administered at baseline (prerandomization), with a score of 15 or greater considered a positive screen for PTSD risk (higher values represent more significant severity of and impairment from PTSD symptoms). The 24-item scale was administered at 6 weeks and 6 months postinjury to assess traumatic stress symptom outcomes.</description>

    <description>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is a 20-item self-report measure of depression symptoms that yields a total severity score (range 0-60) . Clinical cut-off scores (≥16 for adults and ≥24 for youth) have been empirically established. Higher values represent more significant severity of symptoms of depression. The CES-D has been validated in adults and children 10 and over as an effective screen for depression. The CES-D was administered at baseline (prerandomization), 6 weeks and 6 months postinjury.</description>

    <description>The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory is a well-validated measure of child health-related quality of life. Children completed the measure at baseline to report preinjury functioning and at 6-weeks and 6-months postinjury regarding current functioning. Current analyses utilize the 8-item Physical health/Physical functioning subscale. Scores range from 0-100; higher scores indicate better functioning outcomes.</description>

    <description>The Health Care Questionnaire for Parents, created for this study, will assess health services utilized post-injury, adherence with specific discharge instructions (e.g., attendance at recommended follow-up appointments), as well as the number of days missed from work (parent) or school (child) related to the injury. Outcome variables to assess adherence will be dichotomized (e.g., attended scheduled appt? yes / no). The Health Care Questionnaire for Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) will assess primary care providers' contacts with study participants, including whether psychosocial concerns were identified since the injury.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Potentially eligible injured patients were identified from patient census and administration lists (n=1330; April 2007 - October 2008). Of 845 eligible children, 149 refused participation, 406 were not approached, usually due to limited parent availability.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>290 children were enrolled for risk screening, of these 85 (29%) scored positive on one or more screening measures for PTSD and were randomly assigned to receive usual care or the intervention (n=39 and n=46 respectively). 5 intervention subjects did not end up receiving the allocated intervention.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>PTSD Symptoms in Children 6 Weeks Post-injury</title>
        <description>The Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS) is a 24-item self-report instrument that yields both a continuous severity score and a determination of likely PTSD diagnostic status according to symptom presence. 17 items corresponding to of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV symptom criteria (and are assumed to yield a PTSD symptom severity score range 0-51) and 7 items assess impairment from those symptoms. The 17 symptom items were administered at baseline (prerandomization), with a score of 15 or greater considered a positive screen for PTSD risk (higher values represent more significant severity of and impairment from PTSD symptoms). The 24-item scale was administered at 6 weeks and 6 months postinjury to assess traumatic stress symptom outcomes.</description>

        <population>85 children were randomly assigned to receive usual care (n=39) or the intervention (n=46, 5 did not go on to receive intervention). Of these subjects, 28 usual care subjects and 36 intervention subjects completed 6 week follow-up.</population>

The CES-D has been validated in adults and children 10 and over as an effective screen for depression.

        <description>The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory is a well-validated measure of child health-related quality of life. Children completed the measure at baseline to report preinjury functioning and at 6-weeks and 6-months postinjury regarding current functioning. Current analyses utilize the 8-item Physical health/Physical functioning subscale. Scores range from 0-100; higher scores indicate better functioning outcomes.</description>

Outcome variables to assess adherence will be dichotomized (e.g., attended scheduled appt? yes / no). The Health Care Questionnaire for Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) will assess primary care providers’ contacts with study participants, including whether psychosocial concerns were identified since the injury.</description>
