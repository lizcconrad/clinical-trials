      Objectives

      Noninvasive stimulation of the central and peripheral nervous system, including transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (TMS), theta-burst TMS (TBS), transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) and cutaneous/peripheral nerve stimulation (CPNS) alone or paired with TMS (paired
      associative stimulation, PAS), has been increasingly used in the investigation of cortical
      plasticity and as a possible adjuvant strategy in neurorehabilitation. It has been shown that
      TMS, TBS, tDCS and CPNS can successfully modulate motor function in healthy volunteers, as
      well as in patients with neurological disorders such as stroke.

      One fundamental problem is that the optimal parameters of stimulation to modulate motor
      function by all of these techniques are not known. The purpose of this protocol is to explore
      within safe guidelines, the effects of different stimulation parameters on motor cortical
      function, on oscillatory brain dynamics measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and
      electroencephalography (EEG), on eye movements, and on fMRI activation. In addition, this
      protocol will be used to train new fellows coming to NINDS Human Cortical Physiology Section
      (HCPS) in the use of TMS, TBS, tDCS, and CPNS techniques.

      We expect that information emerging from these studies will allow us to 1)optimize the
      stimulation parameters to collect pilot data in healthy volunteer for future patient-oriented
      hypothesis-driven protocols,2)to collect pilot data for power analysis for future
      patient-oriented hypothesis driven protocols, and 3) to train new fellows in the use of these
      different methods.

      Study Population

      Up to 1000 healthy volunteers, age 18 and older.

      Design

      Healthy volunteers will receive one or more of the following types of stimulation alone or in
      combination: (1) 1 Hz TMS for up to 30mins and up to 115% of resting motor threshold
      intensity (MT). These parameters are not being used for single-pulse TMS and paired-pulse
      TMS. Parameters for single-pulse TMS and paired-pulse TMS are variable as they depend on the
      sub-study. For paired pulses, duration of each TMS pulse is up to 1 msec. Interval between
      pulses is up to 20 sec and intensity of stimulation is up to 100 % of stimulator s output
      depending on the sub-study. (2) TBS below 100% active MT; (3) tDCS up to 2 mA for up to
      60mins (4) CPNS with intensities below 130% of the peripherally-elicited-motor-threshold for
      up to 2 hours. All of these parameters of stimulation and procedures have safely been used as
      previously reported in the literature. Sham stimulations will be delivered for each modality.

      Each subject may undergo up to 20 sessions spaced by at least one day, depending on the
      particular exploration. To verify that the number of sessions per subject does not exceed 20
      sessions, the number of sessions per participant is tracked across substudies using CTDB. The
      AIs are responsible for entering into CTDB the subjects/visits. We will test the effects of
      these different forms of stimulation on motor cortical excitability, simple motor tasks, and
      functional neuroimaging measures. Some stimulation may be conducted before, after, or during
      fMRI scans, eye movement recording, MEG and/or EEG recording sessions. To identify the
      possible contribution of sub-cortical structures, we will also measure M-wave, F-wave, and/or
      H-Reflexes. The goal of these exploratory studies is to obtain preliminary information on the
      effects of these various combinations of central and peripheral nervous system stimulation
      that would allow us to develop subsequent, finely tuned, hypothesis-driven protocols.

      Under this protocol, we conduct:

      Exploratory Sub-studies. These substudies are exploratory in nature and are conducted in
      order to develop information to generate better informed hypotheses and/or power analyses. We
      have set an upper limit of 40 subjects per sub-study.

      Hypothesis-Testing Sub-studies. Hypothesis-testing sub-studies are studies with specific
      hypotheses to be tested. These sub-studies undergo statistical and PIRC review after 6
      subjects per group (e.g., after 12 subjects, 6 per arm, if two groups are studied), before
      additional subjects can be recruited. Together, the P.I. and PIRC will decide whether to
      continue the sub-study with more subjects without an amendment or whether an amendment or
      protocol would be necessary. A memo requesting a review of hypothesis-testing sub-studies for
      possible additional enrollment (beyond 6) will be sent to PIRC and the statistical reviewer.

      In addition to the sub-study types above, this protocol is used to train new investigators
      and optimize various techniques and experimental approaches (e.g., appropriate MRI sequences,
      parameters of TMS stimulation, behavioral training duration).

      We devised a strategy to ensure that a sub-study engages only procedures authorized in
      protocol and consent form and is scientifically valuable. F...

      upper limit is up to 300% of the sensory threshold. All of these parameters of stimulation
      and procedures have safely been used as previously reported in the literature. Sham
      stimulations will be delivered for each modality.

      Each subject may undergo up to 20 sessions. A single session may last no longer than 8 hours
      to allow for initial testing paradigm followed by retests or performing other components of
      the same substudy later in the day. Appropriate rest breaks and meal breaks will occur during
      long sessions.Subjects participate in one experimental session per day. The 20 experimental
      sessions will be scheduled over a ten-year period. To verify that the number of sessions per
      subject does not exceed 20 sessions, the number of sessions per participant is tracked across
      substudies using CTDB. The AIs are responsible for entering into CTDB the subjects/sessions.

      and optimize various techniques and experimental approaches (e.g., appropriate MRI sequences,
      parameters of TMS stimulation, behavioral training duration).

      We devised a strategy to ensure that a sub-study engages only procedures authorized in
      protocol and consent form and is scientifically valuable. First, the investigator submits the
      sub-study proposal to the PI which describes rationale, methods, techniques and/or behavioral
      tasks. The PI then meets with the investigator and the Protocol Coordinator (PC) to discuss
      the sub-study and make sure all procedures are allowed under protocol and consent form.
      Subsequently, the PI discusses at this time the pilot with the PIRC chair and suggestions are
      incorporated accordingly.

      The status of each sub-study is reported to the IRB at the time of the continuing review.
