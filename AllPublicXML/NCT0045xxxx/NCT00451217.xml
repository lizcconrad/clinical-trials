    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate in adult patients faster recovery from a
      neuromuscular block induced by either rocuronium or vecuronium after reversal at reappearance
      of T2 by 2.0 mg/kg Org 25969 (sugammadex) compared to 50 ug/kg neostigmine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects of ASA 1 - 4;

          -  Subjects above or equal to the age of 18;

          -  Scheduled for surgical procedures with a general anesthesia with the use of rocuronium
             or vecuronium for endotracheal intubation and maintenance of neuromuscular block;

          -  Scheduled for surgical procedure in supine position;

          -  Given written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects in whom a difficult intubation because of anatomical malformations was
             expected;

          -  Subjects known or suspected to have neuromuscular disorders impairing neuromuscular
             block (NMB) and/or significant renal dysfunction;

          -  Subjects known or suspected to have a (family) history of malignant hyperthermia;

          -  Subjects known or suspected to have an allergy to narcotics, muscle relaxants or other
             medication used during general anesthesia;

          -  Subjects receiving medication in a dose and/or at a time point known to interfere with
             neuromuscular blocking agents such as antibiotics, anticonvulsants and Mg2+;

          -  Subjects in whom the use of neostigmine and/or glycopyrrolate may be contraindicated;

          -  Subjects who had already participated in an Org 25969 trial;

          -  Subjects who had participated in another clinical trial, not pre-approved by NV
             Organon, within 30 days of entering into CT 19.4.301.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant:

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential not using any method of birth control:
             condom or using only hormonal contraception as birth control;

          -  Female subjects who were breast-feeding.
