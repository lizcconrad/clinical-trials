  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a three month weight loss phase involving the use of meal replacements, participants
      are randomized into different weight loss maintenance conditions. Aim 1: To test the
      hypothesis that the meal replacement (MR) and reduced energy density eating (REDE)
      interventions, when added separately to the LEARN program, will produce superior weight loss
      maintenance compared to a LEARN-only intervention. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that the
      weight loss maintenance condition that combines MRs and REDE will produce better maintenance
      of weight losses than either individual component and than the LEARN-only condition. Aim 3:
      To test the hypothesis that the two conditions receiving the REDE intervention will
      experience longer-lasting improvements in the energy density and nutritional composition of
      the diet compared to the two non-REDE conditions.
