      Investigate if asthmatics treated with FLIXOTIDE (FP) 500 mcg BID during 14 days get reduced
      bronchial reactivity after inhalation of Leukotriene D4. Two 14 days treatment periods where
      patients received FP 500 MCG BID and placebo. Washout at least 21 days between treatments.
      Bronchial challenge with methacholine and Leukotriene D4 were performed before the start of
      each treatment period and on treatment days 13 and 14 respectively.
