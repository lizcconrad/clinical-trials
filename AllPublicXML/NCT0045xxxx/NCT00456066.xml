  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Distal embolization can occur during coronary angioplasty performed in the acute phase of
      myocardial infarction and is associated with poor long-term outcome. We hypothesize that the
      use of a system allowing thrombus aspiration before angioplasty and stent implantation will
      limit infarct size and its severity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled for emergency angioplasty in the acute phase of a first ST-elevation
      myocardial infarction will be treated either by thromboaspiration followed by angioplasty or
      by angioplasty alone. The infarct size and severity will be assessed by ce-MRI and rest
      Tc99m-mibi gated SPECT performed during initial hospital stay (5th-8th day). A control MRI
      will be performed at 6-month follow-up to analyse the evolution of left ventricular volumes.
