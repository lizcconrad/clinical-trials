  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucose control has been shown as an important and independent prognostic factor in several
      acute conditions in hospitalized patients, including Acute MI, stroke, cardiac surgery and in
      critical care units.

      Patients with acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD)and diabetes treated with insulin had a
      longer in-patient stay and more frequent isolation of Gram negative bacteria from sputum than
      those without diabetes.Hyperglycemia (&gt;11 mmol/l) on admission predicted failure of
      non-invasive ventilation and infectious pulmonary complications in patients admitted to the
      ICU with acute respiratory failure caused by severe AECOPD.

      The primary goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that in AECOPD, tight glycemic
      control during hospital stay will improve outcome of hospitalization.

      The secondary goal of this study is to test new ways in controlling patients in the internal
      medicine ward.
