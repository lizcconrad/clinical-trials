  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oncology patients require numerous invasive procedures throughout their disease process
      including bone marrow biopsies (BMB). BMB.s are performed by a significant number of health
      care providers. One of the biggest concerns for health care providers is to improve patient
      comfort. The goal of this study was to reduce pain during BMBs.

      Specific aims of the study were to determine if there is a difference in patients' perceived
      pain during injection of the pre-procedure anesthetic when buffered versus unbuffered
      lidocaine is administered to patient's receiving bone marrow biopsies.

      A double blind, experimental crossover design was used to examine the difference in pain
      levels when using buffered versus unbuffered lidocaine prior to the bilateral bone marrow
      biopsy procedure. Based on a power analysis for a paired t-test, a convenience sample of 48
      patients was enrolled into the study. Patients served as their own control. The site of first
      biopsy, and which lidocaine solution was administered first, were randomized. A 100mm visual
      analogue scale (VAS) was used to measure pain.

      All data has been collected, are currently under analysis, and results will be completed in
      August 2006. Differences in groups will be examined using a paired t-test. A demographic
      questionnaire was used to gather select demographic variables. Correlative studies will be
      done to examine the relationship between the patient's perceived pain scores and several
      exploratory variables. Results of this study may change the current type of anesthetic used
      pre-BMBs thus improving patient comfort.
