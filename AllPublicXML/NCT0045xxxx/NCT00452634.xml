    <textblock>
      3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly referred to as the statins,
      have proven therapeutic and preventative effects in cardiovascular diseases. Recently, there
      are emerging interests in their use as anticancer agents based on preclinical evidence of
      their antiproliferative, proapoptotic, anti-invasive, and radiosensitizing properties.
      Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase by the statins interferes with the
      rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway, leading to reduced levels of mevalonate and its
      downstream products, many of which play important roles in critical cellular functions such
      as membrane integrity, cell signaling, protein synthesis, and cell cycle progression.
      Perturbations of these processes in neoplastic cells by the statins may therefore result in
      control of tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis. The statins have demonstrated growth
      inhibitory activity in cancer cell lines and preclinical tumor models in animals.
      Simvastatin, a member of the statin family, profoundly impaired basal and growth
      factor-stimulated SCLC cell growth in vitro and induced apoptosis. SCLC cells treated with
      simvastatin were sensitized to the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide. Moreover,
      SCLC tumour growth in vivo was inhibited by simvastatin. Therefore, the investigators will
      conduct this phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy &amp; toxicity of irinotecan/cisplatin plus
      simvastatin in patients with chemo-naïve ED-SCLC.
