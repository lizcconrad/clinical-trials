  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of enteral iron supplementation for
      improving anemia, decreasing the risk of blood transfusion, and decreasing mortality in
      patients who are hospitalized in the intensive care unit. This study will also address any
      relationship between enteral iron supplamentation and risk of infection.

    <textblock>
      Critical illness is characterized by the anemia of inflammation, which is partially caused by
      sequestration of iron from bone marrow sites of erythropoeisis into storage within the
      reticulendothelial system as ferritin. Also the majority of critically ill patients are
      hypoferremia, the efficacy of iron supplementation remains unknown. Furthermore, several
      retrospective studies have found an association between iron overload and infection. However,
      the relative risk/benefit profile of enteral iron supplementation with respect to infection
      has not been studied. The purose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of enteral iron
      supplamentation in critically ill patients. The hypothesis is that enteral iron
      supplamentation will result in both an improved hematocrit and a decreased need for blood
      transfusion, without increasing the risk of infection.
