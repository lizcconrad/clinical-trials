      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib together with
      cisplatin may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving bortezomib
      together with cisplatin works as first-line therapy in treating patients with malignant
      mesothelioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the activity and safety of bortezomib and cisplatin as first-line treatment in
           patients with malignant mesothelioma.

        -  Validate the use of progression-free survival rate as a primary endpoint for the design
           of phase II mesothelioma trials.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days
      1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 76 patients will be accrued for this study.
