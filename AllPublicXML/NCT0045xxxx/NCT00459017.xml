    <textblock>
      Despite knowledge regarding the importance of controlling patients' blood pressure (BP) only
      30% of treated patients achieve BP goals. Our objective was to determine the effect of
      frequent self measurements of BP in the patients' natural environment as a mean to improve BP
      control. Our hypothesis was that frequent measurements of BP will reduce mean BP levels.
