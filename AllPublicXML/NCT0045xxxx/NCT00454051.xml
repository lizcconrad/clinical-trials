    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the expression of IgE high affinity receptors (the part
      of the cell associated with allergic response) in patients suffering from uncontrolled severe
      asthma despite long term treatment with high dose of inhaled corticosteroid and long acting
      Beta-2 agonist.

    <measure>Change (%) From Baseline in FcεRI (High-affinity IgE Receptor) Expression on Blood Basophils and Dendritic Cells After 16 Weeks of Treatment With Omalizumab as Compared With Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Blood was drawn from participants at baseline and at Week 16. Basophils and dendritic cells expressing FcεRI were counted and the percentage was calculated. Fluorescence was used to label FcεRI so that they could be visualized. The greater the fluorescence intensity the greater FcεRI expression. The change from baseline is described by the difference (%) between the baseline value, before the first study drug administration, and the value observed at the end of study, expressed as a percent of the baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change (%) From Baseline in FcεRI (High-affinity IgE Receptor) Expression on Blood Basophils and Dendritic Cells After 16 Weeks of Treatment With Omalizumab as Compared With Placebo</title>
        <description>Blood was drawn from participants at baseline and at Week 16. Basophils and dendritic cells expressing FcεRI were counted and the percentage was calculated. Fluorescence was used to label FcεRI so that they could be visualized. The greater the fluorescence intensity the greater FcεRI expression. The change from baseline is described by the difference (%) between the baseline value, before the first study drug administration, and the value observed at the end of study, expressed as a percent of the baseline value.</description>

        <description>Blood was drawn from participants at baseline and at week 16. Basophils and dendritic cells expressing FcεRI were counted and the percentage was calculated. Fluorescence was used to label FcεRI so that they could be visualized. The greater the fluorescence intensity the greater FcεRI expression. The change from baseline is described by the difference (%) between the baseline value, before the first study drug administration, and the value observed at the end of study, expressed as a percent of the baseline value.</description>
