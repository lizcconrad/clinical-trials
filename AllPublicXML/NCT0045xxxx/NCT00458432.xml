      This study uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore the areas of the brain involved
      in different types of mental processes, in particular, the brain regions involved in
      perception, recognition, learning, and memory. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to
      produce images of body tissues and organs. In this study it is also used to measure blood
      flow in different regions of the brain while the subject is presented auditory or visual
      stimuli. The subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner (a narrow
      cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud noises that occur during the scanning process.
      Subjects are in the scanner no more than 2 hours.

      Healthy, right-handed normal volunteers between 20 and 40 years of age who have at least a
      high school education may be eligible for this study.

      While undergoing MRI, participants are presented visual stimuli (pictures or geometric shapes
      on a projection screen) or auditory stimuli (tones played through a set of headphones).
      Unpleasant stimuli such as loud noise, electric shocks, heat, or tactile stimuli are
      administered occasionally. The intensity of these stimuli is similar to those experienced in
      practice sessions before the scanning. Participants receive between 30 and 60 visual or
      auditory stimuli during the scanning session, and each stimulus lasts about 1 second. In some
      studies participants are asked to move a joystick that controls a rating bar presented on a
      projection screen to indicate when they expect to receive these stimuli and how sure they are
      that they will occur. Heart rate, respiration rate, and sweat gland activity are monitored
      during the MRI sessions, using electrodes placed on the fingers to measure heart rate and
      sweat gland activity and a sensor strapped around the chest to measure respiration. Subjects
      are in the scanner no more than 2 hours.

      Following the experiment, subjects may be asked questions about their experiences during the
      study.

      The long-term goals of this study are to understand the neural substrates of aversive
      Pavlovian conditioning in human subjects. The general approach is to use whole brain
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to describe brain regions and circuits that
      contribute to the acquisition and performance of this form of learning. The specific aims of
      this proposal are:

        1. To identify brain regions that respond to aversive stimuli.

        2. To identify brain regions primarily responsible for the expression of cognitive and
           autonomic responses versus those involved in stimulus processing and memory encoding.

        3. To relate patterns of activity within selected brain areas to implicit versus explicit
           memory performance.

        4. To compare the parallel development of implicit and explicit knowledge about stimulus
           relationships during Pavlovian delay and trace fear conditioning.

        5. To test specific predictions regarding the nature of learning-related activity in the
           amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortex as they develop during
           conditioning and to integrate these findings into a more general theoretical
           understanding of memory phenomena in humans.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Normal right-handed volunteers with at least a high school education, age 20 to 40 years,
        will be recruited to participate in this study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will be excluded if they have evidence of or a history of learning disability,
        psychiatric condition, head trauma, seizures or other neurological condition, alcoholism or
        substance abuse, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease. We will also exclude subjects
        with vision and/or hearing problems severe enough to interfere with testing. Lab work will
        be limited to a urine pregnancy test for females. Females with a positive pregnancy test
        will be excluded from neuroimaging studies. All subjects will be questioned prior to MRI
        scanning for possible occupational exposure to metal slivers or shavings, which may have
        become accidentally lodged in the tissues of the head or neck. Those whose history is
        suggestive of such a problem will be excluded. Subjects with surgical clips or shrapnel in
        or near the brain or blood vessels, subjects with cochlear implants, subjects with any
        metallic body in the eye or CNS, and subjects with any form of implant wire or metal device
        which may concentrate radiofrequency fields will be excluded because of possible risks
        during MRI scanning.
