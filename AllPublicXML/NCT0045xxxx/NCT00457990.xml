    <textblock>
      Background: Iron deficiency in early childhood may impair neurodevelopment.

      Aim: To examine whether early iron supplementation improved neurodevelopment in preterm
      infants.

      Method: Children who participated in a clinical trial of iron supplementation were invited
      for a neurodevelopmental follow-up examination at the time of school entry.

    <textblock>
      Children with a birth weight of &lt; 1301g who participated in a randomized controlled trial of
      early versus late enteral iron supplementation were evaluated applying a standardized
      neurological evaluation, the Kaufmann Assessment Battery for Children, and the Gross Motor
      Function Classification Scale (GMFCS) at the age of school entry.

      Severe disability was defined as any of the following: any abnormal neurological examination
      associated with a severely impaired mobility (GMFCS&gt;1), severe cognitive impairment (mental
      processing composite (MPC) &lt;51), hearing loss requiring amplification, or blindness. The
      absence of disability was defined as normal neurological examination, normal mobility
      (GMFCS=0), and normal cognitive development (MPC&gt;85) and the absence of any severe hearing
      and visual impairment.
