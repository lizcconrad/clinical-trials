  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capecitabine is an orally administered fluoropyrimidine that is converted by 5-FU by
      thymidine phosphorylase (TP), preferentially in tumor tissues and has demonstrated activity
      as single agent in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Up-regulation of TP after taxane
      treatment in vitro suggested that there may be synergistic effects in combined treatment with
      taxane and capecitabine. The combination of taxane and capecitabine was reported to be highly
      active against non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and stomach cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed esophageal cancer with histology of squamous
             carcinoma or adenocarcinoma

          2. Clinically diagnosed metastatic or recurrent esophageal cancer according to Sixth
             Edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (Appendix V)

          3. At least 18 years old

          4. Disease status must be that of measurable disease defined as RECIST:Lesions that can
             be accurately measured in at least one dimension &gt; 10 mm with chest x-ray, spiral CT
             scan or physical examination

          5. ECOG performance status 0-2

          6. No prior radiotherapy to measurable lesion(s) but previous surgery and/or chest
             radiotherapy for the primary lesion is allowed

          7. Adequate major organ function including the following:Hematologic function: WBC ≥
