      This study will evaluate the effects of a drug called betahistine on appetite and food intake
      in overweight women. Betahistine has been used for many years to treat vertigo (dizziness).
      It was taken off the market in the United States in 1970 because it was thought to be
      ineffective for vertigo, but is still used for this purpose in many other countries. Some
      research suggests that betahistine may reduce appetite and food intake.

      Healthy overweight women between 18 and 50 years of age may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates must have a body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 40 and weigh less than 300
      pounds. They are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine
      tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), breathing test and eating behavior questionnaires.

      Participants are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for a 3-day/2-night stay for the
      following procedures:

        -  Medication: Subjects take either betahistine (in one of three possible doses) or placebo
           capsules one time on the days of admission to the Clinical Center (day 1), three times
           on day 2 and two times on day 3.

        -  Blood tests and 24-hour urine collection.

        -  Resting metabolic rate: Subjects rest quietly for 1 hour after awakening and then rest
           again under a clear plastic hood or while wearing a face mask, breathing normally for
           about 25 minutes.

        -  DEXA scan to measure body fat, muscle, and bone mineral content: Subjects lie on a table
           above a source of X-rays while a very small dose of X-rays is passed through the body.

        -  Meal studies: Subjects food intake is measured on days 2 and 3.

        -  Questionnaires: Subjects complete questionnaires about how hungry or full they are
           feeling and rate how much they liked the foods they ate.

      Current medications for the long-term treatment of obesity are moderately effective at best.
      Therefore, research focusing on compounds that affect energy balance through novel mechanisms
      is warranted. Preliminary human and animal data suggest central nervous system histaminergic
      tone is important in the regulation of food intake. We therefore propose to study the effects
      of betahistine hydrochloride, a histamine analogue which has agonist activity at the
      histaminergic H1 receptor and antagonist/reverse agonist activity at the H3 receptor. Prior
      animal studies have suggested that betahistine suppresses food intake and reduces body
      weight, but there are sparse human data assessing the effects of betahistine on metabolism.

      Betahistine s effects on women s food intake and metabolism will be evaluated through an
      inpatient randomized double-blind placebo controlled dose-ranging study. We will examine the
      acute effects of betahistine on food intake, hunger, and satiety, resting energy expenditure,
      and on hormones and substrates relevant for body weight regulation. If results suggest
      betahistine has salutary effects on food intake or metabolism in humans, these studies will
      lay the groundwork for additional investigations to assess the efficacy of betahistine in the
      treatment of obesity.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Volunteers will qualify if they meet the following criteria:

          1. Good general health. In general, subjects will be required to take no medications.
             However, individuals taking medications for obesity-related co-morbid conditions, who
             have not had changes in dosage for more than 6 months, may be included, at the
             discretion of the principal investigator.

          2. Age 18-50 years.

          3. Female sex. In this pilot study, we seek to decrease the variability of subject
             response to the greatest extent possible. Since women have a higher prevalence of
             obesity than men, and tend to be the group that most uses weight loss pharmacotherapy,
             we will only study women in the pilot investigation. Subsequent studies with include
             both sexes.

          4. Regular menses (either spontaneous or as a result of oral contraceptive pills) or
             post-menopausal status (no menses for at least 3 months).

          5. Obesity, defined as body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 40 kg/m(2) but weight under
             300 lbs, in order for subject to be able to undergo DEXA scanning with the Hologic
             instrument available in the Nuclear Medicine Department.

          6. A negative pregnancy test at the initial evaluation. Sexually active women must be
             using an effective form of birth control. These methods include abstinence, oral
             contraceptives, an intrauterine device (IUD), levonogestrol implants (Norplant), or
             medroxyprogesterone acetate injections (Depo-provera shots). (One of these methods
             must have been used by the subject for at least two months prior to the start of the
             study). If one of these cannot be used, contraceptive foam with a condom is
             recommended.

          7. Willingness to participate in the research protocol.

             EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

             Volunteers will be excluded (and referred to non-experimental treatment programs as
             needed) for the following reasons:

               1. A presence of major illnesses: renal, hepatic (other than obesity-related
                  steatosis), gastrointestinal, most endocrinologic (e.g., Cushing syndrome, hyper-
                  or hypothyroidism, pheochromocytoma), hematological problems or pulmonary
                  disorders; or porphyria;

               2. History of anaphylaxis, asthma, urticaria, rhinitis, allergic rash, or other
                  allergic disease requiring antihistamine treatment; subjects with a history of
                  antihistamine treatment for a self-limited allergic reaction such as to poison
                  ivy or to a medication that they are no longer taking may be included at the
                  discretion of the primary investigator.

               3. History of peptic ulcer disease;

               4. Baseline QT interval prolongation (greater than or equal to 480 msec QTc) because
                  of reports of histaminergic compounds causing prolonged QT interval and cardiac
                  arrhythmias in susceptible patients (i.e. those with prolonged QT interval at
                  baseline);

               5. Current smokers of tobacco products;

               6. Self-reported lactose intolerance;

               7. Self-reported food allergy to foods used in standardized food array in this
                  protocol or to betahistine itself;

               8. Subjects following a diet with specific food requirements such as vegetarian,
                  vegan, or kosher because of the use of a standardized food array in this
                  protocol;

               9. Subjects with a history of DSMIV classifiable eating disorders such as anorexia
                  nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge-eating disorder will be excluded from the
                  current proof-of-concept study;

              10. Women with reproductive potential who are pregnant or who are currently nursing
                  an infant;

              11. Individuals who have current substance abuse or a psychiatric disorder or other
                  condition that in the opinion of the investigators would impede competence or
                  compliance or possibly hinder completion of the study;

              12. Subjects who regularly use prescription medications unrelated to the
                  complications of obesity (especially vasoactive compounds such as calcium channel
                  blockers, nitrates, beta-blockers, etc.), subjects using H2 blockers for
                  dyspepsia, and subjects who require chronic use of antihistamines for allergic
                  conditions; oral contraceptive use will be permitted, provided the contraceptive
                  has been used for at least two months before starting study medication. The use
                  of over-the-counter and prescription medications will be reviewed on a
                  case-by-case basis; depending on the medication, subjects who have continued to
                  take prescription medication for at least 3 months prior to study entry may be
                  eligible. Allowable medications may include statins for the treatment of
                  dyslipidemia and low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of acute coronary
                  syndrome. Medications used for the treatment of hypertension will not be allowed
                  because of the potential vasodilatory activity of betahistine.

              13. Recent (3 months) use of anorexiant medications;

              14. Weight change of more than 3% of body weight in the past two months;

              15. Subjects with a consistently (2 weeks apart) elevated systolic blood pressure of
                  greater than 160 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg.
