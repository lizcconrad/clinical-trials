      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill tumor cells.
      Docetaxel may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving docetaxel together
      with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of docetaxel when
      given together with radiation therapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with
      stage II, stage III, or stage IV cervical cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose (RPTD) of docetaxel when administered with
           radiotherapy in patients with stage IIB-IVA cervical cancer. (Phase I)

        -  Assess the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety, feasibility, and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
           (Phase I)

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen at the RPTD in these patients. (Phase II)

        -  Determine the response in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, nonrandomized, prospective, dose-escalation study of docetaxel
      followed by an open-label phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
           weekly for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity. Patients also undergo concurrent pelvic external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) once
           daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Beginning 1-2 weeks after completion of EBRT, patients
           receive one or two applications of intracavitary low-dose-rate brachytherapy (LDR BT)
           comprising cesium-137.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The recommended phase II dose (RPTD) is the
      dose below the MTD.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive docetaxel at the RPTD, EBRT, and LDR BT as in phase I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for this study.
