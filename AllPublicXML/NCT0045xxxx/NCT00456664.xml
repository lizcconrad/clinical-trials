      Various diagnostic methods are available for CMV infection. But none of them could be a
      standard and highly valuable. Our first goal is to setup a series of molecular diagnostic
      tools for HIV-1 infected person. By using these tools, physicians can easily select cases
      with CMV disease or immune restoration inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) to enroll this study.
      Furthermore, we will seek for a predict marker for CMV reactivation, CMV disease and IRIS.
      Finally, our research will focus on the mechanism of the IE gene alternative splicing between
      lytic and latent stage.

      At present, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) remains a major health threat in immune compromised
      patients. Especially HCMV will cause blind and death in HIV-1 infected person. Currently, few
      antiviral drugs can be chosen for treatment of HCMV infection. Besides, more and more drug
      resistant virus strains were reported and led failure in antiviral therapy.

      Various diagnostic methods are available for CMV infection. Such as shell vial assay, CMV
      antigen test, pp65 antigen assay and polymerase chain reaction. But none of them could be a
      standard and highly valuable. Although CMV-PCR is very sensitive, it can't distinguish
      between active disease and asymptomatic infection or latency, can't predict symptomatic
      disease nor can't monitor the successful antiviral therapy.

      Our first goal is to setup a series of molecular diagnostic tools for HIV-1 infected person.
      By using these tools, physicians can easily select cases with CMV disease or immune
      restoration inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) to enroll this study. Furthermore, we will seek for
      a predict marker for CMV reactivation, CMV disease and IRIS. Finally, our research will focus
      on the mechanism of the IE gene alternative splicing between lytic and latent stage. We may
      find out new therapeutic concept and prevent virus reactivation from latency.
