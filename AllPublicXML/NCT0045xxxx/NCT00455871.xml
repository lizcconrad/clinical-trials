      The purpose of this study is to determine the benefits, if any, of combination therapy with
      Lucentis plus reduced fluence photodynamic therapy with Visudyne.

      The study will have two treatment groups. Each group will receive intravitreal injections
      (injection of medication in the jelly-like part of the back of the eye). One group (Group1)
      of approximately 15 patients will receive 0.5 mg of Lucentis™ followed by reduced fluence
      Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) with Visudyne ® 1-2 weeks later. The other group (Group 2) of
      approximately 15 patients will receive 0.5 mg of Lucentis™ followed by Photodynamic Therapy
      with Visudyne on the same day. patients will be assigned at random to receive one of the two
      treatments arms in the study. The dose received at the first injection will be the same dose
      received throughout the study.
