  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare subject satisfaction of once a week dosing of 35 mg
      Actonel to once daily dosing of 5 mg Actonel in postmenopausal osteoporotic women.

      The secondary objectives are to measure compliance (50 % drug taken), and persistence, [and
      urinary NTx (N-telopeptides) (optional)].

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Five years or greater postmenopausal who present with a diagnosis of postmenopausal
             osteoporosis based on standard clinical practice criteria.

          -  Subjects must discontinue bisphosphonates, calcitonin, fluoride, glucocorticoids (â‰¥ 5
             mg prednisone or equivalent per day) and hormone replacement therapy including
             estrogen-related compounds at least 6 months prior to randomization. During the study,
             these drugs are not permitted other than the study medication, Actonel.

          -  Other concomitant medications should be kept to a minimum, but if the drugs are
             considered necessary for the subject's welfare and are unlikely to interfere with
             study medication, they may be given at the discretion of the Investigator.

        Exclusion criteria :

          -  Had a history of cancer within the past 5 years. Relatively benign skin malignancies,
             such as basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, are not an exclusion criteria
             if the subject has been in remission for at least 6 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Diagnosis of hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and hyperthyroidism.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
