  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of 2 different doses
      of modified-release recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone (MRrhTSH) when administered
      with radioiodine in patients with multinodular goiter, a condition that involves the
      enlargement of the thyroid gland. We will also evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      radioiodine therapy alone in these patients. The goal of the treatment is to determine if
      there was a reduction in the size of the goiter and to study if goiter symptoms have improved
      after 6 months and after 36 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of multinodular goiter, judged clinically and by ultrasound at
             Screening to be at least 40 mL, but less than or equal to 140 mL in size.

          -  Clinically free of thyroid cancer as determined by Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) of all
             dominant and/or highly suspicious cold nodules in the goiter and cytology reports as
             negative for thyroid cancer. (Note: Results of FNA and cytology reports that were
             performed within 18 months prior to commencing Screening procedures and meet these
             criteria are acceptable for inclusion).

          -  Principal Investigator must believe that there is a minimal risk of coexistent thyroid
             cancer.

          -  Principal Investigator feels that the patient's iodine intake and/or levels will not
             significantly impact the results of the study (urinary iodine assay at Screening and
             low-iodine diet are optional and associated data will not be collected for study
             purposes).

          -  Baseline serum level of free thyroxine index (FTI) within the normal range, as
             determined by central lab.

          -  Baseline serum level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) ranges from undetectable to
             the upper limit of the normal range, as determined by central lab.

          -  Females of child-bearing potential must be on a stable hormonal contraceptive regimen
             (i.e., &gt; 6 months continuous use) and/or use a double barrier method (i.e., condom and
             foam) through Visit 8 (i.e. the end of the Core Study).

          -  Through Visit 8 (6 months) of a male patient's participation in the study, it is
             recommended that his sexual partner(s), who are females of child-bearing potential,
             use the above described methods of contraception.

          -  Negative pregnancy tests for all women of child-bearing potential prior to
             participating in the study. Women aged 50 years and above and considered
             postmenopausal (defined as &gt; 2 years since last menstrual period) will not need to
             have a pregnancy test.

          -  Routine blood laboratory values within normal range at Screening, as determined by
             central lab. Abnormal values considered to be not clinically significant by the
             Principal Investigator are acceptable for inclusion.

          -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) (12 lead, 2 minute rhythm strip) within normal limits at
             Screening as determined by a designated study cardiologist or appropriately qualified
             physician at each site. Evidence of an old myocardial infarction (MI) will exclude the
             patient. Patients who have ECG findings of occasional premature atrial beats, abnormal
             PR intervals not associated with supra ventricular tachycardia (SVT) or heart block,
             right bundle branch block, and heart rates ≤ 100 beats per minute (BPM) and ≥ 50 BPM
             may be included in this study.

          -  Committed to follow all protocol-required study procedures as evidenced by providing
             written informed consent within 21 days prior to Screening Period 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of thyroid cancer.

          -  Previous partial or near total thyroidectomy.

          -  Clinical history, signs or symptoms that make thyroid cancer a higher than usual
             probability, such as positive immediate family history of thyroid cancer, history of
             head or neck irradiation, a stone-hard nodule or suspicious growth of a nodule in
             recent months, palpable cervical lymph nodes or nodes that on ultrasound have features
             suspicious for metastases (unless ruled out by biopsy or FNA).

          -  During the 45 days before administration of MRrhTSH or placebo (i.e., Screening
             Periods 1 and 2), use of propylthiouracil, methimazole or thyroxine, vitamins or
             supplements containing kelp or iodine (taking a multivitamin that does not contain
             iodine or kelp is acceptable), medications that significantly affect iodine handling
             such as high dose corticosteroids, high dose diuretics, or lithium (low or moderate
             dose diuretic use is acceptable).

          -  Patient has currently or within the past 60 days used retinoic acid.

          -  Serum calcitonin above the upper limit of normal at Screening, as determined by

             significant arrhythmia within 6 months (patient may have mild hypertension or chronic
             cardiac illnesses that are well controlled on a medication regimen: blood pressure
             (BP) less than 140/90 mmHg after resting 5 minutes).

          -  A concurrent major medical disorder (e.g., documented significant cardiac disease,
             debilitating cardiopulmonary disease, advanced renal failure, advanced liver disease,
             advanced pulmonary disease, or advanced cerebral vascular disorder) that may have an
             impact on the capability of the patient to adequately comply with the requirements of
             this study.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.

             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive or hepatitis B antigen positive (no
             screening for HIV or hepatitis B should be done in the study).

          -  Hyperthyroid symptom scale (HSS) ≥ 20.

          -  Patients who have received 131I in the past, and have had a lifetime exposure believed
