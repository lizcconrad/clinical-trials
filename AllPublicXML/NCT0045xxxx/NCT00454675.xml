  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether an average population of males and females who smoke 10 pack years or
      more of cigarettes in a primary care setting with chronic bronchitis has already developed
      significant changes on pulmonary function testing.

      The incident of COPD is dramatically increasing while other chronic disease states are
      decreasing in the US population. Smoking cigarettes is the leading risk factor for COPD.
      Smokers with chronic bronchitis may show early or late changes of COPD on pulmonary function
      tests. It is imperative that we define this patient population to determine whether early
      intervention will alter pulmonary function over the years.
