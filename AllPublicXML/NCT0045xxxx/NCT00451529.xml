  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a moderate to severe carotid atherosclerotic plaque are at risk for stroke and
      this risk increases with increasing degree of stenosis. It has been shown that carotid
      endarterectomy in symptomatic patients with a carotid artery stenosis of 70-99% is highly
      beneficial. However, the beneficial effect of surgery in patients with symptomatic 30-69%
      stenosis is not clear yet.A clear beneficial effect of surgery in the 30-69% stenosis group
      might be found in a sub-group of patients whom are at greater risk for stroke. Definition of
      this sub-group might be achieved by plaque characterization, since rupture of a vulnerable
      plaque is the main cause of stroke due to carotid artery stenosis.This study will include
      patients with a 30-69% carotid artery stenosis, and assess plaque composition by MRI, the
      degree of plaque inflammation by FDG-PET, and the amount of microembolization by transcranial
      Doppler ultrasound. The main purpose of this study is to assess whether one or a combination
      of each of these imaging methods can predict the occurrence of a (recurrent) ischemic stroke.

        Patients with a history of transient ischemic attack or minor stroke within three months of
        enrollment and an ipsilateral 30-69% carotid stenosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with neurological symptoms due to ischemia in the carotid artery territory
             and with a carotid stenosis between 30% and 69% as detected by ultrasound examination

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a probable cardiac source of embolism (rhythm disorders, mitral valve
             stenosis, prolapse or calcification, mechanical cardiac valves, recent myocardial
             infarction, left ventricular thrombus, atrial myxoma, endocarditis, dilated
             cardiomyopathy, patent foramen ovale) or a clotting disorder.

          -  Patients with evident other cause of neurological symptoms than carotid stenosis due
             to atherosclerotic disease (like demyelinating diseases, epilepsy, congenital brain
             disorders, aneurysms, fibromuscular dysplasia, etc.).

          -  Patients already scheduled for carotid endarterectomy or stenting

          -  Severe co-morbidity, dementia, or pregnancy.

          -  Standard contra-indications for MRI (ferromagnetic implants like pacemakers or other
             electronic implants, metallic eye fragments, vascular clips, claustrophobia,
             documented allergy to contrast media, renal insufficiency, etc).

          -  Patients who were referred from another hospital to one of the three participating
             hospitals (to avoid referral bias).

          -  Patients who had a TIA or minor stroke more than 3 weeks before inclusion

          -  Patients who had a prior TIA or stroke
