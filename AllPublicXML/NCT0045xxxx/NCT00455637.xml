          -  Diagnosis of cerebral palsy.

          -  Presence of clinical bilateral hip pain (of at least 6 months duration) due to
             cerebral palsy as defined by the child/young person and/or parents.

          -  Paediatric Pain Profile score of 25 or greater.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with Botulinum toxin (any serotype, administered anywhere in the body)
