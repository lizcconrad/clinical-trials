  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive weight gain during pregnancy is associated with complications during delivery
      primarily due to macrosomia (large babies) but also with high levels of weight retention post
      pregnancy and thereby increased risk of future weight related health problems. The primary
      aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention consisting of; recurrent
      Motivational Interviewing (MI), prescription of physical activity and extended information on
      recommended weight gain during pregnancy in regards to preventing excessive gestational
      weight gain.
