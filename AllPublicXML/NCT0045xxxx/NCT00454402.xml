      The aim of the study is to assess the effect of Alfuzosin compared with placebo, for 7 days,
      on the outcome of patients with uretheric stones submitted to Extracorporeal Shock Wave
      Lithotripsy (ESWL), namely in the percentage of patients without imagiologic evidence of any
      stone after 72h to 96 hours.

      This study will also specifically focus on the evaluation of time of stone clearance and of
      pain reduction (Numeric Rating Scale).
