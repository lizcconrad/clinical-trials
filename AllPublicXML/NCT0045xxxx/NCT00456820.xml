    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out differences in activation of mood regulating areas
      of the brain in response to negative and positive pictures, before and after 6 weeks of
      additional Wellbutrin XL treatment. Participants should have been treated for depression with
      an SSRI medication (e.g., Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa or Lexapro) and have decreased
      depression symptoms but also be experiencing side effects of medications such as sexual side
      effects and feelings of apathy (indifference, lack of interest) and lack of full emotional
      response. We will first take a brain scan to measure activity in different parts of the
      brain, while subjects are seeing pictures, using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. Then
      we will add Wellbutrin XL - another well-known antidepressant that acts by increasing the
      chemical dopamine in the brain, to subjects' treatment. Wellbutrin addition is useful in
      decreasing the sexual side effects of SSRIs. After treatment with Wellbutrin XL for 6 weeks
      subjects will have a second MRI scan with picture rating.

      Hypotheses:

      Hypothesis 1.After wellbutrin XL addition for 6 weeks, SSRI treated subjects will show
      increased activation and connectivity of prefrontal cortex and limbic regions such as the
      amygdala on exposure to negative and positive pictures

      Hypothesis 2.Increase in activation of the MRC (Mood Regulating Circuit) will correlate with
      decrease in Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) score and Sexual Dysfunction Score.

      We plan to study a maximum of 15 subjects in this study. SSRI treated depressed patients who
      after treatment of depression continue to suffer from sexual dysfunction and apathy will be
      included in the study. fMRI will be conducted at baseline and after addition of Wellbutrin XL
      treatment 300 mg po qd and then used at a dose of 300 mg - 450 mg from week 3 - 6 depending
      on response and tolerance. Patients will also be rated weekly on 17-item Hamilton Depression
      Rating Scale, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRAS) (Montgomery and Asberg
      1979), AES (Marin et al 1991), Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ) and
      Clinical Global Impression (Improvement) weekly for 6 weeks. Depressed patients will also be
      rated on the scan days on cognitive measures such as verbal memory and working memory.
