  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic and molecular basis of lipodystrophy syndrome in HIV-infected patients is not
      known. Whether besides protease inhibitors, other antiretroviral drugs, HIV infection and
      reduction in viral load contribute to the development of lipodystrophy syndrome is not clear.

      The project therefore has the following aims: 1) to characterize metabolic abnormalities and
      changes in body fat distribution, 2) to develop objective criteria for defining the syndrome
      and to ascertain prognostic indicators and 3) to elucidate the molecular basis of the
      lipodystrophy syndrome in HIV-infected patients.

      A 2-year long prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study in 200
      asymptomatic HIV (+) patients to compare two equally effective antiretroviral regimens, one
      with and the other without a protease inhibiotor. We will study body fat distribution by
      anthropometry and magnetic resonance imaging and will measure insulin sensitivity (in a
      subset of patients), plasma lipoproteins, glucose tolerance and other metabolic variables. We
      will study expression of an array of adipocyte specific proteins/transcription factors
      involved in adipocyte differentiation, insulin action and lipoprotein metabolism in fat
      biopsy samples obtained before and after institution of therapy.
