  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Certain percentage of MDS patients develop iron overload. Iron is known to participate in
      intracellular reactions that generate free radicals, inducing oxidative stress and apoptosis,
      which was found to be increased in MDS patients and consequently resulted in ineffective
      hematopoiesis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the antioxidant effect of the oral iron
      chelator Deferasirox -Exjade in low risk MDS patients with iron over load by evaluating
      changes in several oxidative stress parameters Certain percentage of MDS patients develop
      iron overload.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome with an IPSS score being Intermediate-1 or low.

          -  Patients who already received ≥20 unit (100 mL/kg) of packed red blood cells and
             showing evidence of iron overload (serum ferritin &gt;1000 µg/L).

          -  Patients post stem cells transplantation with disease recurrence with MDS IPSS score
             low or intermediate 1.

          -  Patients who have given consent personally in writing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome with an IPSS score being Intermediate-2 or

             treatment

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding. Female of child-bearing potential should conduct
             contraception during the clinical trial.

          -  Patients treated with systemic investigational drug within the past 4 weeks or topical
             investigational drug within the past 7 days

          -  Other surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of study drug

             cooperative with regard to the study protocol

          -  History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drug or excipients
