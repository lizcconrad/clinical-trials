  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess the feasibility of evaluating YSPSL for the amelioration of
      ischemia reperfusion injury following liver transplantation by administering YSPSL into the
      liver graft directly ex vivo via the portal vein and to the recipient intravenously prior to
      reperfusion. Recently, P-selectin expression has been associated in liver grafts with
      prolonged cold storage times and rejection. By examining biomarkers of IRI including
      P-selectin by immunohistochemistry and/or quantitative PCR, liver histology and hepatic blood
      flow using established techniques, the goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of
      using these modalities for future studies of safety and efficacy.

      This will be a single-center, single-dose study. The study will be a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose study. Patients who are undergoing cadaveric
      orthotopic liver transplantation and are at risk for development of DGF, based upon known
      risk factors, will be eligible to participate in the study. 12 patients will be enrolled in
      the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient will be a recipient of a primary (first) ABO compatible cadaveric liver
             allograft;

          2. Patient's age is &gt;=18 years;

          3. Patient is not a recipient of a multivisceral transplant or simultaneous kidney
             transplant;

          4. Patient has not undergone prior organ or cellular transplant of any type;

          5. Patient has a Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of &lt;28;

          6. Cold ischemia time (CIT) anticipated to be less than 12 hours;

          7. Donor liver procured by UCLA liver team;

          8. Veno-veno bypass is not planned to be used for the patient (e.g. no prior surgery or
             other factor that indicates a risk for excessive blood loss and therefore a need for
             veno-veno bypass +/- autologous recovery during surgery);

          9. For patients who are women of childbearing potential, patient has a negative pregnancy
             test (either urine or serum) within 48 hours prior to transplant;

         10. Patient (male and female) is willing to use an acceptable form of birth control for at
             least 3 months post-treatment; and

         11. Patient is willing and able to sign informed consent.

          1. Patient has a prior organ transplant of any type;

          2. Patient has known allergic or intolerance reactions to human immune globulins,
             antibodies, or components of the formulation or known contraindication to
             administration of YSPSL;

             procedure;

          7. Patient has current drug or alcohol abuse or, in the opinion of the investigator, is
             at risk for poor compliance with the visits in this protocol (no drug testing
             required);

          8. Patient is a pregnant or nursing female, a female of childbearing potential planning
             to become pregnant within the duration of this study, or is not practicing birth
             control;

          9. Patient is planned to receive a living donor liver transplant;

         10. Patient lives &gt;200 miles away or otherwise is not able to participate in study
             follow-up visits;

         11. Donor body mass index &gt;28;
