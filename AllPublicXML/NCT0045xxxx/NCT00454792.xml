      The purpose of this study is to compare patients with low back pain (LBP) and Modic Changes
      from The Backcenter Funen, Ringe:

        1. To compare the effect of two types of non-operative treatments:

           A. exercise and advice to be physically active

           B. restitution and advice not to overload the spine

        2. To investigate if the results of the treatment are influenced by gender, age, smoking,
           and physical load.

      The clinical experience is that many patients with Modic changes have relatively severe and
      persistent LBP, which typically appears to be resistant to treatment. Furthermore, a
      retrospective study at The Backcenter Funen, Ringe, shows that patients with MC fail to
      improve engaging physical activity. This is unfortunate, because the typical rehabilitation
      for patients with persistent LBP is back exercises and information about keeping physically
      active. This means that this relatively large subgroup of patients with Modic changes
      probably does not improve with the rehabilitation tools used today.

      A randomised controlled trial has therefore been designed to study the specific subgroup of
      patients with Modic changes. In this study we will compare the present &quot;state-of-the art&quot;
      rehabilitation approach to persistent LBP (namely to exercise and keep active) with a new
      concept (restitution). The justification for this is that restitution reduces mechanical
      stress on the vertebrae and therefore would allow heeling of the possible micro fractures in
      Modic changes.
