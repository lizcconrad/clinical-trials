      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of treatment with a steroid and
      antibiotic on the size of the tonsils and symptoms of children with OSAS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will enroll children between 18 months and 12 years of age with mild sleep apnea and treat
      them with 5 days of prednisolone and 10 days of amoxicillin/clavulanate. We will obtain a
      questionnaire pre and post treatment and ask the parents to tell us if they think the child
      has improved enough after treatment to forego surgery. If not, they will undergo an
      adenotonsillectomy to relieve their sleep apnea and if yes, we will repeat the sleep study to
      make sure that the apnea has resolved.
