  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rational for this trial is given by the knowledge that gemcitabine acts as a potent
      inhibitor of DNA repair and therefore may prevent adequate repair of platin-induced DNA
      damage. Gemcitabine is an excellent choice for combination therapy by its unique mechanism of
      action and favourable toxicity profile. The combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin was
      shown to be effective in several trials, producing response rates of 30-52 % in patients with
      pretreated metastatic breast cancer. To improve on tolerability and handling of the regime
      carboplatin may be the more appropriate choice for treatment. The mechanism of action of
      carboplatin is very similar to that of cisplatin. The rational for combining gemcitabine and
      carboplatin is based on their single-agent activities in metastatic breast cancer, the
      activity of this combination in other malignancies and on the fact that carboplatin has
      demonstrated efficacy comparable with cisplatin in several tumor types.
