  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether conversion from cyclosporine, a calcineurin inhibitor (CI)
      to sirolimus (SRL) results in improved long-term renal function without a negative impact on
      safety or immunosuppressive efficacy, and to further examine the potential of SRL to reduce
      the severity and/or progression of chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized, parallel-group, comparative, outpatient study will be conducted
      in multiple centers in Taiwan.

      The study will randomize approximately 120 patients. 80 patients will be randomized to the
      SRL therapy group (conversion from CI- to SRL-based immunosuppression: group A) and 40
      patients to the CI therapy group (continued CI therapy: group B).

      Dosage and Administration

      SRL Therapy: At the time of randomization on day 1, each patient will have been receiving:

        -  triple therapy with a CI (tacrolimus or CsA) that began at the time of transplantation
           or within 2 weeks thereafter AND

        -  corticosteroids corresponding to a dosage range of 2.5 to 15 mg/day for prednisone or
           prednisolone (2 to 12 mg/day for methylprednisolone) or the alternate day equivalent for
           at least 12 weeks before randomization, PLUS

        -  either MMF (minimum dose 500 mg/day)/MPS (minimum dose 360 mg/day) or AZA (minimum dose
           50 mg/day) for at least 12 weeks before randomization.

      SRL will be added to the immunosuppressive regimen for Group A. Group B will continue on this
      CI immunosuppressive regimen.

        <title>Change in Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) Change From Baseline</title>
        <description>GFR is an index of kidney function. GFR describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. GFR can be measured directly or estimated using established formulas. GFR was calculated using Nankivell formula. A normal GFR is &gt; 90 mL/min, although children and older people usually have a lower GFR. Lower values indicate poor kidney function. A GFR &lt;15 is consistent with kidney failure.</description>

At the discretion of the investigator, patients will be permitted to: (a) change from MMF/MPS to AZA or vice versa, and from CsA to tacrolimus or vice versa; (b) continue MMF/MPS or AZA for the entire 104-week period of randomized therapy; or (c) discontinue MMF/MPS or AZA and subsequently restart either one after discontinuation. Whole blood CsA or tacrolimus trough concentrations will be monitored at designated intervals and the CI dose adjusted to maintain the following trough concentration ranges: CsA 50-250 ng/mL and Tacrolimus 4-10 ng/mL.</description>

Once SRL trough level was at target range, MMF dose reduced to a maximum of 1500 mg/day or MPS dose reduced to a maximum of 1080 mg/day and AZA dose reduced to a maximum of 75 mg/day. Corticosteroids were administered according to local practice, within a daily maintenance dosage range (2.5 to 15 mg for prednisone or prednisolone; 2 to 12 mg/day for methylprednisolone) or the alternate day equivalent.</description>
