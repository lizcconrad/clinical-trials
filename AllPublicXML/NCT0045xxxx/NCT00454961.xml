    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the effectiveness of artemether-lumefantrine
      (Coartem®) treatment provided by community health workers against uncomplicated malaria in
      children under 5 years of age in Kibaha District, Tanzania, during an extended follow-up of
      42 days. The hypothesis is that artemether-lumefantrine treatment provided by community
      health workers will result in less than 85% PCR-corrected parasitological effectiveness by
      day 42, mainly due to partial non-compliance to full standard 6-dose regimen of the drug.
