  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle intervention and certain medications have been shown to be effective for
      antipsychotic-induced weight gain, but no controlled studies have compared psychological and
      pharmacological therapies. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled study to test the
      efficacy of lifestyle intervention and metformin alone and in combination for
      antipsychotic-induced weight gain.

      The study was designed as a double-blind randomized controlled trial, with research assessors
      and patients intended to be blind to the intervention status. The staff members performing
      the assessment were not involved in implementing any aspect of the intervention.128 patients
      were randomized to one of four 12-week individual treatments: metformin (750mg/day), placebo,
      lifestyle intervention plus metformin (750mg/day) or lifestyle intervention plus placebo.
      Medications were provided in double-blind fashion.The assessments include body weight, body
      mass index, waist circumference, fasting glucose, fasting insulin and insulin resistance
      index.
