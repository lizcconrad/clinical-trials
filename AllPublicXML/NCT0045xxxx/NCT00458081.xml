      Primary objective:

        -  To assess the effect on microalbuminuria levels of treatment with rimonabant 20 mg
           versus a placebo during a 12 month period.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Percentage of patients in both arms of the study whose levels of microalbuminuria
           decrease, stabilise, increase towards macroalbuminuria or are unchanged after 12 months
           of treatment with rimonabant or placebo.

        -  To assess the effect of treatment with rimonabant 20 mg versus placebo over a 12 month
           period on:

             -  Weight and waist circumference.

             -  Glycaemia profile: fasting glycaemia, fasting insulinaemia and HbA1c.

             -  Lipid and lipoprotein profile: triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C,
                apolipoproteins A1 and B.

             -  Inflammatory markers

             -  Adipocytokines.

             -  Blood pressure.

             -  Glomerular filtration rate.

        -  To assess the quality of life by means of questionnaire filled in.

        -  Safety parameters
