      All subjects will be assigned into control and experimental groups by a random table. The
      first 40 numbers in the first row will be used for the study. Subjects assigned with an odd
      number will be divided into the control group.

      ROLE OF SUBJECTS Subjects in the experimental will receive Hans treatment for hypertension.
      No invasive procedures will be used for subjects in either the control and experimental
      groups.

      This randomized controlled study will recruit hypertensive subjects into control and
      experimental groups using a random table. Only the subjects in the experimental group use
      Hans stimulation as a treatment for high blood pressure. The treatment regiment is discussed
      in the Treatment section in detail. The subjects in the control group will not
