  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The middle ear implant are used for patients with mild to severe sensorineural hearing loss,
      who cannot benefit from conventional hearing aids because of medical reasons such as chronic
      external otitis or external skin irritation. The device is also available for patients who
      are dissatisfied with the conventional hearing aids because of poor sound quality, feedback
      or occlusion of the ear canal. To date, more than 1500 patients have been implanted in Europe
      and about more than 600 patients in France. The aim of the present study is to compare in a
      randomized study the performances of the system to those of the conventional hearing aid in
      patients with similar degree of hearing loss.

      Objective: The main objective of this study is to demonstrate that the middle ear implant
      increases the hearing in terms of speech intelligibility in quiet and noisy conditions, in
      patients who have no further benefit of their conventional hearing aid. The quality of life
      of these patients will be evaluated as well as the tolerance of the middle ear implant after
      6 months.

      Design of the study: 420 patients with mid or severe hearing loss will be included. They will
      have for 3 months the best conventional hearing aid adapted to their hearing loss. The first
      84 patients who will not have a benefit of this hearing aid, will be randomised in two
      groups. The patients of the first group will be operated as soon as possible, the surgery of
      the patients of the second group will be delayed by 6 months. The whole duration of the study
      is 48 months.

      Evaluation criteria: Audiological testing (pure-tone hearing thresholds, speech comprehension
      in quiet and noise), and subjective evaluation using self-assessment scales will be performed
      before and 6 months after the implantation in the two groups.
