  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of cholic acid therapy in treating lipodystrophy patients
      with hepatic steatosis. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over
      study.

    <textblock>
      Lipodystrophies are rare disorders characterized by selective loss of adipose tissue and
      predisposition to develop insulin resistance and its associated metabolic complications such
      as dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus and hepatic steatosis. Nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis or
      steatohepatitis caused by excessive accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes, in fact, is
      a common feature of these disorders. Often a cause for significant morbidity and even
      mortality in lipodystrophic patients, hepatic steatosis poses a significant therapeutic
      challenge. Recent insight into the role of primary bile acids, cholic acid and
      chenodeoxycholic acid, which are endogenous ligands for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), in
      regulating hepatic triglyceride homeostasis offers new treatment options for hepatic
      steatosis. Cholic acid was shown to inhibit hepatic triglyceride accumulation by more than
      50% in a mouse model of hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia. Cholic acid has been
      previously used to treat inborn errors of bile acid synthesis in children without any side
      effects. In other studies in adults, cholic acid has been reported to be well tolerated.
      Therefore, we propose to investigate a potentially safe therapeutic option for its efficacy
      in reducing hepatic steatosis in patients with lipodystrophies.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with lipodystrophies as diagnosed by clinical criteria.

          -  Hepatic steatosis (&gt;5.6% hepatic triglyceride content) as demonstrated by 1H magnetic
             resonance spectroscopy.

          -  Age 6-70 years.

          -  Alcohol intake of less than 40 g per week.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Laboratory or other histologic findings highly suggestive of liver disease due to
             causes other than non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, such as chronic viral hepatitis,
             autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, biliary obstruction or genetic liver
             diseases such as Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.

          -  Treatment with drugs associated with steatohepatitis, e.g., corticosteroids, high dose
             estrogens, methotrexate, amiodarone, , sulfasalazine, or oxacillin in the 6 months
             prior to the study.

          -  Decompensated liver disease as evidenced by clinical features of hepatic failure
             (variceal bleeding, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy etc.) and laboratory
             investigations (prolonged prothrombin time, hypoalbuminemia, presence of esophageal
             varices etc.)

          -  Evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma: alpha-fetoprotein levels greater than 200 ng/ml
             and/or liver mass on imaging study suggestive of liver cancer.

          -  Use of drugs which can potentially decrease hepatic steatosis during previous 3
             months; ursodeoxycholic acid, high-dose vitamin E, betaine, acetylcysteine and
             choline. Thiazolidinediones are allowed if dose has been stable for 3 months prior to
             screening.

          -  Significant systemic or major illnesses other than liver disease, such as congestive
             heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory failure, renal failure (serum
             creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL), acute pancreatitis, organ transplantation, serious psychiatric
             disease, and malignancy, that could interfere with the trial and adequate follow up.

          -  Known HIV-infected patient.

          -  Current substance abuse.
