      This study will use pre-treatment positron emission topography and functional magnetic
      resonance imaging scans of the brain to predict the most effective antidepressant treatment
      for people with major depressive disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by a combination of symptoms that can
      interfere with a person's ability to work, study, sleep, eat, and enjoy activities that were
      once pleasurable. Studies have shown that as little as 50% to 60% of individuals with MDD may
      respond to the first antidepressant medication prescribed. Currently psychiatrists lack tools
      that allow them to select the treatment plan that is most likely to benefit a particular
      individual. Some of the chemical abnormalities in the brains of people with MDD are
      detectable on positron emission topography (PET) scans. There are distinct differences in the
      PET scans of people with MDD who respond to treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitor (SSRI), people with MDD who do not respond to SSRI treatment, and people who do not
      have MDD. This study will use pretreatment PET and functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) scans of the brain to predict which antidepressants will be most effective in people
      with MDD. This may help to reduce the trial and error currently associated with
      antidepressant treatment.

      We will perform pretreatment PET scans to quantify serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and
      serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). All patients
      will then receive a standardized treatment protocol with a selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitor (SSRI), escitalopram. If the patient does not remit, he or she will receive a
      selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), desipramine. We hypothesize those patients
      with high pre and postsynaptic 5-HT1A BP and low 5-HTT BP in specific brain regions will not
      remit to a SSRI and will remit to a selective NRI. Finally, we will generate a predictive
      model of remission based on brain imaging outcome measures. Our overall goal is to reduce the
      trial and error associated with antidepressant treatment by using data from pre-treatment
      quantification of 5-HT1A receptors and 5-HTT to guide antidepressant treatment selection.

    <description>Remission in this study is defined as both a â‰¥50% decrease in the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) Score and a final 24-item HDRS score &lt;10. Remission of depressive symptoms was calculated for the 28 completers of the SSRI phase.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Remission of Depressive Symptoms - Tricyclic Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured over 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who did not achieve remission during the SSRI phase advanced to the tricyclic phase of the study. Participants were treated with either desipramine or nortriptyline. Seven participants started the tricyclic phase. Four completed the tricyclic phase. The completers (n=4) were analyzed for remission status.</description>

    <description>Mean % improvement from baseline to end of treatment trial using the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Percent improvement of depressive symptoms was calculated for the 28 completers of the SSRI phase. The higher the score on the 24-item HDRS, the greater the depression severity. Minimum score on the scale is 0, and maximum score is 74. Subscales are not used for this analysis.</description>

          <description>Participants will take escitalopram through standardized dosing over an 8 week trial. Non-remitters will be offered entry into a second open treatment phase with standardized treatment with desipramine.
In phase 1, participants will receive escitalopram beginning at 10mg daily for 4 weeks, increasing to 20mg if non-response at week 4 or 6. If participants experience intolerable side-effects, they will be switched to an alternative SSRI, sertraline. Non-remitters after 8 weeks may enter a second phase of standardized treatment, switching from escitalopram to desipramine, dosed by blood level according to a treatment protocol. Those with intolerable side-effects to desipramine will be switched to an alternative tricyclic antidepressant, nortriptyline.</description>

        <population>28 of 38 participants completed the SSRI phase. Only those 28 participants were assessed for remission status.
1 participant who is counted as a non-remitter had a spontaneous remission following his MRI.</population>

        <description>Mean % improvement from baseline to end of treatment trial using the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Percent improvement of depressive symptoms was calculated for the 28 completers of the SSRI phase. The higher the score on the 24-item HDRS, the greater the depression severity. Minimum score on the scale is 0, and maximum score is 74. Subscales are not used for this analysis.</description>
