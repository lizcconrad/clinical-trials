      The purpose of this study is to investigate the natural kinetics of D-dimers that occur after
      abdominal surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a potentially fatal disease with an estimated incidence of
      0.1%. One third of the VTE occur as pulmonal embolism with a mortality up to 25% (White RH.
      Circulation 107:2003)

      Serum d-dimer levels are used as sensitive marker for the diagnosis of VTE (Kelly J et al.
      Arch Intern Med, 162: 2002). Because of its sensitivity, the determination of serum D-dimer
      levels is an accepted method to exclude VTE in the outpatient setting meaning that VTE may be
      excluded in case of normal D-dimer levels (Kelly J. Lancet 359: 2002). The specificity of the
      D-dimer testing, however, is low. This is true especially in the postoperative phase. The
      interpretation of elevated D-dimer levels in surgical patients remains elusive.

      The natural kinetics of D-dimers after surgery is not known. The question to what extent
      D-dimer levels rise after surgery and how long it may take D-dimer levels to return to normal
      after surgery is not yet determined. This information is needed to be able to use D-dimer
      testing for VTE diagnosis in surgical patients.

      In this study, D-dimer levels are measured in surgical patients immediately before (day 0)
      and repeatedly after surgery. D-dimer level measurement will be stopped after D-dimer levels
      returned to normal.
