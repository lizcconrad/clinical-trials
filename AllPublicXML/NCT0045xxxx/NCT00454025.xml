  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated intraocular pressure is widely accepted as a risk factor for glaucoma and
      controlling the pressure remains the cornerstone of effective treatment. There is evidence
      that posture can have a significant effect on intraocular pressure fluctuations. Salat (or
      Salah) refers to the five daily prayers performed by Muslims. The time spent praying in a
      kneeling or prostrate position may be associated with wide fluctuations in intraocular
      pressure, potentially sight-threatening for Muslim patients with glaucoma. The researchers
      seek to investigate the link between traditional daily Muslim prayer postural changes and
      intraocular pressure changes.
