  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients taking regular medication for their pain often still have episodes of severe
      pain that 'break through' despite their background pain treatment. Fentanyl is a strong,
      short-acting pain killer often used to treat this 'breakthrough' pain. Nasalfent contains
      fentanyl in a patented drug delivery system called PecSys and is given via a simple nasal
      spray. This study will test the efficacy and safety of Nasalfent in the treatment of
      breakthrough cancer pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatments for breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP) work too slowly to meet the fast onset
      of most BTCP episodes, they continue to act longer than the episode of pain lasts and so can
      have unwanted side effects due to this 'over treatment' of the pain episode. In addition most
      cancer patients have oral problems which make taking pain relief medication by mouth
      uncomfortable for the patient. Nasalfent is administered via the nose as a simple spray and
      can be taken by patients or given by their carers. The nasal route is a common way to
      administer medication for example in the treatment of migraine or allergy. At any time during
      the study the patient may take their regular treatment for BTCP should they so wish.

      This study will compare the time of onset and degree of pain relief of Nasalfent to that of
      Placebo. The safety of the two treatments groups (Nasalfent, Placebo) will also be examined.
