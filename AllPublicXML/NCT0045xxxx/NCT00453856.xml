  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IPTi, a strategy whereby infants are provided treatment doses of antimalarials at routine
      vaccination visits, has been shown to significantly reduce malaria and anemia in two studies
      in Tanzania. However the results obtained in Gabon are not similar. Many factors are likely
      to influence the efficacy or effectiveness IPTi. It is reasonable to assume that the efficacy
      of IPTi will be influenced markedly by the sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to the
      antimalarial drug (Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine) used for IPTi.

      In order to interpret the results of individual IPTi trials conducted by the IPTi Consortium,
      and to provide information for policy makers regarding the predicted efficacy of IPTi, it is
      essential to obtain information on antimalarial drug sensitivity of Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine
      now that the IPTi trial has been conducted. The simplest and most universally accepted
      measure of testing for antimalarial drug efficacy is the &quot;in vivo efficacy study,&quot; which
      follows a standardized World Health Organization protocol.

      A second reason for evaluating drug resistance as an adjunct to the IPTi trials is to
      determine if the intervention increases the carriage and/or spread of drug resistant P.
      falciparum parasites.

      Thirdly the overall effect at the community level of selection of resistant genotypes in
      IPTi-recipients is unclear.

      Administration of standard single oral dose of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to children aged
      6-59 month old children in Lambaréné at enrolment, if eligible according to the approved
      protocol.

      139 subjects will be enrolled and treated with Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine for uncomplicated
      malaria. Thereafter each subject will be followed according to the approved protocol

      The proportion of subjects with Adequate Clinical and Parasitological response (ACPR) by day
      28, Early Treatment Failure (ETF), Late Clinical Failure (LCF) and Late Parasitological
      Failure (LPF)will be evaluated.

      secondly the frequency of molecular markers for Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine drug resistance
      will be determined.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated because of Early Treatment Failure in child.The justification for this
    decision are concerns about safety of children.
