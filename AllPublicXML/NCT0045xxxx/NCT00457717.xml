      This study was designed to compare the difference of using atropine eyedrops alone from
      atropine combined with the stimulation of auricular acupoints therapy in reducing myopia
      progression.

    <textblock>
      A total of 64 school-aged children with myopia, fulfilling eligibility criteria, were
      recruited. They were randomly assigned to three arms:

        1. 21 treated with the 0.25 % atropine each night (0.25A).

        2. 20 treated with the 0.5 % atropine each night (0.5A).

        3. 23 treated with 0.25 % atropine each night together with stimulation of auricular
           acupoints(0.25A+E).

      This protocol was proceeded for at least 6 months.The differences in post-treatment effects
      of these three groups were statistically accessed.
