  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a single agent, paclitaxel has a response rate of 33% and 25-29% in SCLC patients with
      sensitive relapse and with resistant relapse, respectively. As a single agent, gemcitabine
      also has a response rate 16% and 6-13% in SCLC patients with sensitive relapse and with
      resistant relapse, respectively. Because of single-agent activity, different mechanism of
      action, non-overlapping toxicities, and beneficial pharmacologic interaction, paclitaxel and
      gemcitabine combinations are attractive for testing in clinical trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment consists of paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 given intravenously
      on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.

      Patients receive treatment every 3 weeks till disease progression
