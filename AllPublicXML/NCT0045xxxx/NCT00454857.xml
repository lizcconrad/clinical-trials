  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center prospective observational descriptive study complemented by a
      retrospective chart review. Patients diagnosed with ITP and currently treated for ITP by a
      hematologist or hematologist-oncologist will be recruited from community-based clinics and
      academic/referral centers. They will be followed prospectively for a period of 12 months. At
      inception, participants' charts will also be reviewed from the date of enrollment
      retrospectively to the date of diagnosis or the previous 36 months, whichever is less.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 12 in Quality of Life Measured by the ITP-Patient Assessment Questionnaire (PAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to month 12 during prospective data collection phase</time_frame>
    <description>The Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura Patient Assessment Questionnaire (ITP-PAQ) was developed to assess disease-specific quality of life (QoL) in adults with ITP. It is a 44-item questionnaire that includes scales for physical health (symptoms, fatigue/sleep, bother, and activity), emotional health (psychological and fear), overall QoL, social activity, women's reproductive health, and work. Scores for each scale range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 12 during prospective data collection phase</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' (score = 100) and 'Worst imaginable health state' (score = 0).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 12 in Treatment Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 12 during prospective data collection phase</time_frame>
    <description>Participant satisfaction with treatment was measured using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), an 11-item questionnaire providing scores on four scales - side effects, effectiveness, convenience and global satisfaction. TSQM Scale scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating more satisfaction with treatment.</description>

        <description>The Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura Patient Assessment Questionnaire (ITP-PAQ) was developed to assess disease-specific quality of life (QoL) in adults with ITP. It is a 44-item questionnaire that includes scales for physical health (symptoms, fatigue/sleep, bother, and activity), emotional health (psychological and fear), overall QoL, social activity, women's reproductive health, and work. Scores for each scale range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

          <description>The Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura Patient Assessment Questionnaire (ITP-PAQ) was developed to assess disease-specific quality of life (QoL) in adults with ITP. It is a 44-item questionnaire that includes scales for physical health (symptoms, fatigue/sleep, bother, and activity), emotional health (psychological and fear), overall QoL, social activity, women's reproductive health, and work. Scores for each scale range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>
          <population>The Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Analysis Set includes all participants who completed at least one questionnaire during the prospective observation period.</population>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results aftercompletion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
