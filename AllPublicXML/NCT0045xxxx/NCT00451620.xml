  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The results from the DECODE Study have shown that postprandial (1 - 2 hours after a meal)
      hyperglycemia (elevated blood sugar) is more common in elderly people with diabetes than
      younger people with diabetes and is the best predictor of the development of complications.
      The DECODE Study involved 6941 people who already had diabetes and 702 who did not have
      diabetes. Diabetes is diagnosed when the blood sugar 1st thing in the morning is over 7.0
      mmol/L. The DECODE Study showed that people at risk for diabetes can have a normal blood
      sugar 1st thing in the morning but have a high blood sugar 2 hours after a meal and that
      these people are at risk for developing heart disease and other complications of diabetes.
      These people would not be identified as at risk if only a fasting blood sugar is done.
      Studies in younger people with diabetes have shown that after a meal, insulin levels are more
      like a person without diabetes and glucose (blood sugar) levels are lower with GlucoNorm than
      with Glyburide. There is no data available that demonstrates this in elderly people with type
      2 diabetes.

      You have been invited to participate in this study because you have type 2 diabetes
      controlled by diet and/or exercise or metformin only and are over 65 years of age.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether GlucoNorm has a greater effect than
      Glyburide on insulin levels and glucose (blood sugar) levels after a meal in elderly people
      with type 2 diabetes who control their diabetes with diet and exercise.

      The results from the DECODE Study have shown that postprandial hyperglycemia is more common
      in elderly people with diabetes than younger people and is the best predictor of mortality
      and morbidity. Studies in younger people with diabetes have shown that in response to a meal,
      insulin profiles are more physiologic and glucose levels are lower with GlucoNorm than with
      Glyburide. There is no data available that demonstrates this in elderly people with type 2
      diabetes.

      This is a randomized, open-label, cross-over study. Subjects will undergo 2 Standard Meal
      Tests with Ensure 325 ml separated by 15 - 30 days. Group 1 will receive GlucoNorm 1 mg
      during the 1st Standard Meal Test and Glyburide 2.5 mg during the 2nd Standard Meal Test.
      Group 2 will receive Glyburide 2.5 mg during the 1st Standard Meal Test and GlucoNorm 1mg
      during the 2nd Standard Meal Test.
