  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to measure a receptor in the brain using positron emission
      tomography (PET) that is involved in inflammation.

    <textblock>
      The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is distinct from central benzodiazepine
      receptors associated with GABAa receptors. Although PBR was initially identified in
      peripheral organs such as kidneys, endocrine glands and lungs, later studies identified PBR
      in the central nervous system. In normal conditions, PBR is expressed in low levels in some
      neurons and glial cells. PBR can be a clinically useful marker to detect neuroinflammation,
      because activated microglial cells in inflammatory areas express much greater levels of PBR
      than in microglial cells in resting conditions.

      PBR has been imaged with positron emission tomography (PET) using
      [11C]1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide (PK11195). However, this
      classical ligand provides low levels of specific signal. Recently we developed a new ligand,
      N-acetyl-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine [11C]PBR28, which showed much greater
      specific signal than [11C]PK11195 in non-human primates. ln the present protocol we plan to
      perform a kinetic brain imaging study with [11C]PBR28 in HlV-seronegative controls,
      HIV-seropositive, non-impaired patients, and HlV-seropositive patients with minor cognitive
      motor disorder(MCMD). Each subject will recieve a brain-dedicated PET scan with 20
      mCi[(11)C]PBR28.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Inclusion criteria (healthy control subjects) aged 18 50 years with history/physical exam,
        ECG, and laboratory tests, plus inclusion criteria listed will be included in the protocol.

          1. HIV-seropositive based on ELISA and Western blot (except the HIV-seronegative
             subjects, who will have ELISA screening).

          2. Capable of providing informed consent.

          3. Ambulatory at initial visit.

          4. If cognitively impaired, the degree of impairment will be MCMD, and not frank
             HIV-associated dementia.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Current psychiatric illness or severe systemic disease based on history and physical
             exam

          2. Current dependence on alcohol or substances other than nicotine.

          3. Laboratory results from blood or urine tests that show clinically significant
             abnormalities.

          4. Previous radiation exposure (X-rays, PET scans etc.) that would exceed research
             limits.

          5. Pregnancy and breast feeding.

          6. A history of brain disease.

          7. Cannot lie on your back for long periods since the pictures will be taken for about
             2.5 hours during which time you will have to lie still on the scanner bed.

          8. More than moderate hypertension.

          9. Positive result on urine screen for illicit drugs.
