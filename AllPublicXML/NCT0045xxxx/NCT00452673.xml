    <measure>Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities Per Dose Level - Safety Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to 30 days post last dose</time_frame>
    <description>Safety was assessed from first dose of study drug through at least 30 days after the last dose, until resolution of drug-related toxicity or when toxicity was deemed irreversible, whichever was longer. An adverse event (AE) was considered a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) if it occurred in the first 21 days and was at least possibly related to study drugs and were: Clinically-evident toxicity of Grade &gt;= 3, or of Grade 2 which required interruption of treatment for &gt;= 7 days (consecutive or non-consecutive); non-hematologic abnormal laboratory value of Grade &gt;= 3, or hematologic toxicity of Grade 4, which persisted 7 days; any grade toxicity which in the judgment of the investigator required a dose reduction or removal from further study therapy.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Deaths, Serious Adverse Events, Adverse Events, Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation and Treatment-related Adverse Events - Safety Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to 30 days post last dose</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 3.0. AE=any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. Serious AE (SAE)=a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization. Treatment-related=having certain, probable, possible, or missing relationship to study drug. Grade (Gr) 1=Mild, Gr 2=Moderate, Gr 3=Severe, Gr 4=Life-threatening or disabling, Gr 5=Death.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Overall Response to Tumor - Efficacy Evaluable Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to 30 days post last dose</time_frame>
    <description>Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, with confirmation at &gt;=4 weeks interval; Partial Response (PR): &gt;= 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LDs) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD, with confirmation at &gt;= 4 weeks interval. Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of new lesion(s), or &gt;=20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since treatment start, or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Stable disease was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, without unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, after &gt;=6 weeks on study. Radiological tumor assessment by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) occurred every 6 weeks. For those patients who were on treatment &gt; 24 weeks, the tumor assessment occurred every 9 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Disease Control Rate - Efficacy Evaluable Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to 30 days post last dose</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate was the percentage of participants, (n/N; number with objective response per Number evaluated) whose best response is either a Complete Response (CR) or a Partial Response (PR). Disease control rate was defined as percentage (n/N) of participants with stable disease greater than (&gt;) 6 months, PR, or CR. Efficacy Evaluable Population: All participants with at least one measurable lesion at baseline, who received at least one dose of combination study drug and have at least one on-study tumor assessment or stopped study treatment prior to first assessment, were evaluated. Those who stop treatment prior to tumor assessment for reasons unrelated to disease or drug were excluded.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>57 enrolled and 52 treated. Reasons for not being treated: 4 no longer met criteria; 1 administrative reason by sponsor. Drug was administered at a reduced dose (gradually escalating at each dose level) during the escalation period and then once a dose for the expansion cohort was identified, additional participants were treated with this dose.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>50 mg Dasatinib + 825 mg/m^2Capecitabine (Dose Escalation)</title>
          <description>Dose Level 1: 50 milligram (mg) dasatinib oral tablet twice daily (BID) plus 825 mg per meter squared (m^2) capecitabine oral tablet BID. Participants were treated at each dose level (DL) for minimum of 21 days before accrual to the next DL. Rules for dose escalation: If 0 dose level toxicity (DLT) was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, the next higher cohort was opened to accrual. If 1 DLT was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, then 3 additional participants were studied. If 0 DLT was observed in those 3 (ie, 1 DLT in 6 subjects at the DL), the next higher cohort was opened for accrual. If &gt;=2 DLT was observed in up to 6 subjects, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded and the next lower DL was defined as the MTD. If 0 DLT was observed in 6 participants in a cohort and the next higher DL exceeded the MTD, then intermediate DLs would be studied. Once the MTD was determined, additional participants were enrolled into that dose group.</description>

          <description>Dose Level 1: 50 milligram (mg) dasatinib oral tablet twice daily (BID) plus 825 mg per meter squared (m^2) capecitabine oral tablet BID. Participants were treated at each dose level (DL) for minimum of 21 days before accrual to the next DL. Rules for dose escalation: If 0 dose level toxicity (DLT) was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, the next higher cohort was opened to accrual. If 1 DLT was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, then 3 additional participants were studied. If 0 DLT was observed in those 3 (ie, 1 DLT in 6 subjects at the DL), the next higher cohort was opened for accrual. If &gt;=2 DLT was observed in up to 6 subjects, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded and the next lower DL was defined as the MTD. If 0 DLT was observed in 6 participants in a cohort and the next higher DL exceeded the MTD, then intermediate DLs would be studied. Once the MTD was determined, additional participants were enrolled into that dose group.</description>

        <description>Safety was assessed from first dose of study drug through at least 30 days after the last dose, until resolution of drug-related toxicity or when toxicity was deemed irreversible, whichever was longer. An adverse event (AE) was considered a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) if it occurred in the first 21 days and was at least possibly related to study drugs and were: Clinically-evident toxicity of Grade &gt;= 3, or of Grade 2 which required interruption of treatment for &gt;= 7 days (consecutive or non-consecutive); non-hematologic abnormal laboratory value of Grade &gt;= 3, or hematologic toxicity of Grade 4, which persisted 7 days; any grade toxicity which in the judgment of the investigator required a dose reduction or removal from further study therapy.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1 to 30 days post last dose</time_frame>
        <population>Safety Population: All participants who received at least one dose of study drug. DLTs: Grade 3 headache, Grade 3 pneumonia, Grade 3 diarrhea in Dosing arms, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. DLTs in dose arm 4: 1 participant with Grade 3 pneumonia and pain and 1 participant with Grade 4 neutropenia and diarrhea plus Grade 3 vomiting and mucositis.</population>

          <description>Safety was assessed from first dose of study drug through at least 30 days after the last dose, until resolution of drug-related toxicity or when toxicity was deemed irreversible, whichever was longer. An adverse event (AE) was considered a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) if it occurred in the first 21 days and was at least possibly related to study drugs and were: Clinically-evident toxicity of Grade &gt;= 3, or of Grade 2 which required interruption of treatment for &gt;= 7 days (consecutive or non-consecutive); non-hematologic abnormal laboratory value of Grade &gt;= 3, or hematologic toxicity of Grade 4, which persisted 7 days; any grade toxicity which in the judgment of the investigator required a dose reduction or removal from further study therapy.</description>
          <population>Safety Population: All participants who received at least one dose of study drug. DLTs: Grade 3 headache, Grade 3 pneumonia, Grade 3 diarrhea in Dosing arms, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. DLTs in dose arm 4: 1 participant with Grade 3 pneumonia and pain and 1 participant with Grade 4 neutropenia and diarrhea plus Grade 3 vomiting and mucositis.</population>

        <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Disease Control Rate - Efficacy Evaluable Population</title>
        <description>Objective response rate was the percentage of participants, (n/N; number with objective response per Number evaluated) whose best response is either a Complete Response (CR) or a Partial Response (PR). Disease control rate was defined as percentage (n/N) of participants with stable disease greater than (&gt;) 6 months, PR, or CR. Efficacy Evaluable Population: All participants with at least one measurable lesion at baseline, who received at least one dose of combination study drug and have at least one on-study tumor assessment or stopped study treatment prior to first assessment, were evaluated. Those who stop treatment prior to tumor assessment for reasons unrelated to disease or drug were excluded.</description>

Participants were treated at each dose level (DL) for minimum of 21 days before accrual to the next DL. Rules for dose escalation: If 0 dose level toxicity (DLT) was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, the next higher cohort was opened to accrual. If 1 DLT was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, then 3 additional participants were studied. If 0 DLT was observed in those 3 (ie, 1 DLT in 6 subjects at the DL), the next higher cohort was opened for accrual. If &gt;=2 DLT was observed in up to 6 subjects, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded and the next lower DL was defined as the MTD. If 0 DLT was observed in 6 participants in a cohort and the next higher DL exceeded the MTD, then intermediate DLs would be studied. Once the MTD was determined, additional participants were enrolled into that dose group.</description>
