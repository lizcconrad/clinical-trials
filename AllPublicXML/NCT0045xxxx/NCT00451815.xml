             and women planning to become pregnant while on study are to be excluded.

          4. Carry a diagnosis of probable idiopathic PD, made by a Movement Disorder Specialist,
             with asymmetric onset and at least 2 of the following cardinal features of PD:
             bradykinesia, rigidity, or a classic PD resting tremor.

          5. Be Hoehn &amp; Yahr Stage I-III inclusive when OFF.

          6. Have a Total Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) OFF score of ³ 8.

          7. Have taken no prescribed medications for PD for a minimum of 2 weeks before the
             Baseline Visit (Day -1).

          8. Are willing to abstain from alcohol for the duration of the study.

          9. Have no clinically significant baseline ECG (12-lead) and laboratory abnormalities (as
             determined by the Investigator), unless exempted by the Biogen Idec Medical Director.

         10. Agree to provide blood samples for mRNA and DNA analysis, which will be collected and
             banked and may be used for exploratory pharmacogenomic studies.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Unless otherwise specified, candidates will be excluded from study entry if any of the
        following exclusion criteria exist at the time of the Baseline Visit (Day –1):

          1. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score &lt;27.

          2. History or clinical features such as impaired downward gaze, prominent axial rigidity,
             gait initiation failure, autonomic dysfunction, etc. consistent with an atypical
             parkinsonism syndrome.

          3. Any significant non-PD central nervous system disorder.

          4. Significant AXIS I psychiatric disease as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
             of Mental Disorders, 4th edition-Revised (DSM IV-TR, American Psychiatric Association,
             2000).

          5. History of surgical intervention for PD (pallidotomy, thalamotomy, deep brain
             stimulation, etc.).

          6. Participation in a previous adenosine A2A trial.

          7. Participation in any other investigational drug study within 1 month prior to
             randomization into this trial.

          8. History of malignancy unless an exemption has been granted by the Biogen Idec Medical
             Director.

          9. History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to a drug.

         10. Clinically significant cardiac, renal, pulmonary, hematopoietic, endocrine, or hepatic
             disease.

         11. Abnormal laboratory results as follows: AST, ALT, total bilirubin, GGT levels &gt; 1.5 x
             upper limit of normal; serum lipase &gt; upper limit of normal; WBC &lt; 4,000 cells/mm3
             hemoglobin &lt; 10, or any other abnormal laboratory value that could interfere with the
             assessment of safety.

         12. Supine (measured in duplicate 10 minutes after resting) or standing (measured in
             duplicate 3 minutes after changing from a supine to a standing position) blood
             pressure of &gt;150 or &lt;90 mmHg systolic or &gt;90 or &lt;40 mmHg diastolic on 2 consecutive
             occasions.

         13. Orthostatic hypotension as defined by a decrease in systolic BP of &gt;20 mmHg or in
             diastolic blood pressure of &gt; 10 mmHg measured in duplicate 3 minutes after changing
             from a supine to standing position.

         14. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

             Visit.

         19. Unwillingness or inability to comply with the requirements of the protocol including
             the presence of any condition (physical, mental, or social) that is likely to affect
