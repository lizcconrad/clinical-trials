      The hypothesis of the study is the following: Patients with sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome
      have different pattern in the secretion of hormones.

      The chronic sleep disorganization that suffer patients with sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome
      (SAHS) may affect the central mechanisms that regulate nutritive behavior and energetic
      balance, causing an alteration in the secretion of hormones that favour the appearance and/or
      development of obesity.

      OBJECTIVES: To compare the plasmatic profiles of different hormones and neuropeptides,
      related with weight control, metabolism and intake in patients with SAHS as well as in
      selected control subjects according to weight.

      DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective and controlled study. 40 patients with SAHS will be included
      as well as 40 control subjects.

      METHODS: To all subjects included in the study, the following procedures will be performed:

        1. Medical History;

        2. Anthropometric variables (height, weight, Body Mass Index;

        3. Somnolence evaluation using the Epworth scale;

        4. Conventional Polysomnography (PSG);

        5. Determination every four hours during a 24 hours period of the levels of leptin
           adiponectin, resistin, insulin, PCR, etc.

        6. Conventional biologic evaluation;

        7. Patients will be re-evaluated after three months of treatment with CPAP.
