      Intimate partner violence against women is a significant global health problem. This study
      was designed to test the hypothesis that a group intervention based on empowerment theory of
      Paolo Freire would be effective as a means to reduce the extent and prevent violence among
      women whose partners were violent toward them.

      battered women (EBW) was conducted with 12 groups over a period of two years. Assessments
