      To determine if the omentectomy diminishes hyperglycemia and improves the resistance to the
      insulin in patients with morbid obesity and propensity to develop to Diabetes Mellitus type
      2.

      To determine the Blood levels of glucose, curve of tolerance to the glucose, hemoglobin
      glycosylated, insulin, triglyceride, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, leptin and Adiponectin in
      patients with Obesity Morbid and that will be put under umbilical surgery and cholecystectomy
      opened.

      To put under them umbilical surgery or Cholecystectomy open with and without omentectomy To
      compare the Blood levels of of glucose, curve of tolerance wing glucose, hemoglobin
      glycosylated, insulin, triglyceride, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, leptin and Adiponectin before and
