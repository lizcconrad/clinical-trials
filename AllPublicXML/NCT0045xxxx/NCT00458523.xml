      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as alemtuzumab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and
      help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well alemtuzumab works in
      treating patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia in partial remission or complete
      remission.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the rate of achieving minimum residual disease (MRD) negativity after
           treatment with alemtuzumab in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL)
           who have low levels of MRD after conventional therapy or who relapse at an MRD level
           after a prior MRD-negative remission.

        -  Determine the safety of alemtuzumab in patients treated in the MRD-positive setting.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the clinical response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the time to MRD relapse in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug when administered as consolidation/maintenance therapy
           on CD52 expression on CLL cells.

        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of repeated drug dosing required to achieve sustained
           MRD negativity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Observation: Patients with minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status are observed
           every 4 weeks for 12 weeks and then every 12 weeks thereafter. If they become
           MRD-positive, then they are eligible for treatment.

        -  Treatment: Patients with MRD-positive status receive alemtuzumab subcutaneously or IV
           over 2 hours three times weekly for up to 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 6 weeks of study therapy, patients are
           evaluated for response. Patients who remain MRD-positive and are responding to study
           therapy receive an additional 6 weeks of treatment. Patients who remain MRD-positive and
           show no significant improvement in the level of leukemic cells detected in their
           peripheral blood or bone marrow are removed from the study. Patients achieving
           MRD-negative remission are removed from study therapy and monitored for disease
           recurrence at an MRD level. If MRD-level relapse is confirmed in these patients, they
           may be retreated with alemtuzumab provided their initial response to therapy lasted for
           at least 6 months.

      Patients undergo collection of peripheral blood and bone marrow periodically during study for
      assessment of MRD by MRD flow cytometry, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis,
      somatic mutation analysis, and B-cell selection.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54 patients will be accrued for this study.
