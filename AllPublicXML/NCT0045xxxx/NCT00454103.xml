  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The improvement of conventional imaging techniques has led to an increased detection rate of
      different adrenal tumors. Since those tumors can belong to a variety of entities the
      therapeutic consequences also show considerable variation. In order to definitely determine
      the type of tumor, invasive procedures like CT guided biopsies are often required, which
      could be avoided by a tumor specific imaging method. The presently available scintigraphic
      procedures are either time consuming and lead to high radiation exposure or are technically
      demanding. The steroidogenic enzymes CYP11B1 (11ß-hydroxylase)and CYP11B2 (aldosterone
      synthase)are expressed exclusively in the adrenal cortex and therefore represent suitable
      targets for a specific imaging technique. In our project we evaluate 123I-Iodometomidate
      which binds to both CYP11B enzymes as radiotracer for adrenal scintigraphy.
