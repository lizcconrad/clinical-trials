      OBJECTIVE: Former studies have presented conflicting data on the association between exposure
      to Portland cement dust and respiratory effects. Our goal is to examine inflammation in the
      airways and in peripheral blood in subjects exposed to cement-dust.

      METHODS: All non smoking, dust exposed, workers from one department in the largest cement
      plant in Norway, are invited to participate. The workers will perform spirometry and induced
      sputum (IS) after a period of regular work with cement dust exposure, and again after a
      minimum of 5 days without exposure. Information on respiratory symptoms, allergy and former
      respiratory disease will be given on a self-reported questionnaire. IS was performed and
      processed as described by Pin et al. Differential cell counts will be carried out.
      Inflammatory markers in induced sputum and in peripheral blood will be measured. We want to
      use a crossover design were the cases are used as their own controls, but we will also
      include external controls.
