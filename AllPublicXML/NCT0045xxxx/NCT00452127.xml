  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase I/II study of the safety of escalating doses of
      single-agent PRO131921 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD20-positive indolent NHL.
      The trial will enroll in two phases: a Phase I dose-escalation portion for patients with
      indolent NHL and a Phase II portion with enrollment of additional patients with follicular
      NHL into two expanded treatment cohorts in order to expand the safety database and collect
      preliminary anti-lymphoma activity data.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Signed informed consent

          -  Ability and willingness to comply with the requirements of the study protocol

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Documented history of histologically confirmed CD20-positive follicular NHL (Phases I
             and II); for Phase I, other CD20-positive indolent lymphomas (marginal zone lymphoma
             and small lymphocytic lymphoma) are also included. Patients with a history of a
             CD20-positive NHL of mixed (indolent/aggressive) histology may also be included in
             Phase I if the most recent relapse biopsy shows only indolent NHL

          -  Indolent lymphoma (Phase I) or follicular lymphoma (Phase II) that either has relapsed
             after a documented history of response (CR, CRu, or PR) of ≥6 months to a
             rituximab-containing regimen or was refractory to a previous rituximab-containing
             regimen

          -  Bi-dimensionally measurable disease, with at least one lesion &gt;1.5 cm in its largest
             dimension

          -  Absolute B‑cell count ≥LLN at screening (Phase I only)

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          -  For patients of reproductive potential (males and females), use of a reliable means of
             contraception during the study and for 1 year following the last dose of study
             treatment

          -  For females of childbearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days
             prior to enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy (other than rituximab or
             radioimmunotherapy)

          -  Prior use of any non-CD20-targeted monoclonal antibody therapy within 6 months of
             enrollment

          -  Current or recent lymphoma treatment

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to human, humanized, chimeric, or
             murine monoclonal antibodies

          -  Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant diseases, such as cardiovascular
             disease, nervous system, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, endocrine, or gastrointestinal
             disorders

          -  Evidence of myelodysplasia or myelodysplastic changes on bone marrow examination

          -  Untreated or persistent/recurrent malignancy (other than lymphoma)

          -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, or other infection

          -  A major episode of infection requiring hospitalization or treatment with IV
             antimicrobials within 4 weeks of screening or oral antimicrobials within 2 weeks of
             screening

          -  History of recurrent significant infection or bacterial infections

          -  Positive hepatitis B or C serology

          -  Positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Central nervous system lymphoma

          -  Recent major surgery within 4 weeks of screening, other than diagnostic surgery
