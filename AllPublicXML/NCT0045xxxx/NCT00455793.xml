      We will obtain data using multi-slice CT technology to detect subclinical coronary disease in
      the HIV population. Determination of subclinical cardiovascular disease using noninvasive
      technology and elucidation of the associated risk factors will help to guide targeted therapy
      to prevent cardiovascular events in this patient population.

      We will investigate the prevalence of coronary plaque lesions and coronary artery
      calcifications in men and women with HIV disease as determined by 64-row multidetector
      computed tomography (MDCT) and MDCT coronary angiography in comparison to age-matched control
      subjects without HIV infection. We hypothesize that evidence of coronary artery calcification
      and coronary plaque lesions as seen by MDCT will be present in individuals with HIV more than
      non-HIV control subjects of the same age. We also hypothesize the degree of atherosclerosis
      will be increased in HIV patients compared to control subjects.

      We will evaluate the metabolic and inflammatory factors associated with coronary artery
      disease in HIV-infected individuals. We hypothesize that traditional cardiac risk factors as
      well as metabolic and inflammatory changes associated with HIV and its treatment such as
      dyslipidemia, increased secretion of inflammatory markers, decreased adiponectin, increased
      insulin resistance and increased visceral fat may be associated with coronary artery disease
      in HIV-infected individuals.
