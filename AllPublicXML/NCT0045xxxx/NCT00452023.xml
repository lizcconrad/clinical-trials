  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to see if Pegasys (IFN-alpha2a) can help to
      control the disease in patients with ET, PV, AMM/MF, and Ph-negative CML. The safety of this
      treatment will also be studied.

      IFN-alpha2a has been used for the treatment of a variety of disorders (such as hepatitis C).
      IFN-alpha2a is a drug that may affect the way infections and malignant diseases develop.

      Before treatment starts, you will have blood (around 2 teaspoons) and bone marrow samples
      collected. To collect a bone marrow sample, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with
      anesthetic and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle. These
      samples will be used for tests to confirm the diagnosis of the disease. Women who are able to
      have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test.

      During treatment, you will receive IFN-alpha2a as an injection under the skin once a week.
      You (or your caregiver) will be taught how to give the injections, and you will receive
      treatment on an outpatient basis.

      Treatment will continue (injections once a week) as long as the disease does not get worse.

      If the disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects, you will be taken
      off the study and your doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.

      During treatment you will have blood (around 1 teaspoon) collected every other week for 2
      months, then once every 1 or 2 months for a year, then every 3 months. You will also have
      bone marrow samples collected every 3 to 6 months during the first year of treatment. After
      the first year of treatment, bone marrow samples will be collected only when your doctor
      feels they are needed. The blood and bone marrow samples will be used for tests to check on
      the response to therapy.

      This is an investigational study. IFN-alpha2a has been approved by the FDA for the treatment
      of hepatitis C and is commercially available. However the use of IFN-alpha2a in this study is
      investigational. The commercial prepartion of IFN-alpha2a(Pegasys) will be used in this
      study. Up to 280 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D.
      Anderson.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Following diagnoses: --ET: Patients with PLT &gt; 600 x10 9 /l documented in the past 12
             months; hyperplasia of marrow megakaryocytes in the absence of identifiable cause of
             thrombocytosis and in the absence of Ph chromosome. Patients with ET and lower PLT
             will be eligible if attributable to prior ET therapy. --PV: Patients should have Hb
             &gt;/= 15g/dl (except if patient is having phlebotomies done) and documented past
             diagnosis.

          2. Performance status &lt;/= 2 (ECOG scale).

          3. Age greater than 18 years since disease is extremely rare in younger age group.

          4. Adequate liver function: total bilirubin of &lt;/= 2.0 mg/dl (except for patients with
             Gilbert's Syndrome) and AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) &lt; 3 X ULN (or &lt; 5 X ULN if considered
             due to tumor), and renal function (serum creatinine &lt;/= 2.0 mg/dl).

          5. Signed informed consent indicating that patients are aware of the investigational
             nature of this study in keeping with the policies of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.
             The only acceptable consent form is the one approved by the M.D. Anderson Cancer
             Center IRB.

             have recovered from the toxic effects of that therapy. Patients may have received
             hydroxyurea or anagrelide immediately before study entry, and may continue into
             therapy if treating physician determines this is in the best interest of the patient.
