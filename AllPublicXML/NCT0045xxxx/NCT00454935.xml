  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation of SV2A expression in surgically
      removed tumour and tumour-surrounding tissue of glioma patients suffering from epilepsy with
      their clinical response to levetiracetam.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Levetiracetam is a relatively novel anti-epileptic drug (AED), which has proven to be
      effective and well tolerated in many glioma patients with otherwise pharmacoresistant
      epilepsy. Moreover, levetiracetam has neither enzyme-inducing nor enzyme-inhibiting
      properties, which makes the drug particularly attractive for brain tumour patients, as they
      frequently receive chemotherapy and/or corticosteroids. Therefore, levetiracetam is the
      anti-epileptic drug of choice post-operatively in glioma patients suffering from epilepsy.
      Unfortunately, even with levetiracetam, a proportion of glioma patients is not free of
      seizures. It is unclear, however, which glioma patients benefit from levetiracetam treatment.
      It is suggested that the expression of protein SV2A is correlated with clinical response to
      levetiracetam. The determination of SV2A expression in brain (tumour) tissue might be used as
      a predictive tool for response to levetiracetam.

      Objective of this study: Correlation of SV2A expression in surgically removed tumour and
      tumour-surrounding tissue of glioma patients suffering from epilepsy with their clinical
      response to levetiracetam.
