  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo controlled, dose escalation clinical
      trial in 4 cohorts of 10 postmenopausal women (total N=40) aged 45 to 65 years with at least
      one menopausal vaginal symptom, vaginal pH &gt; 5.0 and &gt; 20% parabasal vaginal epithelial
      cells.

      Primary Aims:

        1. the optimal dose of VG101 based on the highest of 4 proposed dose levels that is not
           associated with unacceptable toxicity during 12 weeks of treatment. Toxicity will be
           based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events
           (CTCAE), version 3. Unacceptable toxicity will be defined as the occurrence of any Grade
           3, 4, of 5 toxicity that is possibly or probably associated with study drug or any other
           unacceptable toxicity as determined by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board.

        2. Specific potential adverse effects of VG101

      Secondary Aims:

        1. the preliminary efficacy of VG101 to:

             -  relieve vulvar and/or vaginal dryness,

             -  relieve vulvar and/or vaginal irritation

             -  relieve vulvar and/or vaginal itching

             -  relieve vulvar and/or vaginal discharge

             -  relieve dyspareunia

             -  improve sexual function

             -  relieve dysuria

             -  reduce frequency of urinary incontinence

             -  improve quality of life

             -  improve the physical examination assessment of vaginal atrophy

             -  reduce vaginal fluid pH

             -  improve the proportion of superficial vaginal epithelial cells

        2. participant adherence to VG101 administration
