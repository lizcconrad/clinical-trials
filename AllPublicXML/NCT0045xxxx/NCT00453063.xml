    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the effectiveness of mometasone furoate nasal spay (MFNS)
      once daily (QD) compared with placebo in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) in
      reducing the total nasal symptom score and the total ocular symptom score.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Average AM Instantaneous (NOW) Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Averaged Over Days 2 to 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 15 days</time_frame>
    <description>TNSS was defined as the sum of the following four nasal symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal congestion/stuffiness, nasal itching, sneezing; each symptom scored on a scale of 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The best possible score on this scale is 0 and the worst possible score on this scale is 12.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Average AM Instantaneous (NOW) Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS) Averaged Over Days 2 to 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 15 days</time_frame>
    <description>TOSS was defined as the sum of the following three ocular symptoms: redness of eyes, itching/burning eyes, and tearing/watering eyes; each symptom scored on a scale of 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The best possible score on this scale is 0 and the worst possible score on this scale is 9.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in AM NOW Nasal Congestion Score Averaged Over Days 2 to 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal congestion was one of the symptoms measured in the TNSS and was scored on a scale of 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The best possible score on this scale is 0 and the worst possible score on this scale is 3.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) Total Score at Endpoint (Last Post Baseline Evaluation Carried Forward)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 15 days</time_frame>
    <description>The RQLQ consisted of 28 items that fell into the following seven domains: activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional. Each of the items was scored from 0 = not troubled to 6 = extremely troubled, and the total of the seven domains was the primary focus of this quality of life evaluation. The best possible score on this scale is 0 and the worst possible score on this scale is 42. The Endpoint was the last post baseline evaluation carried forward and was Day 15 for the majority of the participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in AM Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow (PNIF) Averaged Over Days 2 to 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were to measure nasal airflow twice daily (in the morning prior to study drug dosing and in the evening) using their PNIF meter. The highest of 3 assessments was to be recorded in the electronic diary. The PNIF meter limits were between 30 and 370 liters/minute. Normal values range between 100 and 150 liters/minute. A positive change from Baseline correlates with improved nasal air flow.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be 12 years of age or older, of either sex and of any race.

          -  Must have at least a 2-year documented history of SAR which exacerbates during the
             study season.

          -  Must have a positive skin-prick test response to an appropriate seasonal allergen at
             Screening (Visit 1). Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity to an
             appropriate seasonal allergen (ie, prevailing trees and/or grasses) must be documented
             by a positive response to the skin prick test with wheal diameter at least 3 mm larger
             than diluent control after 20 minutes.

          -  Must be clinically symptomatic at the Screening Visit.

          -  Must be clinically symptomatic at the Baseline Visit.

          -  Must be in general good health as confirmed by routine clinical and laboratory testing
             and electrocardiogram (ECG) results. Clinical laboratory test (complete blood count
             [CBC], blood chemistries, and urinalysis) must be within normal limits or clinically
             acceptable to the investigator and the sponsor.

          -  Must be free of any clinically significant disease, other than SAR, that would
             interfere with the study evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of anaphylaxis and/or other severe local reaction(s) to skin testing.

          -  A subject with asthma who requires chronic use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids.

          -  Current or history of frequent, clinically significant sinusitis or chronic purulent
             postnasal drip.

          -  A subject with rhinitis medicamentosa.

          -  A history of allergies to more than two classes of medications or who are allergic to
             or cannot tolerate nasal sprays.

          -  A subject who has had an upper respiratory tract or sinus infection that required
             antibiotic therapy without at least a 14-day washout prior to the Screening Visit, or
             who has had a viral upper respiratory infection within 7 days before the Screening
             Visit.

          -  A subject who has nasal structural abnormalities, including large nasal polyps and
             marked septal deviations, which significantly interfere with nasal air flow.

          -  A subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, is dependent on nasal, oral, or
             ocular decongestants, nasal topical antihistamines, or nasal steroids.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Average AM Instantaneous (NOW) Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Averaged Over Days 2 to 15</title>
        <description>TNSS was defined as the sum of the following four nasal symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal congestion/stuffiness, nasal itching, sneezing; each symptom scored on a scale of 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The best possible score on this scale is 0 and the worst possible score on this scale is 12.</description>

        <population>All randomized participants were to be included in the analysis (intent-to-treat principle). However, subjects with a missing evaluation at a given visit or time point were not included in the analysis for that evaluation. This included participants without a baseline score for a given change-from-baseline evaluation.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Average AM Instantaneous (NOW) Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Averaged Over Days 2 to 15</title>
          <description>TNSS was defined as the sum of the following four nasal symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal congestion/stuffiness, nasal itching, sneezing; each symptom scored on a scale of 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The best possible score on this scale is 0 and the worst possible score on this scale is 12.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants were to be included in the analysis (intent-to-treat principle). However, subjects with a missing evaluation at a given visit or time point were not included in the analysis for that evaluation. This included participants without a baseline score for a given change-from-baseline evaluation.</population>
