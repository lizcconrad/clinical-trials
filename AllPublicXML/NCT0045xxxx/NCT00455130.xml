  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis is the most frequent lethal genetic disease of childhood. Causes disruption
      of glandular function of the pancreas, intestine, liver, lungs (causing chronic lung
      infection with emphysema), sweat glands and reproductive organs. We know that many CF
      patients die of lung failure, brought about in part by repeated lung infections caused by
      thick, sticky mucus that cannot be readily cleared from the lung.

      Inhaled mannitol is an osmotic agent that has been investigated in a number of small studies
      that have examined mucociliary clearance, quality of life and lung function in CF and
      bronchiectasis. The promising results of these studies warrant futher investigation. The aim
      of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of inhaled mannitol when administered
      twice a day over two weeks in CF.
