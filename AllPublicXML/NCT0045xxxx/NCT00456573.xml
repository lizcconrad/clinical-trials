      The purpose of this study is to compare the cytokine profile of tonsillar and peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and to compare the
      blood mononuclear cell cytokine secretion profile between patients with obstructive sleep
      apnea and controls without apnea.

      We will recruit subjects with OSA about to undergo adenotonsillectomy and collect a blood
      sample and portion of their tonsils after the induction of general anesthesia. The
      mononuclear cells will be isolated from both these tissues and stimulated with different
      markers and cytokines assayed and compared. We will also recruit patients with no symptoms of
      OSA undergoing unrelated elective surgery and ascertain the absence of OSA by having the
      parents fill out a sleep questionnaire. We will then collect blood samples from these
      patients after the induction of anesthesia and examine the cytokine secretion profile and
      compare it to that of the children with OSA.
