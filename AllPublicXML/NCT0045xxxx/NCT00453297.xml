  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I trial in healthy, post-menopausal women is designed as a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized, ascending single-dose safety trial. MF101 will be
      administered as a single oral dose to a total of 32 enrolled subjects between the ages of
      40-65 years. Eight subjects will be assigned to each of four cohorts. Within each cohort, six
      subjects will be randomized to receive MF101 and two subjects will receive placebo. MF101
      doses will be incrementally escalated until the stopping criteria are reached. If stopping
      criteria are reached before the fourth cohort receives dosing, the next cohort may receive a
      dose between the dose that was administered to the cohort exhibiting symptoms of MF101
      toxicity and the next lower dose group.

      The primary goal of this study is to identify the highest safe oral dose of MF101 that is
      well tolerated in humans.

      Secondary goals include: characterizing clinical symptoms of MF101 toxicity in healthy
      subjects and evaluating the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics of key MF101 active components
      after a single oral dose.
