  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become the standard of care for breast cancer patients with
      large tumors in order to render them operable for mastectomy or, in some cases, for
      lumpectomy and radiation therapy. Building on this theme, several large hormonal therapies
      are extensively investigated in the neoadjuvant setting, together with biologic correlates
      for response and resistance. As a further extension, neoadjuvant therapies with biologic
      agents are now too, being investigated for biologic evidence of efficacy before large-scale
      clinical trials of thousands of patients are embarked on. The neoadjuvant setting is
      especially attractive for these studies for several reasons including early assessment of
      response to therapy, biopsiable access to the primary tumor, and considerable reduced sample
      sizes compared to those required in the adjuvant setting. In addition, clinical response to
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a validated surrogate marker for improved survival. It may be
      used to test the overall efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment regimens and mirrors the effect of
      therapy on micrometastases setting. In a recent study, good clinical response to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy was the only independent variable, by multivariate analysis, associated with
      decreased risk of death.

      GW572016 is a new and promising dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor against HER1/2. Hundreds of
      patients were treated in phase I and II studies world-wide and results indicate that this
      reversible, oral small molecule is generally well-tolerated. Studies of neoadjuvant
      Trastuzumab indicate that HER2 interference leads to significant tumor regression even after
      3 weeks of monotherapy. We aim to extend these findings with a novel agent, GW572016 that may
      be more effective, especially from its in vitro data, and to discover the true response rate
      to inhibiting HER1/2 signal transduction in breast cancer patients.
