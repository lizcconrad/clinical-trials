  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study based in Southern Ethiopia Purpose - to explore if children in contact with adults with
      TB have positive acute reactants such as IFN-y and other cytokine responses; if these
      responses discriminate between high and low risk of disease progression and whether these
      could be incorporated into improved diagnostic approaches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study follows children in contact with TB. Those with positive TST will be offered
      chemoprophylaxis and all children will be followed for 2 years to describe IFN-y responses
      over time, identify symptoms of active TB and if these symptoms are associated with IFN-y and
      other cytokine responses.

      Children with suspicion of TB attending health centres will also be investigated using
      routine diagnostic tests and IFN-y and other cytokines responses to evaluate if the latter
      could be used in improved diagnostic approaches.
