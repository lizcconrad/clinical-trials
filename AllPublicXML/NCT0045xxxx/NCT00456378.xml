      This pivotal clinical trial is being conducted to evaluate the DIAM™ Spinal Stabilization
      System for the treatment of single-level moderate lumbar degenerative disc disease. The
      implant under investigation in this clinical trial is the DIAM Spinal Stabilization System,
      and the device will be implanted using a posterior surgical approach. Patients in the control
      group will receive nonoperative treatment.

    <measure>Overall Success</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A patient will be considered an overall success if all of the following conditions are met:
Pain/disability (Oswestry) success;
No serious adverse event classified as &quot;implant associated&quot;, &quot;implant-/surgical procedure associated&quot;, or &quot;nonoperative treatment associated&quot;; and
For patients in the investigational group, no additional surgical procedure at the involved level classified as a failure. For patients in the control group, no &quot;treatment surgery&quot; at the involved level that was the result of a poor response to conservative care treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain/Disability Status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The self-administered Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire will be used. Success will be defined as pain/disability improvement according to the following definition:
Pre-treatment Score - Post-treatment Score ≥ 15</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurological Status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological status is based on four types of measurements: motor, sensory, reflexes, and straight leg raising. Each of the sections is comprised of a number of elements. Overall neurological success will be defined as maintenance or improvement in all sections ( motor, sensory, reflex, and straightleg raising ) for the time period evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Status (Back Pain and Leg Pain)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Numerical rating scales will be used to evaluate pain intensity and duration. The pain score (0 min, 20 Max) is derived by adding the numerical rating scores from the pain intensity (0-10, with a score of 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 representing &quot;pain as bad as it could be.&quot;) and duration scales (0-10, with a score of 0 being &quot;pain none of the time&quot; and a score of 10 being &quot;pain all of the time&quot;). Success for back pain and leg pain is described as follows: Pre-treatment Score - Post-treatment Score &gt;0</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>General Health Status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) will be used to assess general health status. The SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) measures a patient's physical wellbeing and will be calculated according to algorithms formulated by the Medical Outcomes Trust. To be classified as a success, the following criterion must be met for SF-36 PCS:
PCSPost-tx - PCSPre-tx &gt;= 0</description>

        Each patient participating in this clinical trial must meet all of the following inclusion
        criteria:

          1. Has moderate low back pain secondary to lumbar degenerative disc disease at a single
             level from L2 - L5. Low back pain is defined as persistent back pain, with or without
             radicular pain, with current episode of less than one year duration. Degenerative disc
             disease is confirmed by patient history, physical examination, and radiographic
             studies with one or more of the following factors (as measured radiographically by MRI
             scans or x-rays):

               -  Decreased disc height &gt;2mm, compared to the disc space at the next adjacent
                  (superior or inferior, whichever has greater disc height) spinal level;

               -  Scarring/thickening of the ligamentum flavum, annulus fibrosis, or facet joint
                  capsule;

               -  Herniated nucleus pulposus.

          2. Is 18-70 years of age, inclusive, and is skeletally mature.

          3. Has pre-treatment Oswestry score ≥ 30.

          4. Has pre-treatment back pain score of ≥ 8 based on the Pre-Treatment Back and Leg Pain
             Questionnaire (Back Pain Intensity + Back Pain Frequency).

          5. Has been treated nonoperatively (e.g. bed rest, physical therapy, medications, TENS,
             manipulation, and/or spinal injections) for a period of at least 6 weeks and not more
             than 6 months prior to enrollment in the clinical study.

          6. If of child-bearing potential, patient is not pregnant or nursing and agrees not to
             become pregnant during the study period.

          7. Is willing and able to participate in either of the randomized treatments for the
             duration of the study follow-up period. If the patient is randomized to the
             investigational group, he/she is willing to undergo surgery and receive the DIAM
             device. If the patient is randomized to the control group, he/she is willing to
             undergo all four nonoperative treatments.
