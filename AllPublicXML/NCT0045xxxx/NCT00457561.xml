  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decreased body fat mass, possibly mediated through the effects of elevated serum adiponectin
      levels, may be associated with requirements for higher recombinant human erythropoietin doses
      and a subsequent worse prognosis in patients beginning hemodialysis.
