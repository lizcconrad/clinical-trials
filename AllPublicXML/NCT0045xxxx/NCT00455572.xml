    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to find out how successfully non-small-cell lung cancer
      patients are able to give an immune response to injections of the immunotherapeutic product
      GSK1572932A, and to find out more about the safety of this treatment. A course of eight
      injections will be administered over 21 weeks; including screening for suitability and all
      tests, the duration of the study for a patient will be 30-35 weeks. During this period
      various tests will be performed, including physical examinations and blood tests. The
      Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

    <textblock>
      This is an open, four-arm, parallel-group study, to be conducted at approximately 20 centers
      in Europe and Canada. All patients will receive the same immunotherapeutic treatment with
      GSK1572932A, but they will be recruited into four cohorts according to the details of their
      disease. Cohort 1: Patients with resected stage IB, II or IIIA tumors who are due for
      standard chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinorelbine. These patients will receive chemo-and
      immunotherapy in parallel. Cohort 2: Patients with resected stage IB, II or IIIA tumors who
      are due for standard chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinorelbine. These patients will first
      receive chemotherapy and then immunotherapy.

      Cohort 3: Patients with resected stage IB, II or IIIA tumors who are not due for
      chemotherapy. These patients will receive immunotherapy only. Cohort 4: Patients with
      unresectable stage III tumors, following standard chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. These
      patients will receive immunotherapy only. Immunotherapeutic treatment will comprise eight
      doses of GSK1572932A. Doses will be administered at three-week intervals; in Cohort 1 this
      may be adapted to fit in with the patient's chemotherapy. During the study, adjuvant
      radiotherapy is allowed in Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 for patients in stage III only and is
      prohibited in Cohort 4. Chemotherapy during the study is allowed in Cohort 1 only as
      described above, and is prohibited in Cohorts 2-4. The total maximum duration of the study
      for a patient will be 30-35 weeks.
