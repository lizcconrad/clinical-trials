  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DX-88 (ecallantide)
      versus placebo in the treatment of moderate to severe acute attacks of hereditary angioedema.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized placebo-controlled trial.

      The study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 30 mg subcutaneous ecallantide
      versus placebo in the treatment of moderate to severe acute attacks of hereditary angioedema.
      This study is conducted under Special Protocol Assessment with the FDA and is designed to
      provide pivotal efficacy data on ecallantide. These data are intended to support the
      marketing authorization of ecallantide in the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary
      angioedema. Efficacy and safety of ecallantide will be evaluated in this study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Symptom Complex Severity (MSCS) Score at 4 Hours Post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The Mean Symptom Complex Severity (MSCS) score is a validated, comprehensive point-in-time measure of symptom severity. At baseline and 4 hours, patients rated the severity on a categorical scale (0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) for symptoms at each affected anatomical location. Ratings were averaged to obtain the MSCS score. A decrease in MSCS score reflected an improvement in symptoms; clinically meaningful improvement was indicated by a reduction in the score of 0.30 or more.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Outcome Score at 4 Hours Post-Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment Outcome Score (TOS) is a validated, comprehensive measure of symptom response to treatment. At 4 hours , patient assessment of response characterized by their change from baseline in symptom severity and collected by anatomic site of attack involvement, was recorded on a categorical scale (significant improvement [100; best value]to significant worsening [-100; worst value]). Clinically meaningful improvement was indicated by a TOS of 30 or higher.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients With Significant Improvement in Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were to be asked to perform an overall response assessment at intervals during the first 4 hours post-dose. Assessments were to be made relative to baseline (ie, immediately before initial dosing) using a 5-category scale. Categories were: significant improvement = &quot;a lot better or resolved&quot;; improvement = &quot;a little better&quot;; same = response unchanged; worsening = &quot;a little worse&quot;; significant worsening = &quot;a lot worse&quot;. Significant improvement is the first time that a patient responded to the overall response assessment as &quot;a lot better or resolved.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Patients With a Successful Response at 4 Hours Post-dosing, Based on the Change From Baseline in the MSCS Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 hours post-dosing</time_frame>
    <description>A successful response was defined as improvement in existing laryngeal symptom complex,stabilization of an existing peripheral symptom complex, or a change from baseline in the MSCS score at 4 hours of at least -1.0.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Patients Maintaining a Significant Improvement in Overall Response Through 24 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours post-dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Maintenance of significant improvement was defined as achieving and maintaining a significant improvement in overall response through 24 hours after dosing. Patient response categories were: significant improvement = &quot;a lot better or resolved&quot;; improvement = &quot;a little better&quot;; same = response unchanged; worsening = &quot;a little worse&quot;; significant worsening = &quot;a lot worse&quot;.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Symptom Complex Severity (MSCS) Score at 4 Hours Post-dose</title>
        <description>The Mean Symptom Complex Severity (MSCS) score is a validated, comprehensive point-in-time measure of symptom severity. At baseline and 4 hours, patients rated the severity on a categorical scale (0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) for symptoms at each affected anatomical location. Ratings were averaged to obtain the MSCS score. A decrease in MSCS score reflected an improvement in symptoms; clinically meaningful improvement was indicated by a reduction in the score of 0.30 or more.</description>
        <time_frame>baseline, 4 hours post-dose</time_frame>
        <population>Patients were excluded from the analysis if they did not have data for the endpoint being analyzed. Reasons for patients being excluded are for ecallantide: 1 patient treated for severe upper airway compromise; for placebo: 3 patient treated for severe upper airway compromise and 3 patients with missing 4-hour data. Best score=0.0; worst score=3.0.</population>

        <description>Treatment Outcome Score (TOS) is a validated, comprehensive measure of symptom response to treatment. At 4 hours , patient assessment of response characterized by their change from baseline in symptom severity and collected by anatomic site of attack involvement, was recorded on a categorical scale (significant improvement [100; best value]to significant worsening [-100; worst value]). Clinically meaningful improvement was indicated by a TOS of 30 or higher.</description>

        <population>Patients were excluded from this analysis if they did not have data for the endpoint being analyzed. The reasons for patients being excluded from this analysis are for ecallantide: 1 patient treated for severe upper airway compromise and for placebo: 3 patient treated for severe upper airway compromise and 3 patients with missing 4-hour data.</population>
