      Primary Objective Comparison of the inhibition of the allergic response assessed by nasal
      provocation test after epicutanous pollen allergen administration and placebo epicutaneous
      administration.

      Secondary Objectives Comparison of the efficacy of the placebo with that of the epicutanous
      pollen allergen administration evaluated by visual analog symptom scales (nasal itching,
      sneezing, rhinorrhea, conjunctival redness, and lacrimation, lung symptoms ), Comparison of
      the inhibition of the allergic response assessed by skin prick test after epicutanous pollen
      allergen administration and placebo epicutaneous administration.
