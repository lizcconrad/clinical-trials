  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxaliplatin is a diaminocyclohexane platinum compound, with a mechanism of action similar to
      that of cisplatin. Oxaliplatin has a more manageable toxicity profile than cisplatin, with no
      renal toxicity and a lower incidence of hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities.
      Gemcitabine and oxaliplatin are both active in NSCLC with no overlapping toxicity.
      Preclinical studies show a synergistic effect of the gemcitabine-oxaliplatin combination. The
      combination of gemcitabine-oxaliplatin is attractive in NSCLC patients as it may improve the
      therapeutic index.

      The combination of gemcitabine-oxaliplatin is attractive in NSCLC patients as it may improve
      the therapeutic index. We are conducting a phase II study to evaluate the response rate and
      toxicity of the gemcitabine-oxaliplatin combination both given every 4 weeks in patients with
      advanced NSCLC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of NSCLC, Stage IV or selected stage IIIB (with
             positive pleural effusion or separate tumor nodules in the same lobe) according to the
             American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC).

          2. No prior chemotherapy.

          3. Prior radiation therapy is allowed as long as the irradiated area is not the only
             source of measurable disease.

          4. No other forms of cancer therapy, such as radiation, immunotherapy for at least 4
             weeks before the enrollment in study.

          5. Performance status of 0, 1, 2 on the ECOG criteria.

          6. At least one unidimensional measurable lesion meeting Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST. 2000).

          7. Estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          8. Patient compliance that allow adequate follow-up.

          9. Adequate organ function including the following:Adequate hematologic function: WBC
             count ≥ 3,500/uL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/uL, and platelet count ≥
             100,000/uLAdequate hepatic function: bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x UNL, ALT or AST ≤ 2.5 x
             UNL.Adequate renal function: creatinine ≤ 1.5mg/dL.

             trial. If male, use of an approved contraceptive method during the study and 3 months
             afterwards. Females with childbearing potential must have a urine negative hCG test
             within 7 days prior to the study registration.

          1. MI within preceding 6 months or symptomatic heart disease, including unstable angina,
             congestive heart failure or uncontrolled arrhythmia

          2. Serious concomitant infection including post obstructive pneumonia

          3. Second primary malignancy (except in situ carcinoma of the cervix or adequately
