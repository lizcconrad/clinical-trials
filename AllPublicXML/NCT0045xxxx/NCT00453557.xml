    <textblock>
      Growth hormone treatment in humans has been shown to decrease body fat. This study aims to
      determine what adipose tissue depots are affected by GH and what is the mechanism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Growth hormone (GH) replacement in GH deficient adults results in an improvement in metabolic
      status, an increase in lean body mass and a reduction in visceral adiposity. GH might also
      decrease visceral adiposity in obese adults that are not GH deficient.

      The objective of the study is to determine the effects of GH on the metabolic syndrome and
      visceral adiposity in men with low blood levels of IGF-1 and the durability of these effects
      after stopping GH therapy. We will use a double blind, placebo controlled 6 month
      intervention trial followed by a blinded follow-up period of 6 months. Thirty non-diabetic
      middle aged men with central adiposity (BMI &gt; 27 kg/m2, waist circumference &gt; 102 cm) will
      participate.
