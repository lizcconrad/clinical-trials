      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a peptide may help the body build an effective immune response
      to kill cancer cells. Colony-stimulating factors, such as GM-CSF, increase the number of
      white blood cells and platelets found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Giving vaccine
      therapy together with GM-CSF may be an effective treatment for acute myeloid leukemia. It is
      not yet known whether giving vaccine therapy together with GM-CSF is more effective than
      giving placebo together with GM-CSF in treating acute myeloid leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying vaccine therapy and GM-CSF to see how
      well they work compared with a placebo and GM-CSF in treating patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia in remission.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare improvement of overall survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated
           with PR1 leukemia peptide vaccine and sargramostim (GM-CSF) vs placebo vaccine and
           GM-CSF.

      Secondary

        -  Compare improvement of relapse-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare remission duration in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare immune response, as measured by PR1-HLA-A2 tetramer assay, in patients treated
           with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to age and complete remission (CR) (≥ 18 years of age and in second CR vs ≥ 55
      years of age and in first CR), type of acute myeloid leukemia (de novo vs secondary), and
      cytogenetics (unfavorable vs favorable and intermediate). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive PR1 leukemia peptide vaccine and sargramostim (GM-CSF)
           subcutaneously (SC).

        -  Arm II: Patients receive placebo vaccine and GM-CSF SC.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 244 patients will be accrued for this study.
