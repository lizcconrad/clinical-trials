      The purpose of this study is to identify factors that contribute to higher mortality rates
      among blacks and Hispanics with diffuse parenchymal lung disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that both socioeconomic and biological factors may contribute to race- and
      ethnicity-based health disparities. Black and Hispanic Americans have worse access to
      healthcare services and tend to receive care from physicians who cannot themselves access the
      same services for their patients that physicians who care for white patients can. These
      factors may play important roles in the development and maintenance of health disparities. In
      addition, biological differences may contribute to disparities. We propose to identify
      factors that explain survival disparities in a group of lung diseases called diffuse
      parenchymal lung diseases (DPLDs), including a severe form of DPLD called idiopathic
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We will follow patients with DPLD at our center and measure both
      social and biological factors to try to identify the factors that lead to survival
      disparities between races. Results of this study will be used to design clinical trials aimed
      at reducing these disparities.
