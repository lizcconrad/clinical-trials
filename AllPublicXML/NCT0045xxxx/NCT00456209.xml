  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phenomenological study is to discover and illuminate the experiences of
      adolescents in the treatment process of cancer and the meanings they attach to these
      experiences, while maintaining their daily routines. The focus area of interest lies in the
      impact side-effects (psychological and physical) which these treatments may have on an
      individual's ability to participate with peers, maintain social activities, and be involved
      in daily occupation(s).

      This study will explore the following research questions: 1. How do adolescent patients in
      the treatment process of cancer perceive and describe their experience of engaging in
      occupational routines? 2. What effect does the treatment process of cancer have on an
      adolescent's ability to participate in life situations such as creating and maintaining
      relationships with family, friends, peers, students, or people with similar backgrounds?

      By doing this study, researchers hope to gain information so that occupational therapists can
      increase the profession's present body of knowledge and better understand these individuals
      at a transitional period in their lives.
