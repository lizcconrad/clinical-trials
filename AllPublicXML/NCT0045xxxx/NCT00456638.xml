    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether epidural Depodur alleviates the pain of
      OP-CABG surgery. This includes pain associated with sternotomy, retraction, dissection and
      other tissue insults, as well as the induced inflammatory system and effects from prolonged
      ventilation in the ICU setting.
