  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study concern a prospective cohort pf patients with latent prostate cancer. We study the
      specific survival at 10 years of patients who accept an active control.Patients inclusion are
      realized in 2 stages:

        -  patient with inclusion criteria (PSA &lt; 10 ng/ml, clinical stage T1c or T2a, Gleason &lt; or
           = 6) are registered if they accept a second prostate biopsy in a 3 months delay

        -  after analyse of second biopsy in central laboratory and confirmation of latent prostate
           biopsy, patients are included if they accept active control Included patients will have
           1 biopsy by years the first two years and then 1 biopsy each 2 years during 8 years.

      If progression of cancer happens during the 10 years control, active control will be stopped
      and patient will be treated by surgery and chemotherapy.
