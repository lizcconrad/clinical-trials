  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' rationale was to evaluate whether a 64-slice CT scanner allows accurate
      measurement of computed tomographic changes in coronary artery flow profiles and whether CT
      flow measurements are suitable for classifying the significance and hemodynamic relevance of
      a stenosis and thereby supplement as a functional parameter for morphological stenosis
      analysis.

      A total of 50 patients prospectively underwent computed tomography coronary angiography
      (CTCA) in a multidetector CT scanner (Brilliance 64, Philips) Â± 1 day before or after
      invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Immediately thereafter, 2 radiologists reviewed the
      imaging data to detect any vessel segments with morphology poorly evaluable by CTCA. A
      locally constant cyclical measurement was acquired in these coronary arteries in breath-hold
      technique during the passage of a 50ml bolus of contrast media. For analysis, time-density
      curves of the bolus passage were registered in the coronary artery and the aorta (internal
      reference), the up-slopes were determined and correlated with each other. The results were
      compared with the ICA findings.
