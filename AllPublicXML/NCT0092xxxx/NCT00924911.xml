    <textblock>
      Part 1 of this study will assess the relative bioavailability of GSK1322322 administered as
      one of three investigational tablets compared to powder in a bottle formulation.
      Pharmacokinetics of these three tablets will be evaluated and the investigation tablet with
      the optimal PK profile will be progressed to Part 2. In Part 2 the investigational tablet
      selected from Part 1 will be coadministered with food alone, an H2 blocker alone, or an H2
      blocker given in combination with ascorbic acid to evaluate the effect on GSK1322322
      pharmacokinetics. Plasma GSK1322322 PK profile, safety, and tolerability will be assessed
      from each dose group.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the
             protocol Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg and body mass index between
             18.5-29.9 kg/m2 inclusive.

          -  QTcB less than 450 msec; or QTc less than 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch
             Block on Screening ECG.

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5xULN (isolated
             bilirubin greater than 1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct
             bilirubin less than 35%)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).
