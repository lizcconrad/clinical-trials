  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that 5-aza and lenalidomide act synergistically in MDS and
      AML patients with chromosomal abnormalities involving monosomy 5 or del5q. Therefore, this
      phase I study will investigate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide in
      combination with a fixed dose of 5-aza in this patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytogenetics are the main predictors of outcome in patients with AML. In fact, a monosomy 5
      or del (5q) as single aberration are poor prognostic markers. Overall, the complete response
      rate for conventionally treated patients with newly-diagnosed AML with chromosome 5
      abnormalities is about 31% to 37 % and all patients rapidly relapse if not rescued by
      allogeneic HSCT. The situation is almost similar in patients with high-risk MDS.Vidaza® has
      been shown in clinical trials to achieve remission rates in about 29% (CR+PR) of the patients
      while a total of 49% achieve improvement of blood counts.Revlimid® is also able to achieve
      complete remissions in advanced MDS and even overt leukemia with or without chromosome 5
      abnormalities. Nevertheless, response rates are lower compared to low-risk MDS (IPSS
      Low/INT-1). Therefore, Revlimid® seems to be too weak as a single agent, but a promising
      compound for a combination therapy.
