      This study is a prospective, open-label, multicentre study. Hundred eligible patients with
      stage III or IV non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with a
      peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count of &gt; 25,000/µL or any leukemia or lymphoma with
      plasma uric acid level of at least 8 mg/dL will be treated with rasburicase 0.20 mg/kg body
      weight intravenously for 4 days. The primary endpoints viz., the percentage of reduction in
      plasma uric acid at 4 hrs after uric acid-lowering therapy, plasma uric acid AUC 0-96 hr and
      incidence of adverse events will be assessed during 11 days study period.
