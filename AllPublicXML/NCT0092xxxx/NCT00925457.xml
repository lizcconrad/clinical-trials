    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective observational study is to obtain information to confirm or
      contradict the results of prior studies on domperidone and sudden cardiac death. The
      population studied are the Saskatchewan residents who used domperidone or another type of
      medication known as a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) between 1990 and 2005. Information will be
      collected from various sources including the Saskatchewan Health (SH) database and Cancer
      Registry.

      The purpose of this population-based, observational study is to evaluate the combined risk of
      serious ventricular arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythm) and sudden cardiac death in users of
      domperidone (a medication used to treat certain gastrointestinal disorders) compared with
      users of proton pump inhibitors (another group of medications used to reduce gastric or
      stomach acid production. The study will be conducted using patient information from
      Saskatchewan Health (SH) who had recorded dispensings of domperidone or a PPI from 1990
      through 2005. The first objective of the study is to estimate the combined relative risk of
      the occurrence of a particular type of irregular heart rhythm known as serious ventricular
      arrhythmia (SVA) and sudden cardiac death SCD (defined as a natural death from an unexpected
      circulatory arrest) during current use of domperidone or current use of proton pump
      inhibitors (PPIs) as compared with nonuse in a diabetic population. The second objective is
      to estimate the combined relative risk of SVA and SCD during current use of domperidone or
      current use of PPIs as compared with nonuse in a non-diabetic population. Study drug dosing
      information not required for Observational Study
