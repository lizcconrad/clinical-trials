      Method/design:

      Design: Multicenter intervention study(before-after), quasi-experimental, prospective, with a
      control group and 12 month's follow-up

      Setting: 21 primary Health Care Centres in Barcelona (Spain)

      Sample: 801 patients (≥ 40 years old) with a register of COPD diagnostic,with one visit
      motivated by COPD during 2003 and that accept to participate at the study, after having read
      and signed the informed consent.

      Intervention: The program includes giving clinical results to the health care workers(doctor
      and nurse), from the medical records and interview. A training course (20h)that deals with
      aspects related to GPC, motivational interview and health education (tobacco, inhalers,
      alimentation, exercise and physiotherapy).

      Main variables: socio-demographic characteristics, quality of life, dyspnea, pharmacological
      treatment, exacerbations and hospital admissions, evaluation of inhalers technique, tobacco
      consumption, lifestyles and health resources used.

      Measures: quality of life was evaluated with the Saint george's Respiratory Questionnaire
      (SGRQ) and dyspnea with the modified scale of the Medical Research Council (MRC). The
      variables are obtained at the beginning of the intervention and at the end (12 months after).
      Information about possible changes in lifestyle is gathered during the follow-up visits.
