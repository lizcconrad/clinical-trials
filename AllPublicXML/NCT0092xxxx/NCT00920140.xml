  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MEK111759 is a dose-escalation, Phase I/II, open-label study to determine the recommended
      dose and regimen for the orally administered MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 in subjects with
      relapsed or refractory leukemias. The recommended dose and regimen will be selected based on
      the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles. This study will identify the
      maximum tolerated and recommended Phase II doses using a dose-escalation procedure. Dose
      escalations will continue based on predefined parameters until a maximum tolerated dose is
      established. In Phase II, the clinical efficacy of GSK1120212 in subjects with relapsed or
      refractory leukaemias (AML, MDS or CMML) will be determined.

    <time_frame>From the start of the study drug until the final study visit (up to approximately 407 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant (par.) or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury. Refer to the general Adverse AE/SAE module for a complete list of AEs and SAEs.</description>

    <time_frame>From the start of the study drug until the final study visit (up to approximately 407 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Hematology and clinical chemistry data were summarized according to National Cancer Institutes (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade, version 3.0. Grade 1, Mild; Grade 2, Moderate; Grade 3, Severe; Grade 4, Life-threatening or disabling; Grade 5, Death.

    <description>Overall response rate (ORR=CR+CRp+Marrow CR+MLFS+PR) was calculated from the investigator's assessment of response recorded within the first eight weeks of treatment. CR includes complete remission. Complete remission is a state in which the participant must be free of all symptoms related to leukemia and have an absolute neutrophil count &gt;=1 x 10^9/L, platelet count &gt;=100 x 10^9/L, and normal marrow differential (&lt;=5% blasts). PR includes partial remission. Partial remission is a state in which the participant has a CR with 6 to 25% abnormal cells in the marrow or 50% decrease in bone marrow blasts. CRp is as per CR but platelet count &lt;100 x 10^9/L. MLFS is a state in which the participant has a normal marrow differential (&lt;5% blasts), neutrophil, and platelet counts are not considered.</description>

An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury.

        <description>Hematology and clinical chemistry data were summarized according to National Cancer Institutes (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade, version 3.0. Grade 1, Mild; Grade 2, Moderate; Grade 3, Severe; Grade 4, Life-threatening or disabling; Grade 5, Death. Data are presented for only those parameters for which an increase to Grade 3 or Grade 4 occurred. Hematology tests where the toxicity grade is defined by NCI-CTCAE includes hemoglobin, international normalized ratio (INR), lymphocytes, total neutrophils, platelet count, and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Participants with missing baseline grades were assumed to have a baseline grade of 0. Only those participants (par.) with laboratory values for worst-case on-therapy (defined as the worst shift that occurred at any time during the treatment period) are presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With a Change From Baseline Grade to Grade 3 and 4 for the Indicated Clinical Chemistry Parameters by Dose</title>
        <description>Hematology and clinical chemistry data were summarized according to NCI-CTCAE grade, version 3.0. Grade 1, Mild; Grade 2, Moderate; Grade 3, Severe; Grade 4, Life-threatening or disabling; Grade 5, Death. Data are presented for only those parameters for which an increase to Grade 3 or Grade 4 occurred. Clinical chemistry tests where the toxicity grade is defined by NCI-CTCAE includes albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, calcium, creatinine, glucose, bicarbonate, potassium, magnesium, sodium, and phosphorus. Participants with missing Baseline grades were assumed to have a Baseline grade of 0. Only those participants (par.) with laboratory values for worst-case on-therapy are presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With a Change From Baseline in Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure by Dose</title>
        <description>Change from Baseline in systolic blood pressure (SBP) is categorized as: Grade 0 (&lt;120 millimeters of mercury [mmHg]), Grade 1 (120-139 mmHg), Grade 2 (140-159 mmHg), and Grade 3/4 (&gt;=160 mmHg). Change from Baseline in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is categorized as: Grade 0 (&lt;80 mmHg), Grade 1 (80-89 mmHg), Grade 2 (90-99 mmHg), and Grade 3/4 (&gt;=100 mmHg). An increase is defined as an increase in the CTCAE grade relative to the Baseline grade. Participants with missing Baseline values are assumed to have a Baseline value of grade 0. Only those participants (par.) with blood pressure values for worst-case on-therapy are presented.</description>

One Phase 2 par. was incorrectly dosed (received &lt;2 mg [0.5 mg]); thus, 6 par. receiving GSK1120212 &lt;2 mg OD were analyzed.</population>

        <description>Overall response rate (ORR=CR+CRp+Marrow CR+MLFS+PR) was calculated from the investigator’s assessment of response recorded within the first eight weeks of treatment. CR includes complete remission. Complete remission is a state in which the participant must be free of all symptoms related to leukemia and have an absolute neutrophil count &gt;=1 x 10^9/L, platelet count &gt;=100 x 10^9/L, and normal marrow differential (&lt;=5% blasts). PR includes partial remission. Partial remission is a state in which the participant has a CR with 6 to 25% abnormal cells in the marrow or 50% decrease in bone marrow blasts. CRp is as per CR but platelet count &lt;100 x 10^9/L. MLFS is a state in which the participant has a normal marrow differential (&lt;5% blasts), neutrophil, and platelet counts are not considered.</description>
