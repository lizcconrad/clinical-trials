    <textblock>
      Conventional cardiac operations are performed with median sternotomy, which is related to
      great wound, morbidities, longer duration in hospital and most significantly, cosmetic
      problems. The investigators invested a new minimally invasive cardiac operation method
      totally under video-endoscope and peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass. The investigators'
      hypothesis is that this new minimally method could provide better cosmetic effects to the
      patients, and also relate to shorter postoperative hospital stay and better recovery.

    <description>Cardiac operations are performed with three keyholes in the right chest wall. Video images are obtained by digital thoracoscope through one hole. Intracardiac lesions are accessed with surgical instruments and repaired through the other two holes. Cardiopulmonary bypass is set up with femoral cannulations. Moderate system hypothermic is applied for the operation. Cardiac arrest is achieved with ascending aorta clamp and cardioplegia solution delivery through aortic root cannulation. After the intracardiac lesions are repaired, aortic clamp is removed, and the heart is reperfused to restore its spontaneous rhythm. After the patients are rewarmed to normal temperature, CPB is discontinued. Femoral cannulations are removed, and surgical wounds are closed.</description>
