  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tetra-ataxiametric posturography is based on the measurement and computerized elaboration of
      electronic signals emitted by four footplates, one for each heel and toe, respectively. These
      are sensitive to vertical pressure produced by a subject standing straight but in various
      positions (feet parallel, in tandem, eyes closed, on pads, etc.). The method yields
      additional parameters not obtained by the traditional monoplate stabilometers, namely,
      weight-distribution patterns and correlation among six combinations of paired outputs from
      the two heels, two toes, heel/toe of each foot, and the two diagonals (tetra-ataxiametric
      synchronizations). Comparing age-matched learning disabled, mentally retarded, autistic, and
      hearing impaired (with and without labyrinthine hypofunction) with normal children,
      significant and clinically meaningful differences were detected between the
      Tetra-ataxiametric measures of stability, interaction between Fourier Spectral Power Ranges
      of body sway, weight distributions, and synchronizations of toe parts. The same parameters
      correlated significantly with cognitive school readiness in normal populations. While the
      stability and spectral quotients show significant developmental changes, weight distribution
      and toe synchronisations are stable from 5 years onwards. The method is suitable for young
      subjects and attractive to children who may ordinarily be reluctant to cooperate, such as the
      autistic ones. The equipment is portable and tests can be conveniently carried out in a
      child's familiar educational setting.

      Recently a new pediatric software was introduced for the TETRAX device. The goal of the
      present study is to create normative data for children starting at preschool age using the
      newly developed software. Four hundred and 80 children between the ages of 5 and 12 years old
      will be examined following informed consent from the children and their legal guardian.
