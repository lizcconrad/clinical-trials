  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      200 patients with post partum anemia will be randomised to receive either intravenous iron
      (intervention group) or peroral iron (control group).

      The hypothesis is that intravenous iron supplementation is superior to standard peroral iron.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi center phase 3 trial, comprising 3 medium sized obstetrical units in
      Norway.

      The amount of iron given to the intervention group is calculated according to the modified
      Ganzoni formula. The control group is given the standard regime of 200 mg ferro sulphate
      daily. In both groups, treatment start at inclusion, within 48 h of delivery.

      The sample size was based on power calculations: About 200 participants are required to
      detect a difference of 0.5 g/dl between the groups (with 80 % power).

      Randomization is performed by use of opaque envelopes. An electronic CRF is applied.
      Laboratory analysis are provided by a recognized Swedish biochemical laboratory.

      Apart from hemoglobin and the common iron parameters, the serum concentration of soluble
      ferritin receptors will be analyzed, as well as hepcidin levels.
