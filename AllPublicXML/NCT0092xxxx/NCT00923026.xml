  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed experimental therapies that involve taking white blood
      cells from patients' tumor or from their blood, growing them in the laboratory in large
      numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient.

      Objective:

      This study will allow patients to be followed for up to 15 years following treatment on an
      NCI Surgery Branch Gene Therapy Trial as required by the FDA.

      Eligibility:

      Patients must have been enrolled on an NCI Surgery Branch Gene Therapy Protocol

      Design

      Patients will be followed with a physical examination and blood tests for up to 15 years as
      required by the FDA

      BACKGROUND:

        -  Patients receiving care at the NIH Clinical Center are required to be enrolled in a
           clinical protocol

        -  Following participation in a treatment protocol, it may be in the best interest of the
           patient to continue to be followed at the Clinical Center

        -  The NCI Surgery Branch conducts clinical trials utilizing gene transfer. The current FDA
           requirements for long term follow up are up to fifteen years for some products. As this
           time period is frequently longer than studies are expected to be open, a protocol is
           necessary to ensure the necessary follow up of these subjects

      OBJECTIVES:

      -To provide long term follow up of patients previously enrolled on treatment protocols in the
      NCI Surgery Branch

      ELIGIBILITY:

      -Enrollment on an NCI Surgery Branch treatment protocol

      DESIGN:

      -Patients will undergo physical exams, laboratory evaluation, imaging or phone follow up as
      required by the treatment protocol and/or as clinically indicated.
