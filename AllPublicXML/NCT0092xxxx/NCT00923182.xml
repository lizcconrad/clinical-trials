      The primary objective of this study is to confirm the safety profile of alemtuzumab 30 mg
      (the US/European Union (EU) approved dose) in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory
      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).

             disease with evidence of progression)

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function

          -  More than 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy, including
