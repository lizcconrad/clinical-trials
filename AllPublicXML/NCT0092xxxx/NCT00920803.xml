  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of SRT501 (5.0
      g) in subjects with colorectal cancer and hepatic metastases when administered once daily for
      14 days.

      The purpose is to also characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of SRT501 (5.0 g) by
      assessing levels of SRT501 and metabolites in blood, urine, bile and normal and malignant
      metastatic tissues in subjects with colorectal cancer and hepatic metastases when
      administered once daily for 14 days.

      The secondary purpose is to examine the pharmacodynamics of SRT501 activity in both normal
      and malignant tissue samples, including blood and/or bodily fluids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, inpatient/outpatient study to assess
      the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of SRT501 in subjects diagnosed with
      colorectal cancer and hepatic metastases. Fifteen subjects aged 18 years of age and older who
      fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in this study. Ten subjects, if
      eligible, will be randomized to receive SRT501 and 5 subjects, if eligible, will be
      randomized to receive placebo. Subjects will sign the informed consent form prior to any
      study-related procedures. If eligible, subjects will consent to receive 5.0 g of SRT501 or
      placebo, to be administered once daily as an oral reconstituted powder, for 14 days at the
      same time each day. On Days 1 and 2, SRT501 or placebo will be administered approximately
      15-30 minutes following the consumption of a standardized breakfast to allow for PK sample
      collection. On all other days, SRT501 or placebo will be administered approximately 15-30
      minutes following the consumption of the evening meal. Following the course of SRT501 or
      placebo administration, subjects will undergo scheduled surgical removal of their metastatic
      liver disease as well as non-diseased tissue and these samples will be evaluated for SRT501
      concentrations and pharmacodynamic markers of neoplastic activity (such as cell
      differentiation, apoptosis, proliferation, etc.). Due to scheduling and surgical
      availability, subjects can receive SRT501 or placebo for a minimum of 10 days and a maximum
      of 21 days. If diseased colon tissue is also scheduled to be removed during resection, both
      diseased and normal colon tissue will also be collected for analysis. Participants will be
      required to return to the study center on Day 2 for a 24-hour PK sample and the evening prior
      to their scheduled surgical resection as well as per the Institution's standards of care for
      recovery following the surgical procedure.

             dosing.

          -  Be amenable to surgical resection of the hepatic metastases.

          -  Be clear of any history of HIV 1 and 2 and hepatitis B and C.

          -  Have a normal 12-lead ECG or an ECG with abnormality considered to be clinically
             insignificant.

          -  Have the ability to communicate with the investigative site staff in a manner
             sufficient to carry out all protocol procedures as described.

          -  Female subject is either post-menopausal, surgically sterilized or be a woman of child
             bearing potential (WCBP) who has documented use of clinically prescribed hormonal
             contraceptives use consistently for three months prior to study entry. Females of
             child bearing potential, as well as their partners, must also use appropriate
             double-barrier birth control while participating in the study and for 28 days
             following the last dose of study drug. If a woman of child bearing potential has a
             surgically sterile partner, then that female is permitted to enroll if double-barrier
             birth control is practiced.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a history / evidence of allergy or hypersensitivity to resveratrol.

          -  Subject has had a major illness (other than colorectal cancer) in the past three
             months or any significant ongoing chronic medical illness that the Investigator would
             deem unfavorable for enrollment.

          -  Subject has inadequate organ function at the Screening visit as defined by the
             following laboratory values:

               -  Hemoglobin ≤10.0 g/dL

               -  Subjects with lower hemoglobin may be included at the Investigator's discretion
                  if the cause of anemia is due to bleeding from their tumor and post transfusion
                  hemoglobin ≥10g/dL prior to dosing.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≤1500 x 10^6/L

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) ≥2.5 x the upper limit of the normal range (ULN)

               -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≥2.5 x ULN

               -  Creatinine ≥ 140 umol/L

               -  Albumin ≤3 g/dL

          -  Subject has a history of or current gastro-intestinal diseases influencing drug
             absorption, with the exception of an appendectomy and/or colorectal cancer.

          -  Subject has liver impairment as indicated by total bilirubin ≥2 x ULN, unless clearly

             ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any ECG
             abnormality at Screening has to be documented by the investigator as not medically
             relevant.

          -  Excessive alcohol intake (more than UK recommended limit - 28 or 21 units per week for
             men or women respectively).

          -  Subject has uncontrolled brain metastases or central nervous system disease.

          -  Subject has participated in a clinical trial within the past three months.
