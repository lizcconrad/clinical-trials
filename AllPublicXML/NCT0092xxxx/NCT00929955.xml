  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is some evidence that anti-inflammatory treatment may have beneficial effects in
      schizophrenia and major depression. Cox-2 inhibitors have been tested in preliminary clinical
      trials for schizophrenia and depression, showing favourable effects compared to placebo
      (Muller and Schwarz et al 2009).

      Statins were introduced as cholesterol-lowering agents but have found much wider usage. They
      are anti-inflammatory agents and thus similar to the Cox-2 inhibitors, which have shown some
      ability as adjuncts to improve the symptoms of schizophrenia in preliminary studies. The
      statins are also known to decrease C-reactive protein (CRP), which has been shown in an
      SMRI-funded study to be elevated in a study of individuals with schizophrenia. Fan et al
      (2007) demonstrated in a small study in patients with schizophrenia that higher than normal
      levels of CRP (&gt;0.50 mg/dl) was associated with marked negative symptoms and higher total
      PANSS scores.

      Ondansetron is a serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonist that is generic and widely used to
      prevent nausea and vomiting in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer. GSK did a small
      study on it as an antipsychotic in the 1980s. Since then, several small studies have
      suggested that it is effective as an adjunct drug in improving the symptoms of schizophrenia.

      Statins are widely used in schizophrenia sufferers, particularly those taking second
      generation antipsychotics, to treat hypercholesterolemia. Both drugs are well tolerated and
      their side effect profiles well understood.

      We propose to conduct a feasibility study in patients with chronic schizophrenia to explore
      the adjunct use of simvastatin and ondansetron on positive, negative and general
      psychopathology in comparisons to treatment as usual (TAU) over a 12 week period.
