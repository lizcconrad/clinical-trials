      Overall study design:

      This study is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter postmarket clinical follow-up study
      with two study arms using the two shoulder prosthesis PROMOS™ STANDARD (group A) and PROMOS
      REVERSE™ (group B). The study will collect efficacy and safety data over 10 years.

      Primary objective of the study:

      The primary objective is to quantify patient benefit after primary total shoulder
      arthroplasty with the modular PROMOS™ shoulder system in a multicenter cohort study (real
      world approach). Patient benefit will be quantified using objective and validated subjective
      measures of function, activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QoL).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Rate of implant related findings like radiological loosening of the glenoid and
           complications like intraoperative stem fissures

        -  Prosthesis survival at common time points, e.g. 5 and 10 years
