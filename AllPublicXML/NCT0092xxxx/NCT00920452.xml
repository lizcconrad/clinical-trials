      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and document appropriate clinical performance of the
      new 4-SITE Header / Lead interface in the TELIGEN 100 HE 4-SITE (VR and DR) implantable
      cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) PGs (Models F103; F111), the COGNIS 100 HE 4-SITE cardiac
      resynchronization therapy ICD (CRT-D) PG (Model P108) when connected to any of the RELIANCE
      Quadripolar (4-SITE) defibrillation leads.

      Appropriate clinical performance of system components of the 4-SITE systems other than the
      new 4-SITE header / lead interface has been evaluated and documented already in the
      previously conducted COGNIS and TELIGEN 100 HE FIELD FOLLOWING STUDY, The COGENT-4 Field
      Following Study.

      Data collected may be used to support international regulatory submissions including the FDA
      and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.

        Study Population: Patients should be selected from the investigator's general population
        indicated for an ICD or CRT-D Implantation. The investigator has the responsibility of
        screening all potential patients and selecting those who meet study eligibility criteria.
