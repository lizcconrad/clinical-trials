  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the dose of aflibercept to be further studied in
      combination with irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/isovorin (FOLFIRI) in Japanese patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Secondary objectives of this study are to assess the safety profile of aflibercept, to
      determine the pharmacokinetics of aflibercept, to make a preliminary assessment of antitumor
      effects.
