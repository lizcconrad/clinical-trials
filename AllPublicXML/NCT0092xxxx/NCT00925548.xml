  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EMD Serono has decided to permanently terminate the trial EMR 200038-010 (STRIDE) in the
      indication of breast cancer following the clinical hold on the investigational new drug
      application for tecemotide (L-BLP25).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the addition of the experimental mucinous
      glycoprotein 1 (MUC1) antigen-specific cancer immunotherapy tecemotide (L-BLP25) to hormonal
      treatment is effective in prolonging progression-free survival in postmenopausal women with
      endocrine-sensitive inoperable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.

Trial outcome Index (TOI) was calculated by the sum of the physical well-being (PWB), functional well-being (FWB), and breast cancer scale (BCS) subscales of FACT-B. Total score of subscores or TOI is calculated from each score of question. Higher score means better and lower score means worthier. Score range; 0-28 in PWB; 0-28 in SWB; 0-24 in EWB; 0-28 in FWB; 0-36 in BCS; 0-92 in TOI.</description>

    <measure>European Questionnaire-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 9, 20, 32, 44 and end of trial visit</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D questionnaire is a measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value. The optional part of the questionnaire was not applied. EQ-5D defines health in terms of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The 5 items are combined to generate health profiles. These profiles were to be converted to a continuous single index score using a one to one matching. The lowest possible score is -0.59 and the highest is 1.00. Higher scores on the EQ-5D represent a better quality of life (QoL) and lower scores on the EQ-5D represent a worst QoL.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D questionnaire is a measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value. The optional part of the questionnaire was not applied. EQ-5D defines health in terms of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The 5 items are combined to generate health profiles. These profiles were to be converted to a continuous single index score using a one to one matching. The lowest possible score is -0.59 and the highest is 1.00. Higher scores on the EQ-5D represent a better quality of life (QoL) and lower scores on the EQ-5D represent a worst QoL.</description>
