      This is a multicenter, follow-up study in up to 191 subjects with metastatic melanoma who
      were previously enrolled and treated in ipilimumab studies MDX010-02, MDX010-08, and
      MDX010-15. The purpose of this study is to 1) collect the date and cause of death, if known,
      for all deceased subjects who participated in any of the specified studies; 2) collect the
      date of progression for subjects who completed the studies with stable disease or better; and
      3) prospectively follow all surviving subjects to determine progression-free and overall
      survival.
