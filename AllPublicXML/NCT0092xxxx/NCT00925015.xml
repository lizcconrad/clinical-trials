    <measure>Number of Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks of Cycle 1 treatment (up to 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>To be declared a DLT an adverse experience had a causality related to study therapy. DLTs could be adverse experiences possibly, probably, or definitely related to study therapy by the Investigator, and included the following : Grade 4 neutropenia lasting &gt;= 5 days; Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with fever &gt;38.5°C; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia; Grade 3 or Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity, except inadequately treated diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, rash, hyperglycemia, and transient abnormality of electrolytes. Anemia, infusion reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, and adverse experiences not-related to study therapy did not qualify as DLTs.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 4 weeks after last drug treatment (up to Day 293)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR's product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR's product, is also an AE.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Human Anti-Human Antibody (HAHA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks after the last administration of dalotuzumab (up to 349 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Sera were collected from participants prior to administration of the first dose of study drug, every 6 weeks during the study period, then 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks post-treatment. A sandwich format enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the presence of HAHA in serum.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR’s product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR’s product, is also an AE.</description>
