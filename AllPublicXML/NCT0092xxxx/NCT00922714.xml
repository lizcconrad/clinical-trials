    <textblock>
      This is a prospective double-blinded placebo-controlled block randomized study in intensive
      care patients comparing intravenous glutamine supplementation to placebo. The hypothesis is
      an improvement of clinical outcome. The primary endpoint is a reduction in the Sequential
      Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on day 7 of treatment.

      This is a prospective double-blinded placebo-controlled block randomised study in intensive
      care patients comparing intravenous glutamine supplementation (0.285 g/kg body weight/24 h)
      to placebo. Inclusion criteria are patients treated for more than 3 days. Primary endpoint is
      a reduction in SOFA-score on day 7 of treatments. Secondary endpoints are: ICU-mortality,
      6-months mortality, length of ICU stay, organ failure free days as well as reduction in
      SOFA-score on day 10 of treatment. Nutrition will be standardised so that not less than 80%
      of the target which is basal energy expenditure according to Harris &amp; Benedict is given
      daily. Enteral nutrition is preferred, but a combination of enteral and parenteral nutrition
      is recommended to achieve the nutritional target. For statistical comparison non-parametric
      rank order statistics will be used. To detect a 0.75-point difference in the reduction of
      SOFA-score on day 7 of treatment, a total of 1,000 patients will be needed.
