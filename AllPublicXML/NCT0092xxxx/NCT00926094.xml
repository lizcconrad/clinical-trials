    <textblock>
      Idiopathic Adhesive Capsulitis, Frozen Shoulder is a condition in which there is a limitation
      and significant pain at the shoulder and it is increases with shoulder movements. The causes
      are not clear. The prevalence of this condition is four times higher in diabetic patient
      compare to the general population.

      The relation between frozen shoulder and impaired glucose tolerance remain unclear.

      Our hypothesis is that patients with no diabetes and that suffer from frozen shoulder have a
      higher prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance than the general population age matched.
