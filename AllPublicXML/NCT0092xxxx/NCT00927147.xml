  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate efficacy and safety boron neutron capture therapy
      (BNCT) administered in combination with cetuximab in the treatment of head and neck cancer
      that has recurred locally following conventional cancer treatment (surgery and radiation
      therapy). Boron neutron capture therapy is a special form of radiation therapy, which is
      based on interaction between boron atoms taken up by the cancerous tissue and neutron
      irradiation. The boron atoms, located within cancer cells, may capture low-energy neutrons
      obtained from a nuclear accelerator, which results in splitting up (fission) of the boron
      atoms, and a high radiation effect within the tumor. Cetuximab is an antibody directed
      against certain proteins found on cancer cell surface (epidermal growth factor receptors).
      When administered immediately after BNCT, cetuximab may or may not improve treatment
      efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, non-randomized, non-comparative, open-label, phase I/II trial to
      determine safety and efficacy of BNCT in the treatment of nonoperable, irradiated, locally
      advanced cancers of the head and neck region. Patients will be treated with a single-fraction
      boronophenylalanine (BPA)-based BNCT. All patients will be evaluated for response using CT or
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      Neutron irradiation will first be planned based on the available tumor imaging examinations,
      following which the head and body position will be determined for irradiation, and head
      fixation will be prepared and tested. On the irradiation day 400 mg/m2 L-BPA-F will be
      infused intravenously over 2 hours. Cetuximab doses will be administered following completion
      of BNCT. The cetuximab doses will be escalated in cohorts of 3 patients.
