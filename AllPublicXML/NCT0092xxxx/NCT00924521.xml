  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whole grain intake beneficially affects body weight, body fat and glucose metabolism, and the
      investigators' previous work has shown that a high whole grain intake significantly reduced
      body fat in the abdominal region as measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)
      compared to a refined grain intake. Additional research is needed with regard to the
      mechanisms by which whole grains may affect visceral adiposity and the adipokines, which have
      been associated with risk for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Therefore the proposed
      study aims to address these issues and in addition, includes exploratory work with adipocytes
      in cell culture to evaluate the effects of whole grains on adipocyte function.

      Hypothesis:

      There will be a greater reduction in visceral adiposity, indicators of insulin resistance
      (HOMA score), improvement in inflammatory status and improvement in adipokine levels after
      six weeks of a weight stable period and after six weeks of weight loss in subjects consuming
      6-9 servings compared to 0 servings of whole grains per day.

    <textblock>
      Including whole grains as part of a heart-healthy diet has been shown to be beneficial in
      decreasing body weight and body fat. The beneficial effects of whole grains on body weight
      may be explained by the larger volume and relatively low energy density of whole grain food
      thus leading to increased satiation. Reducing visceral fat is of particular importance as
      visceral adiposity has been associated with increased risk for metabolic diseases and
      cardiovascular disease.

      The proposed study is a randomized, 2-parallel arm controlled feeding study. Subjects will be
      fed one of two weight maintenance diets (refined grain and whole grain) for 6 weeks, followed
      by a 6 week controlled weight loss period where subjects are fed the same diets, but at a
      reduced calorie level, designed to elicit weight loss (~2 lbs per week). Diets for both
      groups will have the same nutrient profile (percent of calories from fat, protein,
      carbohydrates, etc.); however, the whole grain (WG) group will substitute whole grains for
      refined grains in their grain intake (breads, tortillas, cereals, etc.). The WG group will be
      expected to take in 6-9 servings of whole grains per day on both diets. Plasma endpoints will
      be measured at baseline and at the end of the 6-week diet periods. Blood samples also will be
      taken at the mid-point of each period and held for analysis if deemed appropriate after
      initial data is reviewed. Endo-PAT will be conducted at baseline and at the end of each diet
      period as well as DEXA and MRI testing.

    <time_frame>Week 6 and 12 - End of diet period 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>To assess regional changes in body fat deposition, subjects will undergo a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan at baseline (beginning of study) and end of each intervention period. Waist circumference measurements also will be taken at this time to track how much fat is lost from the abdominal area of the body.</description>

    <description>Twelve-hour fasting blood samples (30ml) will be collected for analyses of plasma C-reactive protein and inflammatory cytokines. Blood samples obtained at baseline will be used to measure baseline values for study endpoints, whereas blood samples obtained at the end of each diet period will measure final endpoint values.</description>

    <measure>Endothelial Health</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 6 and week 14 - Baseline end of each diet period</time_frame>
    <description>Study subjects will undergo endothelial health assessment by EndoPAT analysis. The EndoPat procedure will occur while the subject is lying down in a relaxed state. Throughout the study, the inflation pressure of the EndoPAT device will be electronically set to 10mm Hg below diastolic BP. Testing begins with 10 min of rest. Following rest, baseline pulse amplitude is measured from each fingertip for 5 min. Next, arterial flow is interrupted for 5 min by a cuff placed on the forearm at an occlusion pressure of 250 mmHg. Following occlusion release, pulse amplitude recording continues for 5 min.</description>

    <description>The COSMED Fitmate is a state-of-the-art resting metabolic rate machine that takes accurate, quick readings of your oxygen use. Participants will lie quietly without moving for 30 minutes upon arrival. A mask will be placed around the nose and mouth and participant will be asked to remain still for another 15 min will resting metabolic rate is measured. The test provides valuable information about how much energy (calories) an individual burns in a 24-hour period. The test will take ~15 min to complete.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 14 - End of diet period 2</time_frame>
    <description>A subset of subjects will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in the abdominal region by standard protocols. Subjects will be placed in a prone position in the magnet with their arms stretched above their head. A series of 40-47 T1-weighed axial spin echo images, will be taken in the abdominal region using established body landmarks. Body compartment volumes for total abdominal and visceral adipose tissue, as well as muscle, will then be obtained by tissue integration analysis.</description>
