      The purpose of the study is to establish an overarching database of information containing
      historical, demographical, clinical, and intermediate and long-term outcome data from all
      William Beaumont Hospital (WBH) patients undergoing Cardiac Computed Tomographic Angiography
      (CCTA) testing for clinical or scientific reasons.

      The principal goal of his project is to enable the study investigators to organize WBH
      research activity in the field of CCTA by concentrating data from all the patients who allow
      use of their data in one organized, audited and securely stored database. It will allow the
      ability to collect retrospective and prospective data from a number of different clinical
      systems and securely maintain patient medical record numbers for the reference on future
      projects as well as identification of patients with multiple studies and multiple follow-ups.
