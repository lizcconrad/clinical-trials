      Introduction: Cardiac output is a key physiological parameter. Unfortunately, it is often
      difficult to measure without using invasive techniques with associated risk. The pulmonary
      artery catheter has, since its introduction, been considered the gold standard for the
      measurement of cardiac output in man. Unfortunately, pulmonary artery catheters have been
      associated with serious complications.1,2 Thoracic electrical bio-impedance (TEB) has been
      suggested as a possible non-invasive technique for the measurement of cardiac output. The
      accuracy and reliability of TEB has been evaluated multiple times with some studies
      demonstrating good correlation with thermodilution3-7 and others with poor
      correlation.6,8-15. TEB is not reliable in patients after cardiopulmonary bypass8,9, kidney
      transplants11, congestive heart failure16, pulmonary edema14, sepsis12, pregnancy15,
      abdominal surgery11,17, or critical illness13,14.

      One of the limitations of TEB is the signal to noise ratio. Commonly TEB systems use an
      alternating current (1 - 4 ma at 20-100 Khz) applied to the skin and have little control over
      the percentage of current passing through the vascular structures in the chest. Changes in
      the electrical impedance of the lungs with respiration change the percentage of the total
      current passing through blood containing structures. Finally, treating all of the blood
      containing structures in the chest as a single impedance to be measured, does not allow
      separation of the signal into its various components. A technique which stabilizes the
      percentage of current delivered to the target structure and records the electrical impedance
      signals directly from that target structure improves the accuracy and reliability of
      impedance based measurement of cardiac output.

      The Endotracheal Cardiac Output Monitor (ECOM) is a system which records the voltages
      produced by a current (2 ma 100 Khz) delivered to the tracheal mucosa by electrodes on an
      endotracheal tube. The proximity of the ascending aorta and trachea allows the design of a
      device that can optimize the current delivery and signal recording from impedance changes in
      the ascending aorta. This study will test the accuracy and efficacy of the ECOM system in
      anesthetized patients.

      Significance: A simple, inexpensive, continuous, non-invasive, accurate, reproducible method
      of measuring cardiac output in patients would reduce the need for pulmonary artery catheter
      measurements of cardiac output. Such a technique would allow the rapid diagnosis and
      treatment of hemodynamic instability in the critically ill patient. The maintenance of
      cardiac output is essential for the prevention of end organ injury which results in morbidity
      and mortality. A technique that accurately measured cardiac output would greatly assist the
      management of the critically ill patient.

      Methods:

      We propose to compare measurement of cardiac output made with the Conmed ECOM 6-3D
      endotracheal tube to those made with a pulmonary artery catheter using. We will do
      correlation studies of cardiac output against those performed using the standard
      thermodilution technique in patients, who in the normal course of their clinical care, are
      having cardiac outputs measured by the thermodilution technique. We will compare cardiac
      output measured by impedance cardiography to transit time measurements.

      These correlation studies will be done in the O.R. and intensive care units on patients
      scheduled for cardiac surgery who routinely have cardiac output measurements using the
      standard thermodilution method.

      Many different algorithms have been developed for the conversion of thoracic impedance
      signals into a calculation of cardiac output including Kubicek18 , Bernstein-Sramek19,
      Shmulewitz20, adaptive algorithms.20 Each of these algorithms requires some sort of
      empirically derived factor to convert from measurements of resistance into measurements of
      volume. The ECOM system uses an adaptive multi-parameter algorithm which allows for the
      reduction of between subject variability. We have derived the empiric fit for the porcine
      model but have not done so for patients. This study will be therefore divided into two
      components. The first data collection of 15 patients will provide the data for the empiric
      fit between the ECOM system and true cardiac output. The second set of 300 patients will be
      the test group for the algorithm.

        1. General Study Design

           Two Component Study: Two component study. The first section is a 15 patient study which
           will provide the data for the empiric fit between the ECOM signal and true cardiac
           output. The second section is a 300 patient study which will provide the test data for
           validation of the algorithm.

           Cardiac Output Measurements: Cardiac outputs measured by the impedance device will be
           compared with measurements from the thermodilution catheter. The primary comparison will
           be between ECOM measurements and the thermodilution measurement.

           Safety Data: No complications have been identified with ECOM system use in patients
           studied to date. Despite this safety profile, we would like to identify any potential
           problems with ECOM tube use. These problems could potentially include tracheal stenosis,
           laryngeal injury, vocal cord injury, and changes in the voice. We have looked for these
           complications with clinical history and follow up. We have also included a more
           extensive post operative interview to look for any airway injury.

        2. Methods of Data Analysis

           Primary outcome comparison will be the correlation between thermodilution cardiac output
           and ECOM impedance measurements. Both Linear regression and Bland-Altman statistics of
           thermodilution cardiac output measurements versus impedance cardiography will be
           performed. Significance will be at p &lt; 0.05.

           Power Calculations:

           A sample size of 15 patients gives us a 90% power to show a correlation R2 of 0.75. In
           the ECOM porcine study we have an R2 of 0.77 to 0.84. The 300 patient second section
           will give us sufficient patient variability (large, small, male, female, young, old,
           aortic atherosclerosis, aortic regurgitation) to assess the technique across a wide
           spectrum of patients.

        3. Subject Selection

             1. Who and Why:

                Patients scheduled for cardiac surgery using extracorporeal circulation and median
                sternotomy will be consented. As part of their routine care for cardiac surgery,
                these patients will be intubated and pulmonary artery catheters placed. The
                measurements proposed in this study will therefore add little additional risk.
                Study patients will be intubated with an endotracheal tube which will allow
                endotracheal electrode measurements (ECOM 6-3D). Thermodilution cardiac output is
                routinely measured which will allow correlation between ECOM and thermodilution
                cardiac output measurements at minimal additional risk.

             2. Total Number/Number per Group Three hundred (300) patients undergoing cardiac
                surgery with median sternotomy will be studied.

        4. Subject Recruitment 1) Source: Patients scheduled for cardiac surgery at the San
           Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) hospital.

           2) Initial Contact Method: Prospective subjects will be approached by a study physician
           and consent obtained in the anesthesia pre-operative (preop) clinic prior to admission
           to the hospital, or in the hospital, if the patient is already an in-patient. Subjects
           will be approached by a study physician who will obtain consent.

        5. Consent Process and Documentation All consent will be obtained by study physicians who
           will explain the risks to the patient. The VA population will be used. No minors or
           non-English speakers will be included. No patients who are mentally incompetent to give
           consent will be included. Only signed, written, witnessed, informed consent will be
           used.

        6. Procedures 1) Study Procedures The patient will undergo routine monitor placement for
           surgery. Only patients who would have a pulmonary artery catheter placed for their
           surgery will be included. The following exceptions in standard anesthetic preparation,
           induction, maintenance, and emergence will be made.

           1. Extra ECG electrode patches will be placed.

           2. The endotracheal tube will have 7 silver doped plastic electrodes (Conmed ECOM Tube).

           3. Pulse oximetry will be measured and recorded using finger, nose, and forehead pulse
           oximetry measurements continuously. Pulse oximetry readings will be compared between the
           three sites and compared to cardiac output measurements. The percentage of time that a
           signal is obtained from the three sites will be calculated. The accuracy of pulse
           oximetry measurements will be compared to routinely drawn blood saturation measurements.
           Pulse oximetry is required during surgery. This addition will record the values obtained
           during routine care. If there are differences between brands or sensor types, those
           results may be reported.

           4. Cardiac output will be measured by iced-thermodilution and impedance cardiography .
           All personnel involved in the study understand that management of the patient will be
           done using the thermodilution derived cardiac output measurements only. The ECOM
           endotracheal cardiac output measurements are for research purposes only and will not be
           used in the management of the patient.

           5. ECOM Impedance cardiography will be measured in the ICU when routine thermodilution
           cardiac output measurements are made. Endotracheal impedance measurements (ECOM) will be
           continued until tracheal extubation. Correlation with thermodilution measurements will
           be stopped when either the endotracheal tube or the thermodilution catheter is removed
           (post op day 0 routinely).

           6. The patient will be interviewed and the medical records will be reviewed for any
           adverse outcomes from the study. Interviews will occur prior to hospital discharge, at
           one month post discharge, and yearly thereafter.

           7. The study will be conducted and data collected by the research team.

           2) Time: The study will be performed during surgery and the ICU stay. It should not
           delay surgery more than 5 minutes. Placement of the electrode patches is rapid. The
           endotracheal electrodes are attached to the endotracheal tube and placement of the tube
           is routine. Recording of cardiac outputs and impedance data will not delay surgery.
           Placement and removal of the aortic flow probe is rapid but may delay surgery for a few
           minutes. Data collected in the ICU will only be correlations between thermodilution and
           impedance data, since no transit time data can be collected outside the operating room.
           ICU data will not delay ICU or hospital discharge.

           3) Study Site: All studies will be performed at the VAMC either in the operating rooms
           or ICU.

        7. Risks/Discomforts

             1. The extra ECG electrode patches have minimal risk. All circuits will have
                electrical isolation and will be approved by biomedical engineering to avoid ground
                loops and leakage currents. There is always the chance of electrical burns or
                shocks but these are rare.

             2. The endotracheal tube will have seven silver doped plastic electrodes. In addition
                to the electrical risks there is the chance of tracheal mucosal injury from the
                electrodes. The electrodes are biocompatible, medically approved, silver doped
                plastic. They are smooth and should not pose a risk to the tracheal mucosa. All
                endotracheal tubes will be sterilized after manufacture.

             3. Pulse oximetry measurements will be recorded. Pulse oximetry measurements are
                required during surgery. They add no additional risk.

             4. Cardiac output will be measured by iced-thermodilution and impedance cardiography
                every ten minutes during the operation. Samples will be obtained in with a ten cc
                volume of iced saline. A five hour operation would have a total volume of 800 cc of
                fluid. We routinely give a 1000 cc of saline to patients for cardiac cases so we
                will just reduce routine fluid administration to account for this extra volume from
                cardiac output measurements. Iced-injectate has no effect on patient temperature
                since active warming of the patient continues throughout the study.

             5. Impedance cardiography measurements will be high frequency (100 Khz), low current
                (4 mA), with input impedance of 1 mOhms. All circuits will be electrically isolated
                and approved by bio-medical engineering. There is always the risk of burns or
                shocks but these are rare.

           There is no interference with other electrical equipment on the patient (e.g., ECG,
           pacemaker, etc.) nor perception of the low current output by the patient. Impedance
           cardiography devices have been in use for over 30 years. They are fully approved by the
           FDA and some are commercially available for clinical use.

           6. The patient interview and review of the medical records will increase patient safety
           by identifying problems caused by the study.

        8. Treatment and Compensation for Injury: There is minimal risks to the patient from this
           study. If there were any injury from the study, treatment will be available. If the
           patient is eligible for veteran's benefits, the costs of such treatment will be covered
           by the Department of Veterans Affairs. If not, the costs of such treatment may be
           covered by the Department of Veterans Affairs or the University of California, depending
           on a number of factors. The Department of Veterans Affairs and the University do not
           normally provide any other form of compensation for injury. For further information
           about this, the patient may call the V.A. District counsel at (415) 750-2288 or the
           office of the UCSF Committee on Human Research at (415) 476-1814.

        9. Alternatives: Consent or refusal to participate in the study will have no effect on the
           patient's care, type of care, or access to care.

      Informed consent: Informed, written consent is to be obtained from each study subject before
      any study-related procedures are begun. A full disclosure of the nature of the study is to be
      made in accordance with the guidelines described in the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR
      50.20).

      Withdrawal: A patient may choose to or be withdrawn from the study for any reason, including:

      a. Refusal of the patient to participate further; b. Refusal of the physician to allow
      patient participation. j. Costs to the subject: There will be no costs to the subject. The
      cost of all study related testing will be covered by Conmed.

      k. Reimbursement of Subjects: None will be provided.

      l. Confidentiality of records: All records will be confidential. All data will be analyzed by
      code number only. Code numbers will be kept at the VAMC under the control of the principal
      investigator. No reports will include patient identifiers.

      5. Qualifications of Investigators: Dr. Arthur Wallace, M.D., Ph.D. has done medical research
      since 1978 including large animal, human clinical trials, and human physiological
      measurement. He has a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering and completed a medical internship,
      anesthesia residency, and a fellowship in cardiac anesthesiology. He has been a faculty
      member of anesthesiology at UCSF since 1992 during this time he has been the PI on several
      clinical trials in high risk patients including the Afterload, Warm Cardioplegia, Atenolol,
      Clonidine, EDRF Intraop, L-ARG, AVD Study, PCRRT, and Aneurysm Trials. Dr. Wallace has worked
      with impedance devices since 1991 and has been the chief scientific advisor on the ECOM
      projects since their inception in 1996. He has been responsible for the tube design,
      algorithm development, electronic design, in-vivo experiments, as well as the animal and
      human trials.

      <recruitment_details>Cardiac output measurements were made in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the San Francisco VA Medical Center. Cases included coronary artery revascularization, both on, off pump, and robotic, aortic valvular replacement, mitral valvular repair or replacement, and aortic root replacement.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Design of the ECOM system and algorithm as well as safety testing were done using an animal model. The initial participants were used to finalize the system and model of the relationship between true and impedance-derived measurement of cardiac output. The final algorithm and electronics were tested in the last 101 enrolled participants.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Cardiac output measurements were made in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Cases included coronary artery revascularization, both on, off pump, and robotic, aortic valvular replacement, mitral valvular repair or replacement, and aortic root replacement.
Measurement of cardiac output made with the Conmed ECOM 6-3D endotracheal tube was compared to those made with a pulmonary artery catheter. Correlation studies of cardiac output were done against those performed using the standard thermodilution technique in patients, who in the normal course of their clinical care, were having cardiac outputs measured by the thermodilution technique.
Correlation study completed in the O.R. and intensive care units on patients who were scheduled for cardiac surgery who routinely have cardiac output measurements using the standard thermodilution method.</description>
