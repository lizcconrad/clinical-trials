  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the aging of the population, the prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
      eye disease has resulted in a large number of people suffering from central vision loss. In
      fact, the most prevalent cause of blindness among veterans is AMD. Since the number of
      elderly veterans is expected to double in the next 10 years, loss of vision due to AMD is
      also expected to proportionally and considerably escalate. People with impaired vision have
      difficulty with daily activities, such as, reading, driving, and recognizing faces. The goal
      of the research project is to provide information on factors that contribute to visual
      impairment. This knowledge is necessary for the development of innovative approaches that
      will optimize the benefit of vision rehabilitation techniques, aimed at improving vision,
      thus allowing our veterans to maintain function and productivity. The findings from the
      proposed research will benefit our veterans and all aging people.

      Vision loss has become a major public health problem due to the growth and aging of the
      population. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of vision loss in
      people over 50 years of age. In the United States, over 10 million people have AMD and over
      1.6 million people age 50 and older have late-stage advanced AMD. It is well established that
      AMD patients with central vision loss use preferred retinal loci (PRL) which are peripheral
      retinal areas adjacent to the fovea for performing daily activities, such as reading.
      However, even in healthy eyes, peripheral vision is limited due to reduced neural sampling
      density compared to the fovea. Additionally, the function of the peripheral retina can be
      further reduced in patients, owing to degenerative disease processes. These neural substrate
      losses are coupled with losses in the quality of the optical image on the retina. Optical
      imperfections increase with age and off-axis viewing, compared to viewing along the optical
      axis of the eye. The combination of these factors plays a significant role in reducing visual
      performance of patients with eccentric fixation. The long term goal of the project is to
      improve the visual performance of veterans with central vision loss by development of
      innovative approaches that will optimize the benefit of vision rehabilitation techniques. In
      the current proposal, optical and neural losses will be assessed in AMD patients with central
      vision loss using novel techniques. Increased optical losses due to age and viewing off the
      optical axis of the eye will be established with wavefront analysis technology. Increased
      neural losses due to retinal dysfunction at PRL will be determined based on measurement of
      visual acuity with blurred stimuli. Improvement in reading speed will be evaluated,
      conditional on neural losses at PRL and/or the stability of PRL, after compensating for
      optical losses with our adaptive optics system. The findings will provide knowledge of PRL
      function and stability that is beneficial for improving the outcome of available vision
      rehabilitation methods that train patients to better use their PRLs. Also, customized
      correction of optical imperfections of the eye for effectively improving visual performance
      can be developed as an approach for better vision rehabilitation of patients. Optimizing
      vision rehabilitation of our veterans will allow them to maintain function and productivity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Standard inclusion criteria are:

          -  qualification for entry into the study based on clinical evaluation,

          -  competence to understand and willingness to sign an informed consent form and
             participate in the study,

          -  pupils that dilate to 5 mm or more.

        The inclusion criteria for normal subjects will be:

          -  corrected visual acuities better than 20/30,

          -  intraocular pressure less than 21 mm Hg,

          -  no family history of AMD,

          -  no history of ophthalmic surgery or neurologic disease,

          -  no history of diabetes, glaucoma, or a history of elevated intraocular pressure.

        The recruitment will ensure that approximately 40 subjects will fall into each of the three
        age groups, 50 to 60 years, 61 to 70 years, and 71 years and older. One eye of each subject
        will be selected at random to be included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ocular opacities that preclude acquiring a clear fundus photograph or refractive
             errors greater than 4 diopters.
