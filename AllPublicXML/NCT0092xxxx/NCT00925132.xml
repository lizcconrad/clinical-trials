  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to treat metastatic melanoma with a combination of standard
      chemotherapy (decitabine and Temozolomide in a dose escalation scheme) with an study drug
      called panobinostat. This combination is proposed to unlock genes that may contribute to
      mechanisms that cause tumor growth.

      The primary objectives of this study are:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the proposed schedule of decitabine,
           temozolomide and panobinostat in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

        -  To define any Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
           combination of decitabine, temozolomide and panobinostat.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most chemotherapeutics target rapidly proliferating cells, leaving quiescent cells and those
      with extended cell cycles unaffected. The investigators propose that this combination of
      decitabine, temozolomide, and panobinostat will target both melanoma stem cells and rapidly
      proliferating melanoma cells. The use of two drugs that regulate gene expression
      epigenetically (panobinostat and decitabine) in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent
      (temozolomide) is hypothesized to:

        -  induce expression genes (e.g., Apaf-1) that increase chemosensitivity of tumor cells and
           enhance apoptosis

        -  potentiate the cytotoxic effect of temozolomide by epigenetic modulation, and

        -  induce proliferation and differentiation of tumor stem cells, thus enabling senescence
           and apoptosis.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To measure overall survival

        -  To measure the time to progression of patients treated with this combination in
           comparison to patients treated historically with DTIC (the current standard of care).

        -  To evaluate treatment response with FDG PET and compare FDG PET with conventional
           imaging for treatment response assessment.

    <measure>Phase I - Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) at a Given Dose Level</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks (one full cycle)</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT was any Grade 4 toxicity for neutrophils or platelets for ≥ 7 days, Grade 3 toxicity for neutrophils for ≥ 21 days, any Grade 3 solid organ toxicity not explainable by another cause (e.g. neurotoxicity, GI toxicity), metabolic/laboratory toxicity (≥10 x ULN AST) for ≥ 14 days, any Grade 4 infection or QTcF&gt; 500msec EKG. DLTs were assessed according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0.
All adverse events were collected and graded to determine DLTs as assessed according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. DLTs were assessed to determine the recommended Decitabine and Panobinostat dose for the Phase II portion of the trial.</description>

    <measure>Phase 2 -Number of Patients With a Decrease in Tumor Size Using RECIST and CHOI's Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks (2 cycles)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response rate was assessed using RECIST criteria in which a complete response was the disappearance of all target lesions; Partial response was a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimension (LD) of target lesions, relative to baseline measurement; Progressive disease was an increase of 20% or more in the sum of the LD of target lesions; and Stable disease was a decrease in tumor size of less than 30% or increase of less than 20%.
Tumor response rate was also assessed using CHOI's criteria in which a response was a 10% decrease in tumor size or a 15% decrease in tumor density on contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan.
Tumor response rates were assessed in order to determine effectiveness of the treatment regimen which was defined by the response rate of at least 30% as measured by either the RECIST or Choi's criteria, and ineffective if the rate is less than 15% on both.</description>

        <title>Phase 2 -Number of Patients With a Decrease in Tumor Size Using RECIST and CHOI's Criteria</title>
        <description>Tumor response rate was assessed using RECIST criteria in which a complete response was the disappearance of all target lesions; Partial response was a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimension (LD) of target lesions, relative to baseline measurement; Progressive disease was an increase of 20% or more in the sum of the LD of target lesions; and Stable disease was a decrease in tumor size of less than 30% or increase of less than 20%.
Tumor response rate was also assessed using CHOI's criteria in which a response was a 10% decrease in tumor size or a 15% decrease in tumor density on contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan.
Tumor response rates were assessed in order to determine effectiveness of the treatment regimen which was defined by the response rate of at least 30% as measured by either the RECIST or Choi’s criteria, and ineffective if the rate is less than 15% on both.</description>
