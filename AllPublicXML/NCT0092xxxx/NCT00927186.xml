  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how teriparatide or zoledronic acid affects the
      bone of postmenopausal osteoporotic women after 6 months of treatment as determined by a bone
      biopsy sample taken from the iliac crest (upper part of the pelvis). After completing 12
      months of treatment all participants are eligible to participate in an additional 12-month
      open label extension.

    <description>The length of tetracycline double labels is a measure of the extent of bone formation in the endocortical compartment within individual remodeling units and is measured in millimeters (mm). Participants were given T for two 3-day periods, 14 days apart. T fluoresces under certain light and temporarily binds to new bone. New bone in biopsy is seen as the amount of bone between 2 fluorescently T labeled lines under microscope. DL indicates active bone formation, SL or NL suggests suppression of bone formation.</description>

        <title>Mineralizing Surface/Bone Surface (MS/BS) in the Cancellous Compartment (CC) of Iliac Crest Bone Biopsies at 6 Months</title>
        <description>MS/BS in CC is a measure of the proportion of BS on which new mineralized bone is deposited at the time of tetracycline (T) labeling and is calculated as sum of total extent of double label (DL) plus half the extent of single label (SL) divided by BS. Participants were given T for two 3-day periods, 14 days apart. T fluoresces under certain light and temporarily binds to new bone. New bone in the biopsy is seen as the amount of bone between 2 fluorescently T labeled lines under a microscope. DL indicates active bone formation, SL or no label (NL) suggests suppression of bone formation.</description>

          <title>Mineralizing Surface/Bone Surface (MS/BS) in the Cancellous Compartment (CC) of Iliac Crest Bone Biopsies at 24 Months</title>
          <description>MS/BS in CC is a measure of the proportion of BS on which new mineralized bone is deposited at the time of tetracycline (T) labeling and is calculated as sum of total extent of double label (DL) plus half the extent of single label (SL) divided by BS. Participants were given T for two 3-day periods, 14 days apart. T fluoresces under certain light and temporarily binds to new bone. New bone in the biopsy is seen as the amount of bone between 2 fluorescently T labeled lines under a microscope. DL indicates active bone formation, SL or no label (NL) suggests suppression of bone formation.</description>

        <description>Ac.f in EC represents the frequency of activation of new remodeling cycles on the bone surface (BFR/BS divided by wall thickness) and is expressed in units of new cycles per unit of time. Participants were given T for two 3-day periods, 14 days apart. T fluoresces under certain light and temporarily binds to new bone. New bone in biopsy is seen as the amount of bone between 2 fluorescently T labeled lines under microscope. DL indicates active bone formation, SL or NL suggests suppression of bone formation. SL cases were imputed to a value of 0.3 µm/day or counted as missing.</description>

        <title>Bone Formation Rate (BFR) in the Endocortical Compartment (EC) of Iliac Crest Bone Biopsies at 6 and 24 Months</title>
        <description>BFR in EC is the volume of mineralized bone formed per unit surface bone per unit time (mm³/mm²/year); calculated as MAR times MS/BS. Participants were given T for two 3-day periods, 14 days apart. T fluoresces under certain light and temporarily binds to new bone. New bone in biopsy is seen as the amount of bone between 2 fluorescently T labeled lines under microscope. DL indicates active bone formation, SL or NL suggests suppression of bone formation. SL cases were imputed to a value of 0.3 µm/day or counted as missing.</description>

        <title>Mineral Apposition Rate (MAR) in the Cancellous Compartment (CC) of Iliac Crest Bone Biopsies at 6 Months</title>
        <description>MAR in CC is a measure of the linear rate of production of mineralized bone matrix by osteoblasts and is measured by the mean distance between two consecutive T labels divided by the time interval. Participants were given T for two 3-day periods, 14 days apart. T fluoresces under certain light and temporarily binds to new bone. New bone in biopsy is seen as the amount of bone between 2 fluorescently T labeled lines under microscope. DL indicates active bone formation, SL or NL suggests suppression of bone formation.

        <title>Mineral Apposition Rate (MAR) in the Endocortical Compartment (EC) of Iliac Crest Bone Biopsies at 6 and 24 Months</title>
        <description>MAR in EC is a measure of the linear rate of production of mineralized bone matrix by osteoblasts and is measured by the mean distance between two consecutive labels divided by the time interval. Participants were given T for two 3-day periods, 14 days apart. T fluoresces under certain light and temporarily binds to new bone. New bone in biopsy is seen as the amount of bone between 2 fluorescently T labeled lines under microscope. DL indicates active bone formation, SL or NL suggests suppression of bone formation. SL cases were imputed to a value of 0.3 µm/day or counted as missing.</description>

        <description>Aj.AR in EC is MAR averaged over the entire osteoid surface and in a steady state is an estimate of the mean rate of matrix apposition. Participants were given T for two 3-day periods, 14 days apart. T fluoresces under certain light and temporarily binds to new bone. New bone in biopsy is seen as the amount of bone between 2 fluorescently T labeled lines under microscope. DL indicates active bone formation, SL or NL suggests suppression of bone formation. SL cases were imputed to a value of 0.3 µm/day or counted as missing.</description>

Participants were given T for two 3-day periods, 14 days apart. T fluoresces under certain light and temporarily binds to new bone. New bone in biopsy is seen as the amount of bone between 2 fluorescently T labeled lines under microscope. DL indicates active bone formation, SL or NL suggests suppression of bone formation. SL cases were imputed to a value of 0.3 µm/day or counted as missing.</description>

Participants were given T for two 3-day periods, 14 days apart. T fluoresces under certain light and temporarily binds to new bone. New bone in biopsy is seen as the amount of bone between 2 fluorescently T labeled lines under microscope. DL indicates active bone formation, SL or NL suggests suppression of bone formation. SL cases were imputed to a value of 0.3 µm/day or counted as missing.</description>

DL indicates active bone formation, SL or NL suggests suppression of bone formation. SL cases were imputed to a value of 0.3 µm/day or counted as missing.</description>

          <title>Active Formation Period (a.FP) in the Endocortical Compartment (EC) of Iliac Crest Bone Biopsies at 6 and 24 Months</title>
          <description>a. FP in EC is the mean time required to rebuild a new bone structural unit, calculated as wall thickness divided by MAR. Participants were given T for two 3 day-periods, 14 days apart. T fluoresces under certain light and temporarily binds to new bone. New bone in biopsy is seen as the amount of bone between 2 fluorescently T labeled lines under microscope. DL indicates active bone formation, SL or NL suggests suppression of bone formation. SL cases were imputed to a value of 0.3 µm/day or counted as missing.</description>
