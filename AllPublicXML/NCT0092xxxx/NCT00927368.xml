    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study which will compare three femoral nerve catheter insertion
      techniques. Subjects will be randomized into one of thee groups, Group 1: ultrasound guided
      femoral nerve catheter using a stimulation needle and stimulating catheter, .Group 2:
      ultrasound guided femoral nerve catheter using a stimulation needle, but non-stimulating
      catheter, or Group 3: ultrasound guided femoral nerve block without stimulation.

      catheter, or Group 3: ultrasound guided femoral nerve block without stimulation.

        -  Pain Scores after surgery with be measured using the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale).
           Subjects will be asked to rate their pain on a scale of 1-10.

        -  Block Performance time is the time from starting the block (after prepping and draping)
           until catheter is placed.

        -  Opioid requirements will be measured as the total amount of opioids (converted to
           morphine sulfate equivalents) used both during surgery, and during the first 48 hours
           after surgery.

        -  Block failure rate will be calculated as the rate of cases that requires repeating the
           block after surgery.

    <description>Time weighted average of verbal response scale (VRS) pain score on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable).
Verbal Response Scale (VRS) pain scores after surgery - which ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum intolerable pain) - were assessed every 30 minutes in the recovery area and every 4 hours thereafter up to 48 hours postoperatively. These individual measurements were averaged for each patient using a time-weighted formula. (For a given patient, the observed VRS pain score profile as a function of time was linearly interpolated and integrated using the trapezoidal rule; then, the time-weighted average was calculated as the value of this integral divided by the total monitoring time of 48 hours.).</description>

    <description>The incremental cost between strategies was calculated as the additional cost of one strategy to the next less costly strategy. There was no variance in the price because these prices were contracted with the hospital. The contracted price for a hospital does not change or fluctuate.</description>

        <title>Time Weighted Average Verbal Response Scale Pain Score</title>
        <description>Time weighted average of verbal response scale (VRS) pain score on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable).
Verbal Response Scale (VRS) pain scores after surgery – which ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum intolerable pain) – were assessed every 30 minutes in the recovery area and every 4 hours thereafter up to 48 hours postoperatively. These individual measurements were averaged for each patient using a time-weighted formula. (For a given patient, the observed VRS pain score profile as a function of time was linearly interpolated and integrated using the trapezoidal rule; then, the time-weighted average was calculated as the value of this integral divided by the total monitoring time of 48 hours.).</description>

          <description>For the ultrasound guidance and needle stimulation arm, the Tuohy needle was positioned with the tip beneath the fascia iliaca under ultrasound guidance. The needle tip was then adjusted as necessary to obtain a quadriceps muscle response with a stimulating current ≤0.5 mA (2 Hz, pulse width 0.1 msec). Subsequently, the catheter was threaded 5 cm beyond the needle tip without additional electrical stimulation
ultrasound guidance and needle stimulation: For the ultrasound guidance and needle stimulation group, the Tuohy needle was positioned with the tip beneath the fascia iliaca under ultrasound guidance. The needle tip was then adjusted as necessary to obtain a quadriceps muscle response with a stimulating current ≤0.5 mA (2 Hz, pulse width 0.1 msec).

          <title>Ultrasound Guidance+Catheter Stimulation</title>
          <description>For the ultrasound guidance and catheter stimulation group, the Tuohy needle was positioned with the tip beneath the fascia iliaca under ultrasound guidance. The needle tip was then adjusted as necessary to obtain a quadriceps muscle response with a stimulating current ≤0.5 mA. At that point, the peripheral nerve stimulator was then disconnected from the stimulating needle and connected to the proximal end of the catheter. The catheter was then advanced 5 cm past the needle tip. If the motor response disappeared during catheter advancement, the catheter was withdrawn slightly until the response returned. Needle orientation and catheter advancement were adjusted as necessary to elicit quadriceps contractions via the catheter with a stimulating current ≤0.5 mA.</description>
