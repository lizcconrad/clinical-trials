      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Imatinib Mesylate is active in diseases -
      such as Desmoid Tumor and Chondrosarcoma - expressing the receptor for the platelet-derived
      growth factor (PDGF) both in its isoform alpha and beta

          -  Surgical resection of local disease unfeasible radically (or unaccepted by the
             patient, or amenable to become less demolitive, or easier, or likely more feasible,
             after cytoreduction) and/or metastatic disease.

          -  ECOG Performance status 0, 1, 2 or 3

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function

          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential must have negative pregnancy test.

          -  Male and female patients of reproductive potential must agree to employ an effective
             method of birth control throughout the study.

          -  Written, voluntary, informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             28 days of first day of study drug dosing

          -  Other primary malignancy with &lt;5 years clinically assessed disease-free interval,
             except basal cell skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ.

          -  Grade III/IV cardiac problems as defined by the New York Heart Association Criteria

          -  Severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, chronic renal

          -  Known brain metastasis.

          -  Known chronic liver disease (i.e., chronic active hepatitis, and cirrhosis).

          -  Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          -  Previous radiotherapy to &gt;/=25% of the bone marrow or within the previous 2 months on
