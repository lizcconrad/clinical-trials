  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low birth weight (LBW) status (&lt; 10% for gestational age at birth) is associated with
      increased risk for diseases such as type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease in adults, and represents one
      example of the &quot;fetal onset of adult disease&quot; hypothesis. Recent data strongly associates LBW
      status with impaired innate and adaptive immunity leading to increased risk for severe
      infections during adolescence or early adulthood. Animal studies suggest that the ratio of
      certain B lymphocyte subpopulations, the B1a and B1b cells, determines whether deficits in
      immunity occur.

      This study will determine the ratio of B1b to B1a lymphocyte subpopulations in the cord blood
      of infants born LBW in the late preterm to term gestations (&gt; 34 weeks at birth) and compare
      those ratios with those of normal birth weight (NBW) controls in a nested case control study
      design.

      Furthermore, animal studies suggest that the expression patterns of CD5 and CD19 proteins
      determines the cellular phenotype of the B lymphocyte, that of a B1a or a B1b cell, and that
      the regulatory regions controlling their expression are epigenetically vulnerable. The
      investigators will therefore isolate DNA and RNA from both B lymphocyte subpopulations and
      determine whether epigenetic changes to the regulatory regions of the genes coding for CD5
      and CD19 protein expression occur in LBW lymphocyte subpopulations as compared to the
      lymphocytes from NBW infants.

      This proposal will be the first human study to examine epigenetic determination of a
      maladaptive phenotype following LBW status at birth in a specific cell type leading to a
      specific impairment of innate and adaptive immunity.
