  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypercholesterolemia is a well-established risk factor for the development of
      atherosclerosis, a component of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The National Cholesterol
      Education Program advises the public to consume 2 g/day of plant sterols or stanols in
      addition to the Therapeutic Lifestyle Change Diet to lower elevated low-density lipoprotein
      (LDL) cholesterol levels. For foods to carry the FDA health claim label they must contain
      0.65 g of phytosterol ester or 1.7 g of phytostanol ester per serving. The study was a
      controlled diet, cross-over clinical investigation using a Latin square sequence. It
      consisted of two 29 d phases separated by a four week wash out interval. Subjects were
      randomized to one of two treatment arms: 1 % dairy milk or low-fat soy beverage providing
      1.95 g plant sterols/day.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy males and females, age 19-60 years old, will be screened for determination of
             fasting circulating LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels.

          2. Subjects accepted into the study will have plasma LDL-C levels between 120 and 200
             mg/dl, TG levels below 250 mg/dl, and a body mass index (BMI) between 22 to 32 kg/m2.

          3. Subjects must also demonstrate an ability to understand dietary and exercise
             procedures and be judged as compliant and motivated by the investigators.

          4. Subjects will be permitted to take stable doses of thyroid hormone and
             anti-hypertensive agents, as long as these are continued equivalently throughout the
             duration of study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of recent (i.e. less than 3 mo) or chronic use of oral hypolipidemic therapy,
             including fish oils, or probucol within the last 6 months.

          2. History of chronic use of alcohol (&gt;2 drinks/d), systemic antibodies, corticosteroids,
             androgens, or phenytoin.

          3. Myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass, or other major surgical procedures
             within the last six months.

          4. Recent onset of angina, congestive heart failure, inflammatory bowel disease,
             pancreatitis, diabetes, or significant current (ie. onset within past three months)
             gastrointestinal, renal, pulmonary, hepatic or biliary disease, or cancer (evidence of
             active lesions, chemotherapy or surgery in the past year).

          5. Exercise greater than walking or running 15 miles/wk or 4,000 kcal/week.
