      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of 8
      week treatment with Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) 20, 60, 120, 240 mg and placebo in patients with
      mild to moderate essential hypertension and to determine the adequate antihypertensive dosage
      for later clinical study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K), a selective blocker of AT1 receptor subtype, showed the rapid and
      potent antihypertensive effect in many hypertensive models. Phase I study, Fimasartan
      (BR-A-657-K) 20mg ~ 480mg single dosing with healthy subjects, demonstrated that the
      Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) was very safe and well tolerated. Another phase I study, Fimasartan
      (BR-A-657-K) 120mg and 360mg dosing for 7 days, also showed that Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) was
      safe and tolerable though one temporal adverse event was observed in high dose.

      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel grouped, clinical study will be
      conducted to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability and to determine
      adequate antihypertensive dosage of Fimasartan(BR-A-657-K) in patients with mild to moderate
      essential hypertension.

      Approximately 182 patients will be enrolled over 12 months in 8 centers nationwide.

      After 2 weeks of placebo run-in period, all subjects will be randomized into one of the
      following 5 groups. Subjects will take test/control drug for 8 weeks of treatment period. If
      subjects take any antihypertensive medications before screening, the subjects will have 1
      week of wash-out period.

      Group I : Placebo, Group II : Fimasartan 20 mg, Group III: Fimasartan 60 mg, Group IV :
      Fimasartan 120 mg, Group V : Fimasartan 240 mg,
