  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One out of every five people experiences tinnitus (a ringing, buzzing, or roaring sound in
      the ear) ranging from mild to severe impairment. To date, there are no effective therapies
      available that have been shown to decrease tinnitus loudness. The purpose of this study is to
      develop a new treatment option for tinnitus using a technique called Repetitive Transcranial
      Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), which will hopefully prove to be an effective means of
      alleviating or reducing the symptoms of tinnitus.

      This research is being conducted at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS).
      Up to 60 subjects, including males and females ages 19-89 years old and of all races, and
      with tinnitus severe enough to seek medical attention, will be enrolled in this study. All
      participants will be evaluated or medically reviewed by the study physician, Dr. Dornhoffer
      of the Hearing and Balance Clinic at UAMS, including a modified physical examination and
      hearing tests, prior to beginning therapy with rTMS in order to rule out any medically
      treatable causes of tinnitus. An MRI scan of the head may or may not be required, depending
      upon the results of this evaluation, in order to rule out specific middle ear pathologies.

      This study will require participation in at least three weeks (4 weekdays per week) of rTMS
      sessions, including two active weeks and a sham (or placebo) week. There will be a three week
      washout period following each treatment week. At the completion of the three treatment weeks,
      subjects who have noticed an improvement in their tinnitus will have the option of
      participating in a maintenance rTMS program providing up to 8 additional weeks of treatment.

    <description>All subjects complete the initial three weeks of rTMS sessions, which include 8 active sessions and 4 sham sessions. Subjects receive sham stimulation first to prevent carry forward effects of active treatment. Active and sham weeks are separated for each subject by an interval of no less than 21 days.</description>

    <description>Subjects who respond to either week of active rTMS have the option of participating in a maintenance rTMS program involving up to 8 additional sessions of therapy, each consisting of 3 days of rTMS treatment. Maintenance sessions will be scheduled with three weeks separating each treatment.</description>

    <description>Active rTMS will be targeted according to the following decision tree: 1) to auditory cortex in the superior temporal gyrus opposite the ear with loudest tinnitus; 2) to the same region in the left temporal lobe. Active stimulation will be delivered at 110% of motor threshold (MT) at a frequency of 1 or 10 Hz for a total of 1800 magnetic pulses per session (and a total of 4 sessions per week of active rTMS therapy).</description>

    <description>Sham rTMS will be targeted using a commercially available sham coil and delivered to the same site within the temporal lobe as active rTMS and in a manner identical to that for active rTMS except that scalp electrodes are used to stimulate the temporalis muscle electrically during sham stimulation to replicate the feel of active TMS.</description>
