      The purpose of this study is to determine whether low level laser therapy can help the
      recovery process for the procedure of liposuction of the thighs, hips and stomach.

      The Erchonia EML Laser is designed to administer low level laser therapy (LLLT). It has been
      hypothesized that LLLT may reduce pain and promote nerve regeneration through the speculated
      anti-inflammatory and immune enhancement properties of the therapy. Prior research has
      indicated LLLT to be a potentially safe and effective means of reducing pain. This clinical
      study was designed to evaluate the potential of the Erchonia EML Laser in offering a novel
      means of delivering LLLT to reduce pain and enhance healing following liposuction.

        Inclusion Criteria: There were separate inclusion criteria for both the liposuction and the
        clinical study components of the study.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE LIPOSUCTION PROCEDURE

        Prior to partaking in the clinical study qualification evaluation, an individual must have
        already:

          -  qualified as a patient for liposuction according to the American Society of
             Liposuction Surgery (ASLSS) and the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery (AACS) 2000
             Liposuction Guidelines.

          -  been deemed suitable for undergoing anesthesia according to the American Society of
             Anesthesiologists: Preanesthesia Evaluation guidelines: Basic Standards For
             Preanesthesia Care (Approved by House of Delegates on October 14, 1987).

          -  Signed the physician's standard informed consent form for the liposuction procedure
             itself.
