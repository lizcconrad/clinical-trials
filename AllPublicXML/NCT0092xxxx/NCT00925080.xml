      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and accuracy of the IVBG System (the
      &quot;System&quot;) when used to track blood glucose in insulin treated subjects with diabetes mellitus
      in an in-clinic setting for up to 72 hours (per subject). Reference blood glucose
      measurements will be collected across the entire reportable range of the System (e.g., 40 400
      mg/dL) with adequate sampling at the upper and lower ends of this range. IVBG System accuracy
      will primarily be assessed relative to ISO 15197 criteria (i.e., within ±15 mg/dL at YSI
      glucose levels &lt; 75 mg/dL, and within ±20% at YSI glucose levels &gt;75 mg/dL).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 years or older;

          2. Willing to participate in one 72-hour in-clinic session during which up to 72 venous
             blood samples drawn for YSI measurement of glucose concentration (maximum sampling
             frequency of 4 per hour), a fingerstick blood glucose measurement will also be
             performed at the time of each YSI blood draw;

          3. If instructed, be willing not to perform any activities that would result in
             submersion of the Sensor/Potentiostat in water or willing to wear a waterproof
             covering when submerging the Sensor/Potentiostat;

          4. Have been diagnosed with insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus and are on multiple daily
             injections (MDI) or Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) insulin therapy;

          5. Able to speak, read, and write English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have skin conditions or existing (or planned) medical instrumentation and/or dressings
             that preclude wearing the IVBG Sensor (e.g., extensive psoriasis, recent burns or
             severe sunburn, extensive eczema, extensive scarring, extensive tattoos, dermatitis
             herpetiformis, or surgical dressings at the proposed wear site);

          2. Are pregnant (as demonstrated by a positive pregnancy test within 72-hours of device
             insertion);

          3. Have a contraindication to placement of a dedicated peripheral IV line;

          4. Have a known history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia;

          5. Current participation in another investigational study protocol (if a subject has
             recently completed participation in another drug study, the subject must have
             completed that study at least 30 days prior to being enrolled in this study);

          6. Have any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with
             their participation in the trial or pose an excessive risk to study staff handling
             venous blood samples (e.g., known history of hepatitis B or C).
