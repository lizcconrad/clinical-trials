  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether weekly injections of phenylalanine ammonia
      lyase (rAvPAL-PEG) can reduce blood phenylalanine concentrations in PKU subjects and whether
      repeated administration is safe.

    <textblock>
      This is a 2 part, Phase 2, open-label dose-finding study in approximately 35 subjects with
      PKU. Seven dose cohorts are planned, each consisting of 5 subjects. In Part 1, the planned
      starting dose levels are those tested in PAL 001 (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0
      mg/kg), provided no dose limiting toxicity was observed in PAL 001. In Parts 1 and 2, study
      drug will be administered by clinic staff.

      Subjects who completed participation in PAL 001 will receive priority to participate in PAL
      002. rAvPAL PEG naïve subjects will be enrolled to fill any dose cohort vacancies resulting
      from subjects who did not complete PAL 001 or who chose not to continue into PAL 002. In
      addition, if the number of dose cohorts determined in PAL 001 is less than 7, additional
      naïve subjects may be added to the existing dose cohorts to provide a total of approximately
      35 subjects entering Part 1 of PAL 002. Furthermore, if serial dosing of cohorts in Part 1 of
      PAL 002 is stopped, additional subjects (either naïve subjects or PAL 001 subjects) may be
      added to the existing cohorts so that total study enrollment is approximately 35 subjects. In
      any of these cases, additional subjects will be enrolled sequentially from lowest to highest
      dose cohort.

      Diet will not be altered during the course of this study, except as necessary for safety.

      Subjects will be evaluated for safety and for blood Phe concentrations throughout the study.
      Toxicity will be measured according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.

      A Data Monitoring Committee will monitor the study.

After each subject completes Part 1, the subject's rAvPAL-PEG dosing will continue in Part 2. In Part 2, each subject's dose will be adjusted to attain a target blood Phe concentration with target levels between 120-600 micromol/L and a minimum blood Phe concentration decrease of 30% from baseline.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For subjects who did not participate in PAL-001, diagnosis of PKU with both of the
             following: Current blood Phe concentration of ≥ 600 mmol/L at Screening and average
             blood Phe concentration of ≥ 600 µmol/L over the past 3 years, using available data.

          -  For subjects who did not participate in PAL-001, evidence that the subject is a
             non-responder to Kuvan® treatment (ie, 4 weeks of treatment with 20 mg/kg/day of
             Kuvan®, insufficient response per investigator determination, and treatment end date ≥

             evaluations (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), and electrocardiogram (ECG) at
             Screening.

          -  Willing and able to comply with study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             including Depo-Provera, within 3 months prior to Screening and during study
             participation.

          -  A prior reaction that included systemic symptoms (eg, respiratory or gastrointestinal
             problems, hypotension, angioedema, anaphylaxis) to rAvPAL-PEG or a PEG containing
             product. Subjects with a prior systemic reaction of generalized rash may be eligible
             for participation per the discretion of the Principal Investigator in consultation
             with the Sponsor's Medical Officer.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding at Screening or planning to become pregnant (self or

             hepatic, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic,
             neurological, oncologic, or psychiatric disease).

          -  Any condition that, in the view of the PI, places the subject at high risk of poor
