    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to use previously collected retrospective observational data
      to compare treatment and outcome in patients treated with CroFab who have a severe
      envenomation to those with a mild/moderate envenomation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must involve treatment of a human patient with CroFab between January 1, 2002 and
             December 31, 2004

          -  The record must contain ALL of the following:

               1. Clinical signs/symptoms prior to the first dose of antivenom,

               2. Documentation of ALL doses of antivenom used to treat the patient,

               3. Indication of whether or not initial control was achieved with antivenom.

        To be included in the Efficacy Evaluable Population (EEP) in the current analysis, each
        record must meet the following criteria:

          -  Must contain enough information to calculate a severity score based on the 7-point
             severity scale.

          -  All records were included in the Safety Population in the current analysis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any cases identified that do not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded, including
             cases not treated with CroFab.
