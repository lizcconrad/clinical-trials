      The purpose of this study is to see how safe the study drug is and to determine the best dose
      to use in cancer patients in the future.

      The study drug is designed to reduce the activity of a protein known as &quot;heat shock protein
      90&quot;, or &quot;Hsp90&quot;. Hsp90 is found in every cell in the human body and normally helps those
      cells (and the body) cope with stressful situations. In certain cancers, however, Hsp90 helps
      the cancer cells survive and grow. By reducing the activity of Hsp90, the study drug may slow
      the growth, and reduce the survival, of those cancer cells.

      This is a dose escalation study. As subjects participating in the study tolerate a specific
      dose level, the new subjects entering will be given a higher dose of the study drug.
