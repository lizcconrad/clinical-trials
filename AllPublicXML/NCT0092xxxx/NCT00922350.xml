  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify that nebulization with bronchodilators associated with
      heliox gas (helium + oxygen) and the posture of a leaning forward truck is effective in
      patients with an asthma attack.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When associated with inhaled bronchodilators, the heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen in
      obstructive lung diseases with asthma, reduces the turbulence of airflow despite high rates,
      due to its low density.

      Although the first report of the use of heliox in the treatment of asthma dating to 1935, few
      controlled studies are available clarify the impact of the use of heliox in hospital
      admission of patients with acute asthma attacks refractory to standard treatment.

      The severe airflow obstruction, observed in cases of acute asthma, also leads to lung
      hyperinflation that favors the increase of respiratory work by increasing the load for the
      inspiratory muscles by placing them at a mechanical disadvantage.

      Various body positions were studied relating them to muscle activity with mechanical
      disadvantage. These studies suggest that the influence posture acts mainly in the position of
      the diaphragm, thus, increasing the stress related to other muscles such as the abdominals
      and the effect of gravity on these.

      This study aims to: assess the efficiency of the positioning body associated with
      nebulization with bronchodilators carried by heliox during acute severe asthma in adults,
      using as the primary outcomes FEV1, FVC and PEF and secondary outcomes as the Borg scale,
      inspiratory capacity, RR, HR and SpO2.

    <description>Patients underwent two carried by heliox nebulization associated with fenoterol (2.5 mg) and ipratropium bromide (0.25 mg). We used three ml of saline solution at 0.9%. For nebulization with heliox or oxygen, was used a system of distribution not invasive, semi-closed in a mask that is non toxic connected to a piece &quot;Y&quot; with a nebulizer in a follow and a bag of tank with a capacity for 2.5 L in the other connected with a valve action. This system was used so that there was a dilution gas. The proportion of 80:20 heliox was used (80% helium: 20% oxygen). To postural change in groups and heliox Oxygen + posture + posture, oriented to the participants to maintain an angle of inclination of the trunk and elbows supported on the thighs, measured from the anterior axillary line and lateral epicondyle of the femur, between 50th and 60th .</description>
