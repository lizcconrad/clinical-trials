    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS): First-Line Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until disease progression or death (assessed on Week 6, Week 12 and thereafter every 8 weeks up to Week 107)</time_frame>
    <description>Time in months from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. PFS calculated as (first event date minus date of randomization plus 1)/30.4. Tumor progression determined from oncologic assessment data (where it meets criteria for progressive disease [PD]), or from adverse event (AE) data (where outcome was &quot;Death&quot;). Progression using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) is &gt;= 20 percent (%) increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; measurable increase in non-target lesion; appearance of new lesions.</description>

    <description>Percentage of participants with OR based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST. Confirmed response were those that persisted on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. CR was defined as disappearance of all lesions (target and/or non target). PR were those with at least 30 percent decrease in sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions, with non target lesions not increased or absent.</description>

    <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (&quot;confined to bed&quot;). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

        <title>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Kidney Symptom Index-15 (FKSI-15): First-Line Participants</title>
        <description>FKSI-15 questionnaires (lack of energy, side effects, pain, weight loss, bone pain, fatigue, enjoying life, short of breath, worsened condition, appetite, coughing, bothered by fevers, ability to work, hematuria, sleep) was used to assess quality of life (QoL) for those diagnosed with renal cell cancer. Questions answered on 5-point Likert scale: 0 to 4 (0= not at all, 1= little bit, 2= somewhat, 3= quite a bit, 4= very much). Total FKSI score 0 to 60; higher scores=better health states (Individual questions may be reversed coded, as appropriate).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-dose on Cycle [C]1 Day [D]1), D1 of each cycle until C23, end of treatment (up to Week 107), follow-up (28 days after last dose)</time_frame>
        <population>FAS treatment-naive population. Here ‘N’ (Number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure and ‘n’ signifies those participants evaluated for this measure at specific time point for each group respectively.</population>

        <description>FKSI-15 questionnaires (lack of energy, side effects, pain, weight loss, bone pain, fatigue, enjoying life, short of breath, worsened condition, appetite, coughing, bothered by fevers, ability to work, hematuria, sleep) was used to assess quality of life (QoL) for those diagnosed with renal cell cancer. Questions answered on 5-point Likert scale: 0 to 4 (0= not at all, 1= little bit, 2= somewhat, 3= quite a bit, 4= very much). Total FKSI score 0 to 60; higher scores=better health states (Individual questions may be reversed coded, as appropriate).</description>

        <description>FKSI-DRS: subset of FKSI which is FACT–Kidney Symptom Index questionnaire used to assess QoL for participants diagnosed with renal cell cancer. FKSI contains 15 questions and FKSI-DRS 9 questions (lack of energy, pain, losing weight, bone pain, fatigue, short of breath, coughing, bothered by fevers, hematuria) each ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). FKSI-DRS total score 0 to 36; higher scores associated with better health states (Individual questions may be reversed coded, as appropriate).</description>

        <population>FAS treatment-naive population. Here ‘N’ (Number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure and ‘n’ signifies those participants evaluated for this measure at specific time point for each group respectively.</population>

        <description>FKSI-DRS: subset of FKSI which is FACT–Kidney Symptom Index questionnaire used to assess QoL for participants diagnosed with renal cell cancer. FKSI contains 15 questions and FKSI-DRS 9 questions (lack of energy, pain, losing weight, bone pain, fatigue, short of breath, coughing, bothered by fevers, hematuria) each ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). FKSI-DRS total score 0 to 36; higher scores associated with better health states (Individual questions may be reversed coded, as appropriate).</description>

        <population>FAS previously-treated Asian population. Here ‘N’ (Number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure and ‘n’ signifies those participants evaluated for this measure at specific time point for each group respectively.</population>

        <title>Euro Quality of Life Questionnaire- 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Index Score: First-Line Participants</title>
        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (&quot;confined to bed&quot;). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-dose on Cycle [C]1 Day [D]1), D1 of each cycle until C23, end of treatment (up to Week 107), follow-up (28 days after last dose)</time_frame>
        <population>FAS treatment-naive population. Here ‘N’ (Number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure and ‘n’ signifies those participants evaluated for this measure at specific time point for each group respectively.</population>

        <title>Euro Quality of Life Questionnaire- 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Index Score: Second-Line Participants</title>
        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (&quot;confined to bed&quot;). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-dose on Cycle [C]1 Day [D]1), D1 of each cycle until C21, end of treatment (up to Week 103), follow-up (28 days after last dose)</time_frame>
        <population>FAS previously-treated Asian population. Here ‘N’ (Number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure and ‘n’ signifies those participants evaluated for this measure at specific time point for each group respectively.</population>

        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single index value. The VAS component rates current health state on a scale from 0: worst imaginable health state to 100: best imaginable health state; higher scores indicate a better health state.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single index value. The VAS component rates current health state on a scale from 0: worst imaginable health state to 100: best imaginable health state; higher scores indicate a better health state.</description>
