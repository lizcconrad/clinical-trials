      Breast radiation treatment is planned from a Computed Tomography (CT) scan. This study is
      designed to investigate a method to reduce the time between the planning of radiation
      treatment and its actual start by automating the intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
      planning process. The investigators plan to examine data from another scan called Cone Beam
      Computed Tomography (CBCT). A CBCT scan provides similar information to a conventional CT
      scan, however the images for CBCT are acquired at the treatment unit (linear accelerator used
      for treatment). Using these x-ray pictures of patients, the study team consisting of a
      radiation oncologist, a medical physicist and a radiation therapist will create a custom
      treatment plan unique to each patient. By doing this, the investigators hope to reduce the
      amount of time spent waiting for treatment and the number of hospital visits for patients in
      the future.
