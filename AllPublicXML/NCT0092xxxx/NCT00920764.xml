      The study objective is to investigate the effects of three low doses of atrasentan on urinary
      albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) levels in subjects with Type 2 diabetic nephropathy.

      Patients with Type 2 diabetes with nephropathy must be receiving a renin-angiotensin system
      inhibitor, such as an Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an Angiotensin II
      Receptor Blocker (ARB) for participation in this study. ACEi and ARB treatment are the
      standard of care for the management of proteinuria in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients.
