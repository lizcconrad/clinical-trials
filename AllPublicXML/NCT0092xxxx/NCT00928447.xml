  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect and safety of rHuPH20 or placebo for the
      treatment of skin allergic reaction to nickel. The study drug and placebo will be
      administered by intradermal injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot Phase II, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to compare the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of rHuPH20 or placebo control administered intradermally
      (ID) in the prevention and treatment of subjects with contact allergy to nickel. This study
      will involve two treatment regimens, which will run in parallel (Treatment Regimens 1 and 2).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females 18-60 years of age. Females of child-bearing potential must use a standard and
             effective means of birth control for the duration of the study.

          -  Known contact dermatitis to nickel with a confirmed positive patch-test result to
             nickel sulfate.

          -  Intact normal skin without potentially obscuring tattoos, acne, dermatitis,
             pigmentation or lesions on the posterior aspect of the torso (back) in the area
             intended for allergen testing and dose administration.

          -  Vital signs (BP, HR, temperature, respiratory rate) within normal range or, if out of
             range, assessed by the Investigator as not clinically significant and it is mutually
             agreed by both Investigator and Sponsor Medical Monitor that the subject need not be
             excluded from the study for this reason.

          -  A negative serum or urine pregnancy test (if female of child-bearing potential) within
             14 days of initial study drug administration.

          -  Subject should be in good general health based on medical history and physical
             examination, without medical conditions that might prevent the completion of study
             drug injections and assessments required in this protocol.

          -  Decision-making capacity and willingness and ability to comply with the requirements
             for full completion of the study.

          -  Signed, written Institutional Review Board (IRB)/EC-approved informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Nickel allergen patch test greater than a ++ reaction.

          -  Subjects who were treated with chemotherapy agents or systemic corticosteroids within
             the past 3 months.

          -  Use of topical steroids, antihistamines, or immunosuppressants used near the site of
             allergen testing/injection within 14 days.

          -  Use of oral antihistamines within 14 days of study conduct.

          -  Extensive ongoing outbreaks of contact dermatitis anywhere on the body.

          -  Pregnant or women who are breast-feeding.

          -  Subjects with a current disease state that can affect immune response (e.g., flu,
             cancer, HIV).

          -  Known allergy to any hyaluronidase or the ingredients in the dose preparation.

          -  History of autoimmune disorder.

          -  Subjects with any other medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             might significantly affect their ability to safely participate in the study or affect
             the conduct of this study. Examples might include asthma, diabetes, heart disease,
             epilepsy, cancer, etc.
