  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether using Taclonex ointment under a hydrogel
      patch is more effective than using the ointment alone in treating psoriasis. Taclonex
      ointment is currently FDA approved for use on psoriasis. The hydrogel patch is a type of
      adhesive pad and contains no medications. It is currently FDA approved and has been shown to
      be safe and virtually free of side effects. The hypothesis is that psoriatic plaques which
      are treated with Taclonex ointment under a hydrogel patch will be more effectively treated
      compared to psoriatic plaques treated with Taclonex alone.

      This will be an open label, bilaterally-controlled single center study. Thirty subjects with
      plaque type psoriasis will be enrolled in the study. All subjects will receive treatment on
      two target lesions that are similar in erythema, scaling and induration, and symmetric in
      anatomic location. The severity of their target lesions will be assessed using a modified
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scoring system (Appendix A). Symmetrical target
      lesions must each be rated at a PASI score equal to or greater than 7 and be within 1 PASI
      score of each other.

      All subjects will apply Taclonex ointment to both target lesions once daily for 4 weeks. The
      occlusive dressing will be applied by the subject to one of the two symmetrical target
      lesions once daily for 4 weeks. The occlusive dressing will be removed by the patient if
      he/she experiences warmth, irritation, increased erythema, and/or itching. If the patch is
      removed due to these symptoms and signs, the subject will leave the lesion un-occluded until
      for 24 hours, at which time a new occlusive dressing will be placed.

      After the initial 4 weeks of treatment, there will be a follow up period of 6 weeks during
      which no treatment is used.

      Subjects will be restricted from using systemic therapies for psoriasis during this study,
      including Psoralen Ultraviolet A (PUVA) photochemotherapy and herbal therapies. All topical
      medications, except the study medications, and UVB phototherapy are prohibited on the target
      lesions. All of the other psoriasis lesions on the body can be treated as usual with other
      topical medications and Ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy as long as it does not impact on the
      two target lesions.

             lesions. Paired target lesions must be in similar anatomic locations (e.g., right and
             left elbows or right and left knees) and have roughly equivalent (no more than one
             point difference) modified Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) scores. Each paired

          <description>Modified psoriasis severity index measures erythema, induration, and scaling each measured from 0-4, with a maximum summed score of 12. A higher score means greater psoriasis severity and a lower score means lower psoriasis severity.</description>
