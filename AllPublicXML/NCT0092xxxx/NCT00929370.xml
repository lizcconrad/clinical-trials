  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand safety and tolerability of the drug GSK1018921
      after 14 days of dosing in healthy volunteers and then in patient volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a four part, parallel group, randomised, study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of repeat doses of GSK1018921 in
      healthy volunteers and stable patients with schizophrenia and to evaluate its effect on
      pharmacokinetics of midazolam. Part A will evaluate 14 days repeat BID dosing in at least
      three cohorts of healthy volunteers, to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK)
      and pharmacodynamics (PD) of GSK1018921. Part B will study the potential drug interaction of
      GSK1018921 (Maximum Tolerated Dose from Part A) with midazolam with 14 days repeat BID dosing
      in healthy volunteers and therefore will assess the PK, safety and tolerability. Part C will
      be a single dose study in healthy volunteers and will include CSF sampling to assess the
      concentration of GSK1018921 and glycine in CSF with two doses (80 and 200 mg). Part D will
      study stable patients with schizophrenia, to assess safety, tolerability, PK and PD following
      28 days of repeat BID dosing.

      Safety assessments will include physical examination, 12-lead ECGs, holter monitoring, vital
      signs, orthostatic vital signs, visual assessments, and clinical lab test. Tolerability will
      be assessed by collecting Adverse Events.

      PD assessments will include glycine in red blood cells, plasma and CSF, as well as CogState
      Battery test, Visual Assessment Scale, Positive And Negative Symptom Scores (PANSS) and
      Clinical Global Impression scales of change.
