  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that weight problems are very common in fibromyalgia. Research also
      suggests that overweight and obesity may contribute to worsening of fibromyalgia symptoms and
      biochemical vulnerability associated with fibromyalgia. Effective weight management may be
      important in not only improving general health but also better management of fibromyalgia
      symptoms. Research has indicated that nutrition and coping education is important aspects of
      successful weight management. In this study, the investigators are evaluating the effect of
      nutrition and coping education on weight and symptom management of fibromyalgia among
      overweight and obese patients.
