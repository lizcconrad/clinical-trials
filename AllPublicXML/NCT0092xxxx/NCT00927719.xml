      This is an enhanced safety surveillance study that will occur within the military Service
      Member population.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the rates of suspected, probable, and confirmed myocarditis and/or
           pericarditis in temporal association with ACAM2000® vaccination.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the rates of cardiovascular adverse events in temporal association with
           ACAM2000® vaccination.

        -  To evaluate the rates of neurological adverse events in temporal association with
           ACAM2000® vaccination.

      The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Activity (AFHSA) will perform comprehensive health
      surveillance through the operation of the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS).
      Demographic and medical information gathered within monthly reports from the DMSS will be
      collected from approximately 100,000 to 200,000 military Service Members who received the
      ACAM2000® smallpox vaccine.
