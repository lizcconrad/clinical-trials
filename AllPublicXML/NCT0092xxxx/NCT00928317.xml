      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the safety, efficacy, tolerability,
      immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics of 3 dose levels of ART621 in the treatment of rheumatoid
      arthritis.

      Despite being effective in approximately 60% of subjects, there are limitations to existing
      anti-TNF therapies especially in relation to immunogenicity, safety and administration. In
      addition, due to their high molecular weight, currently marketed products are largely
      confined to the blood stream.

      ART621 is an anti-TNF molecule that contains 2 identical domain &quot;antibodies&quot; that have the
      binding activity of a full antibody but with a substantially smaller molecular size. The
      molecular weight of approximately half that of full size antibodies is predicted to, a) have
      improved tissue penetration and, b) to be less immunogenic than full size antibodies.

      This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, efficacy, tolerability, immunogenicity
      and pharmacokinetics of ART621 when administered with an intravenous loading dose followed by
      subcutaneous administration every week.

          -  Have active RA at the time of screening and at baseline, defined as ≥ 6 swollen joints
             and ≥ 6 tender joints (from 68 joint count) together with at least 2 of the following
             3 criteria:

               -  CRP level ≥ 1.5 mg/dl;
