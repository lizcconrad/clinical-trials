  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to compare a new symptoms rating questionnaire, called the
      Vancouver Semi-Structured Interview for Depression (V-SID), to the traditionally used
      questionnaires. The investigators predict that the V-SID will be more sensitive to patients'
      improvement than are traditional questionnaires.

    <textblock>
      Depression is sometimes associated with difficulties in thinking skills. Recent evidence
      suggests that in those people who have thinking difficulties, effective treatment and
      improvement of depression can also result in improved thinking skills. Therefore, a test of
      thinking skills is included in this study.

      This study will also evaluate three other potential indicators of treatment response:
      cortisol, cytokines, and grip strength.
