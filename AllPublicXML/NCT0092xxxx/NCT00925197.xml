  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of the study are to prove correlation between laboratory and patient self-testing
      (PST) measurements, estimation of INR variability within a target therapeutic zone and
      frequency of hemorrhagic and/or thromboembolic events after mechanical heart valve
      replacement.

      This is the first French, prospective, randomised, single centre study, comparing patient
      self-testing (PST) of international normalised ratio (INR), with conventional laboratory
      monitoring. Aims of the study are to prove correlation between laboratory and PST
      measurements, estimation of INR variability within a target therapeutic zone and frequency of
      hemorrhagic and/or thromboembolic events after mechanical heart valve replacement.

      Patients (206) were postoperatively, randomly, consecutively included (2004 - 2008): 103
      patients in each group, with a one year follow-up. Two INR control devices were selected:
      Coaguchek® (Roche) and INRATIO® (Hemosense).
