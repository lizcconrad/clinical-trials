      The goal of this research study is to design messages which can help people learn more about
      how to prevent colon cancer. Eligible participants will be asked to review a series of short
      cancer prevention messages and share their opinions on them. Participants also need to fill
      out a short survey with questions on their background and attitudes and knowledge about
      physical activity and colon cancer. The whole study can be completed online and will take
      less than 1 hour. After completing the entire study, participants will receive $25.

      The goal of this research is to develop and test potential intervention messages which can be
      used to help increase colon cancer prevention behaviors. Two sets of intervention messages
      will be developed: generic and behavioral. Using a randomized control design the
      investigators will evaluate the behavioral messages among women. This message testing
      protocol will help them determine if the messages are relevant, acceptable, comprehensible,
      memorable, and motivating for the target audience. The investigators' hypothesis is that the
      behavioral messages will receive more positive ratings than the generic messages. If so, they
      will be used to promote cancer screening and physical activity in future intervention
      studies.
