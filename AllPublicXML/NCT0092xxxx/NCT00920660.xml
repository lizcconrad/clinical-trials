      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of single, oral
      doses of SRT2104 (250 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg, 2000 mg) and prednisolone as measured by levels of
      ex vivo LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in whole blood of healthy adult subjects.

      The secondary purposes of this study are to assess the pharmacodynamic effects of single,
      oral doses of SRT2104 (250 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg, 2000 mg) and prednisolone (30mg) as measured
      by levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1beta in whole blood of healthy adult subjects. In addition,
      plasma pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of SRT2104 following the administration of
      single, oral doses of SRT2104 (250 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg, 2000 mg) in healthy adult subjects
      will also be assessed. As exploratory endpoints, transcriptomic profiles, biomarker
      exploration, and relationships between plasma SRT2104 levels and ex vivo LPS-induced
      TNF-alpha production may also be examined.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, non-therapeutic clinical study of SRT2104 administered
      orally as 250 mg capsules. Randomized, double-blind study to evaluate and compare the
      sensitivity of systemic biomarkers, such as ex-vivo LPS-induced TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and
      IL-1beta, to treatment with four-single oral doses of SRT2104 (250 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg, and
      2000 mg), prednisolone (30 mg), and placebo in healthy adult volunteers. Twenty (20) subjects
      (males and females of non-childbearing potential) aged 18-60, who fulfill the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in this study to achieve a minimum of 15
      evaluable subjects. Each subject will participate in 6 treatment periods. For each treatment
      period subjects will fast for at least 10 hours overnight. After pre-dosing procedures,
      subjects will consume a standard, non-high-fat (approximately 650 kcal with approximately 30%
      of calories derived from fat) meal 15-30 minutes prior to receiving test material. During the
      first five treatment periods, subjects will receive a single dose of SRT2104 or matched
      placebo; during the last treatment period, subjects will receive 30 mg open-label
      prednisolone. Assessments will be performed until 24 hours post dose in each treatment
      period.

      Subjects will be asked to sign the informed consent form(s) at the screening visit. If
      eligible and willing to participate, subjects will enter into the study. Subjects will be
      required to attend the research unit in a fasted state (at least 10 hours without food) on
      six separate occasions (treatment visits) during the study. There will be at least a 7-day
      washout period between treatment visits.

      During the first five treatment visits, subjects will receive one of the following five
      treatments:

      A. 250 mg SRT2104 administered as eight oral capsules (one active SRT2104 250 mg capsule +
      seven placebo capsules) B. 500 mg SRT2104 administered as eight oral capsules (two active
      SRT2104 250 mg capsules + six placebo capsules) C. 1000 mg SRT2104 administered as eight oral
      capsules (four active SRT2104 250 mg capsules + four placebo capsules) D. 2000 mg SRT2104
      administered as eight oral capsules (eight active SRT2104 250 mg capsules + zero placebo
      capsules) E. Eight placebo capsules

      During the last treatment visit, subjects will receive 30 mg of open-label prednisolone
      tablets.

      Subjects will be required to return to the research unit 24 hours after dosing in each
      treatment period in order to gather the required PK and PD samples. Subjects will be asked to
      return to the study center for an End of Study safety assessment 7 to 10 days after the last
      treatment visit.

    <description>Subjects will be required to attend the research unit in a fasted state (at least 10 hours without food) on six separate occasions (treatment visits) during the study. At approximately the same time every morning, subjects will consume a standard, non-high-fat meal (approximately 650 kcal with 30% of calories derived from fat). Test material (per treatment) will be administered within 15-30 minutes following the meal. There will be at least a 7-day washout period between treatment visits.
During the first five treatment visits, subjects will receive one of the following treatments in the form of 8 capsules: 0.25g SRT2104, 0.5g SRT2104, 1g SRT2104, 2g SRT2104, or placebo.
During the last treatment visit, subjects will receive 30 mg of open-label prednisolone tablets.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study is open to healthy male and female volunteers, 18 to 60 years of age, with
             hematology, clinical chemistry, electrolytes, serology, and urinalysis tests within
             normal, allowable limits using normal laboratory values (if out-of-range values
             result, they must be considered clinically significant by the Investigator to be
             exclusionary) and performed within 21 days to 1 day of receiving the first dose of
             test material.

          -  All male subjects and their female partners must be willing and able to use an
             acceptable form of double-barrier birth control (hormonal or double barrier method of
             birth control [condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with
             spermicidal foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository]; true abstinence) for at least 12
             weeks after the last treatment dose.

          -  All female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential. For the purposes of this
             study, non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menopausal females with a
             documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
             spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L)
             is confirmatory]. [Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal
             status is in doubt will be required to use adequate contraception (hormonal or double
             barrier method of birth control [condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault
             caps) with spermicidal foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository]; true abstinence) for
             the duration of the study dosing and for at least 12 weeks after the last treatment
             dose, if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must
             discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study
             enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of
             HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method].
