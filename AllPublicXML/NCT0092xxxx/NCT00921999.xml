      Background:

        -  The common varicella-zoster virus causes both chickenpox and shingles. Both diseases
           cause rashes, but they can also have complications such as bacterial infections of the
           skin, pneumonia, or eye disease.

        -  By drawing and studying blood samples from people who have been infected with the
           varicella-zoster virus or who are receiving or have received the varicella vaccine,
           researchers hope to learn more about the immune system s response to the virus.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the immune system s response to the varicella virus, either in its existing
      form or given as part of a vaccine.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals 18 years of age and older who have had or are receiving the varicella
           vaccine.

        -  Individuals 5 years of age and older who currently have chickenpox or shingles.

      Design:

        -  Participants will visit the NIH Clinical Center for an initial physical examination, and
           will provide blood samples for evaluation.

        -  Researchers will determine the number of samples to be taken and the amount of blood to
           be drawn as needed based on the participants medical history and exposure to the
           varicella-zoster virus.

      Investigators in this study will not be giving subjects either the chickenpox or shingles
      vaccine. They will only be looking at the response to the vaccine in persons who are
      receiving or have received the vaccine from their health care provider.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox (varicella) and shingles (zoster). Antibody is
      important for control of varicella as evidenced by the role of varicella immune globulin in
      limiting the severity of disease in immunocompromised persons. Limited information is
      available regarding the individual viral proteins to which antibodies are produced during
      primary infection with VZV or after vaccination. Furthermore, commercially available tests to
      determine seropositivity to VZV after vaccination have limited sensitivity, and improved
      assays are needed. We will obtain blood from persons with varicella, zoster, and those
      vaccinated with the varicella (not zoster) vaccine at the NIH Clinical Center and measure
      immune responses against specific viral proteins, look for virus in the blood, and in some
      cases measure immune responses against cellular proteins over time. Elucidation of these
      responses might help to develop more sensitive assays for VZV seropositivity after
      vaccination and determine how the varicella vaccine protects against varicella.
