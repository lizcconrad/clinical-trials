    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that a combined adult Tdap-IPV vaccine (REPEVAX®)
      will provide similar rapid antibody responses against tetanus toxoid as a tetanus toxoid
      vaccine alone in healthy adults.

          -  Guillain Barré syndrome or neuropathy of brachial plexus following a previous
             vaccination with a tetanus toxoid containing vaccine

          -  Known encephalopathy after receipt of a pertussis vaccine or neurological disorders
             after an injection with the same antigens

               -  subjects with prostate or breast cancer who are not on chemotherapeutic drugs
                  (other than hormone blocking drugs),

               -  subjects with skin cancer who are not receiving radiation therapy or
                  chemotherapy, and

               -  High dose (≥ 20 mg/day prednisone equivalent) systemic (≥ 14 days) corticosteroid
                  treatment daily or on alternate day within the last 28 days (inhaled
                  corticosteroids allowed)

               -  Chemotherapeutic agents used to treat cancer or other conditions

               -  Treatments associated with organ or bone marrow transplantation

          -  Immune dysfunction caused by a medical condition, or any other cause (e.g., congenital
             immunodeficiency, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, organ or bone marrow
             transplantation, leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma or
             generalized malignancy)

          -  Known severe thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorder contraindicating an
             intramuscular injection

          -  Administration of blood products including immunoglobulins within the last 90 days or
             planned before Visit 3

          -  Recent administration of a live vaccine (≤28 days) or an inactivated vaccine (≤14
             days) or vaccination planned before Visit 3

          -  For female subjects, pregnancy (positive pregnancy test before first blood sample) or
             breast-feeding through Visit 3

          -  Planned participation in another clinical study during the present study period
