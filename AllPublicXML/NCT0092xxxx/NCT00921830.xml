    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic and bioavailability
      characteristics of two test formulations of ibuprofen for rectal administration with the
      profile of a marketed reference formulation of ibuprofen 200 mg (for oral administration).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ibuprofen is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic in adults and children. Two ibuprofen
      suppository formulations have been developed for pediatric use to facilitate dosing in
      younger age groups. This is a single-dose, balanced, randomised, three-period crossover study
      in healthy male and female adult volunteers. Each volunteer will receive a single dose of 50
      mg ibuprofen as a suppository, a single dose of 200 mg ibuprofen as a suppository and a
      single oral dose of 200 mg ibuprofen (tablet). There will be 14 blood samples taken over 12
      hours in each study period. Concentrations in plasma of ibuprofen and its S and R enantiomers
      will be measured using a validated chromatographic method. Standard pharmacokinetic
      parameters will be obtained and bioavailability on the basis of rate and extent of drug
      absorption will be assessed.
