  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with head and neck cancer frequently develop synchronous or metachronous esophageal
      malignancies. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of endoscopic screening for
      esophageal cancer in head and neck cancer patients. The Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) system, an
      optical technology that enhances the visualization of superficial vascular network, may be
      superior to the conventional white light endoscopy for the detection of neoplastic lesions.
      However, whether the application of NBI improves the detection results have not been
      critically evaluated.

      This study aims to investigate the diagnostic value of the NBI system in the endoscopic
      screening for esophageal neoplastic lesions in patients with head and neck cancer.

      This is a prospective blinded controlled tandem endoscopy trial conducted in a regional
      medical center (Lotung Poh-Ai Hospital, Taiwan). Patients with tissue diagnosis of head and
      neck cancer are enrolled. Endoscopy screening for esophageal lesions is first performed by
      using the conventional white light system. Suspicious lesions are recorded. Then the entire
      esophagus is examined under the NBI system by another endoscopist, who is blinded to the
      result of the conventional endoscopy. After the endoscopic inspection completed, all
      suspicious lesions are biopsied. Before each procedure, which one of the two participating
      endoscopists applies the conventional or NBI system is randomized. The diagnostic rate of
      esophageal neoplasm by the conventional white light system and that of the NBI system are
      compared.

      The endpoint is the neoplastic lesion detected on endoscopic biopsy. We considered invasive
      cancer, carcinoma in-situ, and high-grade dysplasia (which usually cannot be distinguished
      from carcinoma in situ) as the primary points. Any dysplastic lesions were considered as
      secondary points.
