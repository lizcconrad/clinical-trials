  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to provide an alternative to bone scanning with technetium-99m
      (99mTc) labelled diphosphonates, and to document the safety of {18F}-Sodium Fluoride (Na18F)
      as a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging radiopharmaceutical. Since the current
      availability of 99mTc was severely reduced because of the Chalk River shut down, alternative
      approaches to done scanning are needed. PET imaging with Na18F is one alternative approach to
      providing this critical clinical service.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      18F-Sodium Fluoride (Na18F) PET imaging is a nuclear medicine procedure, and its principal
      radiopharmaceutical, Na18F, has been used for scanning the skeleton for the spread of cancer
      for more that 30 years, but has not been approved by Health Canada because less expensive
      alternate drugs have been available (99mTc diphosphonates). Given the sudden and drastic
      change in the availability of 99mTc, an acceptable alternative for 99mTc-diphosphonates is
      needed as soon as possible.
