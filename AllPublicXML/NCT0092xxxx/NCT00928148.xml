  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, 3-period and 3-treatment crossover
      study designed to evaluate the safety and duration of efficacy of SPD465 (50 or 75 mg)
      compared with placebo and an immediate release amphetamine salt formulation (25 mg) in adults
      with ADHD. The controlled environment used in this study is an analog classroom setting
      adapted for a 16-hour adult day.
