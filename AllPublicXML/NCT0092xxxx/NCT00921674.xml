    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic and bioavailability profile
      (rate and amount of absorption into the bloodstream) of a test formulation of Ivermectin
      solution 1 mg/ml with a marketed reference formulation of Ivermectin 3 mg tablets when taken
      after a standard meal. The study is designed in accordance with the EU Note for Guidance on
      the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence 2001.

    <textblock>
      Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medicine (i.e. a medicine used to eliminate parasitic worms)
      for oral administration, and is approved in the US and some other countries in a tablet form.
      A new liquid formulation of ivermectin has been developed to facilitate dosing. This is a
      single dose, randomised, crossover study in healthy adult male and female volunteers, with
      doses taken 20 minutes after a standard breakfast. Doses will be separated by washout period
      of at least 14 days. Twenty-one blood samples will be taken from each volunteer over 144
      hours in each period. Concentrations of Ivermectin in plasma will be measured using a
      validated chromatographic assay (LC-MS/MS). Standard pharmacokinetic parameters will be
      obtained and bioequivalence on the basis of rate and extent of drug absorption will be
      assessed.
