    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, non-interventional, single arm and open label study, in
      patients with contact dermatitis requiring systemic steroid therapy with a purpose to obtain
      the real life effectiveness and tolerability of Medrol in treating contact dermatitis in
      Indian patients. Patients with contact dermatitis who have been prescribed for Medrol will be
      enrolled into the study and will be followed up for the resolution of symptoms

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To be eligible for enrollment in this study, patients must be prescribed oral Medrol
             tablets (4mg and 16 mg) for contact dermatitis as per the locally approved prescribing
             information

          -  Medrol tablets, will be prescribed to the patient by the physician according to
             his/her usual practice. The decision to prescribe Medrol tablet will necessarily
             precede and will be independent of the decision to enroll patient into the study

          -  Only those patients, who are ready to sign an informed consent, will be included in
             the study

          -  Subject can be contacted through telephone

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have any other dermatological or systemic condition that may interfere or
             confound with the study outcome measurements

          -  Patients taking any oral steroid preparation or immunomodulators or have taken any
             such oral medication during last 15 days before enrollment. NSAIDs (Non Steroidal
             Anti-Inflammatory Agents) are excluded from the list

          -  Any contraindication to Medrol tablet use. Contraindications of Medrol use are
             systemic fungal infections and known hypersensitivity to components

          -  Participation in other studies within last 1 month before the current study begins
             and/or during study participation

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study
