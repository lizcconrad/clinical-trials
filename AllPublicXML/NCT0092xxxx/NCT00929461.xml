  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre- and intra-operative nutritional support in patient undergoing major surgery results in
      decreased morbidity and mortality. Studies investigating the role of omega-3 fatty acids in
      these patients are increasing. Some are focused on perfusion at the cellular level. This
      study was undertaken to address the effect of postoperative administration of omega-3 fatty
      acids on cellular hypoperfusion associated with major gastric surgery.

    <description>All patients received TPN for 5 days postoperatively, according to a standard protocol: 3 g/kg BW glucose (5% Dextrose in Ringer's Lactate, Biosel, Istanbul), 1.2 g/kg BW amino acids (Aminosteril 10%, Fresenius-Kabi) and 0.8 g/kg BW omega-6 fatty acids (Lipovenoes® 10%, Fresenius-Kabi) were provided to both groups through an indwelling central venous catheter. In the omega-3 group, the lipid content of TPN was replaced partially by omega-3 fatty acids (Omegaven®, Fresenius-Kabi) up to 0.2 g/kg BW per day.</description>
