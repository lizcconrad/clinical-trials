  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether low level laser light directed at the neck
      and shoulders could be effective in the temporary reduction of chronic pain in the neck and
      shoulder region.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic neck and shoulder pain arising from osteoarthritis, chronic muscle spasms or thoracic
      or cervical spine sprain strain can be seriously debilitating. Currently available treatment
      options such as pain relief medication, ice pack, massage, physical therapy and chiropractic
      are typically of limited effectiveness. More permanent options such as surgery are invasive
      with long recovery periods and side-effects and complications of their own. Low level laser
      light therapy, with its proven anti-inflammatory ability, offers a simple non-invasive option
      for the reduction of chronic neck and shoulder pain.

    <measure>Number of Participants Whose Self-reported Degree of Pain on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in the Neck and Shoulder Area Decreased by 30% or More From Before to After Study Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and one hour</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported degree of pain in the neck and shoulder region on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS is a 100 mm long horizontal line ranging from '0: no pain at all' on one end to '100: worst pain imaginable' on the other end. Participants mark a point along the line that best represents the pain they are experiencing at that moment.</description>

    <measure>Change in Self-reported Degree of Pain in the Neck-shoulder Region on the 0-100 Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and one hour</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported degree of pain in the neck and shoulder region on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS is a 100 mm long horizontal line ranging from '0: no pain at all' on one end to '100: worst pain imaginable' on the other end. Participants mark a point along the line that best represents the pain they are experiencing at that moment. The change is calculated as the difference from the VAS score recorded at baseline to the VAS score recorded one hour after study treatment administration. A positive change (+) means that the pain got worse and a negative change (-) means that the pain got better.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Range of Motion (ROM) for the Left Side of the Neck From Baseline to One Hour After Study Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and one hour</time_frame>
    <description>Range of motion (ROM) for the left side of the neck is a measure of how well the neck can move to the left side. The participant gently tilts their neck to the left side as far as possible, and this distance is measured in degrees. The change for ROM for the left side of the neck is measured as the difference in degrees of ROM recorded from baseline to one hour after study treatment. If the change is positive (+), this means that ROM has gotten better and the neck can move further to the left side than before getting the treatment. If the change is negative (-), this means that ROM has gotten worse and the neck can move less to the left side than before getting the treatment</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Range of Motion (ROM) for the Left Shoulder From Baseline to One Hour After Study Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>one hour</time_frame>
    <description>Range of motion (ROM) for the left shoulder is a measure of how well the participant can move the left shoulder. The participant gently raises the left shoulder (and left arm) as far as possible, and this distance is measured in degrees. The change for ROM for the left shoulder is measured as the difference in degrees of ROM recorded from baseline to one hour after study treatment. If the change is positive (+), this means that ROM has gotten better and can move the left shoulder better and further than before getting the treatment. If the change is negative (-), this means that ROM has gotten worse and the left shoulder can move less easily and not as far than before getting the treatment</description>

    <time_frame>baseline and one hour</time_frame>
    <description>Range of motion (ROM) for the right shoulder is a measure of how well the participant can move the right shoulder. The participant gently raises the right shoulder (with right arm) as far as possible, and this distance is measured in degrees. The change for ROM for the right shoulder is measured as the difference in degrees of ROM recorded from baseline to one hour after study treatment. If the change is positive (+), this means that ROM has gotten better and the right shoulder can move further more easily than before getting the treatment. If the change is negative (-), this means that ROM has gotten worse and the right shoulder can move less and not as far to the left side than before getting the treatment.</description>

          <title>Pain Rating on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</title>
          <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is used as a self-reported measure of current pain level. Participants mark the spot on the line scale that shows the level of their pain at that time. The scale ranges fron '0: no pain at all' to '100: worst pain imaginable.' The scale is a straight line of 100mm. The point marked by the participant is measured as their current pain level. The higher the number, the greater the pain level. To qualify to be in the study, participants needed to record a Baseline pain level on the VAS of 30 or greater.</description>

        <description>Range of motion (ROM) for the left shoulder is a measure of how well the participant can move the left shoulder. The participant gently raises the left shoulder (and left arm) as far as possible, and this distance is measured in degrees. The change for ROM for the left shoulder is measured as the difference in degrees of ROM recorded from baseline to one hour after study treatment. If the change is positive (+), this means that ROM has gotten better and can move the left shoulder better and further than before getting the treatment. If the change is negative (-), this means that ROM has gotten worse and the left shoulder can move less easily and not as far than before getting the treatment</description>

          <title>Change in Range of Motion (ROM) for the Right Side of the Neck From Baseline to One Hour After Study Treatment.</title>
          <description>Range of motion (ROM) for the right side of the neck is a measure of how well the neck can move to the right side. The participant gently tilts their neck to the right side as far as possible, and this distance is measured in degrees. The change for ROM for the right side of the neck is measured as the difference in degrees of ROM recorded from baseline to one hour after study treatment. If the change is positive (+), this means that ROM has gotten better and the neck can move further to the right side than before getting the treatment. If the change is negative (-), this means that ROM has gotten worse and the neck can move less to the right side than before getting the treatment.</description>

        <title>Change in Range of Motion (ROM) for the Right Shoulder From Baseline to One Hour After Study Treatment.</title>
        <description>Range of motion (ROM) for the right shoulder is a measure of how well the participant can move the right shoulder. The participant gently raises the right shoulder (with right arm) as far as possible, and this distance is measured in degrees. The change for ROM for the right shoulder is measured as the difference in degrees of ROM recorded from baseline to one hour after study treatment. If the change is positive (+), this means that ROM has gotten better and the right shoulder can move further more easily than before getting the treatment. If the change is negative (-), this means that ROM has gotten worse and the right shoulder can move less and not as far to the left side than before getting the treatment.</description>
