      Background:

      Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder in which patients are at increased risk
      of developing tumors (usually non-cancerous) of the central and peripheral nervous system.
      The disease affects essentially every organ system.

      The natural course of NFI over time is poorly understood. For most patients the only
      treatment option is surgery. A better understanding of NF1 may be helpful for the design of
      future treatment studies.

      Objectives:

      To evaluate people with NF1 over 10 years in order to better understand the natural history
      of the disease.

      To characterize the patient population and to examine how NFI affects patients quality of
      life and function.

      Eligibility:

      Children, adolescents, and adults with NF1.

      Design:

      Participants have a comprehensive baseline evaluation including genetic testing, tumor
      imaging, pain and quality-of-life assessments, and neuropsychological, motor and endocrine
      evaluations.

      Patients are monitored every 6 months to every 3 years, depending on their individual
      findings at the baseline study. Tests may include the following, as appropriate:

        -  Medical history, physical examination and blood tests.

        -  Whole body and face photography to monitor visible deformities.

        -  Neuropsychological testing, quality-of-life evaluations, motor function tests,
           endocrinologic evaluations, heart and lung function tests, hearing tests, bone density
           scans and other bone evaluations.

        -  MRI and PET scans to detect and assess plexiform neurofibromas (tumors that arise from
           nerves and can cause serious problems), paraspinal neurofibromas (tumors that arise from
           nerves around the spine and can cause problems by compressing the spinal cord), and
           malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (a type of cancer that arises from a peripheral
           nerve or involves the sheath covering the nerve).

        -  Eye exams, MRI scans and PET scans to evaluate optic pathway gliomas (tumors arising
           from the vision nerves or the brain areas for vision) and the chemicals within the tumor
           and brain.

        -  Eye exams and photographs to evaluate the development of Lisch nodules (non-cancerous
           tumors on the eye).

        -  Photographs of dermal neurofibromas (tumors of the skin), cafe-au-lait spots (dark or
           pigmented areas on the skin that are often the first signs of NF1) and other skin
           problems.

        -  Pain evaluations to monitor the different types of pain patients experience, causes of
           the pain, how often the pain occurs, effect of the pain on quality of life, and what
           pain medications and alternative treatments, such as acupuncture, are effective....

      BACKGROUND:

      Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant, progressive genetic disorder
      characterized by diverse clinical manifestations. Patients with NF1 have an increased risk of
      developing tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system including plexiform
      neurofibromas (PN), dermal neurofibromas, optic pathway tumors, brain tumors, malignant
      peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, and
      pheochromocytomas. In addition, NF1 manifests in essentially every organ system, with for
      example, skeletal and vascular abnormalities, and cognitive deficits. Thus, the care for
      individuals with NF1 requires a multidisciplinary approach. The natural history of NF1
      related tumor and other manifestations is poorly understood, and for most NF1 related tumor
      manifestations the only standard treatment option is surgery. The NIH Clinical Center
      provides the ideal infrastructure for evaluation of the natural history of rare diseases. A
      better understanding of the natural history of NF1 related tumor and other manifestations
      will be helpful for the design of treatment studies. The NCI, POB has an active clinical
      trials program for NF1 related tumor manifestations including PN, MPNST, and in collaboration
      with Dr. Douglas Stewart from the NHGRI, dermal neurofibromas. Unlike individuals with
      refractory solid cancers, individuals with NF1 have near normal life expectancy, and their
      benign tumors progress more slowly than solid cancers. Individuals with NF1 may thus
      participate in multiple treatment trials.

      OBJECTIVES:

      The overall purpose of this descriptive NF1 Natural History study is to serve as an umbrella
      protocol for the ongoing NF1 clinical trials program to allow the longitudinal evaluation of
      individuals with NF1 for NF1 related tumor and non tumor manifestations irrespective whether
      they are currently enrolled on a treatment study or not, and to develop a better
      understanding of the biology of NF1 related manifestations. Following these patients
      longitudinally will allow investigators to develop a better understanding of the natural
      history of these manifestations, provide the basis for the development of endpoints for
      clinical trials and to potentially develop more effective treatments. NF1 manifestations,
      which will be followed longitudinally, include PN, MPNST, optic pathway tumors, dermal
      neurofibromas, NF1 associated pain, and neuropsychological, motor, and endocrine function. A
      comprehensive treatment plan and recommendations will be developed and communicated with the
      patient and primary caregivers.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Children, adolescents, and adults with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of NF1 or a confirmed
      NF1 mutation.

      DESIGN:

      Attempts will be made to have all individuals undergo a comprehensive baseline evaluation
      including clinical phenotyping, genotyping, imaging of tumor manifestations, and pain,
      quality of life, neuropsychological, motor, and endocrine evaluations. The NF1 manifestations
      will be longitudinally monitored with a frequency of every year to every three years, with
      the extent and timing of follow-up evaluations depending on the findings at baseline.

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA PATIENT

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Age:

               -  Less than or equal to 35 years of age for new patients evaluated at NIH.

               -  No upper age limit for patients previously enrolled on clinical trials at NIH or
                  for patients diagnosed with MPNST, or with clinical concern for MPNST, or with
                  infrequent or unusual NF1 related manifestations.

          2. Diagnosis: Patients who are diagnosed with NF1 using the NIH Consensus Conference
             criteria or have a confirmed NF1 mutation with analysis performed in a CLIA-certified
             laboratory. NF1 mutation testing to confirm eligibility will not be performed on this
             protocol, but as part of a separate screening study. Histologic confirmation of NF1
             related benign tumors is not necessary in the presence of consistent clinical and
             radiographic findings, but is required for individuals with MPNST who enroll on this
             study.

             For the clinical diagnosis of NF1 all study subjects must have at least two or more
             diagnostic criteria for NF1 listed below (NIH Consensus Conference):

               1. Six or more cafe-au-lait spots (greater than or equal to 0.5 cm in prepubertal
                  subjects or greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in postpubertal subjects).

               2. Greater than or equal to 2 neurofibromas or 1 plexiform neurofibroma.

               3. Freckling in the axilla or groin.

               4. Optic glioma.

               5. Two or more Lisch nodules.

               6. A distinctive bony lesion (dysplasia of the sphenoid bone or dysplasia or
                  thinning of long bone cortex).

               7. A first-degree relative with NF1.

          3. Prior and current therapy: For NF1 related benign tumor manifestations there is no
             standard effective medical treatment, and surgery is the only standard treatment.
             Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are additional treatment options for malignant NF1
             related tumors. For the purpose of this study subjects who have not previously
             received medical or surgical treatment, patients, who have previously received medical
             or surgical treatment, and subjects who are currently receiving medical treatment
             and/or radiation for a NF1 related manifestation will be eligible. Prior and current
             treatment for NF1 related manifestations will be recorded at trial entry and
             throughout the study.

          4. Performance Status: ECOG less than or equal to 3. Subjects who are wheelchair bound
             because of paralysis will be considered ambulatory when they are up in their
             wheelchair. Subjects have to be able to travel to the NIH for evaluations.

          5. Informed Consent: All patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is less than
             18 years old) must sign an IRB-approved document of informed consent to demonstrate
             their understanding of the investigational nature and the risks of this study before
             any protocol-related studies are performed. When appropriate, pediatric subjects will
             be included in all discussions.

          6. Durable Power of Attorney (DPA): All subjects greater than or equal to 18 years of age
             will be offered the opportunity to assign DPA so that another person can make
             decisions about their medical care if they become incapacitated or cognitively
             impaired.

          7. In addition, subjects participating in evaluation for variation in gene expression
             must:

               -  Have at least 1 plexiform neurofibroma and be able to undergo MRI analysis of the
                  plexiform neurofibroma(s).

               -  If possible, but not absolutely required, have one or both biologic parents (NF1
                  affected or not) willing to donate a blood or cheek swab, or mouthwash sample for
                  DNA extraction. A separate informed consent will be obtained from biologic
                  parents.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. In the opinion of the investigator the patient is not able to return for follow-up
             visits or obtain required follow-up studies.

          2. In the opinion of the investigator the patient is not able to obtain an MRI scan.

          3. Individuals who are pregnant or breast feeding or who become pregnant while enrolled
             on this trial will not be excluded from participation, but will not undergo
             radiographic evaluations or MRI scans requested for research purposes, or other
             studies which might negatively impact on the pregnancy.

        ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA PATIENT FOR OPTIONAL TUMOR / TISSUE BIOPSY FOR RESEARCH

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Age greater than 12 years, and neurofibroma, cafe-au-lait macule, xanthogranuloma, or
             other skin area, which is easily accessible, and sufficiently distant from vital
             structures to allow for biopsy.

          2. Platelet count has to be greater than or equal to 100,000/microL, and PT and PTT have
             to be within normal limits within 1 week of each biopsy.

          3. The subject or parent/guardian must sign a separate biopsy consent, and the
             participant, if minor, must sign a separate assent describing the biopsy.

          4. No medical treatment specifically directed at NF1 related tumor within six weeks prior
             to collection of specimen.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Biopsies will not be performed if the participant requires general anesthesia.

          2. Requirement for medications, which interfere with platelet function, such as aspirin,
             which cannot be stopped within 1 week prior to the biopsy.

        ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA UNAFFECTED SIBLING (NEUROCOGNITIVE AND QOL EVALUATION)

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        1. Availability of a sibling not affected with NF1 for longitudinal evaluation of
        neurocognitive function and quality of life evaluation. An assent form will be prepared for
        unaffected minor siblings, and written informed consent will be obtained from siblings 18
        years of age or older.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        1. A medical condition which would preclude the sibling from participation in the
