      The goal of this study is to identify any side effects caused by the implanting of markers
      via the rectum. The investigators will also try to determine if any other factors (such as
      the position of the markers) influence the risk of side effects. The study procedures consist
      of two questionnaires:The first will be completed immediately after the marker implantation
      and the second questionnaire will be completed during your radiotherapy planning.

      Precise localisation of target organs has become increasingly important with the routine use
      of steep dose gradients from conformal and intensity modulated radiotherapy. This is
      particularly challenging when soft tissue target organs, such as the prostate, displace
      relative to bony anatomy. Although novel imaging techniques are being developed for the
      direct visualisation of such soft tissue structures, contrast and image quality is currently
      limited. However, the use of radio-opaque intra-prostatic fiducial markers(IPM) during high
      dose radiotherapy has proven very effective in terms of improving accuracy, and decreasing
      toxicity.
