      Registry program for volunteers who are willing to serve as control subjects in future
      research studies.

      The registry is a collection of volunteers willing to participate as control subjects in
      research studies. Control subjects are people who do not have a specific disease; therefore
      they can serve a critical role as a comparison with people who have the disease or other
      characteristic being studied. Once registered, participants will be notified about studies
      they may be able to participate in as a control.

      Participation requires:

        1. signing a consent form

        2. answering a short health survey

        3. providing a DNA sample via a mouthwash kit

      The registry allows scientists to select study participants based on whether or not they have
      a specific genetic change that may be relevant to a disease under investigation. Having the
      ability to access controls when needed is an extremely valuable resource that will speed up
      scientific discoveries.
