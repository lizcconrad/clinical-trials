  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized control trial of a behavioral
      intervention delivered by nurses via an electronic medical record (EMR) patient web portal to
      determine if this is an efficacious method for supporting medication adherence.

    <textblock>
      300 adult HIV+ patients will be randomized to one of two arms. 150 will be assigned to
      receive secure messages focused on antiretroviral adherence from a nurse through the health
      plan EMR patient website. 150 will be assigned to an attention control comparison arm, and
      will receive electronic messages from a study staff member that provide information about the
      various features of the health plan patient website. Patients will be invited by mail to be
      telephone screened for enrollment in the study. Patients will be provided the opportunity to
      opt out of being contacted by the study. Eligible and interested patients will be mailed an
      access code and separately emailed a link to a secure study website where they will complete
      a web consent form and a baseline web survey before being randomized to an intervention arm.
      This trial will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of using health information technology
      as an intervention delivery vehicle to improve patient disease management behaviors such as
      treatment adherence.
