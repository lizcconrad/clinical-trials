  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In treatment-resistant depression, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been shown to
      effectively reduce depressive symptoms, though the underlying neurobiological mechanism is
      still unclear. The serotonergic system, and in particular the inhibitory serotonin-1A
      (5-HT1A) receptor, appears to be significantly involved in the effectiveness of ECT. The aim
      of the study is to assess the effects of ECT on the 5-HT1A receptor binding potential (BPND)
      and distribution in humans in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) and the
      radioligand [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635.

      12 patients suffering from severe, therapy-resistant unipolar depression will undergo 3 PET
      scans, two of these scans taking place before the ECT treatment, consisting of 6-14 ECTs, the
      third scan taking place after the ECT treatment.

      This imaging study hypothesizes that upon completion of the ECT, the overall 5-HT1A receptor
      BPND in the brain of depressed patients will significantly change.

      This study would be the first to demonstrate an effect of electroconvulsive therapy on the
      5-HT1A receptor binding in humans in vivo. Given the involvement of the 5-HT1A receptor in
      the pathophysiology of mood disorders, the present study would be an important step towards a
      better understanding of antidepressant treatment and treatment response. By comparing
      treatment effect and the underlying biological mechanism, the study might help to identify
      biomarkers that distinguish patients who are likely to benefit from ECT from patients who
      will rather be non-responders. Finally, by investigating the role of the 5-HT1A receptor in
      ECT, is highly discussed relevance for antidepressant action will be further elucidated and
      might prepare the ground for new therapeutic strategies.
