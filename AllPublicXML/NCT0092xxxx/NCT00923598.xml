  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, observer-masked, controlled study. Subjects will be patients undergoing
      bilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA). One side (left or right) will be randomized to one
      of two treatment groups: a postoperative ropivacaine concentration of 0.1% or 0.4%. The
      contralateral side will receive the other possible ropivacaine concentration of 0.1% or 0.4%.
      The basal rate and patient-controlled bolus volume will depend upon the treatment group, but
      the total dose of local anesthetic is the same for each. For the duration of the study, all
      patients will receive the current usual and customary analgesics for bilateral TKA patients.
      All patients will receive a ropivacaine perineural infusions initiated in the operating room
      and continued until at least the afternoon of postoperative day (POD) 2, as well as oral
      acetaminophen, a sustained-release oral opioid; and celecoxib. Rescue opioid and route of
      administration will be determined by pain severity using a Numeric Rating Scale of 0-10, with
      0 equal to no pain and 10 being the worst imaginable pain.

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test the null hypothesis that differing concentrations of
      ropivacaine (0.1% vs. 0.4%) at an equal total dose has no impact on quadriceps muscle
      strength during a continuous femoral nerve block following total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
      These results will help define the optimal concentration of local anesthetic used for
      continuous peripheral nerve blocks.
