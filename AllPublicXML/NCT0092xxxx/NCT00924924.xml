      The purpose of this project is to determine if a worksite wellness intervention using a
      theoretically-based self-management model increases confidence for carrying out healthy
      behaviors and improves health practices of participating employees. The research questions
      are: 1) does the intervention produce between group differences in behavior self-efficacy and
      actual health behaviors, 2) are self-efficacy and performance of health behaviors related,
      and 3) do changes in self-efficacy result in changes in behavior.

      The purpose of this project is to see if a six-week education program called Act Healthy! led
      by trained volunteers from the UM T.E. Atkins Wellness Program is able to help people who
      take the classes improve their confidence in their ability to choose good health behaviors
      and carry out new behaviors. The project will use the Stanford University Self-management
      education model and train volunteers to be teachers. People who work on the MU campus will be
      recruited to take a 50-minute class once a week for six weeks. Class members will complete
      questionnaires before and after the class and again three months later that ask about their
      health behaviors and confidence to perform health behaviors. This information will be
      analyzed to determine if the classes were effective in helping people act in healthier ways.
