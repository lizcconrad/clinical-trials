    <textblock>
      Palliative radiotherapy is radiation treatment given to help reduce pain or discomfort, or
      other symptoms related to cancer. This is used commonly for cancer that has spread to the
      bones and brain, and for many other primary cancers that are too advanced to be cured,
      including lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and head and neck cancer. The benefits of palliative
      radiotherapy for advanced liver cancer have not been well studied.

      This study is designed to help to see whether palliative radiation therapy is effective in
      controlling pain, discomfort or other symptoms related to liver cancer, and how this therapy
      Phase II Trial of Palliative Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma and
      Hepatic Metastases might affect the quality of life of patients receiving such therapy. This
      information will help the doctors understand if there are specific conditions under which
      radiation therapy is more effective and worthwhile, and how it may affect the quality of life
      for patients who have locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic metastasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The liver is one of the most common sites with tumour involvement, including both primary and
      metastatic disease. Gastrointestinal tumours, breast, lung and melanoma are the most common
      primary sites for hepatic metastases. Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) is the sixth most common
      cancer worldwide, with over 600,000 new cases diagnosed per year. It is the third most common
      cause of cancer related death.Although, predominately a disease in Asia and sub-Saharan
      Africa, the incidence of HCC is increasing in North America. The use of radiation in
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas, as well as hepatic metastases, for palliation is
      uncommon in clinical practice.

      This may be because there is a prevailing perception that radiation to the liver will
      inevitably lead to radiation induced liver disease (RILD). However, several single
      institution, predominantly retrospective studies, have demonstrated effective palliation for
      locally advanced HCC as well as hepatic metastases with minimal toxicity.In this study,
      palliative radiotherapy (RT), delivered in one fraction of 8Gy, will be given to symptomatic
      patients who are not candidates for radical treatment. We hypothesize that palliative RT will
      provide symptomatic relief to a large fraction of the patients, with both primary and
      metastatic disease. We also expect minimal toxicities at this treatment dose.
