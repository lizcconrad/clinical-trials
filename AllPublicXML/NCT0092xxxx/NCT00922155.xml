  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the usefulness of a balloon covered sheath as a guide
      sheath in endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsy and bronchial brushing
      cytology for diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Flexible bronchoscopy has been applied in the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions
      (PPLs) for decades. Without accurate localization, the diagnostic yield for peripheral lung
      cancers by these procedures is limited and variable. Localization of peripheral lung cancers
      can be aided by the use of computed tomography or fluoroscopy during fiberoptic bronchoscopy.
      However, radiation exposure to staffs and patients is always a concern in these procedures.

      The clinical application of endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) included determination of the
      depth of tumor invasion in tracheobronchial wall, evaluation of tracheobronchial structure
      before therapeutic bronchoscopy, localization of site of biopsy, EBUS-guided transbronchial
      needle aspiration, and analysis of peripheral tumor. Under EBUS guidance, the diagnostic
      yield of transbronchial lung biopsy in patients with peripheral lung cancer by bronchoscopic
      examination was significantly improved without an increase in the complication rate. More
      recently, with the aid of a guide sheath (EBUS-GS), EBUS has been shown to increase the
      diagnostic yield of PPLs, even in patients with fluoroscopy-invisible lung nodules, and avert
      the need for surgical procedures.

      Most recently used GS for EBUS are specified for the EBUS probe with an external diameter of
      1.9 mm. Such a thin caliber GS is designed to reach the PPLs, sometimes with an aid of
      curette, to provide an exact site for repeated obtainment of adequate specimens. We wonder
      whether a larger caliber sheath transformed from a balloon covered with an external diameter
      of 2.6 mm without reaching the PPLs, can offer similar effectiveness in diagnosis of the
      PPLs. The results may provide an alternative way for EBUS-GS especially in those countries
      where the commonly used GS of EBUS is not available.

    <description>The guide sheath (GS) was originally the balloon covered sheath (MAJ-643R, external diameter 2.6mm) of the EBUS probe. The two ends of the balloon covered sheath were cut and trimmed. The EBUS probe was covered with guide sheath and then inserted through the working channel to the targeted bronchus.</description>
