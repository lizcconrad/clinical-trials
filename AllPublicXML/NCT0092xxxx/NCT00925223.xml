    <textblock>
      Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), originally known to be a member of the nerve growth
      factor family, has aroused attention as a modulator in visceral hyperalgesia recently.
      Visceral hypersensitivity is recognized as a clinical hallmark in IBS patients. So in this
      study, the investigators will focus on the role of BDNF in colonic hyperalgesia in IBS
      patients.

        Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder
        characterized by recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel
        habits in the absence of structural and biochemical abnormalities.
