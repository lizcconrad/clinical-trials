  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether topical application of rapamycin can lead to
      reduction in size and/or number of fibrofolliculomas in BHD patients and may prevent the
      growth of new ones. Secondary we evaluate rapamycin safety, formula acceptance and patient
      satisfaction.
