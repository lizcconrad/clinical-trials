      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and how the body affects a drug (CNTO
      1959) in healthy volunteers and in patients with psoriasis.

      CNTO 1959 is an experimental drug. In this study, CNTO 1959 will be tested to see if it may
      be useful in treating psoriasis. This disease causes inflammation of skin and nails. This is
      a Randomized (study drug assigned by chance), Double-blind (neither physician nor patient
      knows the name of the assigned drug), Placebo-controlled study of the experimental drug CNTO
      1959 in both healthy patients as well as patients with psoriasis. This study will compare the
      effects (both good and bad) of CNTO 1959 to those of placebo. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and potential side effects of CNTO 1959 given to healthy volunteers and
      patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. In addition, the investigators will measure how
      much study drug is in the blood following a dose of CNTO 1959, and determine if the body
      makes antibodies to it. (An antibody is a protein made by the body in response to a foreign
      substance). Safety assessments will be performed throughout the study and include obtaining
      and evaluating laboratory tests, vital signs (e.g., blood pressure), and the occurrence and
      severity of adverse events. This is the first time that CNTO 1959 will be studied in humans.
      There will be 2 parts to this study. The first part of this study will involve healthy
      volunteers, and the second part of the study will involve patients with psoriasis. About 47
      healthy volunteers and 24 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis will take part in the
      study. Enrollment for the healthy volunteer part is closed as of 23SEP09. CNTO 1959 will be
      administered as either an intravenous (IV) infusion or subcutaneous (SC) injection. Duration
      of participation may be up to 28 weeks.
