    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to determine whether occlusion of
      triamcinolone 0.1% cream (TAC) with hydrogel patch improves its efficacy in treating eczema.
      A secondary objective is to determine whether eczema improves under occlusion with hydrogel
      patch alone, without TAC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 6-week, open label, bilaterally-controlled single center study involving 30
      subjects age 13 and older with eczema. The primary objective of this clinical study is to
      determine whether occlusion of triamcinolone 0.1% cream (TAC) used to treat eczema with
      hydrogel patch improves its efficacy. A secondary objective is to determine whether eczema
      improves under occlusion with hydrogel patch alone. All subjects will have 3 target lesions
      of similar severity followed throughout the study. Patients will apply hydrogel patch alone
      to the first lesion, TAC 0.1% cream to the second lesion, and TAC 0.1% cream occluded by
      hydrogel patch to the third lesion. All treatments are twice a day for a maximum of 4 weeks
      or until lesions are cleared. The modified Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score will
      be used to evaluate each lesion.

    <description>Percent change in mean EASI score week 0 to week 6: Each lesion was scored using a 12-point modified Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) at baseline and 2 weeks after the 4-week treatment period (week6). An experienced evaluator assessed each lesion on the severity of 4 domains, with higher scores indicating more severity: 1) intensity of redness (erythema), 2) thickness (induration, papulation, oedema), 3) scratching (excoriation) and 4) lichenification (lined skin) as as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) and severe (3).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has signed the informed consent form and Health Insurance Portability and
             Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization form;

          2. Male or female subject at least 12 years of age; subjects under 18 years of age will
             need parental or official guardian consent.

          3. A diagnosis of eczema with at least three lesions no larger than 7 by 7 cm on either
             the trunk, arms, or legs that would serve as target lesions. The lesions must be wide
             enough apart so that there is no overlap of hydrogel patches. All three lesions must
             have at least 5 out of 12 points on the modified EASI scale. Each of the three lesions
             must have no greater than 1 point difference from each other on the modified EASI
             score. (If the subject can identify specific eczema lesions that are more pruritic,
             recalcitrant and/or tend to initiate the itch-scratch cycle, then those lesions will
             be preferentially selected as the target lesions.)

          4. Any additional diagnoses must, in the investigator's opinion, not preclude the subject
             from safely participating in this study or interfere with the evaluation of the
             subject's eczema;

          5. Subject is able to completely discontinue the use of any medication or therapy (other
             than study medications) for relief of eczema in the target areas to be treated;

          6. Subject is able to completely discontinue the use of any systemic medication or
             therapy (e.g. oral medications, phototherapy, herbal remedies, or acupuncture) for
             relief of eczema;

          7. Subject must be reliable and mentally competent to complete study measurements;

          8. Subject is able to understand and agrees to comply with study requirements, attend
             study visits, and comply with the restrictions during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with exclusively hand, face, foot, and/or groin dermatitis

          2. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the test medications;

          3. Pigmentation, extensive scarring, or pigmented lesions in affected areas that would
             interfere with evaluation of efficacy parameters;

          4. Clinically infected eczema at baseline.

          5. Any evidence of atrophy in the areas selected for treatment with topical
             corticosteroid;

          6. Subjects requiring any other medication (topical or systemic) that may affect the
             course of the disease during the study period (e.g. oral corticosteroids,
             immunosuppressants, antibiotics, sedating antihistamines). Inhaled steroids will be
             permitted.

          7. Topical therapies (other than non-prescription emollients) on potential target lesions
             within one week of starting study treatment;

          8. Systemic therapy, phototherapy, or a systemic investigational therapy for eczema
             within 30 days prior to study entry;

          9. Subject is considered unreliable as to medication compliance or adherence to scheduled
             appointments as determined by the investigators.
