    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if liquid supplemental melatonin is an effective
      treatment for children with autism who have sleep problems related to insomnia (difficulty
      falling asleep).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep difficulties in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are common reasons why
      parents seek medical intervention for their children. Identifying a safe and effective
      pharmacologic agent that promotes sleep in ASD would favorably impact the lives of these
      children and their families. In this study we plan to determine the dose-response,
      tolerability and any adverse effects of supplemental melatonin in 30 children with ASD.The
      melatonin dose levels are 1mg, 3mg, 6mg, and 9mg. After a 3 week baseline period, the child
      will begin melatonin at 1mg and will dose escalate every three weeks until he/she is falling
      asleep within 30 minutes of bedtime at least 5/7 nights per week. No child will take more
      than 9 mg of supplemental melatonin.

    <description>We hope to target 12 of the 30 children to be enrolled for this study to participate in a pharmacokinetic arm of the study. These 12 children would be receiving overnight sleep studies prior to receiving the first dose of melatonin and again at about every 3 week intervals each time the dose increases until the child is falling asleep within 30 minutes of bedtime on 5/7 nights per week. During the sleep studies an intravenous catheter will be placed in the child's arm to sample small amounts of blood throughout the day (about 3 teaspoons of blood)to allow us to look at how melatonin is produced in children with autism who have sleep problems.</description>

    <description>Of the 30 targeted participants, 18 will be randomized at the first three week dosing period {1mg of melatonin}. The randomization will be single blind to the parent in a 5:1 ratio (15 children will receive melatonin, and 3 children will receive a flavored placebo at the first 3-week period only). After the initial 3-week dose cycle of 1 mg, all children randomized to placebo will begin 3 mg of melatonin and will continue in dose increase (6mg, 9 mg)until they meet the criteria of falling asleep within 30 minutes of bedtime 5/7 nights per week. No child will take more than 9 mg.</description>

    <description>Liquid melatonin will be given to the parent. There are 4 dose levels (1mg, 3mg, 6 mg, and 9mg)of melatonin that will be used at 3 week intervals. The child will start with 1mg and the dose will be increased at 3 week intervals until the child is falling asleep within 30 minutes of bedtime on 5/7 nights per week. Once this goal is reached the child will stay on that dose through the remainder of the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with autism ages 4-10 years.

          -  Diagnosis of autism based on Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS).

          -  Time to fall asleep of 30 minutes or longer by parent report at least 3 nights/week in
             the last 3 months.

          -  Children may take seasonal allergy medications.

          -  Children may take the following medications for the same dose at least 3 months:
             Citalopram (Celexa), Escitalopram (Lexapro), Amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall),
             Atomoxetine (Strattera), Methylphenidate(Ritalin), Dextroamphetamine(Dexedrine),
             Risperidone (Risperdal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children taking medications other than those in the inclusion criteria.

          -  Children with primary sleep disorder other than insomnia (such as sleep-disordered
             breathing).

          -  Children with non-febrile unprovoked epileptic seizure within the last two years.

          -  Children with liver disease or high fat diets, as melatonin metabolism may be affected
             in these children.

          -  Children who are visually impaired (partially or completely blind) as light suppresses
             melatonin synthesis and these children may have altered diurnal melatonin rhythms.

          -  Children with known genetic syndromes co-morbid with autism including fragile X, Down
             syndrome, neurofibromatosis, or tuberous sclerosis.

          -  Children who have outside normal limits on blood work for complete blood count, liver
             and renal function and hormone levels of ACTH, cortisol, LH, FSH, prolactin,
             testosterone and estradiol.

          -  Tanner staging beyond level 1 at any time point in the study.

          -  Children whose assessment score does not place them on the autism spectrum.
