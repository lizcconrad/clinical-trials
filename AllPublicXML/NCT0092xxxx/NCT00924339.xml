  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH MIM#143890), an inherited disorder of lipoprotein
      metabolism, is a risk for early cardiovascular disease (CVD). This autosomal dominant disease
      is characterized by markedly elevated plasma concentrations of low density lipoprotein (LDL)
      and total cholesterol (TC), typically well above the 95th percentile for age and sex (1). A
      defective gene for the LDL-receptor is inherited from one parent (2). The disorder was first
      noted by Müller in 1939, including familial clustering of tendon xanthomas, high serum
      cholesterol and early MIs (3).

      The present study aims: a) to strengthen the evidence for the hypocholesterolaemic effect of
      soy protein in children and adolescents affected with FH b) to monitor the compliance of soy
      consumption as a possible causal factor linked to the variable lipaemic response observed in
      the previous study c) to assess certain safety markers of soy food consumption (hormone
      status, thyroid function, bone metabolism) 4) to monitor the adherence to the soy
      intervention additionally comprise collections of blood and urine samples.

      Hypothesis 1: Soya protein-substituted diets change total and LDL-cholesterol, Apolipoprotein
      B and uric acid serum concentrations.

      Primary parameters: Blood analysis

      Hypothesis 2: Children and adolescents with FH, in which the cholesterol, LDL-lipoprotein and
      Apolipoprotein B concentration is not influenced by means of soy protein substituted diet -
      is it because of a) the effect of non-responder? or b) subjects, who have no regularly
      dietary soya intake.

      Secondary parameters: isoflavones daidzein, glycetein, genistein and equol in the urine
      samples

      The pilot study will include 30 children and adolescents with heterozygous Familial
      Hypercholesterolemia. All children and adolescents will be recruited from the Paediatrics
      Outpatient Department of the Division of Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism at the Vienna
      University Hospital. Furthermore, children of patients with heart stroke, patients from other
      paediatrics and patients from other children hospitals will be recruited. Inclusion criteria:
      To be eligible the study participants will have to be aged between 4 and 18 years, do not
      regularly eat soy food and do not have a protein allergy. The participants are recruited by
      their familial history and/or their cholesterol levels (elevated over 130 mg/dl and total
      cholesterol elevated over 200 mg/dl) according to American Academy of Paediatrics criteria.
      Furthermore they should keep a 7-day nutrition record at the beginning of study. Exclusion
      criteria: Patients younger than 4 years and older than 18 years, children who are extremely
      underweight according to Kromeyer Hausschild´s criteria. Children and adolescents with mental
      disability and with simultaneous medication and protein allergy. Complete physical
      information will be done and a thorough medical history will be taken in all participants.
      Physical examination and blood sampling will be performed in the outpatient clinic setting as
      done routinely.
