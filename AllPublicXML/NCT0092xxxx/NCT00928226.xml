  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The maximum tolerated dose of 3-session (ie, treatment) stereotactic radiosurgery to treat
      brain metastases greater than 4.2 cm3 in size will be determined.

      This study investigates if increasing radiation dose improves outcome for patients without
      greater toxicity (side effects).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 years and older with pathologically-proven solid tumor malignancy and 1 to 4
             brain metastases, one of which is 4.2 to 33.5 cm^3.

          -  Systemic therapy: Prior cytoxic systemic therapy must be completed ≥ 5 days prior to
             radiosurgery. No concurrent cytoxic systemic therapy along with SRS. Cytoxic systemic
             therapy to start ≥ 5 days after the completion of SRS.

          -  Prior surgery or SRS is allowed as long as the target metastatic lesion in this study
             has not previously been treated with SRS.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

          -  Life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously treated with whole brain irradiation

          -  Metastatic lesion in question has previously been treated with SRS.

          -  &gt; 4 total brain metastases at the time of initial evaluation.

          -  Pediatric patients (age &lt; 18), pregnant women, and those who are unable to give
             informed consent.
