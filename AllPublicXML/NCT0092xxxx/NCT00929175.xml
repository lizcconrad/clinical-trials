  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has been linked to resistant hypertension, but the
      effect of treatment of OSAS on the resistant hypertension have no been established. In a
      double-blind randomized clinical trial patients with resistant hypertension with at least
      moderate sleep apnea will be randomized to receive therapeutic CPAP or Placebo CPAP for eight
      weeks in an ambulatory set. The investigators want to determine any difference on
      hypertension control between the 2 management strategies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial. Participants were consecutive
      patients with resistant hypertension, defined as uncontrolled BP, despite the concurrent use
      of 3 or more antihypertensive agents, including a diuretic, with adherence to treatment and
      without white coat phenomenon. All participants should have a diagnosis of at least moderate
      OSAS, defined by AHI &gt; 15 in a portable monitoring sleep exam. Participants were assigned to
      active CPAP or sham-CPAP. The main outcome was change in 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure
      (ABP) monitoring values from baseline to two months of active CPAP or sham CPAP

    <description>The sham-CPAP was the same equipment used for active CPAP (Respironics Remstar-Auto, Murraysville, PA) fixed in the lowest pressure (4cmH2) and modified as recommended by Farré et al. The differences between the two were undetectable except for the pressure generated in the facial mask in the sham-CPAP that was no greater than 1cm H2O.</description>
