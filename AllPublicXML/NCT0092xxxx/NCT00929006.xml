  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if in late pubertal girls without hyperandrogenemia
      (HA), progesterone (P) will acutely reduce waking lutenizing hormone (LH) frequency to a
      greater extent than sleep-associated LH frequency. We hypothesize that in late pubertal girls
      with HA: (a) waking and sleep-associated LH frequency will be elevated (compared to
      controls); and (b) P will suppress waking LH frequency to a lesser degree than it does in
      girls without HA.

      During early puberty, LH frequency increases during sleep; but in late puberty, LH frequency
      decreases overnight. Nonetheless, nocturnal LH frequency is similar (~0.5 pulses per hour) in
      early and late pubertal girls. Preliminary data in early pubertal girls suggests that
      progesterone acutely slows waking LH frequency, but does not acutely change nocturnal LH
      frequency. We hypothesize that daytime LH frequency is regulated primarily by sex steroid
      negative feedback, while sleep-associated LH frequency is not; and that androgens interfere
      with sex steroid suppression of daytime LH frequency. We propose to assess this further using
      a protocol in which short-term Progesterone and placebo is given to late pubertal girls (in a
      cross-over fashion), with subsequent assessment of LH pulse frequency (with sampling
      occurring while awake and while asleep). We propose that any effect of Progesterone will be
      blunted or absent in late pubertal girls with hyperandrogenemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Late pubertal girls (Tanner breast stage 3, 4, or 5)

          2. Postmenarcheal, but no more than 4 y postmenarcheal

          3. Age 10-17 y

          3. Inability to comprehend what will be done during the study or why it will be done

          4. Being a study of GnRH pulse regulation in adolescent girls with and without HA, boys
             are excluded

          5. Obesity associated with a diagnosed (genetic) syndrome (e.g., Prader-Willi syndrome,
             leptin deficiency), obesity related to medications (e.g., glucocorticoids), etc.

             will be accepted in such girls)

         10. 17-hydroxyprogesterone &gt; 250 ng/dl, which suggests the possibility of congenital

             growth in children, striae)

         17. Hematocrit &lt; 36% and hemoglobin &lt; 12 g/dl (specifically, documentation of a hematocrit
             &gt;= 36% or a hemoglobin &gt;= 12 g/dl in the month prior to GCRC admission is required for
             the frequent sampling protocol in the GCRC)

         18. Significant history of cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., known or suspected
             congestive heart failure; asthma requiring intermittent systemic corticosteroids;
             etc.)

         19. Persistent liver test abnormalities (confirmed on repeat), with the exception that
             mild bilirubin elevations will be accepted in the setting of known Gilbert's syndrome

             metabolism, or blood pressure can be taken in the 3 months prior to the first
             inpatient GCRC study (or in the 2 months prior to screening). Such medications include
             oral contraceptive pills, progestins, metformin, glucocorticoids, psychotropics, and
             sympathomimetics/stimulants (e.g., methylphenidate). Patients taking restricted
             medications will be excluded unless written permission (for the subjects to
             discontinue the medication) is received from the subject's physician.

         23. Weight &lt; 22 kg is an absolute exclusion criterion (to ensure safe blood withdrawal)
