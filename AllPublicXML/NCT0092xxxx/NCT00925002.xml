  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, open-label study designed to obtain additional, long-term, open-label
      safety and efficacy data for Fx-1006A and to continue to provide patients with 20 mg oral
      Fx-1006A (soft gel capsule) who have completed either Protocol Fx-006 (a 1 year, open-label
      extension study to Protocol Fx-005 which is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      18-month study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Fx-1006A) or Protocol Fx1A-201 (a Phase
      2, open-label study to evaluate TTR stabilization as well as the safety and tolerability of
      Fx-1006A) until market availability of Fx-1006A in individual patients' country of residence.

      Patients who successfully complete Protocol Fx-006 or Fx1A-201 will report to the clinical
      unit on Day 0 (Baseline) to sign the informed consent form and determine their eligibility
      for Protocol Fx1A-303. In addition, on Day 0 (Baseline), patients will have their entrance
      criteria reviewed and medical history and demography for all patients will be obtained. The
      relevant end of study assessments from Protocols Fx1A-201 and Fx-006 will serve as Baseline
      assessments for Protocol Fx1A-303 if these examinations were performed within 30 days of Day
      0 (Baseline). For any patient successfully completing Protocol Fx-006, the Karnofsky
      Performance Scale Index will be assessed and the cranial nerve and upper limb components of
      the NIS will be performed and combined with the NIS-LL data from the end of study visit from
      Protocol Fx-006.

      If there is more than 30 days between the final study visit of Fx-006 or Fx1A-201 and Day 0
      (Baseline) of Fx1A-303, all Day 0 study procedures will be performed (i.e., no data from the
      final study visits from the previous studies will be utilized).

      Eligible patients will begin once-daily dosing with 20 mg Fx-1006A at home on Day 1 (i.e.,
      first dose) and will return to the clinical unit for study visits every 6 months.

      Adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medication use will be collected at each 6-month visit
      to the clinical unit and, if female, a urine pregnancy test will be performed. An abbreviated
      physical examination (including weight and vitals signs) will be conducted at every other 6
      month visit. A telephone call will be made at 3-month intervals between clinic visits to
      assess safety and the use of concomitant medications.

      For the evaluation of efficacy, the NIS, Norfolk QOL-DN, and Karnofsky Performance Scale
      Index will be performed on an annual basis (i.e., every other 6-month visit).

      An end of study visit will occur upon patient withdrawal (for any reason), program
      discontinuation by the Sponsor, or upon market availability of Fx-1006A in individual
      patients' country of residence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has successfully completed either Protocol Fx-006 or Fx1A-201.

          -  If female, patient is post-menopausal, surgically sterilized, or willing to use two
             acceptable methods of birth control (i.e., hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine
             device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide) throughout the study and
             for 3 months from the end of the study. (A condom alone is not considered an
             acceptable method of birth control.)

          -  Patient is, in the opinion of the investigator, willing and able to comply with the
             investigational product regimen and all other study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has not successfully completed either Protocol Fx-006 or Fx1A-201.

          -  Chronic use of non-protocol approved non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
             defined as greater than 3 to 4 times/month. The following NSAIDs are allowed:
             acetylsalicylic acid, etodolac, ibuprofen, indomethicin, ketoprofen, nabumetone,
             naproxen, nimesulide, piroxicam, and sulindac.

          -  If female, patient is pregnant or breast feeding.

          -  Clinically significant medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would place the patient at an increased risk to participate in the study.
