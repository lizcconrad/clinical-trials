  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic osteoarthritis (OA) pain of the knee is not effectively abrogated by the available
      non-pharmacologic or pharmacologic treatments. Radiofrequency (RF) neurotomy is a therapeutic
      alternative for chronic pain. Here, the researchers investigate the efficacy of RF neurotomy
      applied to articular branches (genicular nerves) in treating knee joint pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The knee joint is innervated by articular branches of various nerves (femoral, common
      peroneal, saphenous, tibial and obturator) (Kennedy et al. 1982; Hirasawa et al. 2000). These
      articular branches around the knee joint are known as genicular nerves. Several genicular
      nerves can be easily approached percutaneously under fluoroscopic guidance. In our study,
      genicular nerves were effectively blocked with local anesthetics under fluoroscopic guidance,
      leading to a significant reduction in knee pain. Rf neurotomy is based on the theory that
      cutting the nerve supply to a painful structure may alleviate pain and restore function. we
      evaluate the efficacy of RF neurotomy in reducing pain and improving function in the elderly
      with chronic knee OA.

    <description>RF cannula was advanced percutaneously towards areas connecting the shaft to epicondyle of femur or tibia. Lidocaine (1 mL of 2%) was injected before activation of the RF generator (NeuroThermTM, Morgan automation LTD, Liss, UK). RF electrode was inserted through RF cannula. The temperature of the electrode tip was raised to 70℃ for 90 seconds by radiofrequency generator.</description>
