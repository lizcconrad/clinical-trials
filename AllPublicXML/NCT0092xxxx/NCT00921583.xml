  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 1986, newly developed titanium implants with a TPS surface have been utilized for the
      treatment of partially edentulous patients with implant supported fixed dental prostheses
      (FTP). In the beginning, these implant types have been sold by Straumann under the brand name
      &quot;Bonefit implants&quot;, later &quot;ITI Dental Implant System&quot; From the beginning, the first 75
      patients have been documented in a prospective case series study, and clinical and
      radiographic results have been reported at 1-year, 3-years, 5-years and 8-years.

      The aim of the present study is to examine the long-term outcomes of this original group of
      patients with at 20 years of clinical function, and to assess the frequency of biological and
      technical complications during this follow-up period.

      Background:

      The rehabilitation with implant-supported restorations has been a successful treatment
      modality in fully and partially edentulous patients since the early 1980s . Today, partially
      edentulous individuals have become the main group of patients being considered for implant
      therapy, and several reports have been published showing favorable long-term outcomes with
      different dental implant systems. In systematic reviews analyzing the long-term performance
      of osseointegrated implants, clinical studies with 5-year observation periods are frequently
      included. However, studies with a 10-year observation period are sparse. Only three clinical
      studies with an observation period of 20-years in edentulous or partially edentulous patients
      have been found.

      Objective:

      The objective is to evaluate dental implants after 20 years of function.

      Methods:

      Partially edentulous patients provided with implants between 1986 and 1989 at the Department
      of Oral Surgery and Stomatology at the University of Bern recruited for a clinical and
      radiographic evaluation 20 years after implant installation. A total of 75 patients with 102
      implants will be recalled for a clinical and radiographic examination. All implants installed
      were hollow screw and hollow cylinder implants (Straumann, Waldenburg, Switzerland) with a
      rough TPS surface. They were placed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The
      superstructures consistent in single crowns or fixed partial dentures, which were
      incorporated 4-6 months postsurgically. All patients will be evaluated using information from
      patient's charts and from the 20-year examination. Apical radiographs will be taken from the
      implant and the adjacent tooth. The marginal bone level around the adjacent tooth will also
      be calculated using the implant shoulder a reference point.
