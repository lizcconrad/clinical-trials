      In this study, radiation therapy plans will be made for 20 consecutive patients with
      mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. One plan is done using a
      breathing adapted pre-chemo PET-CT scan fused with a post-chemo planning CT scan and another
      plan is done using the standard procedure with pre-chemo PET-CT fused with post-chemo
      planning CT scan. Dose levels to the lymphoma and to the organs of risk will be compared in
      each patient. The best radiation therapy plan will be used to treat the patient.

    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy using a breathing adapted therapy scan is a routine technique in breast cancer.
      Breathing adapted radiotherapy may also reduce radiation dose to organs at risk, e.g. heart
      and lung, in patients with mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

      Optimal radiation therapy of these lymphoma patients includes radiotherapy planning using
      pre-chemotherapy PET-scanning, fused with a post-chemo planning CT-scan. This makes accurate
      treatment of pre-chemo involved volume possible and also accurate radiation of the post-chemo
      involved volume possible. Thus, the optimal breathing adapted radiation requires planning
      using a breathing adapted pre-chemo PET-CT scan fused with a breathing adapted post-chemo
      planning CT scan. In this study, 20 consecutive patients with mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma
      and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas will have combination therapy with chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy to involved nodes. Two radiation therapy plans will be made for each
      patient: one using a breathing adapted pre-chemo PET-CT scan fused with a post-chemo planning
      CT scan, and one using the standard procedure of a pre-chemo PET-CT scan fused with
      post-chemo planning CT scan. Dose levels to the lymphoma and to the organs of risk will be
      compared in each patient. The best radiation therapy plan will be used to treat the patient.
