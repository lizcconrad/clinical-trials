    <textblock>
      In this study, Malathion Gel 0.5% will be compared to Nix (permethrin 1%) as a treatment for
      head lice in patients 2 years of age and older. Malathion Gel 0.5% is a new formulation of an
      established head lice treatment. The new formulation has been evaluated in 2 previous studies
      of patients 2 years of age and older.

      This is a Phase III, multi-center, investigator-blinded, two-arm, randomized, parallel group
      study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of a Malathion Gel, 0.5% formulation, manufactured
      by Taro. The objective is to show superiority of the novel product to an active control, Nix®
      Crème Rinse, manufactured by Insight Pharmaceuticals.

    <description>Treatment Success was evaluated using the Efficacy Intention to Treat (eITT) (LOCF) Efficacy ITT (eITT) was considered definitive.
The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of index subjects who were considered a Treatment Success 14 days after their last treatment (Day 14 visit if only treated on Day 1, Day 21 visit if treated on Day 1 and Day 7).
