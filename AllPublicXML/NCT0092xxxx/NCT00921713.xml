      The purpose of this proposal is to develop and test the efficacy in a randomized, controlled
      clinical trial of an Oncology Nurse Care Management (ONCM) program to support cancer patients
      early in their course. The ONCM program will be compared with an Enhanced Usual Care (EUC)
      program that will provide education materials and treatment resources for patients. Efficacy
      will be measured by differences over time in participant-reported Quality of Life, Symptoms
      and Emotional Distress, and Quality of Care between patients receiving ONCM versus EUC.

      Overall Goal:

      Our primary goal is to assess the impact on quality of life, quality of care, and other
      outcomes of two programs designed to support patients newly diagnosed with breast,
      colorectal, and lung cancer patients. The Oncology Nurse Care Management (ONCM) and Enhanced
      Usual Care (EUC) interventions will be implemented and evaluated among enrollees of Group
      Health.

      Specific Aims:

      A.1. To develop a robust early cancer notification system based on automated data to
      facilitate intervention shortly after cancer diagnosis.

      A.2. To implement an Oncology Nurse Care Management program that addresses patient questions,
      symptoms, psychosocial needs, and facilitates timely, coordinated care.

      A.3. To compare the impact of the Oncology Nurse Care Manager Program with Enhanced Usual
      Care in Group Health cancer patients using a randomized clinical trial design. Our two
      primary outcomes are quality of life and patients' perspectives of quality of care. As
      secondary outcomes, we will evaluate the impact of the intervention on psychosocial distress
      and depression.

    <description>In addition to this mailed information packet, patients in OCNM will be contacted by an experienced Oncology nurse with additional training in self-management support and psychosocial care. The intervention nurse, supported by a Medical Oncologist and Clinical Psychologist, will work closely with patients, their primary care physicians, and other clinicians to assure that patient needs discussed are met. The nurses will be trained in and employ proven counseling and psychotherapeutic approaches-behavioral activation and problem-solving treatment. The multi-component intervention will be based on the Chronic Care Model's six elements (health care organization, community resources, self-management support, delivery system design, decision support, and clinical information system).</description>
