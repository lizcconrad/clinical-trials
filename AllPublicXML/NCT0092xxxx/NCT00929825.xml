  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (THSC) is a therapeutic modality developed
      for the treatment of various diseases such as leukemia, bone marrow aplasia, lymphomas,
      multiple myeloma, among others. Most patients who undergo the THSC usually have oral
      manifestations as a result of immunosuppression achieved by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.
      The most common complications are the reduction of salivary flow, mucositis and
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). These conditions can be very debilitating and interfere
      with medical therapy, leading to systemic complications, affecting the prognosis and
      increasing the length of hospitalization of the patient and the costs of treatment. To date,
      there is no protocol that prevents the reduction of salivary flow and minimizes the
      occurrence of mucositis and GVHD in these patients. This study aims to verify the
      effectiveness of treatment with two sialogogues (Hyperboloid and TENS [transcutaneous
      electrical stimulation]) to restore the flow and biochemical composition of saliva in
      patients undergoing THSC myeloablative and non-myeloablative conditionating regime.

      It will be included in the sample a total of 60 patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (THSC) at the Clinical Hospital. Patients will be randomly divided into four
      groups, each with 15 subjects: group I patients who will use only the mechanical sialogogue;
      group II patients who will make use of electrical sialogogue (TENS); group III patients who
      will make use of mechanical sialogogue associated with TENS and group IV patients who will
      not receive therapy (control).

      The project will present the following experimental design:

        1. Selection of patients to be subjected to the transplantation of hematopoietic stem
           cells;

        2. Implementation of a reference sialometry;

        3. Institution of therapy with mechanical and electrical sialogogue;

        4. Clinical examination, assessment of the occurrence of mucositis and obtention of saliva
           samples pre- and post-THSC;

        5. Qualitative analysis of saliva (turbidity, viscosity and color);

        6. Biochemical analysis of saliva;

        7. Statistical analysis of data.
