    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study involving a small number of blind subject to evaluate the
      effectiveness of using a software and associated hardware components to assist the blind in
      identifying and locating objects of interests and to assist in way finding tasks. After the
      system has been successfully tested by the blindfolded engineers, it will be evaluated in a
      small number of blind subjects.

      This is primarily an engineering project to develop computer vision algorithms for an
      integrated system comprising of a laptop computer, webcam, gps, digital compass, microphone,
      and stereo earphones. The system will be voice controlled. The algorithm will be trained to
      identify and located objects and navigationally landmarks in real-time, previously selected
      by sighted developers. After the system has passed objective engineering milestones, blind
      subjects will be tested to determine whether the novel system will improve the ability of the
      blind to travel over a test course in a hospital setting.

    <description>8 blind subjects are asked to use a prototype computer vision system to determine the challenges facing computer vision based indoor navigation.
Subjects are asked to travel through the hallways of a large hospital from the front entrance to a side entrance. The pathway consists of 9 segments including corners, four-way intersections, and doorways, and the total length of the route was approximately 200 meters. This challenging route was designed to stress the capabilities of the navigation system. It is a route that even sighted persons may find difficult to follow without practice. Pedestrian traffic was present throughout the route and lighting conditions could change in two of the segments where there were windows and doors.</description>
