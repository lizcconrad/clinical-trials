  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of SRT501 (5.0
      g) with or without concurrent bortezomib administration, when administered once daily in 21
      day cycles, in male and female subjects with Multiple Myeloma.

      The purpose is also to define objective response (ORR, CR, PR, MR, SD) and time to
      progression (TTP) of SRT501 with or without concurrent bortezomib administered concurrently
      in male and female subjects with Multiple Myeloma.

      In addition, 15 subjects will participate in a sub-study to assess the pharmacokinetics of
      SRT501.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an, open-label, phase II study of SRT501, alone or in combination with bortezomib, in
      subjects with measurable Multiple Myeloma. Sixty-one (61) evaluable subjects, who fulfill the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in this study. Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples
      will be collected from a subset of 15 subjects to determine SRT501 plasma concentrations in
      this patient population. Subjects will sign the informed consent form prior to any study
      related procedures. If eligible, subjects will receive 5.0 g of SRT501 to be administered for
      20 consecutive days in a 21 day cycle for a maximum of 12 cycles. SRT501 will be administered
      as an oral suspension product at the same time each morning (approximately 15-30 minutes
      following consumption of breakfast) on all dosing days. Safety assessments will be performed
      continuously throughout the cycle and these will be reviewed for all subjects at Day 21 of
      each cycle prior to subjects proceeding to the next cycle. SRT501 will not be administered on
      Day 21 of each cycle. Subjects will be assessed for efficacy and response of SRT501 at the
      end of every 2 cycles (6 weeks) of treatment. When necessary, a bone marrow biopsy and CT (or
      appropriate radiographic imaging) of the chest and abdomen/pelvis will be performed to
      confirm response. After the first two cycles of SRT501 treatment and review of the efficacy
      and response analysis, any subject who exhibits stable disease or better with SRT501
      monotherapy may continue on SRT501 monotherapy (5.0 g/day) for an additional two cycles. If,
      after the first two cycles of SRT501 monotherapy, a subject exhibits PD, then that subject
      will receive bortezomib (1.3 mg/ m2 on Day 1, Day 4, Day 8, and Day 11 in a 21 day cycle) in
      conjunction with SRT501 (5.0 g/day). Bortezomib will be administered prior to SRT501
      administration. If after two additional cycles of SRT501 monotherapy (4 cycles total), the
      subject exhibits a MR or better, they will remain on SRT501 (5.0 g/day) treatment until they
      are judged to have SD or PD. At the time the subject is judged to have SD or PD after
      receiving at least four cycles of SRT501 (5.0 g/day) monotherapy, then they may also receive
      bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 on Day 1, Day 4, Day 8, and Day 11 in a 21 day cycle) in conjunction
      with daily SRT501 dosing. If at any point while a subject is receiving SRT501 and bortezomib
      the subject is assessed to have PD, then they will be removed from the study and will be
      required to undergo End of Study assessments/follow-up approximately 28 days (+/- 7 days)
      following the last dose of SRT501 or SRT501 and bortezomib.

SRT501 will be administered at the same time each morning (approximately 15-30 minutes after breakfast) on all dosing days. No SRT501 administration will occur on Day 21 of each cycle.
After the first two cycles of SRT501, any subject who exhibits stable disease or better with SRT501 monotherapy (5.0 g/day) will continue for an additional two cycles. If, after the first two cycles, a subject exhibits PD, that subject will receive bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 on Day 1, Day 4, Day 8, and Day 11 in a 21 day cycle) in conjunction with SRT501. Bortezomib will be administered prior to breakfast and SRT501 administration.
If after two additional cycles of SRT501 monotherapy (4 cycles total), the subject exhibits a MR or better, they they will remain on SRT501 therapy. If PD or SD are exibited, they are to undergo bortezomib regiment listed above.</description>
