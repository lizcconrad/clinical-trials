    <textblock>
      This clinical pilot study will test the hypothesis that systemic low-dose IL-2 therapy
      significantly enhances the immunologic efficacy of a vaccine comprising melanoma peptides
      plus GM-CSF-in-adjuvant.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have been diagnosed, by cytologic or histologic examination, with AJCC
             stage IIB, stage III or resected stage IV melanoma.

          -  Patients with up to 2 brain metastases less than or equal to 2 cm that have been
             surgically removed or treated successfully with the gamma-knife are eligible. Surgical
             resections must have been performed within 6 months prior to entry.

          -  All patients must have:

               1. ECOG performance status 0-1, and,

               2. Ability and willingness to give informed consent.

          -  Laboratory parameters as follows:

               -  HLA-A1, A2 or A3 (+)

               -  gp100 (+) and/or tyrosinase (+) tumor cells

               -  ANC &gt; 1000/mm3, and Platelets &gt; 100,000 and Hgb &gt; 9

               -  Hepatic: AST and ALT up to 2.5 x upper limits of normal (ULN), Bilirubin up to
                  2.5 x ULN, Alkaline phosphatase up to 2.5 x ULN

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients who are currently receiving cytotoxic Chemotherapy or radiation or who have
             received that therapy within the preceding 4 weeks.

          -  Patients with known or suspected allergies to any component of the vaccine.

          -  Patients receiving the following medications at study entry or within the preceding 30
             days are excluded:

               -  Agents with putative immunomodulating activity (with the exception of
                  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents)

               -  Allergy desensitization injections

               -  Corticosteroids, administered parenterally or orally - topical corticosteroids
                  are acceptable

          -  Any growth factors, Interleukin 2, Interferon alfa.

          -  Prior melanoma vaccinations will not be an exclusion criteria if given more than 8
             weeks previously, but will be recorded, and data analysis will take this into account.

          -  Other investigational drugs or investigational therapy also will not necessarily be an
             exclusion criteria, but will similarly be recorded and taken into account during data
             analysis.

          -  Pregnancy or the possibility of becoming pregnant during vaccine administration.

               -  Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
                  (urinary or serum beta-HCG) prior to administration of the first vaccine dose.

               -  Males and females must agree, in the consent form, to use effective birth control
                  methods during the course of vaccination.

               -  This is consistent with existing standards of practice for vaccine and
                  chemotherapy protocols.

          -  Patients in whom there is a medical contraindication or potential problem in complying
             with the requirements of the protocol, in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Patients classified according to the New York Heart Association classification system
             as having Class II, III or IV heart disease.

          -  Patients with active connective tissue disease requiring medication, or other severe
             autoimmune disease.

          -  Patients who are actively hyperthyroid.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled diabetes.
