  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety about needles is a commonly expressed concern by diabetics about beginning insulin
      therapy. A shorter, thinner pen needle that delivers insulin with the safety and efficacy
      profile of currently marketed pen needles may appeal to many diabetic patients as the new
      needle may be perceived as less intimidating and more comfortable. Currently marketed pen
      needles range in length from 5 to 12.7 millimeters (mm).

      The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the investigational 4mm x 32
      Gauge(G) pen needle manufactured by Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) provides equivalent
      glucose control (as measured by fructosamine levels) as the currently marketed BD 5mm x 31 G
      and BD 8mm x 31 G pen needles (PN)in diabetic subjects with varying insulin dosage regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within each dose group, subjects were randomly assigned at baseline to one of two study arms.
      One study arm (4/5 mm PN) compared the BD 4mm PN to the 5mm PN, and the other arm (4/8 mm PN)
      compared the BD 4mm PN to the 8mm PN, in a crossover fashion. Based on the randomization,
      subjects used either the 4mm or the other assigned PN (5mm or 8mm) for the first 3 weeks,
      then switched to the alternate PN for the next 3 weeks. Glycemic control was assessed by
      serum fructosamine (FRU) levels at the end of each 3 week period.

      Based on their baseline insulin regimen, subjects were also assigned to an insulin dosing
      group (Low or Regular) to help ensure balance among treatment arms. Requirements for each
      group were as follows: Low Dose: largest single dose of insulin each day with a pen device
      must be less than or equal to 20 units. Regular Dose: largest single dose of insulin each
      day, with a pen device, must be 21-40 units.

    <measure>Percent (%) Absolute Change in Fructosamine</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks per pen needle, from visit 2-3 and visit 3-4.</time_frame>
    <description>Within each study arm (4mm / 5mm PN, or 4mm / 8mm PN) subjects used one pen needle (PN) for 3 weeks then switched to the alternate PN for the next three weeks, for a total of 6 weeks. The principal endpoint measure of glycemic control is the percent absolute change in serum fructosamine concentration, based on the fructosamine (FRU) concentration measured in micromoles per liter (umol/L) at the end of each three week period. The change was calculated according to the following formula:
Percent absolute change in FRU, or %|∆ FRU|= 100*[FRU(4mm)-FRU(5 or 8mm)]/[FRU(5 or 8mm)].</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Absolute Change in Fructosamine, by Dose Group</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks per pen needle, from visit 2-3 and visit 3-4.</time_frame>
    <description>Glycemic control was determined separately for each insulin dose group in the same manner as described for the primary outcome measure, according to the following formula:
%|∆ FRU|= 100*[FRU(4mm)-FRU(5 or 8mm)]/[FRU(5 or 8mm)].</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Severe Unexplained Hypoglycemic Events</measure>
    <time_frame>During 3 weeks using each pen needle</time_frame>
    <description>Severe Unexplained Hypoglycemia is defined as an event in which the subject's blood glucose is below 50 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) and/or they required assistance from another person for treatment and there is no identified cause (for example, the subject skipped a meal). These events were also reported as Adverse Events.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Severe Unexplained Hyperglycemic Events</measure>
    <time_frame>During 3 weeks using each pen needle</time_frame>
    <description>Severe Unexplained Hyperglycemia is defined as requiring a visit to the emergency room or hospitalization and/or having a blood glucose value above 450mg/dL without an identified cause (for example, the subject missed an insulin dose). These events were also reported as Adverse Events.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relative Injection Pain Score Assessed by Subject</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 4: 18-24 days after starting 2nd pen needle</time_frame>
    <description>After using the second assigned pen needle (PN) for 3 weeks, subjects used a 150mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to rate the pain of the second PN relative to the first PN. The VAS was anchored at the center (0mm) with &quot;as painful&quot;, and at the extreme ends with &quot;much less painful&quot; (-75mm) and &quot;much more painful&quot; (+75mm). VAS scores were adjusted for the order of PN use, such that a positive score means that the 4mm PN was scored as more painful than the reference PN (5mm or 8mm), and a negative score indicates that the 4mm PN was less painful than the reference.</description>

        <title>Percent (%) Absolute Change in Fructosamine</title>
        <description>Within each study arm (4mm / 5mm PN, or 4mm / 8mm PN) subjects used one pen needle (PN) for 3 weeks then switched to the alternate PN for the next three weeks, for a total of 6 weeks. The principal endpoint measure of glycemic control is the percent absolute change in serum fructosamine concentration, based on the fructosamine (FRU) concentration measured in micromoles per liter (umol/L) at the end of each three week period. The change was calculated according to the following formula:
Percent absolute change in FRU, or %|∆ FRU|= 100*[FRU(4mm)-FRU(5 or 8mm)]/[FRU(5 or 8mm)].</description>

        <description>After using the second assigned pen needle (PN) for 3 weeks, subjects used a 150mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to rate the pain of the second PN relative to the first PN. The VAS was anchored at the center (0mm) with “as painful”, and at the extreme ends with “much less painful” (-75mm) and “much more painful” (+75mm). VAS scores were adjusted for the order of PN use, such that a positive score means that the 4mm PN was scored as more painful than the reference PN (5mm or 8mm), and a negative score indicates that the 4mm PN was less painful than the reference.</description>

          <title>Reported Injection Site Leakage Events, by Pen Needle Type and Droplet Size</title>
          <description>If insulin leakage from the injection site was observed, subjects rated the size of the leakage droplet based on a visual scale provided in their diaries. Scores of 1+, 2+, 3+, and 4+ correspond to droplet sizes of 1, 10, 20 and 50 ul, respectively. Droplets larger than those shown on the scale were scored as 5+. Subjects were not required to make a diary entry if there was no leakage.</description>
          <population>The number of participants shown is the number of subjects that reported at least one event of leakage (see previous data table). The number of reported leakage events is presented for each droplet size category. No data were collected if there was no leakage.</population>
