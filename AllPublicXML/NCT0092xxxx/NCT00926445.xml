    <textblock>
      Preterm and critically ill neonates experience many painful manipulations. The aim of the
      study is to evaluate the influence of these experiences and maternal deprivation on later
      pain behavior. Using Scoring systems, Prechtl general movements, skin conductance, testing
      flexor reflex levels with von Frey filaments and measuring salivary cortisol levels the
      investigators compare pain behavior of preterm (birth weight (BW) &lt; 1500 grams), term
      neonates with need of ventilation (&gt; 48 hours) with healthy neonates at the time of their
      first vaccination at the age of 3-4 months. The investigators are also testing flexor
      reflexes and skin conductance and general movements in regular intervals during the initial
      hospital stay. The investigators hypothesize that pain behavior is different at the age of
      3-4 months in children with many early painful experiences.
