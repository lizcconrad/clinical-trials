  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Japanese traditional diet contains considerably more nitrate/nitrite than the European foods.
      80% of dietary nitrate originates from vegetables. Green leafy vegetables, especially
      spinach, salad and seaweed are rich in nitrates. Other vegetables contain nitrate at lower
      concentrations, but because they are consumed in greater quantity, they may contribute more
      nitrate and thus nitrite from the diet. Nitrate/nitrite is attributed multiple health
      benefits. Japanese people have an exceptional longevity and the lowest rate of heart
      diseases. On the other hand, gastric cancer rate is high too. Nitrate/nitrite is strongly
      correlated with these phenomena. Is this high nitrate consumption protective or damaging?
      Understanding dietary nitrite and nitrate consumption and its metabolism therefore becomes
      very important.

      Aim: To compare conversion of nitrate to nitrite in Japanese people, measured in blood and in
      saliva during consumption of traditional Japanese foods vs European diet.

    <description>10 days of nitrate rich diet (Japanese traditional). After that switch to nitrate low diet for 10 days (European foods). Study nitrate/nitrite in blood, saliva and blood pressure 3 times in each person (10 min each time). A list of Nitrate rich foods are provided.</description>
