    <textblock>
      This study will report on the outcomes of rTMS administered 3 times per week, compared with
      the standard protocol of 5 times per week. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      frequency condition and depressive symptomatology will be measured weekly using a range of
      clinician and self-rated questionnaires. Participants will remain in the study for at least 4
      weeks, with the option of continuing for a further 2 weeks as judged by the study
      psychiatrist. It is hypothesised that rTMS administered three times per week will be equally
      as effective as rTMS administered five times per week in reducing depressive symptomatology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of active rTMS over sham rTMS for depression;
      however, few have systematically studied the optimal frequency of treatment sessions to
      achieve this efficacy. To date, the majority of studies have administered rTMS every weekday,
      although this approach has not been widely contested. In addition, most studies have only
      assessed the effectiveness of rTMS over a two week period, which has resulted in some
      improvement in depressive symptomatology; however, a longer treatment course would likely
      result in greater improvement. In this study depressed patients will be randomly assigned to
      receive rTMS either 3 or 5 times per week, for a period of 4-6 weeks. A range of rating
      scales will be used to assess the improvement of depressive symptomatology within and between
      the two frequency groups, to ultimately determine whether TMS is needed 5 times per week to
      achieve adequate anti-depressant effects or whether 3 times per week is sufficient in
      achieving a similar level of efficacy for patients.
