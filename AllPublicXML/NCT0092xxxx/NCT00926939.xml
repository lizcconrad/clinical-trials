  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate a sustainable and broadly accessible treatment
      delivery model (Motiv8) for smoking cessation based on abstinence-reinforcement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smokers are randomly assigned to one of two groups: an Abstinence Contingent (AC) group and a
      Submission Contingent (SC) group. The AC group receives vouchers for abstaining from smoking
      (measured by a carbon monoxide monitor and confirmed through video-submission), and the SC
      group receives vouchers for submitting videos of their carbon monoxide breath tests. Both
      groups take videos of their CO-monitoring on a secure website designed for the study, as well
      as receive standard care counseling and education related to smoking cessation. The main
      intervention lasts four weeks, and a three-week maintenance phase will follow. Assessments
      will be conducted at intake, week four (end of the main treatment phase), and at three and
      six months after the intervention period is completed
