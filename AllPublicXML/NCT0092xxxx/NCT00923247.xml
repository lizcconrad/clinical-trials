  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  The combination of anti-cancer drugs vandetanib (given orally) and bortezomib (given
           intravenously) has not been used in humans. However, both drugs have been studied
           separately. Bortezomib has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
           for treating multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, while vandetanib is still under
           investigation pending FDA approval.

        -  Both bortezomib and vandetanib are under investigation for use in treating certain kinds
           of cancer. Researchers hope that the combination of these two drugs will be more
           effective than either of them alone.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine if the combination of vandetanib and bortezomib will decrease the amount of
           the cancer and, if it does, to determine how long the response will last.

        -  To determine any side effects that may occur with this combination of treatments.

        -  To determine what doses of each drug are well tolerated and safe when given together.

        -  To study genetic mutations in tumors to better understand how tumors grow and how these
           drugs interact with the tumor.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients 18 years of age and older with solid tumors that cannot be surgically removed
           and have either recurred or shown further growth. The tumor(s) must be able to be
           evaluated by X-ray, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and CT (computerized tomography)
           scanning.

        -  Patients who have been diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer will participate in Phase
           II of the study.

      Design:

        -  Tumor samples may be taken at the start of the study for research purposes.

        -  Phase I: Patient groups will be treated on an outpatient basis with vandetanib and
           bortezomib, given at increasing doses over four different levels to determine the
           maximum tolerated dose calculated by height and weight:

        -  Doses will be given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 for each 28-day cycle.

        -  Two additional levels (Level 1A and Level 1B) may be included in the study, depending on
           side effects at various levels.

        -  Phase II: Patients with medullary thyroid cancer will be divided into two groups, with
           two patients in Group A for every one patient in Group B. No placebo will be involved in
           this study.

        -  Group A: Patients will be treated with vandetanib and bortezomib at the maximally
           tolerated dose of the Phase I study.

        -  Group B: Patients will be treated with bortezomib alone.

        -  A second tumor sample may be taken. In patients with thyroid cancer, the second biopsy
           will be done at the 6-week evaluation (approximately 42 days after beginning). In
           patients with cancer other than thyroid cancer, the second biopsy will be obtained on
           Day 4 of either the first or second cycle, after the bortezomib infusion.

        -  The effects of the drugs will be studied through blood samples and CT scans taken during
           and after various drug cycles.

      Background:

        -  Vandetanib (CAPRELSA; ZD6474) potently inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor
           receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), and shows additional inhibitory activity at sub-micromolar
           concentrations against the Rearranged during Transfection (RET) receptor, Flt-4 and EGF
           receptor tyrosine kinases.

        -  Clinical trials have shown that vandetanib is active against medullary thyroid
           carcinomas (MTCs), but the activity is characterized by partial responses of variable
           duration, underscoring the need to develop active combinatorial regimens.

        -  Bortezomib (PS-341, Velcade ), a proteasome inhibitor, has been reported to have several
           putative mechanisms of action and it is likely that its toxicity is mediated by
           affecting more than one pathway or target. Bortezomib is reported to inhibit the nuclear
           factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) pathway and regulate
           NF-kappaB-dependent expression of several other inhibitors of apoptosis.

        -  In vitro studies have shown bortezomib to be active against a broad range of thyroid
           cancer cell lines. Given this activity of bortezomib and the role of the proteasome in
           regulating diverse cellular pathways, this study proposes to combine bortezomib with
           vandetanib to treat patients with advanced solid tumors with a focus on patients with
           MTC.

      Objectives:

        -  To assess the activity of vandetanib plus bortezomib in adults with MTC, using Response
           Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and tumor biomarkers including
           carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and calcitonin as endpoints.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerance of vandetanib plus bortezomib in dose-seeking
           cohorts.

        -  To compare the combination bortezomib plus vandetanib versus vandetanib alone in adults
           with MTC by assessing the response rate and progression-free survival

        -  In exploratory analyses: (a) examine the correlation between genotype and response to
           therapy in patients with MTC, (b) examine the extent, if any, of rearranged during
           transfection (RET) inhibition in patients with MTC following the administration of
           vandetanib; and (c) examine the effect, if any, of bortezomib on microtubules.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adults age 18 and older with unresectable, recurrent or metastatic solid tumors,
           including MTC.

        -  Disease must be evaluable by RECIST.

      Design:

        -  Phase I dose-escalation study followed by randomized phase II trial.

        -  Maximum total number for planned enrollment: 117 - Dose-seeking cohorts of three to 6
           patients until maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/dose limiting toxicity (DLT) reached (up to
           24 patients) followed by a randomized phase II trial comparing the activity of the
           combination of bortezomib plus vandetanib with vandetanib alone (2:1 randomization 62
           plus 31 equals 93 patients).

        -  The MTD and DLT will be determined based on toxicities during the first eight weeks of
           combined therapy.

        -  Cycle length will be four weeks. Response will be determined by RECIST every 12 weeks.

    <time_frame>80 days</time_frame>
    <description>A maximum tolerated dose for vandetanib will be determined if dose limiting toxicity is observed in 2 or more patients at one of the dose levels being evaluated. The MTD will be the dose level immediately preceding the dose level at which DLT (e.g. defined as neutrophil count below 1000/ µL (grade 3) on 2 consecutive measurements drawn at least 72 hours OR a single neutrophil count below 500/µL occurred. Platelet count below 50,000 µL (grade 3) on 2 consecutive measurements drawn at least 72 hours apart OR a singe platelet count below 25,000/µL. A platelet transfusion administered when platelet count is below 50,000/µL is dose limiting thrombocytopenia, unless the transfusion is being administered for peri-operative coverage.</description>

    <description>Response is assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete response is disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Progressive disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable disease is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression. Progression is assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and is defined as the appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Although a clear progression of &quot;non-target&quot; lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).</description>

    <description>Geometric mean for Bortezomib pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters both before (cycle 1 day 1) and during steady-state Vandetanib (cycle 3 day 1; exposures are dose normalized). Bortezomib plasma concentrations were measured using a validated LC-MS/MS assay with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 1 ng/mL. Only measured concentrations above the LLOQ were used in the calculation of PK parameters. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was recorded as observed values.</description>

               -  alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline
                  phosphatase (ALP) all three less than 2.5 times the upper limit of the reference
                  range (ULRR), or less than 5 times the ULRR if judged by the investigator to be
                  related to liver metastases

               -  serum creatinine less than 1.5 times the ULRR or creatinine clearance greater
                  than or equal to 30 mL/minute (calculated by Cockcroft-Gault formula or measured
                  in a timed urine collection)

               -  serum calcium below the CTCAE grade 1 upper limit (11.5mg/dL or 2.9 mmol/L). In
                  cases where the serum calcium is below the normal range, the calcium adjusted for
                  albumin is calculated and substituted for the measured value.

               -  serum potassium greater than the lower limit of normal (LLN) and less than 5.5
                  mmol/L.

               -  serum magnesium greater than the LLN and less than 3.0 mg/dL or 1.23 mmol/L.

                  thromboplastin time (PTT) less than or equal to 10 seconds above ULN.

          9. Ability to understand and sign an informed consent document.

         10. Provision of informed consent prior to any study-related procedures

         11. Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential

         12. Ability and willingness to follow the guidelines of the clinical protocol including
             visits to National Cancer Institute (NCI), Bethesda, Maryland for treatment and follow
             up visits.

         13. Because the effects of chemotherapy on the developing human fetus are potentially
             harmful, female patients must be one year post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or
             using an acceptable method of contraception during and continued after the last dose
             of study medications (oral contraceptives, barrier methods, approved contraceptive
             implant, long-term injectable contraception, intrauterine device or tubal ligation).
             Male patients must be surgically sterile or using an acceptable method of
             contraception during their participation in this study. Contraceptive use will
             continue for at least four months after the last dose of study medication.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients with cancer potentially curable by surgical excision alone or patients who
             have not received therapy that might be considered standard and potentially curable.

          2. Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease or any concurrent condition
             including, but not limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, unstable hypertension, seizure disorder, or psychiatric illness which in the
             Investigators opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial
             or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol.

          3. Untreated brain metastases (or local treatment of brain metastases within the last 6
             months) due to the poor prognosis of these patients and difficulty ascertaining the
             cause of neurologic toxicities.

          4. During Phase II enrollment: Prior therapy with vandetanib.

          5. Women who are currently pregnant or breast-feeding, due to the possible adverse
             effects on the developing fetus and infants.

          6. The presence of a second malignancy within the last 2 years, other than squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer because it will complicate the
             primary objective of the study. Cancer survivors who have been free of disease for at
             least two years can be enrolled in this study.

             - There is one other exception to the exclusion of secondary malignancies: multiple
             endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) patients with concurrent medullary thyroid cancer
             and pheochromocytoma may be enrolled at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.

          7. Patients with evidence of a bleeding diathesis that cannot be corrected with standard
             therapy or factor replacement.

          8. Any unresolved toxicity greater than CTCAE grade 1 (except alopecia) from previous
             anticancer therapy. Patients with grade 1 neuropathy will be evaluated on a case by
             case basis for entry into study. Baseline conditions will be taken into consideration.

          9. Major surgery within 4 weeks, or incompletely healed surgical incision before starting
             study therapy.

         10. Clinically significant cardiovascular event (e.g. myocardial infarction, superior vena
             cava syndrome (SVC), New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of heart disease
             greater than or equal to 2 within 3 months before entry; or presence of cardiac
             disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, increases the risk of ventricular
             arrhythmia.

         11. History of arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contractions PVCs, bigeminy,
             trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation) which is
             symptomatic or requires treatment (CTCAE grade 3) or asymptomatic sustained
             ventricular tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation controlled on medication is not excluded.

         12. History (within the last 6 months) or presence of stroke/cerebrovascular accident.

         13. Corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation with other medications. If the medication can
             be discontinued and an alternative medication started that does not cause QTc
             prolongation, the patient would be eligible. If no alternative medication is available
             and the medication cannot be discontinued for medical reasons, then the patient would
             not be eligible.

         14. Congenital long Q wave, T wave (QT) syndrome, or 1st degree relative with unexplained
             sudden death under 40 years of age.

         15. Presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB).

         16. QTc with Bazett's correction that is not measurable, or greater than or equal to 480
             msec on screening electrocardiogram (ECG). (Note: If a patient has a QTc interval
             greater than or equal to 480 msec on screening ECG, the screen ECG may be repeated
             twice (at least 24 hours apart). The average QTc from the three screening ECGs must be
             less than 480 msec in order for the patient to be eligible for the study). Patients
             who are receiving a drug that has a risk of QTc prolongation are excluded if QTc is
             greater than or equal to 460 msec.

         17. Concurrent medication that may cause QTc prolongation or induce Torsades de Pointes:
             Those medications in Group One will not be allowed. Those medications in Group Two
             will be allowed.

         18. Hypertension not controlled by medical therapy (systolic blood pressure greater than
             160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 100 mm Hg)

         19. Currently active (uncontrolled) diarrhea greater than or equal to CTCAE Grade 2 that
             may affect the ability of the patient to absorb the vandetanib or tolerate diarrhea.
             Antidiarrhea medications are allowed in patients with chronic diarrhea.

         20. Concomitant medications that are potent inducers (rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin,
             carbamazepine, phenobarbital and St. John's Wort) of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)
             function.

         21. Major surgery within 4-weeks, or incompletely healed surgical incision before starting
             study medications. Biopsies, port placements, and dental work are examples of
             acceptable (nonmajor) surgery within the 4 week time frame.

         22. Inability to take oral medications for whatever reason.

        <description>A maximum tolerated dose for vandetanib will be determined if dose limiting toxicity is observed in 2 or more patients at one of the dose levels being evaluated. The MTD will be the dose level immediately preceding the dose level at which DLT (e.g. defined as neutrophil count below 1000/ µL (grade 3) on 2 consecutive measurements drawn at least 72 hours OR a single neutrophil count below 500/µL occurred. Platelet count below 50,000 µL (grade 3) on 2 consecutive measurements drawn at least 72 hours apart OR a singe platelet count below 25,000/µL. A platelet transfusion administered when platelet count is below 50,000/µL is dose limiting thrombocytopenia, unless the transfusion is being administered for peri-operative coverage.</description>

        <description>Response is assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete response is disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Progressive disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable disease is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

        <description>Progression free survival is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression. Progression is assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and is defined as the appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Although a clear progression of &quot;non-target&quot; lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).</description>

          <description>Progression free survival is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression. Progression is assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and is defined as the appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Although a clear progression of &quot;non-target&quot; lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).</description>
          <population>No participants were enrolled in the phase IIB cohort. One participant was in cohort 2A, thus standard deviation could not be calculated.</population>

          <title>Number of Participants With Tumor Biomarker Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) Response</title>
          <description>Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) was measured by the biomarker response criteria. Complete response (CR) is normalization (≤ upper limit of normal) of CEA level following treatment, confirmed with a repeat CEA level at least 4 weeks apart. Partial response (PR) is a ≥50% decrease in the CEA level relative to the baseline level, confirmed with a repeat CEA level at least 4 weeks apart. Progressive disease is a ≥50% increase in the CEA relative to the baseline level, confirmed with a repeat CEA level at least 4 weeks apart. Stable disease is &lt;50% increase or decrease in CEA level relative to the baseline level.</description>
          <population>No participants were enrolled in the phase IIB cohort. Only participants with average pre-treatment CEA levels that are &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal are evaluable for biomarker response. There were 14 participants that met this criteria.</population>
