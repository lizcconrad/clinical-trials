      The study aims to evaluate the safety and performance of the RTPS in patients with localized
      prostate cancer.The RTPS is an investigational device and requires permanent implantation of
      a small radioactive fiducial, called the Blip, in the prostate.

      The high precision of planned radiotherapy treatments requires accurate positioning of the
      prostate in order to ensure that the tightly conformed dose distribution does not miss the
      prostate and result in either significant tumor underdosage, an increased dose to the rectum
      or bladder, or both. Precise delivery has been addressed using a variety of pre-treatment
      localization systems. The most direct localization of the prostate involves the use of
      ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or radiography of permanently implanted fiducial
      markers.

      In this study the safety and performance of a novel investigational tracking system will be
      evaluated. The Radiation Therapy Positioning System (RTPS) is a radioactive tracking system
      integrated into the radiotherapy set-up workflow. The System is composed of the Clinical
      Positioning System (CPS) and a radioactive soft tissue implanted fiducial (Blip), which is
      permanently implanted in the prostate. By tracking the implanted Blip, the CPS can monitor
      positional changes prior to and during the treatment.

      The accuracy of the RTPS localization will be compared to the CBCT in at least 5 radiation
      therapy sessions per patient.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          2. Male, age greater than or equal to 45 years.

          3. Intact prostate of at least 30g, as estimated by physical estimation and/or
             ultrasound.

          4. ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 0 or 1.

          5. Patients must be planned to have external beam radiation as the definitive treatment
             for their prostate cancer with treatment set-up verification according to a locally
             fixed protocol.

          6. Patients must have anatomy that will allow an adequate pelvic imaging by CBCT as well
             as CT scanning.

          7. Organ confined or locally advanced prostate cancer with clinical N category 0 or x, M
             category 0 or x.

          8. Ability to comply with study visit schedule.

          9. Patient (or legal guardian) understands the study requirements and the investigational
             procedure and provides written Informed Consent before any study-specific tests or
             procedures are performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Past history of abdominoperineal (A-P) resection.

          2. Planned course of treatment using brachytherapy (permanent brachytherapy seeds or high
             dose rate [HDR] brachytherapy).

          3. Allergy to local anesthetics.

          4. History of chronic prostatitis.

             with a ruler.)

          8. Patients with a body habitus that the CT bore of the CT/LINAC treatment machine cannot
             accommodate.

          9. Patients with a prior history of pelvic or prostate radiotherapy.
