  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has shown improvement in mortality and morbidity in
      patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and congestive heart failure.
      Additionally in CRT patients it has been demonstrated that optimizing paced/sensed
      atrioventricular (AV) and interventricular (V-V) timings leads to immediate hemodynamic
      benefits and further improves cardiac function. Recent studies have shown that optimal
      paced/sensed AV and V-V delays change over time, which raises the question of how often
      optimization should be repeated. Thus, frequent re-optimization of these delays might be
      beneficial for maintaining significant improvement of cardiac function. However, it remains
      to be evaluated whether timing optimization may be beneficial on patients who have received
      CRT for a number of years and are now having the CRT device replaced.

      -  This is a prospective, randomized, and multicenter study

        -  Patients who have received a replacement St. Jude Medical(SJM) CRT device, either CRT-P
           or CRT-D, within the last two weeks post CRT replacement will be considered for
           enrollment in the study.

        -  Baseline measurements will be performed at the time of enrollment.

        -  Patients are followed up to 12 months post CRT replacement with data collected at 3, 6,
           9 and 12 months post CRT replacement.

        -  Patients will be randomized at enrollment to either Group 1 (use of SJM algorithm to
           optimize programming) or Group 2 (&quot;Control&quot;).

The paced/sensed AV and V-V delays could be programmed empirically or optimized using any non-intracardiac electrogram (IEGM) based method as per sites standard of care. However, the Group 2 patients can be optimized only once within the first 4 weeks post CRT replacement. Any paced/sensed AV and V-V delay optimizations performed after 4 weeks post CRT replacement in Group 2 patients will be considered a protocol deviation.</description>
