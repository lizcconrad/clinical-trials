    <description>Subjects wore 2 Navigator sensors for approximately 122 hours. Subjects and clinical staff were masked to continuous glucose data. During the time the subjects wore the continuous sensor, they were instructed to continue with their current diabetes management plan. Subjects stayed at the clinic for approximately 50 hours during the study period. While in the clinic, venous blood samples were collected every 15 minutes to determine whole blood reference glucose concentrations using the Yellow Springs Instrument. Subjects were also asked to obtain up to 50 FreeStyle finger blood glucose measurements using the system in the Navigator receiver for comparative analysis and system calibration. This was not a treatment study.</description>
