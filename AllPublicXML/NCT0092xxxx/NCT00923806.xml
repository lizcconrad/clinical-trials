  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a protein present mostly in cancer cells.

        -  An experimental procedure developed for treating patients with cancer uses blood cells
           found in their tumors or bloodstream. These cells are genetically modified using the
           anti-CEA gene and a type of virus. The modified cells (anti-CEA cells) are grown in the
           laboratory and then given back to the patient to try to decrease the size of the tumors.
           This is called gene therapy.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether advanced cancers that that express the CEA antigen can be treated
           effectively with lymphocytes (white blood cells) that have been genetically engineered
           to contain an anti-CEA protein.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients 18 years of age and older with metastatic cancer (cancer that has spread beyond
           the original site) and for whom standard treatments are not effective.

        -  Patients' tumors express the CEA antigen.

        -  Patients have the human leukocyte (HLA-A*0201) antigen.

      Design:

        -  Workup with scans, x-rays and other tests.

        -  Leukapheresis to obtain cells for preparing the anti-CEA cells for later infusion.

        -  1 week of chemotherapy to prepare the immune system for receiving the anti-CEA cells.

        -  Infusion of anti-CEA cells, followed by interleukin-2 (IL-2) treatment. The cells are
           given as an infusion through a vein. IL-2 is given as a 15-minute infusion through a
           vein every 8 hours for a maximum of 15 doses.

        -  1-2 weeks of recovery from the effects of chemotherapy and IL-2.

        -  Periodic follow-up clinic visits after hospital discharge for physical examination,
           review of treatment side effects, laboratory tests and scans every 1 to 6 months.

      Background:

        -  We have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both the alpha and beta
           chains of a T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA),
           which can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this TCR with high efficiency (greater
           than 30%) without the need to perform any selection.

        -  In co-cultures with HLA-A2 and CEA positive tumors, anti-CEA TCR transduced T cells
           secreted significant amounts of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) with high specificity.

      Objectives:

      Primary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety of the administration of anti-CEA TCR engineered peripheral blood
           lymphocytes in patients receiving the non-myeloablative conditioning regimen and
           aldesleukin.

        -  To determine if the administration of anti-CEA TCR engineered peripheral blood
           lymphocytes and aldesleukin to patients following a nonmyeloablative but lymphoid
           depleting preparative regimen will result in clinical tumor regression in patients with
           metastatic cancer that expresses CEA.

        -  To determine the in vivo survival of TCR gene-engineered cells.

      Secondary objective:

      - To determine the in vivo survival of TCR gene-engineered cells.

      Eligibility:

      Patients who are HLA-A*0201 positive and 18 years of age or older must have

        -  metastatic cancer whose tumors express the CEA antigen where the life limiting component
           of the disease is hepatic metastases;

        -  previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred to standard care for
           metastatic disease;

      Patients should not have:

      - contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.

      Design:

        -  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained by leukapheresis (approximately 5
           times 10(9) cells) will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and aldesleukin
           in order to stimulate T-cell growth.

        -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of approximately 10(8) to 5 times 10(8) cells to
           retroviral vector supernatant containing the anti-CEA TCR genes.

        -  Patients will receive a nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen
           consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by intravenous (IV) infusion of
           ex vivo tumor reactive, TCR gene-transduced PBMC plus IV aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg q8h
           for a maximum of 15 doses). Patients will receive CD8-enhanced anti-CEA TCR transduced
           cells.

        -  Patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor with physical examination, computed
           tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and clinical laboratory evaluation four
           to six weeks after treatment. If the patient has stable disease (SD) or tumor shrinkage,
           repeat complete evaluations will be performed every 1-3 months. After the first year,
           patients continuing to respond will continue to be followed with this evaluation every
           3-4 months until off study criteria are met.

        -  The study will be conducted using a Phase I/II optimal design. The protocol will proceed
           in a phase 1 dose escalation design, with six cohorts. Should a single patient
           experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at a particular dose level, three more
           patients would be treated at that 3 dose to confirm that no greater than 1/6 patients
           have a DLT prior to proceeding to the next higher level. If a level with 2 or more DLTs
           in 3-6 patients has been identified, three additional patients will be accrued at the
           next-lowest dose, for a total of 6, in order to further characterize the safety of the
           maximum tolerated dose (MTD) prior to starting the phase II portion. If a DLT occurs in
           the first cohort, that cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. If 2 DLTs are encountered
           in this cohort, patients will be accrued to the de-escalation cohort.

        -  Once the MTD has been determined, the study then would proceed to the phase II portion.
           Patients will be entered into two cohorts based on histology: cohort 1 will include
           patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, and cohort 2 will include patients with
           other types of metastatic cancer that express CEA.

        -  For each of the 2 strata evaluated, the study will be conducted using a phase II optimal
           design where initially 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled. For each of these two
           arms of the trial, if 0 or 1 of the 21 patients experiences a clinical response, then no
           further patients will be enrolled but if 2 or more of the first 21 evaluable patients
           enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual will continue until a total of 41
           evaluable patients have been enrolled in that stratum.

        -  The objective will be to determine if the combination of high dose aldesleukin,
           lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy, and anti-CEA TCR-gene engineered lymphocytes is able
           to be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor
           of a modest 20% partial response (PR) + complete response (CR) rate (p1=0.20).

          1. Metastatic cancer that expresses carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as assessed by one of
             the following methods:

               -  Immunohistochemistry of resected tissue, assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
                  in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) approved test in the
                  Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer
                  Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH). Since the affinity of the
                  antibody is weak, a result of greater than or equal to 1+ is considered positive.

               -  Detection of elevated levels of circulating CEA using a standard clinical
                  enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay. Results will be considered positive if
                  CEA level is greater than 10 mcg/L.

               -  Metastatic cancer diagnosis will be confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology at
                  the NCI.

          2. Hepatic metastases must represent the life limiting components of the disease defined
             as liver disease with a very high likelihood of causing the death of a patient
             according to the best clinical judgment of the attending physician.

          3. Patients must have previously received systemic standard care (or effective salvage
             chemotherapy regimens) for metastatic disease, if known to be effective for that

                  Patients who are HIV seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus
                  be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its

          4. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).

          5. Concurrent systemic steroid therapy

          6. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in
