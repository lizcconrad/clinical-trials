  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate the blood pressure (BP)-lowering efficacy of the
      combination of aliskiren and valsartan, as initial therapy, compared to valsartan monotherapy
      in Type II Diabetic patients with Stage II hypertension.

      When protocol Amendment 2 was released, there were patients who had already been randomized
      into the study. These patients were included in the trial prior to making changes to the
      eligibility criteria. Thus, the study contains 2 distinct cohorts. Cohort 1 contains those
      patients who had already been randomized, and had been deemed eligible based on the original
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, prior to Amendment 2. No new patients were randomized to Cohort
      1. Cohort 2 contains patients who were randomized, having been found eligible based on the
      revised inclusion/exclusion criteria, after Amendment 2. Differences in the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria are indicated below.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean 24-hour Ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure (MASBP) at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure was evaluated at baseline (Week 0) and post-baseline visits. The mean hourly systolic blood pressure was calculated at post-dosing hours 1-24 for each patient. The MASBP for each patient was calculated by averaging the patient's available hourly means for post-dosing hours 1-24.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (MSSBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Sitting blood pressure was measured at trough (24 hours ± 3 hours post dose) and recorded at all study visits. At the first study visit, the arm in which the highest sitting diastolic blood pressure was found was the arm used for all subsequent readings throughout the study. At each study visit, after the patient had been sitting for five minutes, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured 3 times using the standard mercury sphygmomanometer. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 1-2 minute intervals and the mean of these 3 sitting blood pressure measurements was used as the average sitting office blood pressure for that visit.</description>

    <description>Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen.
Serious adverse events are any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgment of investigators represent significant hazards.</description>

        <description>Sitting blood pressure was measured at trough (24 hours ± 3 hours post dose) and recorded at all study visits. At the first study visit, the arm in which the highest sitting diastolic blood pressure was found was the arm used for all subsequent readings throughout the study. At each study visit, after the patient had been sitting for five minutes, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured 3 times using the standard mercury sphygmomanometer. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 1-2 minute intervals and the mean of these 3 sitting blood pressure measurements was used as the average sitting office blood pressure for that visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (MSDBP)</title>
        <description>Sitting blood pressure was measured at trough (24 hours ± 3 hours post dose) and recorded at all study visits. At the first study visit, the arm in which the highest sitting diastolic blood pressure was found was the arm used for all subsequent readings throughout the study. At each study visit, after the patient had been sitting for five minutes, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured 3 times using the standard mercury sphygmomanometer. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 1-2 minute intervals and the mean of these 3 sitting blood pressure measurements was used as the average sitting office blood pressure for that visit.</description>

        <description>Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen.
Serious adverse events are any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgment of investigators represent significant hazards.</description>
