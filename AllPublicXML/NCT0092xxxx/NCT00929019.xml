      1. Rationale

           Immunotherapy applying ex vivo generated and tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DC)
           has now successfully been introduced in the clinic. A limited, but consistent, number of
           objective immunological and clinical responses have been observed. Most of the
           successful results have been observed in patients with minimal residual disease, rather
           than patients with advanced metastatic disease. Moreover, the investigators' preliminary
           results show that presence of tumor epitope specific T cells in biopsies taken from
           delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction sites highly correlates with prolonged
           progression free survival (PFS).

           Within uveal melanoma patients, a group with high risk of metastatic disease can be
           identified on basis of tumor specific genetic changes in loss of chromosome 3.

           At present no standard adjuvant or systemic treatment is available. Applying DC-based
           immunotherapy in this group of high risk patients might reduce the risk of recurrence
           without interference in the current treatment guidelines.

        2. Objectives

           In this joint clinical study of Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (RUNMC) and
           Rotterdam Eye Hospital, the investigators aim to determine the in vivo immunological
           response induced in high risk uveal melanoma patients vaccinated with mRNA-transfected
           DC.

        3. Study design

           This study is an open label non-randomized phase II intervention study.

        4. Study population

           The investigators' study population consists of HLA-A2 positive patients with a high
           risk uveal melanoma with proven expression of melanoma associated antigens tyrosinase
           and/or gp100.

        5. Main study endpoints

      This is an exploratory study aiming to demonstrate proof of principle. The first study
      endpoints are in vivo immunological response induced in high risk uveal melanoma patients
      vaccinated with mRNA-transfected DC, administered i.v./i.d. and toxicity. Secondary study
      endpoints are progression free survival, overall survival, and toxicity.
