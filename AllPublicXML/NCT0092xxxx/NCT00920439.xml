    <time_frame>During the 4-day (Days 0-3) post-vaccination period</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed solicited local symptoms were pain, redness and swelling. Any = all reports of the specified symptom irrespective of intensity grade. Grade 3 pain = cried when limb was moved/spontaneously painful. Grade 3 redness/swelling = redness/swelling spreading beyond 30 millimeters (mm) of injection site.</description>

    <time_frame>During the 4-day (Days 0-3) post-vaccination period</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed solicited general symptoms were temperature [defined as axillary temperature equal to or above (≥) 37.1 degrees Celsius (°C)], drowsiness, irritability and loss of appetite. Any = all reports of the specified symptom irrespective of intensity grade and relationship to vaccination. Grade 3 drowsiness= drowsiness that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 irritability= crying that could not be comforted/ prevented normal activity. Grade 3 loss of appetite= subject did not eat at all. Grade 3 fever = fever above (&gt;) 39.0 °C. Related = symptom assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination.</description>

    <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 AE = an AE which prevented normal, everyday activities. Related = AE assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination.</description>
