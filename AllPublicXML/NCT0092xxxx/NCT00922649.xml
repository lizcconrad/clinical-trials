    <textblock>
      16-week, open-label, multi-center pilot study. Insulin pump naïve subjects with type 2
      diabetes who are not achieving glycemic targets (screening A1C ≥ 7.0%) on an established
      regimen of either: 1) ≥ 2 OAs (Cohort A), 2) basal insulin ± OAs (Cohort B), or 3)
      basal-bolus insulin ± OAs (Cohort C) will initiate basal-bolus therapy with an insulin pump
      using a rapid-acting insulin analog.

    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate insulin dosing patterns, i.e., number of daily basal rates, after 16 weeks of insulin pump therapy aimed at achieving normal or near-normal glycemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes.</description>

    <measure>7 point profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Self-monitored 7-point profiles were compared at baseline and Week 16 for each cohort and all cohorts combined.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CGM Glucose Ranges - Percent of Measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Weight change was evaluated at Week 16 for each cohort and all cohorts combined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hypoglycemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence (percent of patients with at least one episode of hypoglycemia) of minor hypoglycemia was evaluated respectively. Minor hypoglycemia was defined as symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia that either resolved spontaneously or upon self-treatment with oral carbohydrate. Severe hypoglycemia referred to symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia during which the patient required the assistance of another individual and was associated with a documented glucose concentration less than 56 mg/dL or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to week 16 in Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PROs were assessed at Baseline, Wk 8 (except for EQ-5D) and Wk 16, including EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) (Generic health-related QoL), Diabetes Symptom Checklist-Revised (DSC-R) (Diabetes-specific QoL), and Insulin Delivery System Rating Questionnaire (IDSRQ) (Treatment Satisfaction with insulin delivery system)</description>
