      At this point in time the approach to the diagnosis of rotator cuff tendon tears is not
      consensual. The French surgeons, considering they have a good experience of this method,
      preferably use a shoulder CT-arthrography. Whereas in the United States surgeons rather rely
      on MRI or MR-arthrography of the shoulder. However, nobody can say which of these three
      examinations is most precise and gives the best information. We proposed to carry out the
      three examinations at the same time in a large number of patients who needed to be operated
      for a rotator cuff tendon tear and then to compare the results of each of these examinations
      with the operative observations.

      Rotator cuff tendon tear is the principal pathology of the shoulder. These degenerative
      tendon lesions are due to normal ageing. True complete asymptomatic tears are even quite
      frequently noted in old subjects. However, they can be very invalidating. The majority of
      these degenerative lesions are treated medically. In a limited number of cases, a surgical
      treatment aimed at reducing a mechanical conflict and/or repair the tendons is necessary.

      The indication for a surgical treatment is based on the clinical evaluation and the
      radiological assessment. The radiological assessment is essential to confirm the tears but
      also to evaluate their extent. The type of surgery depends on this anatomic and radiologic
      assessment. It is thus possible, in the event of small complete tear, to make a simple tendon
      suture or a transosseous reinsertion. On the other hand, in the event of a large tear with
      tendon retraction, muscular flap reconstruction is needed.

      The preoperative radiological assessment is based on different radiological examinations,
      exploring the tendons. In the United States, MRI is mainly used in this case. In France, it
      is CT-arthrography which is regarded as the standard of care because the high contrast
      resolution of the images obtained and their reliability appear to be higher than those of
      MRI. The articular puncture necessary to perform this examination is not regarded in our
      country as an obstacle. The MR-arthrography, which consists in injecting into the joint of
      very low concentration of gadolinium, makes it possible to obtain an arthrographic effect in
      MRI. This examination gives images with an excellent contrast. It is already very widespread
      in the USA. In France, we have an increasingly large experience of it, but still limited.
