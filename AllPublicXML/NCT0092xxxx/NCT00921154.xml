      The purpose of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic and bioavailability profile
      (rate and amount of absorption into the bloodstream) of a test formulation of ivermectin
      solution 1 mg/ml with a marketed reference formulation of ivermectin 3 mg tablets when taken
      after an overnight fast .The study is designed in accordance with the EU Note for Guidance on
      the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence 2001.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medicine (i.e. a medicine used to eliminate parasitic worms)
      for oral administration, and is approved in the US and some other countries in a tablet form.
      A new liquid formulation of ivermectin has been developed to facilitate dosing. This is a
      single dose, randomised, crossover study in healthy adult male and female volunteers, with
      doses taken after an overnight fast. Doses will be separated by washout period of at least 14
      days. Twenty-one blood samples will be taken from each volunteer over 144 hours in each
      period. Concentrations of ivermectin in plasma will be measured using a validated
      chromatographic assay (LC-MS/MS). Standard pharmacokinetic parameters will be obtained and
      bioequivalence on the basis of rate and extent of drug absorption will be assessed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  pregnant or nursing subjects

          -  subjects who lived in region endemic for certain parasitic worm diseases

          -  any protocol-specified vital sign or medical history that would preclude participation
             in the trial, including, but not limited to recent blood donation (or loss) and
             positive screens for HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C

          -  Any indication of current or previous abuse of alcohol, solvents or drugs

             period or quantities of methylxanthine or alcohol-containing beverages which, in the
             opinion of the Investigator are abnormal (more than 5 cups or glasses of tea, coffee,
             cola, chocolate etc. per day or more than 20 g alcohol/day)

          -  Patients with a known or suspected intestinal helminth infection

             product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of trial results and,
             in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry
             into this trial
