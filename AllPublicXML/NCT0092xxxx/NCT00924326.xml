  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with B
      cell lymphomas or leukemias that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing
      them in the laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying these specific cells with a
      type of virus (retrovirus) to attack only the tumor cells, and then giving the cells back to
      the patient. This type of therapy is called gene transfer. In this protocol, we are modifying
      the patient s white blood cells with a retrovirus that has the gene for anti-CD19
      incorporated in the retrovirus.

      Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to determine a safe number of these cells to infuse and to see
      if these particular tumor-fighting cells (anti-CD19 cells) cause tumors to shrink.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults age 18-68 with B cell lymphomas or leukemias expressing the CD19 molecule.

      Design:

      Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and undergo
      a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed

      Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo
      leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti-CD19 cells. {Leukapheresis is a
      common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.}

      Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the
      conditioning chemotherapy and the anti-CD19 cells. They will stay in the hospital for about

      4 weeks for the treatment.

      Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects,
      lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1
      year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  We have constructed a retroviral vector that encodes an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen
           receptor (CAR) that recognizes the CD19 antigen. This chimeric receptor also contains
           the signaling domains of CD28 and CD3-zeta. The retroviral vector can be used to mediate
           genetic transfer of this CAR to T cells with high efficiency (&gt; 50%) without the need to
           perform any selection.

        -  In co-cultures with CD19-expressing target cells, anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells
           secreted significant amounts of IFN-y and IL-2.

        -  We have developed a process for cryopreserving the cell product which may lead to the
           ability for this product to be manufactured at a central location and shipped to other
           institutions for treatment of a broader patient population

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Primary objectives

        -  With the approval of amendment S, determine the safety and feasibility of the
           administration of cryopreserved anti-CD19-CAR engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes
           with a nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen in patients with Bcell lymphomas.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Patients of 18 years of age or older must:

        -  have a CD19-expressing B-cell malignancy of any type

        -  be a non-responder to, or recurred after one or more standard chemotherapy-containing
           regimens for their malignancy

        -  currently require treatment due to progressive malignancy

        -  deemed to be incurable by standard therapy

      Patients may not have:

        -  a history of allogeneic stem cell transplantation

        -  CNS disease

      DESIGN:

        -  PBMC obtained by leukapheresis (approximately 5 X 109 cells) will be cultured in the
           presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell proliferation.

        -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of approximately 108 to 5 X 108 cells to
           retroviral vector supernatant containing the anti-CD19 CAR.

        -  With the approval of amendment S, patients will receive fludarabine and cyclophosphamide
           chemotherapy (NMA) for lymphocyte-depletion, followed by cryopreserved
           anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells.

        -  Patients will be followed until disease progression

        -  Patients who have responded to treatment and then progress may receive one retreatment

               1. Patient must have a CD19-expressing B cell malignancy. Patients with Diffuse
                  large B-cell lymphoma, Primary Mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, and Diffuse large
                  B-cell lymphoma transformed from follicular lymphoma must have measurable disease
                  after at least two prior chemotherapy regimens one of which must have contained

               2. Confirmation of diagnosis of B cell malignancy and positivity for CD19 confirmed
                  by the Laboratory of Pathology of the NCI. The choice of whether to use flow
                  Cytometry or immunohistochemistry will be determined by what is the most easily
                  available tissue sample in each patient. Immunohistochemistry will be used for
                  lymph node biopsies, flow Cytometry will be used for peripheral blood, fine
                  needle aspirates and bone marrow samples.

               3. Patients must have indications for treatment for their B cell malignancy at the
                  time of enrollment on this trial.

                       are HIV seropositive can have decreased immune -competence and thus be less
                       responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its
                       toxicities.).

                    -  2. Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen and hepatitis C antibody unless
                       antigen negative. If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patients

                  determined by an echocardiogram.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients that require urgent therapy due to tumor mass effects such as bowel

             be positive for any of the above do not need to be retested; may be performed within 3

             physical exam will have lumbar puncture for examination of cerebral spinal fluid.

         11. Patients may undergo lumbar puncture (LP) for flow cytometry of the CSF in order to
             assess the presence of CD19 positive lymphocytes for potential correlation with
             neurologic toxicity. Patients who have no neurologic symptoms at the time of LP

             will be eligible for enrollment regardless of the results of the flow cytometry.
