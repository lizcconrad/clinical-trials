  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following lung surgery air may continue to leak from the surface of the lung. Chest drains
      are placed to allow this air to be removed safely and prevent the lung from collapsing.
      Drains need to remain until the air leak from the lung has ceased.

      Air which continues to leak results in longer chest drainage times which cause increased
      discomfort and immobility for patients. These patients are at risk of secondary complications
      such as infection. Longer hospital stays and increased costs ensue. A randomised controlled
      trial (RCT) conducted at The Royal Brompton Hospital has shown clear benefits in the
      management of difficult air leak with the use of BioGlue. BioGlue is a surgical sealant
      applied to the surface of the lung at the time of surgery.

      BioGlue is of bovine origin. Concerns exist regarding the potential risk of transmission of
      blood borne diseases with bovine derived medical products. Should a surgical adhesive without
      these potential risks prove as effective as BioGlue then its use could be commended.

      The Vivostat System is a medical system that derives a sealant from the patient's own blood.
      A small study has shown that it may also be of benefit in the management of difficult air
      leaks. The principal aim of our RCT is to compare the duration of air leak, length of chest
      drainage and hospital stay associated with BioGlue to that of Vivostat.
