  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult intracranial ependymoma is a relatively rare brain tumour entity, accounting for 2-5%
      of all intracranial neoplasms. The pertinent prognostic factors as well as the pattern of
      recurrence remain to be elucidated. According to several recent reports, the prognostic value
      of Karnofski performance status, tumour location, the extent of surgical removal,
      histological grade and even postoperative radiotherapy remain controversial. As a
      consequence, optimal therapeutic management of adult intracranial ependymomas remains an
      ongoing debate. For this reason, a retrospective study conducted by the French society of
      neurosurgery (SFNC), neuropathology (SFNP) and the association of the neuro-oncologists of
      French expression (ANOCEF) was undertaken and allowed to collect 258 cases coming from 25
      centers, initially diagnosed as intracranial ependymomas between 1990 and 2004. Clinical and
      follow-up data of these patients are known and the paraffin embedded samples as well as the
      frozen tissues available have been centralized. Central pathological review of these 258
      cases was conducted by two senior neuropathologists and confirmed the diagnosis of ependymoma
      in 152 cases, thus constituting the most important series of the literature. Few molecular
      studies were carried out on ependymomas. The investigators have the opportunity, based on
      this important series, to determine the clinicopathological criteria and the molecular
      markers who will allow a better characterization of the diagnosis and the prognosis of these
      tumors.
