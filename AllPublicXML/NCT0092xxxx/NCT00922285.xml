      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Test the effects of an art therapy intervention on emotional distress in caregivers of
           pediatric patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation for cancer.

        -  Describe pro-social interactions of caregivers of pediatric patients undergoing bone
           marrow transplantation for cancer.

        -  Describe the illness experience of caregivers and how it is impacted by the art therapy
           intervention.

        -  Describe the caregivers' current health-related quality of life and life meaning prior
           to pediatric patients initiation of bone marrow transplantation for cancer.

        -  Determine the effect size for calculating the sample needed for a randomized clinical
           trial.

      OUTLINE: Caregivers undergo art therapy over 60 minutes once a week for 6 weeks. Each session
      comprises developing trust through the expression of support, affirmation, and collaboration;
      creating intimacy through attunement; exploring affective states; integrative processing
      through the creation of an autobiographical narrative; and identifying opportunities for
      continued exploration and resources that support the client, should that exploration become
      necessary.

      Caregivers also complete a Meaning of Life Questionnaire and a Family Quality of Life Scale
      at baseline and at the end of week 6.
