  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a register-based, epidemiological study of HPV type distribution in women aged 18
      years and above with recurrent conization following a primary conization for high grade
      lesions/ microinvasive carcinomas. This study will involve data collection from different
      databases in the Cancer Registry of Norway.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects must meet the following criteria at study entry:

          -  Women aged 18 years and above at the time of the collection of the primary cone
             specimen;

          -  Who have undergone for the first time a conization due to high grade lesions or
             microinvasive cervical carcinomas, histologically diagnosed in 2003, with possible
             extension backwards in time;

          -  Availability of recurrent cone specimen with high grade lesions/ microinvasive
             cervical carcinomas or invasive cervical cancer;

          -  Availability in designated local laboratories of the primary and recurrent cone
             specimens;

          -  The cone specimen was adequately preserved;

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject. If the subject is deceased, the
             cone and biopsy specimens will be used according to prior approval from the Ethics
             Committee.
