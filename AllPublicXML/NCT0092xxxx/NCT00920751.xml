      Hypothesis

        1. Study method achieves lower requirement for medications

        2. Study method increases overall cecal intubation with comparable assessment of current
           experience and patient willingness to repeat future colonoscopy compared with
           conventional colonoscopy

        3. Study method results in reduction in medication-related (cardiorespiratory)
           complications, faster turn around of patients, compared with conventional colonoscopy

        4. Study method improves bowel preparation and increases polyp pickup rate

      Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening for the high and the low risk healthy asymptomatic VA
      patients is being promoted (VHA directive). Compliance with this Directive will result in an
      increased number of VA patients undergoing colonoscopy. The demand for colonoscopy far
      exceeds the capacity available to perform the procedure in the VA system. The conventional
      practice for colonoscopy at VA facilities across the country is to perform colonoscopy under
      conscious sedation with air insufflation. Efficiency is governed by the fact that sedated
      patients require time and space for recovery and these are major limiting factors in the
      current setting for the use of colonoscopy for CRC screening.

      Methods that maintain a high success rate and good patient assessment improve overall
      compliance for surveillance colonoscopy. Our preliminary experience showed that patients are
      able to complete successful colonoscopy without sedation in 52% of cases when colonoscopy was
      aided by a water infusion in lieu of air insufflation method. In this group of patients, the
      shortened recovery time means a quick turn around of patient and a more efficient endoscopy
      service. Patients are able to communicate better with the staff and physician regarding their
      problem and discharge instructions, and not subjected to the amnesic effect of sedation. Next
      day follow-up of patient by telephone contact which requires commitment of staff time can be
      obviated.

      If this randomized study confirms the success of our preliminary findings and this technique
      is adopted by more endoscopists, a larger number of VA patients may benefit from less
      sedation complications and at the same time allow for more efficient colonoscopy screening
      services.
