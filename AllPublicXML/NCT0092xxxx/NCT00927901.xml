    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of each treatment period (Day 7)</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the average of measurements made 23 hours 10 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post-dose at Baseline and at the end of each treatment period. The analysis included period baseline FEV1 as covariate.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Using Rescue Medication During Each 7 Day Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of each treatment period (Day 7)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients recorded use of rescue medication (salbutamol/albuterol multi-dose inhaler) as the number of puffs taken in respective preceding 12 hours morning and evening in a diary. Patient with any use of rescue medication (any number of puffs &gt; 0) was included to calculate endpoint.</description>

    <measure>Indacaterol Exposure (AUC[0-24 Hours]) at the End of Each 7 Day Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>End of each treatment period (Day 7)</time_frame>
    <description>Venous blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluation were collected at 15 and 30 minutes; and 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 hours post-dose at the end of each 7 day treatment period and were analyzed using a LC-MS/MS assay. Area under the concentration-time curve up to 24 hours (AUC[0-24 hours]) was calculated from concentration-time data and recorded sampling times using non-compartmental methods.</description>

          -  Treatments for asthma and allied conditions:

          -  The following treatments should not be used unless they have been stabilized prior to

The dose refers to 400 μg of free base indacaterol. Patients received each treatment for 7 days via the Concept1 single-dose dry-powder inhaler. There was a washout period of at least 7 days between each treatment period. Daily inhaled corticosteroid treatment (if applicable) was to remain stable throughout the study. The short-acting β2-agonist salbutamol/albuterol was available for rescue use throughout the study.</description>
