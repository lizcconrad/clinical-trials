    <textblock>
      Mother-infant relationship disturbances broadly comprise three areas; maternal distress,
      infant functional problems, and relationship difficulties. Given the high frequency of such
      disturbances and the relative paucity of randomized treatment studies, substantial systematic
      investigation is needed. This project is a randomized controlled study comparing
      mother-infant psychoanalytic treatment with treatment as usual in cases where mothers and/or
      health visitors demanded expert help.

      DESIGN

      Eighty dyads with infants below 1½ years of age are interviewed and then randomly assigned to
      MIP or TAU. An end-point interview follows after ½ year, evaluating the intervention effects.

      The MIP treatments are performed by IPA psychoanalysts at the Infant Reception Service of the
      Swedish Psychoanalytic Society. TAU implies contact with a Health Visitor at a Child Health
      Centre. Additional treatments within the TAU framework suggested at the initiative by the
      health visitor or the mother are registered at the end-point interview. Each TAU case will
      also be investigated via CHC records.

      INSTRUMENTS

      Mother-report questionnaires; the Ages and Stages Questionnaire:Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE;
      Squires et al., 2002), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS; Cox et al., 1987)and
      the Swedish Parental Questionnaire (SPSQ; Östberg et al., 1997).

      Independently rated video-taped mother-infant interactions: the Emotional Availability Scale
      (EAS; Biringen, 1998).

      Relationship assessment: the Parent-Infant Relationship Global Assessment Scale (PIR-GAS;
      ZERO-TO-THREE, 2005).

      Prognostic assessment: the Mother-Baby Interview (MOBI; Salomonsson, 2009). Interview-based
      assessments of psychoanalytic aptitude and quality of the process.

      Ideal typing (Stuhr&amp;Wachholz, 2001) of &quot;maternal types&quot; and &quot;infant types.&quot;

    <description>TAU involved scheduled health visitor calls at the local Child Health Centre (CHC), with paediatric checkups at 2 and 6 months of age. The health visitor is encouraged to promote attachment and to detect postnatal depressions. Mothers may be offered parental groups, infant massage or guidance promoting interaction, as well as appointments with a paediatrician or a child psychiatric psychologist. Within the TAU framework, additional treatment may be initiated by the health visitor or the mother. This will be registered at the end-point interview.</description>

    <description>MIP (Norman, 2001; 2004) is a psychoanalytic method adapted to the requirements of the infant as analysand in the presence of his mother. The analyst strives to recruit the baby for an emotional interchange, though this does not imply any belief whatsoever that the infant understands verbal communication. Rather, the analyst addresses the baby to help him liberate emotions consolidated in symptoms such as screaming, avoiding maternal eye contact, and breast refusal. The analyst takes great care in enrolling the participant mother. This is to enhance her understanding of the baby's predicament and the nature of their relation, as well as giving her all space needed to vent her own frustration, depression and anxiety.</description>
