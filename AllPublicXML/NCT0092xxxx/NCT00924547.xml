  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral supplementation of patients affected by cystic fibrosis with docosahexanoic acid (DHA)
      will result in normalization of the known fatty acid derangements in these patients and will
      diminish the production of proinflammatory isoprostanes such as 8-isoprostane-PGF2α.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design will be a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial.
      After informed consent has been obtained, 18 eligible subjects with pancreatic insufficient
      cystic fibrosis will be enrolled in the study. Participants will take part in two 4 week
      study sessions, each separated by a 4 week washout period. One session will involve treatment
      with placebo and the other two sessions will provide treatment with approximately 25mg and 35
      mg of DHA/kg of body weight. The patients will be assigned to each of the treatment sessions
      in random order, as described above. The DHA source will be provided by Martek Biosciences
      Corporation, Columbia, MD, USA in the form of a chewable capsule containing 200 mg of DHA.
      The placebos will be identical to the DHA supplement but will not contain the active
      ingredient, DHA. Subjects will be instructed to take the study capsules in addition to their
      normal doses of pancreatic enzymes with meals and to maintain their usual diets. Blood,
      urine, and exhaled breath condensate samples will be collected at baseline and after
      completion of each of the study periods. Patients will be screened and enrolled when they
      present to clinic for their routine check-up. The subjects have routine blood work at their
      annual check-ups, and when possible will have an additional tube of blood saved for the
      baseline fatty acid profiles so as to avoid unnecessary blood draws. Following each study
      period, blood draw, urine collection, and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) will be collected
      at the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center. The patients will also be given the supply of DHA
      and placebo (for the entire study) at time of enrollment. The order in which they take the
      supplement or the placebo will be determined using a randomization table.
