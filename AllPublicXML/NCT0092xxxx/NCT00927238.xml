      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of XL TDR in patients
      with single-level degenerative disc disease compared to other devices approved by the FDA for
      the same or similar indications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The XL TDR® eXtreme Lateral Total Disc Replacement consists of two endplates that are
      provided in a number of sizes to accommodate a variety of patient anatomies and pathologies.
      The XL TDR device is made up of a ball and socket articulation and the joint is made of
      CoCrMo alloy.

      The XL TDR is intended to be used to reconstruct the spine following the removal of part or
      all of the intervertebral disc on one level of the lumbar spine.

      The XL TDR is indicated for reconstruction of the disc following discectomy in skeletally
      mature subjects with symptomatic degenerative disc disease (DDD) of the lumbar spine at one
      level from L1-L5. DDD is defined as discogenic back pain with degeneration of the disc
      confirmed by patient history radiographic studies.
