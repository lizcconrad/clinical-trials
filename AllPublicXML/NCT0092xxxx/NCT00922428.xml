      The purpose of this observational study is to give an overview of the use of PASCOE-Agil
      HOM-Injektopas in a 2-4 week treatment of rheumatic disorders of different aetiology and
      localisation, displaying a variety of symptoms.

      Efficacy and tolerability of the drug will be assessed. Special regard will be taken to the
      administration management in relation to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The observational study was carried out by medically-trained doctors who generally treated patients with rheumatic disorders. By choosing a range of different medical specialties – predominantly orthopaedics, rheumatology, general medicine, sports medicine and family doctors – it was ensured that a broad spectrum of patients was recruited.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The observational study was carried out between January 2008 and the end of May 2008 by 280 therapists. The non-interventional character of an observational study meant that no exact timeframe for the treatment of patients was specified.</pre_assignment_details>
