    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of foretinib (also known
      as GSK1363089) when used in the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
      (liver cancer).

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of foretinib (also
      known as GSK1363089) when used in the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma (liver cancer), and to assess the safety and tolerability of that dose in this
      patient population.

      The MTD will be identified during Phase I, by standard dose-escalation of foretinib. Then
      Phase II will assess the safety and tolerability of foretinib dosed at MTD.
