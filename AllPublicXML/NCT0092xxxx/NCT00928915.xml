  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is the most feared complication in patients on vitamin K
      antagonists (VKA). VKA related ICH occurs 8-10 times more frequently and the mortality is 2
      times higher than in non-anticoagulated patients. Mortality may rise up to 67%. The higher
      mortality rate may in part be due to the higher rate of haematoma expansion (HE) over a
      longer period after symptom onset. International guidelines recommend treatment of VKA-ICH
      with prothrombin complex (PCC) or fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) both in combination with
      Vitamin-K. But these recommendations are not based on randomized controlled trials. It is
      known that these drugs lower the INR, and thus it is assumed that normalization of
      coagulopathy may lead to haemostasis and reduction of HE. Safety and efficacy of these
      treatments have never been studied in a prospective controlled trial.

      The investigators' questions are: How potent are PCC and FFP in normalization of the INR?
      What is the safety profile of each of these drugs?

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Spontaneous ICH (intraparenchymal), subdural hematoma (SDH) diagnosed by CT scanning ≤
             12 hours after onset of symptoms. In case of unknown time of symptom onset: time
             between last seen in healthy condition and first CCT ≤ 12 hours.

          -  Therapy receiving vitamin K antagonists (VKA)

          -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≥ 2

          -  Signed informed consent form, or signed informed consent by a legal representative,
             judicial consent in cases where no legal representative is available in time, or
             consent of an independent physician familiar with the indication in cases where the
             first three possibilities can not be realized.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with ICH not related to vitamin-K antagonist therapy or

          -  Patients with secondary ICH related to infarction, hemophilia or other coagulopathy,
             tumor, hemorrhagic infarction, cerebrovenous thrombosis, aneurysm, arteriovenous
             malformations (AVM) or severe trauma
