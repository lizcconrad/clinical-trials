      The purpose of the study is to determine whether lithium is safe and effective in the
      treatment of ALS

    <textblock>
      Daily doses of lithium, have been found to delay progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
      (ALS) in a 15-month study of 44 patients with ALS. At the end of the trial, about 30 percent
      of the patients that took riluzole had died, while all those receiving riluzole plus lithium
      had survived. the lithium group had slower progression as measure by a test of breathing
      (FVC) and strength.

      This study will determine whether lithium in combination with riluzole delay progression of
      patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease in comparison of an historical cohort of
      ALS patients treated with riluzole alone.
