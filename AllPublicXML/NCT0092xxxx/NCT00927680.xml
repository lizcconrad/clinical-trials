    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer in Puerto Rico (PR) accounting
      for approximately 1,500 individuals annually, which represent 12% of all cancer cases in the
      island. The genetic epidemiology of CRC among Hispanic populations is not well studied, hence
      studies focused on large, well defined ethnic groups such as Puerto Ricans, are clearly
      warranted. The first step towards evaluating the molecular, environmental, and genetic
      epidemiology of CRC in PR is to establish a population-based familial CRC registry. The
      following specific aims have been proposed:

      Specific Aim 1: To prospectively identify and recruit approximately 300 CRC probands from two
      distinct geographical areas in PR (Metropolitan and Southern Region). From each proband the
      investigators will obtain a pedigree extended to second-degree relatives and cousins.
      Assuming 10% will be positive for a family history of CRC, the investigators will then
      recruit all 30 probands with a family history of CRC and a sample of 15 family-history
      negative probands and obtain: paraffin-embedded tumors blocks, blood samples, risk factor and
      food frequency questionnaires.

      Specific Aim 2: To prospectively identify and recruit selected relatives (parents,
      grandparents, and same generation relatives - cousins and siblings) from the 45 probands
      identified in Specific Aim 1. In addition, for siblings and cousins of probands (i.e.
      relatives in the same generation as the proband), the investigators will obtain risk factor
      and food frequency questionnaires, and for colorectal cancer cases, tumor blocks and
      pathology reports of their cancers.

      Specific Aim 3: To estimate from this pilot study the following parameters: (a) response rate
      of probands and their selected relatives; (b) response rate of participants for each data
      item; (c) family history of CRC and other cancers; (d) number of living first- and
      second-degree relatives and cousins of probands; (e) number of these relatives who live in
      the same household and region/municipality; (f) prevalence/distribution of selected risk
      factors from the administered questionnaires.

      Data obtained from this study will serve as the foundation for our large, island-wide,
      population-based, genetic-epidemiologic study of familial colorectal cancer in Puerto Rico.
      Through this feasibility study, we will assess the feasibility: (1) of recruiting colorectal
      cancer patients using the PR Central Cancer Registry, (2) of evaluating family pedigrees and
      recruiting the relatives of probands (3) obtaining tumor, blood, medical and exposure
      information from both probands and their relatives. Providing important data on Hispanic
      populations that would enable family-based case-control studies of risk factors for CRC, with
      an emphasis on candidate genes in selected carcinogenic pathways, genetic and epigenetic
      modifications. Furthermore, information obtained from this proposal may serve to identify
      families that would be informative for linkage studies to potentially map new genes, evaluate
      genotype-phenotype correlations, gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions.

        1. Probands will be ascertained from the Puerto Rico Central Cancer Registry (PRCCR),
             from the monthly report of incident colorectal cancer cases. Eligible cases were
             persons (1) with pathologic diagnosis of colorectal cancer; (2) who were 15 years of
             age or older, and (3) without previous history of colorectal cancer.

          2. Probands will be ascertained from the Oncology Hospital, UDH Hospital and the Ashford
             Presbyterian Community Hospital.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  patients with colon polyps or colon cancer

          -  patients will have a colonoscopy or colon surgery to treat a benign condition such as
             fissure, fistula, or hemorrhoids

        Exclusion criteria:

        Participation in this study is limited to persons 15 years or older with colon polyps or
        colon cancer and control subjects 21 years or older with no malignant conditions in the
        colon and / or rectum. Controls between the ages of 15 to 20 years will be not evaluated.
        The reason is colon cancer occurs in people under 21 years, except in special cases
        associated with certain genetic causes. People who cannot sign the consent may not
        participate in this study.
