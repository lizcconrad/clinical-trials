      This study provides cancer care through the National Cancer Institute's Medical Oncology
      Branch (MOB) to patients who are not enrolled in an active treatment research protocol.
      Patients receive standard treatments only; no investigational therapies are provided on this
      protocol.

      Patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this protocol. Candidates are patients
      for whom an NCI investigator decides that the interests of the patient and the NCI are best
      served by the patient's enrollment in this protocol to receive care and follow-up within the
      MOB. This includes patients in the following categories:

        -  Patients previously enrolled in NCI trials whose participation in this protocol may
           continue to provide researchers important scientific information

        -  Patients who will be eligible for a research protocol within the foreseeable future

        -  Patients whose medical welfare will be seriously compromised by referral back to the
           community, such as patients with a rare or complex disease for which community resources
           are inadequate or unavailable

        -  Terminally ill patients who have received most of their specialized medical care at the
           Clinical Center and for whom humanitarian considerations dictate that they continue to
           receive their medical care at NIH after going off study for the remaining weeks or
           months of life

        -  Patients with cancer or HIV, or people at risk for cancer or HIV for whom cancer
           treatments at the NCI are requested through the MOB consult service

        -  Patients who are participating in a non-treatment NCI research protocol and require
           standard-of-care therapy

        -  Patients with cancer or HIV or people at risk for cancer for whom cancer treatment or
           management at the NCI would add significant value to the institute's cancer training
           program

      Participants receive standard medical care, including periodic routine laboratory tests,
      diagnostic x-rays, and nuclear medicine scans to monitor the course of illness and the
      effects of any treatment.

      Background:

      It may be in the interest of the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) to treat and/or follow
      certain subjects who are not currently enrolled on an active research protocol.

      Objective:

      The objective of this protocol is to add value to the medical or surgical oncology training
      programs by providing treatment and medical follow-up for NCI patients and other Institute
      consult patients not currently enrolled on an active research protocol.

      Eligibility:

      It is in the best interests of the subject and the CCR for the subject to receive treatment
      or

      donate cellular products at the NCI, NIH Intramural Research Program.

      Design:

      No investigational therapies will be administered on this study. This protocol is not a
      platform to perform pilot studies of off-label uses for standard agents.

      This protocol will provide the administrative vehicle to provide cancer care for patients in
      the intramural research program.

      Medical/surgical/radiotherapeutic care, treatment and follow-up is provided for subjects who
      are not currently enrolled on an active protocol.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patient must be age 18 or older.

        A CCR investigator decides that it is in the best interest of the patient and the CCR for
        the subject to receive treatment and follow-up at the NCI/NIH.

        Related cell therapy donors for patients previously transplanted on an NCI trial who
        require non-investigational diagnostic studies and/or therapies for transplant-related
        complications that arise urgently and/or are unable to be addressed on an existing NIH
        treatment protocol or by providers outside the NIH.

        Volunteer unrelated donors may donate cellular therapy products to patients on this
        protocol. Volunteer unrelated donors will not enroll on this protocol and unrelated donor
        evaluation, suitability and eligibility determination, and collection takes place at
        National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP)-affiliated centers or cooperative registries in
        accordance with the most recent FDA, NMDP, and AABB regulations and standards. NMDP network
        standards and processes are covered by the NIH NMDP Transplant Center Agreement, and the
        latest version of the NMDP Standards.

        The patient or their Legally Authorized Representative is able and willing to provide
        informed consent. Note, participants who can expect to receive no direct benefit on this
        study (i.e. donors) may not consent through an LAR.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Participants who are receiving an investigational therapy.

        Donor participants who unable to provide the informed consent.
