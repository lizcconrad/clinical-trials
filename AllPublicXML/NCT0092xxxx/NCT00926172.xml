    <textblock>
      The Chinese Cerebral Aneurysms Survey is a continuing prospective study among middle-aged and
      older individuals (35 - 75 years) that aims to determine the prevalence of cerebral
      intracranial aneurysms in the general population with MRA at 3.0 Tesla (T).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral intracranial aneurysms are common. In angiographic and autopsy studies, estimates
      for prevalence vary between 0.2 and 9.9 percent. The methods used to detect the aneurysms
      markedly influenced the proportion of aneurysms. Retrospective autopsy studies probably give
      an underestimation and prospective angiography studies an overestimation of the actual
      prevalence. Accurate data on the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms are essential in
      evaluating the results of screening programs for aneurysms in general population.

      During the past decade, MRA, as a preferred accuracy modality for noninvasive intracranial
      vascular imaging at most centers, is playing an increasing role in the evaluation of patients
      suspected of having intracranial aneurysms. In recurrent study, we have tested that MRA at 3T
      has excellent sensitivity, accuracy, and correlation with DSA and is comparable to catheter
      cerebral angiography for the evaluation of patients with intracranial aneurysms (Stroke, in
      press). Therefore, we examined trends in intracranial aneurysm prevalence with the use of MRA
      at 3.0T to determine the true prevalence of cerebral intracranial aneurysms in the general
      middle-aged or elder population.

        The investigators recruited 4500-5000 native inhabitants aged 35-75 years lived in China
        according to China census-tract data from the year 2005. The gender was accordance with
        China census-tract data, and the population aged 35-75 years has a higher incident of
        intracranial aneurysm in the literature. Assuming an 8 percent prevalence of intracranial
        aneurysm in the general population and using a two-sided alpha value of 0.05, the
        investigators estimated that 4500-5000 native inhabitants would need to be enrolled for the
        study.
