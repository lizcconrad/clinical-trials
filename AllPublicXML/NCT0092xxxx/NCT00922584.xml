      This trial's aim is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of sorafenib in relapsed advanced
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) after failure of epidermal growth factor
      receptors-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment and to explore the correlation
      between clinical outcomes and biochemical modulation of signal transduction pathways.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sorafenib, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, targets the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway at the level of
      Raf kinase and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases, and has shown efficacy against NSCLC in Phase
      I/II trials. Because the targets of sorafenib are different from that of EGFR-TKI, it is
      reasonable for sorafenib to treat relapsed advanced NSCLC after failure of EGFR-TKI
      treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological documented stage IIIB (not amenable for radical regional
             therapy) or stage IV NSCLC. The pathological diagnosis must be adenocarcinoma with or
             without bronchioalveolar carcinoma. Sputum cytology alone is excluded.

          -  Recurrent or progressive disease after prior one EGFR-TKI treatment. The patient must
             have stopped the EGFR-TKI treatment for at least two weeks. The response to EGFR-TKI
             should be partial response or complete response or stable disease (the duration of
             stable disease should be more than 3 months). Patients who had never received
             chemotherapy or received one regimen chemotherapy before EGFR-TKI are eligible.

          -  Prior surgery, including palliative surgery, is permitted if performed 4 weeks before
             the start of study treatment and the patient is fully recovered.

          -  Prior localized radiotherapy 4 weeks before the start of study is permitted if it was
             not administered to target lesions selected for this study, unless progression of the
             selected target lesions within the radiation portal is documented. Patient has
             recovered from CTCAE grade 3/4 toxicity of radiotherapy. Palliative radiotherapy
             within 4 weeks of start of study is also permitted.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years.

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1,or 2. Life expectancy of at least 3 months. Measurable
             disease, according to the RECIST, the presence of at least one uni-dimensional
             measurable lesion with longest diameter &gt; 20 mm by conventional techniques or &gt; 10 mm
             by spiral CT scan.

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory
             requirements to be conducted within 7 days prior to screening:

          -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dl

          -  Platelet count &gt; 75x109/L

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal

          -  ALT and AST &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal without liver metastasis, ALT and AST &lt; 5 x
             upper limit of normal with liver metastasis.

          -  International normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal and prothrombin
             time (PT) ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal. Patients who are being therapeutically
             anticoagulated with an agent such as Coumadin or heparin will be allowed to
             participate provided that no prior evidence of underlying abnormality in these
             parameters exists.

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             sorafenib clinical trial.

          -  Mixed small cell and non-small cell lung cancer histology. Other pathological types of
             NSCLC than adenocarcinoma and bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma.
