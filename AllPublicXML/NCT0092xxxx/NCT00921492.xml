  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis The overall hypothesis is that non-obese (BMI &lt;30) women with PCOS have high
      luteinising hormone (LH) and cortisol pulse frequency and amplitude and that repeated
      low-frequency EA restore these alterations and induce ovulation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1. Elucidate if low-frequency EA induce ovulation and restore LH frequency and amplitude
      as well as sex steroid secretion as compared to a control group receiving same amount of
      attention.

      Aim 2. Elucidate if low-frequency EA restore cortisol frequency and amplitude compared to a
      control group receiving same amount of attention.

      Aim 3. Elucidate if low-frequency EA restore psychological distress and quality of life as
      compared to a control group receiving same amount of attention.in women with PCOS.
