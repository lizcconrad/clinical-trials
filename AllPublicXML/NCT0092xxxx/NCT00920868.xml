  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to find the highest tolerated dose of the study drugs:
      capecitabine, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, and dasatinib given in combination to subjects with
      advanced solid tumors. This will occur in the first part of the study (Phase I). Once this
      dose has been determined, it will be given to subjects with advanced metastatic colorectal
      cancer in the second part of the study (Phase II).

      By giving these drugs in combination, researchers hope to evaluate the side effects of the
      study drugs in both groups, and to determine if this combination could possibly decrease or
      stabilize the cancer being treated.

      Subjects will be enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) and Rocky Mountain Cancer
      Center.

      After satisfying eligibility and screening criteria, patients will be treated on 21 day
      cycles.

      ABOUT THE STUDY DRUGS

        -  Capecitabine (Xeloda™) is an oral (taken by mouth) chemotherapy drug in tablet form made
           by Roche Laboratories Inc. Capecitabine has been approved for use by the Food and Drug
           Administration (FDA) for first line treatment (treatment that should be used for cancer
           that has not been treated yet) of metastatic colorectal cancer and also for metastatic
           breast cancer.

        -  Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin™) is an intravenous (given by injection into a vein) chemotherapy
           drug made by Sanofi-Synthélabo. This drug is also approved by the FDA for use in
           metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  Bevacizumab (Avastin™) is a type of intravenous cancer treatment called anti-angiogenic
           therapy (a type of therapy to treat cancer that interferes with blood flow to the tumor,
           thereby stopping tumor growth, and possibly leading to tumor shrinkage) made by
           Genentech Inc. Bevacizumab is approved by the FDA for first line treatment of metastatic
           colorectal cancer in combination with other chemotherapy.

        -  Dasatinib (Sprycel™) is an oral drug made by Bristol Myers Squib, Inc (BMS). Dasatinib
           is approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia or for patients that are resistant to a medicine called imatinib
           mesylate (Gleevec™ ).
