  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether imaging with 18F-choline PET/CT can provide
      information that may help guide subsequent investigational or clinical treatments for
      patients with advanced (hormone-refractory) metastatic prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who meet eligibility criteria and are enrolled will undergo whole-body imaging with
      18F-choline PET/CT at 3 time points during the course of treatment that is indicated for
      castrate resistant prostate cancer. The 1st PET/CT scan is performed at baseline before
      treatment initiation. The 2nd and 3rd scans are performed at two other treatment-releated
      timepoints or at approximately 1 month and 3 months after treatment initiation. Change in
      lesion 18F-choline uptake from baseline measured at each time point will be determined.
      Cancer 18F-choline uptake will be evaluated as a marker of therapeutic response in comparison
      to PSA response and symptom scores. Treatment-related changes in tumor 18F-choline uptake
      occur will be studied after the second and third PET scans to determine the acuity by which
      changes in tumor 18F-choline uptake can be expected following specific treatments for
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer. The study evaluates a diagnostic intervention and the
      treatments themselves are not considered part of the investigation. All treatment decisions
      will be made independent of the study and must be deemed clinically-warranted by a treating
      physician.

    <description>PSA levels measured from the start of treatment over the period of follow-up were recorded. Time to PSA progression was calculated as the number of days from the start of treatment to the date of the first PSA test result that represented a 30% or greater increase from the PSA nadir, confirmed on the basis of repeated PSA measurements. For proportional hazards regression analysis, the percentage change in PSA level within 15 wk of starting treatment was calculated, using a 50% or greater decrease in PSA level as a predefined definition of PSA re- sponse based on Prostate Cancer Working Group guidelines.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of written informed consent.

          2. Men, over 18 years of age, with histologically-confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer

          3. History of treatment by complete androgen blockade for greater than 3 months prior to
             enrollment

          4. Progressive disease evidenced by 2 consecutive rises in PSA measured at least 1 week
             apart, with the absolute value of the latest PSA &gt; 5.0 ng/ml.

          5. A rise in PSA following anti-androgen drug withdrawal, above the last PSA value before
             withdrawal.

          6. Patient has agreed to treatment for hormone-refractory (ie. castrate-resistant)
             prostate cancer under supervision of a medical oncologist, urologist, radiation
             oncologist or nuclear medicine physician. Treatments indicated for HRPC are
             docetaxel-, cabazitaxel-, or mitoxantrone-based chemotherapy, abiraterone, radium-223,
             enzalutamide, or sipulecuil-T.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Other co-existing malignancies or malignancies diagnosed within the last 5 years with
             the exception of basal cell carcinoma or superficial transitional cell carcinoma of
             the bladder.

          2. Serious underlying medical conditions that would otherwise impair the patient's
             ability to undergo imaging.

          3. Patient weighs over 350 lbs (due to scanner weight limit).

          4. Clinical life expectancy &lt; 12 weeks.

          5. Participated in other radioactive drug studies where estimated total cumulative dose
             within 1 year is &gt; 0.05 Sievert for whole body, active blood-forming organs, eye lens,
             gonads, or 0.15 Sievert for other organs.

          6. Concurrent Therapy. Allowed: Prior or concurrent chemotherapy, but must be &gt; 12 weeks
             since last treatment at enrollment; prior or concurrent hormonal therapy; prior
             surgery; prior or concurrent bisphosphonate; prior or concurrent receptor/biologic
             agent allowed if given on approved study protocol.

        <title>Proportional Hazards Regression Analysis of Time to PSA Progression</title>
        <description>PSA levels measured from the start of treatment over the period of follow-up were recorded. Time to PSA progression was calculated as the number of days from the start of treatment to the date of the first PSA test result that represented a 30% or greater increase from the PSA nadir, confirmed on the basis of repeated PSA measurements. For proportional hazards regression analysis, the percentage change in PSA level within 15 wk of starting treatment was calculated, using a 50% or greater decrease in PSA level as a predefined definition of PSA re- sponse based on Prostate Cancer Working Group guidelines.</description>
