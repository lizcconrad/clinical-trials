    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of this trial is to evaluate naltrexone's efficacy in light of genetic
      variation and brain response to alcohol cues utilizing a neuroimaging paradigm. This trial
      has four specific aims. First, this trial will evaluate whether the presence of the OPRM1
      Asp40 allele substitution is associated with improved treatment response to naltrexone in
      treatment-seeking alcoholics. Second, it will evaluate whether there is a difference in the
      naltrexone dampening of the alcohol cue-induced brain activation dependent on OPRM1 genotype.
      Third, it will explore whether alcohol cue-induced brain activation dampening by naltrexone
      might be a mediating factor in the treatment effects of naltrexone, the OPRM1 gene, or their
      interaction that might be observed in the first aim. Finally, this trial will evaluate the
      effect of medication compliance, or adverse effects, on the observed medication by genotype
      treatment response. A secondary aim will measure medication compliance and side effects based
      on OPRM1 genotype.
