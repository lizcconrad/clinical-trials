  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting to emergency departments (ED) with non-specific complaints (NSC) such as
      &quot;not feeling well&quot;, &quot;feeling weak&quot;, &quot;being tired&quot;, &quot;general deterioration&quot; are a very common
      and well-known, but poorly studied patient group. The differential diagnosis of NSC is
      extremely broad ranging from insufficient home care to acute life-threatening conditions.
      Therefore, the evaluation and diagnostic work-up of these mostly elderly patients with NSC is
      very time-consuming and not straight-forward. Furthermore, the assessment is complicated by
      comorbidities, polypharmacy or an altered mental status. For this reason, potentially
      unnecessary diagnostic efforts are undertaken in order to exclude a serious underlying
      condition, leading to prolonged throughput times and ED observation unit stays.

      On the other hand, the patients` condition might be underestimated by ED physicians, which
      may result in ineffective, delayed or inadequate disposition, as well as poor patient
      outcomes. BANC (formerly BAUCAS) is a series of clinical studies with the intention to
      investigate the usefulness of clinical findings and biomarker levels combined for disposition
      of patients with non-specific complaints presenting to the emergency department.

        The protocol of the BANC study specifies that patients are consecutively enrolled in order
        to obtain a random sample of the source population of ED self-referred and referred
        patients with UC

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All adult non-trauma patients with an Emergency Severity Index (ESI) of 2 or 3 are
             screened for inclusion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with specific chief complaints are excluded. Moreover, patients in whom an
             unambiguous and clear working hypothesis with logical management steps can be
             established are excluded
