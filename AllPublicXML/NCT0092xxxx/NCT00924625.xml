    <textblock>
      This study will be a small randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of
      neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to improve physical function and reverse muscle
      atrophy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The investigators will also determine the
      mechanism by which NMES affects muscle hypertrophy and physical function. The proposed study
      will be the first step in demonstrating that NMES training is an effective alternative to
      highly intense volitional exercises (VE) in individuals with RA. After baseline testing, 60
      individuals with RA will be randomly assigned to a 16-week NMES program or highly intense VE
      program. Both programs will be applied based on the best current clinical evidence. Subjects
      will be re-assessed after intervention. Groups will be compared for differences in
      performance-based and self-reported lower extremity function, muscle volume, muscle strength,
      proportion and area of type I and II muscle fibers, fat content, and muscle oxidative
      capacity from pre- to post-intervention. Changes in physical function, muscle volume, and
      muscle strength will be correlated with proportion and area of type I and II muscle fibers,
      fat content, and markers of muscle oxidative capacity.

    <description>NMES will be used as in clinical practice based on an evidence-based approach. NMES will be applied at the participant's maximum tolerance. Participants will receive 3 treatments/week for 12 weeks with at least 48h between training sessions.</description>

    <description>VE will be used as in clinical practice based on an evidence-based approach. VE program will be the one shown to positively affect muscle hypertrophy and will follow the resistance training principles. Participants will receive 3 treatments/week for 12 weeks with at least 48h between training sessions</description>

    <description>Strength of the quadriceps muscles will be tested at the beginning of each session. During administration of the NMES participant will sit with the knees bent at 70 degrees. The force sensing pad will be secured to the ankle joint. Two electrodes will be placed on the thigh muscle; one near the hip and the other near the knee joint. The intensity of NMES will be increased gradually according with tolerance. During each treatment 15 electrically elicited muscle contractions will be administered to each thigh. Each contraction will last 14 sec followed by 1min rest.</description>

    <description>The training will include bilateral exercises using resistance equipment (Leg Extension and Leg Press machines). Each resistance exercise will have: (a) dynamic muscle action at moderate repetition velocity (1-2 s concentric, 1-2 s eccentric, 2-3 s interval); (b) 3 sets of 8 repetitions with a load corresponding to 80% of one repetition maximum(1-RM); (c) 2-min rest period between sets and exercises.</description>
