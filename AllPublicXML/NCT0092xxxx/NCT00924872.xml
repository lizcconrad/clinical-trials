      To test the hypothesis that persons with stroke can safely and effectively learn to use power
      mobility devices. The primary objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that, with
      formal wheelchair skills training, people who have had a stroke and have been prescribed a
      power wheelchair will have a larger improvement in performance and safety scores on the
      wheelchair skills test than people who have not received wheelchair skills training.
