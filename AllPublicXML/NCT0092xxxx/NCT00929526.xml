  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This extension study is conducted to assess the efficacy of the GSK 580299 vaccine against
      cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions, cervical cancer and cytological
      abnormalities associated with human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 and/or HPV-18 or other oncogenic
      HPV types for an additional two years. All subjects who participated in the primary
      vaccination study NCT00316693 and who confirmed their interest in participating in a long
      term follow up study will therefore be invited to be followed for up to 48 months after
      administration of the first dose of vaccine. In addition, safety and persistence of the
      humoral immune response will be evaluated in this study.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the extension phase at
      Months 36 and 48. The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a
      separate protocol posting (NCT number = NCT00316693).

      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects were randomised in the primary vaccination study NCT00316693 to receive the Cervarix vaccine or the Aimmugen vaccine and were aged 20 - 25 years at the time of first vaccination. Only subjects showing willingness to participate in this long term follow-up study and who had signed the informed consent form entered this study.</pre_assignment_details>
