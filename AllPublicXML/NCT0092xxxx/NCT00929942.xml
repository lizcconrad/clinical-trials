      A prospective observational trial involving 10 patients is planned. Intervention &quot;SX-ELLA
      Stent Degradable DV Bronchial (DV Stent)&quot; will be implanted in the target lesion in general
      anesthesia under fluoroscopy or by direct vision. Before dilatation, extension of the airway
      complications will be measured by bronchoscopy and documented.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive airway complications (OAC) (bronchial stenosis) are a significant problem in lung
      transplantation (LTx), and a special subset of chronic graft dysfunction. The overall rate is
      approximately 20% per recipient. Even though disobliteration (laser, argon-coagulation,
      cryotherapy) or balloon dilatation (bronchoplasty) are performed there is a high rate of
      recurrence. Self expandable metallic stents (SEMS) is one suggested treatment option after
      failed initial therapy but have a high rate of re-stenosis (50-60%). Morbidity, the risk for
      e.g. infection and atelectasis and lower long-term survival are often consequences in pts.
      treated with SEMS. No surgical options aside from re-do-transplantation are available. OAC
      are developing mostly in the time 3 - 6 months post Tx. The idea is a permanent but temporary
      therapy with replacement character of the stenosis which is given in degradable bronchial
      stents.

      Hypothesis: New biodegradable bronchial stents are a successful treatment of benign bronchial
      stenosis after lung transplantation. After stent placement is further disobliteration is less
      frequently used during the next 6 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recurrent airway complication (obstructive or necrotic) after single-order double-lung
             transplantation (at least twice balloon-dilatation or disobliteration therapy).

          -  Patient at least 3 months after lung transplantation and followed in MHH outpatient
             clinic.

          -  Target lesion in the left or right main stem bronchus, intermediate bronchus, right or
             left lower lobe, left upper lobe. Multiple lesions are eligible for inclusion and
             treatment but DV-stent implantation in different target lesions should be at least 6
             weeks apart.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding women.

          -  Patients who are using no double-barrier method of birth control.

          -  Previous use of a metallic stent (SEMS).

          -  Target lesion in the middle lobe bronchus, right upper lobe, carina or trachea.

          -  Previous use of brachytherapy or topical mitomycin.

          -  Pats. after heart-lung transplantation.
