      The study hypothesis (or theory) is that monthly loss of iron before menopause may reduce
      women's risk of hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis.

      This study uses noninvasive, noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of arteries in
      women entering menopause. This will help to determine if there is a correlation between iron
      accumulation and hardening of the arteries. In addition, blood levels of hormones will be
      measured to help show differences due to hormone levels vs. iron accumulation.

    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, is the underlying disease responsible for the
      vast majority of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and afflicted over 30 million
      Americans in 2005. While the prevalence of atherosclerosis is similar in women and men, women
      enjoy a ~5-10 year lag in onset of cardiovascular events compared to men. After menopause, a
      state defined by marked reduction in ovarian hormone production, the incidence of events such
      as heart attack and stroke caused by atherosclerotic plaque rises up to threefold regardless
      of age range. This has prompted numerous investigations of hormone therapy (HT) to lower
      cardiovascular risk to premenopausal levels. Therapeutic trials, however, have not realized a
      cardiovascular benefit; in fact, initiating HT in large randomized trials did not decrease
      and possibly increased cardiovascular risk. Studies of coronary heart disease prevention have
      shown mixed results using estrogen alone vs. estrogen plus progestin, while studies of stroke
      prevention have consistently shown increased risk with HT. Clearly, different therapeutic
      interventions warrant consideration. This proposal seeks to investigate a novel perspective
      using longitudinal clinical studies in women at risk of atherosclerosis. The studies involve
      a new noncontrast, noninvasive MRI method with blood tests that measure cholesterol, hormone
      levels, and inflammation.
