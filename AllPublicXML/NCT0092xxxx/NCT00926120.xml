  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if administering Mogroside Sweetener &quot;PureLo&quot; (the
      study substance) for 14 days will lower the hepatitis C viral load and liver function alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT) levels.

      The primary objectives of the study are to assess the safety and efficacy of administering
      Mogroside Sweetener &quot;PureLo&quot; to genotype 1 subjects at a dose level of 5 grams every 6 hours
      for 14 days on hepatitis C viral load and serum ALT levels. Percentage change in HCV load
      over the first 48 hours and daily for 14 days and change in serum ALT levels over the two
      week period of study, will be calculated for each patient. The number of subjects who show a
      decline in viral load of at least 50% will then be calculated, as will the number of subjects
      who decrease their serum ALT levels by at least 50%. All efficacy and safety analysis will be
      conducted at the end of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Serologic evidence of HVC infection by an anti-HCV antibody test.

          -  Serum HCV RNA quantifiable &gt; 20,000 copies/mL at screening period and demonstrate
             abnormal ALT &gt; 40 for 6 months.

          -  No clinical suspicion or radiological evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and a serum
             AFP &lt; 50 ng/mL.

          -  Negative urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential documented within
             the 24-hour period prior to the first dose for test drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Interferon with or without RBV therapy at any previous time or any other systemic
             antiviral therapy or investigational drug &gt; 3 months prior to the first dose of study
             drug.

          -  Subjects who are expected to need systemic antiviral therapy at any time during the
             study are also excluded.

             with an increased risk of metabolic liver disease.

          -  History or other evidence of a medical condition associated with chronic liver disease
             (e.g., haemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, toxin

             time during the study.

          -  History of major organ transplantation with an existing functional graft.

          -  History of thyroid disease poorly controlled on prescribed medications.
