    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, multicenter study to evaluate efficacy, safety
      and acceptability of pericoital oral contraception with levonorgestrel (LNG). The objectives
      of the study as stated in the study protocol are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of the study regimen among women who have sex 1-4 days a month
           and who are relying on the study regimen as their primary method of contraception

        -  To evaluate the safety of this regimen, with particular emphasis on its effects on
           vaginal bleeding patterns and anemia

        -  To evaluate the acceptability of the regimen The study will enroll fertile women of
           reproductive age who have sex up to 6 days a month, are at low risk for sexually
           transmitted infections (STIs), have no contraindications to progestin-only oral
           contraceptives,have no serious contraindications to pregnancy, and are willing to use an
           investigational method of contraception as their only contraceptive method for 6.5
           months (each tablet contains 0.75 mg LNG to be used after every sex act).
