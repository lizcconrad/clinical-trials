    <measure>Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Ipilimumab Manufactured by Process C Relative to the Cmax of Ipilimumab Manufactured by Process B - Evaluable Pharmacokinetic Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>Single-dose Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of ipilimumab were derived from serum concentration versus time data. Cmax was measured from first dose to end of the induction period (4 doses) as micrograms per milliliter (μg/mL). Samples were obtained at 0 hour (predose) on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, and Weeks 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10; Day 1, samples were also obtained 1 h 30 minutes (min), 2 h, 2 h 30 min, 3 h 30 min, 4 h 30 min, and 6 h post dose. In calculating PK parameters, predose concentrations and concentrations prior to first quantifiable concentration below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) were treated as &quot;missing&quot; for the calculation of summary statistics. Drug was quantitatively determined in serum by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Individual PK parameter values were derived by non-compartmental methods using a validated PK analysis program (Kinetica™ 4.4.1 within eToolbox [version 2.6.1]).</description>

    <measure>Best Overall Tumor Response Per Investigator Based on Modified World Health Organization (mWHO) Criteria - All Randomized Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to last patient, last visit, approximately 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Response (OR) was determined as the combination of assessments of index and non-index lesions using mWHO criteria which were: Complete Response=complete disappearance of all lesions; Partial Response=decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions, in the absence of Complete Response; Stable Disease=does not meet criteria for complete or partial response, in the absence of progressive disease, or a decrease or tumor stabilization of one or more non-index lesions; Progressive Disease (Progression)=at least 25% increase in the sum of the products of all index lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum recorded at or following baseline) and/or the appearance of any new lesion(s), or progression of non-index lesion(s). OR was measured across the entire study from Day 1 to the last patient, last visit (2009 to 2012)</description>

    <description>ir RC=modifications of mWHO criteria reflecting clinical experience with ipilimumab in over 20 completed and/or ongoing clinical studies. irRC were designed to capture clinical activity of ipilimumab immunotherapy that may not be adequately addressed by the mWHO criteria. irComplete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all index and non-index lesions. irPartial Response (irPR): Decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all index and all new measurable lesions in the absence of irCR, non-index lesions not considered. irStable Disease (irSD): Does not meet criteria for irCR or irPR, in the absence of progressive disease (irPD). irProgressive Disease (irPD): At least 25% increase in Tumor Burden when compared to sum of the products of diameters of lesions at nadir.</description>

    <measure>Median Overall Survival Following First Ipilimumab Dose - All Treated Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 (first dose) to last patient, last visit, approximately 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time between the first dose of study treatment and death and was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods, with participants who had not died censored at the last date known to be alive. Overall survival was measured in months.</description>

    <measure>Model Estimates of Mean Absolute Lymphocyte Count at Each Nominal Ipilimumab Induction Dose and at End of the Induction Dosing Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (prior to first dose) to Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) were obtained throughout the study as part of the hematology panel. Results collected from 28 days prior to the first infusion of ipilimumab through the end of the Induction-Dosing Period were included in the analyses of ALC. Mean ALC was estimated via an extended linear model, with linear splines and a spatial exponential within-patient correlation structure. Lymphocytes were measured as 1000 cells per micro liter (c/µL).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Deaths, and AEs Leading to Discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to last patient, last visit, approximately 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs) were graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events version 3.0. Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 15.1 was used. Note there is a difference in number of participants with an SAE in this outcome measure and the number listed in the Adverse Events Section of this document. This is because the SAEs reported in the xml upload of the Adverse Events section includes additional participants who reported SAEs after the clinical study report database was closed.</description>

    <time_frame>Prior to start of drug Week 1 to Week 24 on treatment or end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Electrochemiluminescent (ECL) Immunoassay was used to detect human anti-human ipilimumab antibodies (HAHA) in serum. Blood samples were collected prior to the start of each ipilimumab infusion at Weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 24, and at end of treatment. Those participants who were positive HAHA on treatment were then tested for presence of neutralizing antibodies.</description>

        <title>Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Ipilimumab Manufactured by Process C Relative to the Cmax of Ipilimumab Manufactured by Process B - Evaluable Pharmacokinetic Population</title>
        <description>Single-dose Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of ipilimumab were derived from serum concentration versus time data. Cmax was measured from first dose to end of the induction period (4 doses) as micrograms per milliliter (μg/mL). Samples were obtained at 0 hour (predose) on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, and Weeks 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10; Day 1, samples were also obtained 1 h 30 minutes (min), 2 h, 2 h 30 min, 3 h 30 min, 4 h 30 min, and 6 h post dose. In calculating PK parameters, predose concentrations and concentrations prior to first quantifiable concentration below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) were treated as “missing” for the calculation of summary statistics. Drug was quantitatively determined in serum by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Individual PK parameter values were derived by non-compartmental methods using a validated PK analysis program (Kinetica™ 4.4.1 within eToolbox [version 2.6.1]).</description>

        <description>The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of ipilimumab were derived from serum concentration versus time data.

          <description>ir RC=modifications of mWHO criteria reflecting clinical experience with ipilimumab in over 20 completed and/or ongoing clinical studies. irRC were designed to capture clinical activity of ipilimumab immunotherapy that may not be adequately addressed by the mWHO criteria. irComplete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all index and non-index lesions. irPartial Response (irPR): Decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all index and all new measurable lesions in the absence of irCR, non-index lesions not considered. irStable Disease (irSD): Does not meet criteria for irCR or irPR, in the absence of progressive disease (irPD). irProgressive Disease (irPD): At least 25% increase in Tumor Burden when compared to sum of the products of diameters of lesions at nadir.</description>
          <population>All participants randomized to a treatment arm who received at least 1 dose of ipilimumab as randomized with measurable disease at baseline, at least one baseline assessment and one on-treatment tumor assessment, no resection of index lesions, and for irRC, no resection of new lesions.</population>

        <description>Electrochemiluminescent (ECL) Immunoassay was used to detect human anti-human ipilimumab antibodies (HAHA) in serum. Blood samples were collected prior to the start of each ipilimumab infusion at Weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 24, and at end of treatment. Those participants who were positive HAHA on treatment were then tested for presence of neutralizing antibodies.</description>
