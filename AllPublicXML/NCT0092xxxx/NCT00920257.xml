          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of solid tumor malignancy or
             lymphoma that is not responsive to standard therapies or for which there is no
             approved or curative therapy. Subjects with malignancies related to human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or solid organ transplant are excluded.

          -  Performance Status score of 0 or 1 according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             (ECOG) scale.

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

          -  Fasting serum glucose &lt;126 mg/dL.

          -  Male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential must have had a prior
             vasectomy or agree to use adequate contraception from the time of the first dose of
             GSK2141795 until three months after the last dose of GSK2141795.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-child bearing potential,
             or of child-bearing potential and willing to use adequate birth control

          -  Adequate organ function

          -  (Part 2 only - endometrial) Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of
             relapsed or metastatic endometrial cancer.

          -  (Part 2 only - endometrial) No more than two prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens in
             the relapsed or metastatic setting. Targeted agents like bevacizumab are not
             considered cytotoxic chemotherapy for the purposes of this study

          -  (Part 2 only, breast) Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of locally
             advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

          -  (Part 2 only, breast) No more than three prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens in the
             metastatic setting. Targeted agents like lapatinib, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab are
             not considered cytotoxic chemotherapy for the purposes of this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to the first dose of GSK2141795. Chemotherapy
             regimens given continuously or on a weekly basis with limited potential for delayed
             toxicity are permitted with approval of a GSK Medical Monitor if dosing of that
             chemotherapy is terminated at least 14 days prior to the first dose of GSK2141795.

          -  Any major surgery within the last four weeks of screening.

          -  Unresolved toxicity (except alopecia) greater than or equal to Grade 2 from previous
             anti-cancer therapy unless agreed to by a GSK Medical Monitor and the investigator,
             and where a GSK Medical Monitor and the investigator consider that the ongoing
             toxicity will not introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the
             study procedures.

          -  Previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2).

          -  Current use of oral corticosteroids, with the exception of inhaled or topical

          -  Symptomatic or untreated CNS metastases or leptomeningeal involvement. Subjects who
             were previously treated for these conditions, and are asymptomatic without
             anti-epileptic medications or steroids for at least 2 months are eligible. Subjects
