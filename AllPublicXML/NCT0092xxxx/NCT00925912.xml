    <textblock>
      Hemorrhoidectomy can be carried out under several modes of anesthesia. In western country
      hemorrhoidectomy usually be performed under general anesthesia, however there may be the
      complications resulted from general anesthesia together with associated diseases in advanced
      age, caudal or spinal anesthesia has been used as an alternative to general anesthesia (GA)
      for hemorrhoid surgery but they all require a trained anesthetist and have numerous known
      complications. Since, anesthesiologists are not always available then local anesthesia is an
      alternative mode of anesthesia that surgeon can safely carry out by their own. Local
      anesthetic produce a loss of sensation and muscle paralysis in a circumscribed area of body
      by localized effect on peripheral nerve endings. The local anesthesia is able to provide
      fully relaxation of the anal canal which is an ideal setting for various anal surgical
      procedures. The results of hemorrhoid surgery under this mode of anesthesia have been
      demonstrated in many publications. Local anesthesia is a safe and effective technique while
      fewer risks and complications compared with general or spinal anesthesia. In Thailand both
      spinal anesthesia and local perianal block have routinely been used for various kinds of
      anorectal surgery. However, so far there has no any trial conducting to compare between these
      two techniques.

      Objectives: To study analgesic efficacy, postoperative voiding problems, patients'
      satisfaction, and other complications after closed hemorrhoidectomy comparison between local
      perianal block and spinal anesthesia.

      Research design: Randomized controlled trial Setting: Phramongkutklao Hospital Research
      methodology: A total of 64 subjects (32 males and 32 females) underwent elective
      hemorrhoidectomy were randomly allocated into two groups. Thirty-two patients were randomly
      allocated to receive spinal anesthesia (SA group) while 32 patients received local perianal
      block (LA group). Duration of analgesic effect, pain measurement with visual analogue scale
      (VAS) at 6 and 24 hours, quantity of analgesic medication administered, postoperative
      complication, and patient's satisfaction with the anesthetic technique were recorded.
