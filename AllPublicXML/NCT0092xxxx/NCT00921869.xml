  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of E7050 when
      administered orally twice daily to patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      E7050 given orally, twice-daily, in patients with advanced tumors that have progressed
      following effective therapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Subjects with a histological or cytological diagnosis of solid tumors or gastric
             cancer.

          2. Subjects who have progressed after treatment with approved therapies or for whom there
             are no standard effective therapies available.

          3. Subjects with adequate organ function.

          4. Patients who have no carryover of effect from prior therapy or no adverse drug
             reactions (excluding alopecia) that may affect the safety evaluation of the
             investigational drug.

          5. Subjects with Performance Status (PS) 0-1 established by Eastern Cooperative Oncology
             Group (ECOG).

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Subjects who have brain metastases with clinical symptoms or which requires treatment.

          2. Subjects with the serious complications or disease history.

          3. Subjects who cannot take oral medication.

          4. Subjects who need continuous use of drugs or foods that strongly inhibit or induce
             CYP3A4/5 or CYP2D6 during the study period.

          5. Female subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding.
