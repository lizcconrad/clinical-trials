  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Pediatric solid tumors (Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and neuroblastoma) are often
           difficult to cure with standard treatment.

        -  Immune therapy using an experimental vaccine made from proteins from the patient's tumor
           cells may boost the body's immune response against the tumor.

        -  The effects of chemotherapy on the immune system can potentially make immunotherapy more
           effective if administered soon after completion of chemotherapy. The addition of
           recombinant human IL-7 (interleukin 7) (rhIL-7 (recombinant human interleukin 7)) may
           make the immunotherapy more effective.

      Objectives:

      -To determine whether immune therapy given after immune suppression can help the body fight
      the tumor and to determine the safety of the treatment.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients with solid tumors, i.e., Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma or neuroblastoma whose
      disease has recurred after treatment or spread beyond the original site

      Design:

        -  Patients undergo tumor biopsy (removal of a piece of tumor tissue) to collect tumor
           cells for making a vaccine from proteins in the patient's tumor and apheresis (removal
           of a quantity of white blood cells) to collect white cells for re-building the immune
           system after immune therapy. Apheresis is repeated three times during immunotherapy
           (weeks 8, 14 and 20).

        -  After receiving standard chemotherapy for their tumor (and an additional course of
           fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to further suppress immunity if needed) patients
           receive immune therapy in Cohorts A and B. rhIL-7 is given 48 hours before the vaccine,
           as an injection under the skin in an extremity that will not be used for the vaccine in
           patients in Cohort B only. You will be watched closely for 6 hours after the rhIL-7 for
           any signs of reaction. rhIL-7 will be given before vaccine doses #1, #2, #3, and #4. The
           vaccine is given at study weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. Each vaccine is given as a total
           of six separate rhIL-7 followed by injections: three intradermal (like a (tuberculosis)
           TB test) on one arm or leg and three subcutaneous (like those for insulin injections for
           diabetes). on the other arm or leg. An anesthetic cream may be used to minimize the
           discomfort of injections.

        -  Patients' white cells are returned to them by infusion through a vein on the first day
           of immune therapy.

        -  Imaging studies and immune studies are done at weeks 1, 8 and 20 to determine the
           response to treatment on the tumor and on the immune system.

      Background:

        -  Patients with recurrent or metastatic pediatric solid tumors experience low survival
           rates, but using current standard therapies, many patients with these diseases are
           rendered into a state of minimal residual disease associated with lymphopenia.

        -  Lymphopenic hosts show augmented immune reactivity, which may be favorable for inducing
           antitumor immune responses.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether Alpha cluster of differentiation 25 (CD25) and 8H9 depleted
           autologous lymphocytes plus tumor lysate/keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) pulsed
           dendritic cell vaccines plus or minus r-hIL7 (CYT107) can induce immune responses to
           tumor lysate in this patient population rendered lymphopenic by cytotoxic therapy.

        -  To assess the safety of administering lymphocytes depleted of cluster of differentiation
           4 (CD4) plus CD25plus suppressor T cells plus or minus r-hIL (CYT107 (interleukin 7)) to
           lymphopenic hosts.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with metastatic or recurrent pediatric solid tumors of the following
           histologies: Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma or neuroblastoma,
           synovial cell sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, undifferentiated sarcoma,
           embryonal sarcoma.

        -  Patients must have sufficient accessible tumor for biopsy to generate tumor lysate.

        -  Patients must meet eligibility criteria upon enrollment and upon completion of standard
           therapy prior to administration of immunotherapy as significant time will have elapsed
           between the time points.

      Design:

        -  Immunotherapy consists of one autologous lymphocyte infusion depleted of CD25plus
           suppressive T cells and depleted of contaminating tumor cells plus 6 sequential tumor
           lysate/KLH pulsed dendritic cell vaccines. No cytokine is administered on Arm A and
           r-hIL7 (CYT107) is administered on Arm B.

        -  Patients will be evaluated for immune responses to tumor lysates using ex vivo assays
           and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH).

        -  The trial uses a one-stage design targeting a response rate of 50 percent. Up to 47
           patients will be treated.

        -  Stopping rules will take effect if excessive toxicity is observed.

                  free interval &gt; one year from completion of cytotoxic therapy

               -  Patients &lt; 5yo must have recovered CD4 count to &gt; 350 cells/mm^3 OR have disease
                  free interval &gt; six months from completion of cytotoxic therapy

          -  Multiple recurrences are allowable as long as CD4 count or disease-free intervals have
             been met.

        C. Age/Weight

          -  greater than 18 mos. and less than or equal to 35 years at the time of initial
             diagnosis.

          -  greater than 10 kg at the time of apheresis. Patients between 10-15 kg must be
             approved by the apheresis unit prior to enrollment on protocol.

        D. Informed Consent

        All patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is less than 18 years old) must sign
        a document of informed consent (screening protocol) prior to performing studies to
        determine patient eligibility. After confirmation of patient eligibility all patients or
        their legal guardians must sign the protocol specific informed consent to document their
        understanding of the investigational nature and the risks of this study before any protocol
        related studies are performed (other than the studies which were performed to determine
        patient eligibility).

        E. Laboratory Parameters

          -  renal function: creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min/1.73m^2 or normal age
             adjusted serum creatinine (less than or equal to 5 yrs. less than or equal to 0.8
             mg/ml; 5-10 yrs. less than or equal to 1.0 mg/ml; 10-15 yrs. less than or equal to 1.2
             mg/ml; greater than 15 yrs. less than or equal to 1.5 mg/ml)

          -  liver function: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
             less than 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin less than 1.5 ULN

          -  hematologic function: platelets greater than 50,000 cells/mcl, hemoglobin (Hgb)
             greater than 9.0 gms/dl, prothrombin time (PT) less than 1.5 ULN. Patients may receive
             transfusion if necessary to reach the pre-apheresis hematology parameters.

        F. Accessibility of Tissue to Generate Tumor Lysates

        Patients must have adequate tumor bulk accessible to biopsy in order to generate the tumor
        lysate (at least 2 cm diameter). Procedures employed to acquire biopsies for tumor lysates
        will be limited to percutaneous biopsies or open biopsies of readily accessible lesions.
        Patients should not undergo biopsies, which will later compromise the ability to render
        function preserving local therapy (e.g. limb salvage therapy). To prevent this, all bone
        biopsies should be performed in consultation with the orthopedic consultant on the case.
        For patients with bone marrow involvement, bone marrow aspirates may be used as a source of
        tumor for tumor lysates. Patients are not eligible if, in the opinion of the principal and
        associate investigators, tumor biopsy would entail extensive surgery such as thoracotomy or
        laparotomy, or if the tumor site places the patient at substantial risk from the biopsy
        procedure.

        National Cancer Institute (NCI) Laboratory of Pathology will review all tumor specimens for
        diagnosis.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: for Apheresis/Tumor biopsy portion of the trial:

        A. Other conditions

          -  Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness, such as serious infections,
             autoimmunity or organ dysfunction, which in the judgment of the Principal or Associate
             Investigators would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate the investigational
             agents or are likely to interfere with the study procedures or results.

          -  Previous allogeneic stem cell or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

          -  Conditions related to tumor, which require emergency treatment (airway compression,
             spinal cord compression) since enrollment would delay initiation of such therapy.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Corticosteroids initiated at the time of tumor diagnosis or recurrence for treatment
             of nerve compression or other symptoms is permitted during this phase of the trial,
             but will not be permitted during the immunotherapy phase, with the exception of a self
             limited course of steroids as described in Section 2.1.4.A.

          -  Patients with a history of central nervous system (CNS) metastases from cancer are not
             excluded provided that the metastatic CNS disease has been effectively treated and
             there is no evidence of active CNS disease as evidenced by stable clinical findings
             and stable radiographic findings for a period of 6 weeks.

          -  Patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C due
             to confounding effects on immune system.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA: for Immunotherapy portion of the trial:

        A. Informed Consent

        Because significant time will have elapsed between apheresis/tumor biopsy and the
        initiation of immunotherapy, all patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is less
        than 18 years old) must sign a second informed consent to document their understanding of
        the investigational nature and the risks of this study before any protocol related studies
        are performed (other than the studies which were performed to determine patient
        eligibility).

        B. Time and Recovery from Cytotoxic Therapy

        At least 3 weeks should have elapsed since the last cycle of cytotoxic therapy or since the
        last dose of radiation therapy, at least 4 weeks must have elapsed since the patient has
        received any investigational therapy, and patients should have recovered from toxic side
        effects of previous therapy to a grade 1 or less, with the exception of the following:

          -  Hematological toxicity: recovery to levels required in Section 2.1.1.E.

          -  Low electrolyte levels (Such individuals should receive appropriate supplementation).

          -  For patients on anticoagulant therapy or with pre-existing coagulation abnormalities,
             prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) must return to baseline.

          -  Liver function tests must resolve to values required in Section 2.1.1.E.

          -  Sterility.

        C. Laboratory Parameters

          -  renal function: creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min/1.73m^2 or normal age
             adjusted serum creatinine (less than or equal to 5 yrs. less than or equal to 0.8
             mg/ml; 5-10 yrs. less than or equal to 1.0 mg/ml; 10-15 yrs. less than or equal to 1.2
             mg/ml; greater than 15 yrs. less than or equal to 1.5 mg/ml).

          -  liver function: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
             less than 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin less than 1.5 ULN.

          -  hematologic function: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 750 cells/mcl,
             platelets greater than 50,000 cells/mcl.

        D. Birth Control

        Subjects of childbearing or child-fathering potential must be willing to use a medically
        acceptable form of birth control, which includes abstinence, while they are being treated
        on this study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: for Immunotherapy Portion of the Trial:

        A. Other conditions

          -  Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness, such as serious infections or organ
             dysfunction, which in the judgment of the Principal or Associate Investigators would
             compromise the patient's ability to tolerate the investigational agents or are likely
             to interfere with the study procedures or results.

          -  Persistent or progressive cancer following the completion of the standard therapy
             phase of the trial will not, in and of itself, preclude receipt of immunotherapy.
             However, patients will not receive immunotherapy if they have an Eastern Cooperative
             Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status performance status of 3 or 4 or, for children
             less than or equal to 10 years of age, Lansky less than or equal to 50 (Appendix III).
             Furthermore, patients will be removed from the trial if they develop requirements for
             anti-neoplastic therapy (e.g. radiation therapy) for progressive disease during the
             trial as discussed in protocol.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C
             infection due to confounding effects on immune function.

          -  Patients who require chronic daily oral corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive
             therapy. Topical or inhaled corticosteroids are permitted. Also, a time limited course
             of steroids does for an unrelated medical condition (e.g. allergic reaction, poison
             ivy) will not preclude receipt of immunotherapy provided that two weeks elapse between
             the last dose of systemic corticosteroids and initiation of immunotherapy.

          -  Patients who are receiving other biologic therapies including cytokines or growth
             factors not specified by the protocol. Herbal supplements will not result in exclusion
             but should be noted and reviewed with the principal investigator (PI).

          -  Patients with a history of CNS metastases from cancer are not excluded provided that

               -  Patients with history of autoimmune disease (excluding thyroiditis on chronic
                  thyroid replacement therapy) or active auto-immune disease, due to a risk of
                  exacerbation of autoimmunity with r-hIL7. Patients with a history of B cell
                  malignancy due to a risk for growth with rhIL7 therapy.

               -  Corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation defined as a QTc greater than or equal
                  to 470 ms or a prior history of cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, or
                  significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities.
