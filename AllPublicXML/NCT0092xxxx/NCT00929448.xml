  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of pneumonia and other infections is one of the most common complications of
      a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Prior studies have also found that patients suffering from
      TBI also develop immune dysfunction consistent with an immunosuppressed state shortly after
      the traumatic event. Specifically, it has been shown that patients with a TBI have impaired
      delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH), cellular immunity and humoral immunity. The humoral arm
      of the immune system is particularly involved in defending the host against extracellular
      bacteria and is primarily composed of B-cells, immunoglobulins and complement. Surgery and
      trauma impair the clonal expansion of antibody producing B lymphocytes causing
      hypogammaglobulinemia, through a mechanism involving T lymphocytes. In addition, during the
      systemic inflammatory process, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 (IL-1beta) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are released. Nuclear factor
      kappa beta (NF-kB) is a transcriptional regulatory protein that is involved in the expression
      of proinflammatory cytokines and appears to act at a critical step in the transcription of
      many proinflammatory genes.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the hypogammaglobulinemia from the immune dysfunction
      and the induction of NF-kB from the inflammatory process are, in part, responsible for the
      development of pneumonia and other infectious complications identified after TBI. This study
      has two specific aims: The primary specific aim of this study is to determine the association
      between serum immunoglobulin or NF-kB levels and the development of pneumonia in patients
      suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI). The secondary specific aim of this study is to
      determine the relative contribution of clinical variables such as APACHE II-III Score and
      Injury Severity Score as compared to immunological variables (serum immunoglobulins and
      NF-kB) to the development of pneumonia in patients suffering from TBI.
