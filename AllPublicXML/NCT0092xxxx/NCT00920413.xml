  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with kidney failure are at risk for the development of anemia. Anemia is a decrease in
      the production of hemoglobin, a substance that carries oxygen in the blood. The majority of
      patients require erythropoietin and iron supplementation to correct the anemia. In some
      patients, the hemoglobin fails to rise to a desired level despite treatment with
      erythropoietin and iron. There have been several studies in hemodialysis patients showing
      that vitamin C given intravenously helps to correct anemia in patients already on
      erythropoietin and iron.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether oral vitamin C will improve parameters of
      anemia in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis.

      Description of the research

      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Participants will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to oral vitamin C 500mg once a day or placebo for 3 months. All participants
      will be receiving oral iron supplementation, subcutaneous erythropoietin and a B and C
      complex vitamin containing 100mg of vitamin C. Lab parameters (hemoglobin, TSAT, ferritin)
      will be done at baseline and then monthly. The primary outcome is percent change from
      baseline in transferrin saturation. Secondary objectives are percent change in ferritin,
      hemoglobin and erythropoietin dose from baseline.

      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Vitamin C 500mg orally once daily or matching
      placebo for 3 months. Randomization codes will be kept by the Research Pharmacy and
      investigators and patients will be blinded to treatment. Patients currently taking vitamin C
      supplements (excluding the 100mg of vitamin C contained in a B and C complex vitamin, a
      supplement used by all peritoneal dialysis patients), will be taken off the vitamin C and
      then randomized to one of the treatment arms after a 1 month washout period. At the end of 3
      months, the effects of vitamin C on the change in transferrin saturation from baseline will
      be evaluated to identify which patients, if any, benefited from treatment. Hemoglobin, serum
      iron, total iron binding capacity, ferritin, transferrin saturation and erythropoietin dose
      will also be assessed. The dose and formulation of recombinant erythropoietin and oral iron
      will be adjusted during the study period according to standard practice algorithms currently
      used in the clinic. The addition of vitamin C does not pose any risk to the patients and will
      be dispensed to the patient by the Research Pharmacy at St. Michael's Hospital free of
      charge.
