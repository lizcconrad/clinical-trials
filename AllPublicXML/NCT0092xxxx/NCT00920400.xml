  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fecal calprotectin is a very sensitive non-invasive inflammation marker in the detection of
      inflammatory bowel disease and, to a lesser degree, has also proven to be useful in
      adenomatous polyps, neoplasias, and infectious gastroenteritis. Elevated calprotectin levels
      can also be found in patients with lesion only in the upper gastrointestinal tract. However,
      the diagnostic value of calprotectin has never been tested in this setting. The aim of the
      study is therefore to determine the diagnostic value of fecal calprotectin in patients with
      diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract.
