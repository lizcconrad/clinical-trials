    <textblock>
      To address whether custom made foot insoles could be used for primary prevention of lower
      limb overuse injuries, the investigators conducted a prospective, randomized controlled study
      comparing the use of insoles and standard shoes in healthy young adults exposed to increased
      physical activity.

    <description>The custom made insoles (Thermo+Camel, cost for the military 20,50 euros) were fabricated from firm-density polyethylene and the hard plastic shell was a three-quarter length. The insole was strong enough to fill the arch area thus providing support to the mid foot. It also influences the position of the foot. The insoles were individually customized by heating the polyethylene in form of individual foot with standing and walking in them. The conscripts were advised to use these insoles in their ankle boot.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  healthy conscripts without any diagnosed deformities of lower limb by physician in
             premilitary physical examination

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  major orthopaedic or medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, inflammatory arthritis,
             previous severe trauma (exclusion criteria for the military service)

          -  patients were excluded from our study if they already had insoles prescribed by a
             physician or a physiotherapist (eight patients)

          -  since only 2% of Finnish conscripts are females, they were excluded from the study
