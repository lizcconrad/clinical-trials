    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomised trial studying patients with stage 3 to 5 chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) in order to determine the impact of specialised care by nephrologists compared
      to guidelines-directed management by primary care physicians (PCP) on: a) prognosis (clinical
      outcome), b) planning of renal replacement therapy (RRT) (urgent versus planned initiation
      RRT) and c) patient satisfaction.
