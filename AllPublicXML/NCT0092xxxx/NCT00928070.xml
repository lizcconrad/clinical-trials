          <population>FAS population included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 baseline or post-baseline efficacy assessment. Here, 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who had baseline UUI episodes greater than 0 per 24 hours and non-missing change from baseline value at Week 4.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Frequency-Urgency Sum Rating Per 24 Hours at Week 4 and 12</title>
          <description>Frequency-urgency sum is total USS ratings recorded for all micturitions in 24-hour day. Number of USS ratings per 24 hours is sum of all USS ratings divided by the total diary days collected at that visit. USS scale: 1=No feeling of urgency to 5=Unable to hold: leak urine. Numerical decrease indicates improvement.</description>
          <population>FAS population. LOCF method was used to impute only Week 12 missing data but not Week 4 missing data. Here, 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who had baseline frequency urgency sum rating greater than 0 per 24 hours and non-missing change from baseline value at Week 12.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Change From Screening in Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) at Week 4 and 12</title>
        <description>PPBC: a self-administered, single-item, questionnaire that asks participants to describe their perception of their bladder-related problems. The PPBC assessment is rated on a 6-point scale: 1=no problems at all, 2=some very minor problems, 3=some minor problems, 4=moderate problems, 5=severe problems, 6=many severe problems. Deterioration=score difference is greater than 0; no change=score difference is 0; minor improvement=score difference is -1; major difference=score difference is less than or equal to -2.</description>

        <description>OAB-q: self-administered, 33-item, questionnaire, assesses how much participant has been bothered by selected bladder symptoms. Each item rated on Likert scale 1 (least symptom bother) to 6 (most symptom bother). Questions 9 to 33 constitute HRQL, includes domains: concern, coping, sleep, and social function. HRQL domain and total raw score derived as sum of scores. Transformed score range 0 to 100 (Total HRQL or domain) = [(Highest possible raw score-Actual total raw score)/Raw score range]*100. Higher transformed scores indicative of better HRQL.</description>

        <description>OAB-S: a validated self-administered instrument that evaluates OAB medication expectations, daily life with AB, and satisfaction with OAB medication and includes 3 stand-alone items that assess overall expectation, satisfaction, and willingness to continue treatment. Satisfaction coded on scale of 1 to 5: (1=very satisfied to 5=very dissatisfied). Coding reversed algorithmically and results transformed: total score range 0 to100. Higher final response value associated with better satisfaction.</description>

          <description>Participant's response to question, &quot;overall, how satisfied are you with your OAB medication?&quot; was obtained on a 5 point scale, 1- very satisfied, 2- somewhat satisfied, 3- neither dissatisfied nor satisfied, 4- somewhat dissatisfied and 5- very dissatisfied. Response values 1 and 2 were combined into &quot;satisfied&quot;, and 4 and 5 were combined into &quot;dissatisfied&quot;.</description>
