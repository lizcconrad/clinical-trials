    <textblock>
      A randomized, crossover, open study in order to compare treatment satisfaction with insulin
      Glargine plus insulin Apidra Vs NPH insulin plus insulin Apidra in newly diagnosed children
      and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

      The study will include two consecutive periods: 2 weeks run in period and 24 weeks
      intervention period, divided into two separate treatment periods of 12 weeks. According to
      randomization, each patient will be treated consecutively with both treatment arms: 12 weeks
      with insulin Glargine and than 12 weeks with NPH insulin or 12 weeks with insulin NPH ad than
      12 weeks with insulin Glargine. Patients will complete DTSQ (Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction
      Questionnaire) at months 0, 12 and 24 weeks, before and at the end of each study arm.

      A randomized, crossover, open study in order to compare treatment satisfaction with insulin
      Glargine plus insulin Apidra Vs NPH insulin plus insulin Apidra in newly diagnosed children
      and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

      134 Patients with new onset Diabetes type 1, diagnosed 12 months previously at maximum will
      be enrolled.

      The study will include two consecutive periods: 2 weeks run in period and 24 weeks
      intervention period, divided into two separate treatment periods of 12 weeks. According to
      randomization, each patient will be treated consecutively with both treatment arms: 12 weeks
      with insulin Glargine and than 12 weeks with NPH insulin or 12 weeks with NPH insulin and
      than 12 weeks with insulin Glargine.

      The study will consist of 4 clinical visits, taking place at -2, 0, 12 and 24 weeks.
      Height,weight,vital signs, HbA1c and insulin doses will be determined during the clinical
      visits.

      Patients will complete DTSQ (Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire) at months 0, 12
      and 24 weeks, before and at the end of each study arm.

      The DTSQ questionnaires consists of DTSQ parents- for patients below the age of 13, and DTSQ
      teen for those above age 13.
