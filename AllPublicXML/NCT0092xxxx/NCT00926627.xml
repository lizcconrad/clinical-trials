  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progressive pulmonary sarcoidosis occurs in up to twenty percent of patients who require
      persistent treatment, but available treatment options have shown considerable long-term
      toxicity and uncertain or unproven efficacy. In these patients, pulmonary fibrosis and
      pulmonary hypertension are common complications which have major prognostic impact.
      Endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been demonstrated to play a key role in pulmonary fibrosis and
      pulmonary hypertension, and a potential role in pulmonary sarcoidosis. ET-1 is a potent
      vasoconstrictor and can promote fibrosis, cell proliferation, and remodeling, and is
      pro-inflammatory. Preliminary data have shown the therapeutic potential of the endothelin
      receptor antagonist (ERA) bosentan in sarcoidosis associated pulmonary hypertension.

      In this light, the therapeutic potential of bosentan as an add-on treatment in progressive
      pulmonary sarcoidosis needs to be evaluated.
