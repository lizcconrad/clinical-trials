      This study will evaluate whether morning-only dosing of MoviPrep® (2L) for afternoon
      colonoscopy is as effective as a standard dosing regimen of half of the volume of MoviPrep®
      (1L) solution the evening prior, and half (1L) the morning of, colonoscopy. MoviPrep® is a
      low volume (2 liters) polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based purgative that is approved for
      evening-only or split (evening and morning) dosing to cleanse the colon prior to colonoscopy.
      Patients undergoing afternoon colonoscopies often have inferior colon cleansing. There is
      evidence that morning-only purgative administration of large volume PEG (4L) is safe and
      effective. This study will assess whether administration of a low volume PEG regimen will
      maintain efficacy and improve tolerance by changing a 2-day preparation procedure into a
      regimen that is completed in 1 day.

      primary objectives

      • To compare the efficacy of morning dose only MoviPrep® (&quot;AM Dosing&quot;) where one-half of the
      prep is given 7 hours before colonoscopy and the second half is given 4 hours before
      colonoscopy, versus split dose (PM/AM) MoviPrep® (&quot;PM/AM Dosing&quot;) where one-half of the prep
      is given at 6pm the night prior to colonoscopy and the second half is given 4 hours before
      colonoscopy.

      Efficacy will be assessed based on cleansing of the entire colon, with successful cleansing
      defined as a score of excellent or good and unsuccessful cleansing defined as a score of fair
      or poor.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To assess the tolerability of AM Dosing MoviPrep® versus PM/AM Dosing MoviPrep® based on
           percentage of prep completed, sleep quality/quantity, future prep choice (same prep or
           alternative prep described), and incidence and severity (using 11-point Likert scale) of
           any adverse events (i.e. nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, light-headedness).

        -  To evaluate the safety of each dosing administration based on vitals with orthostatic
           measures (BP, pulse) on day of colonoscopy.

        -  To evaluate the effect of colon prep on work and productivity as measured by the degree
           of interference with work/productivity the day prior to colonoscopy.

        -  To assess difference between two dosing arms with respect to analysis of right colon
           cleansing, and overall adenoma detection in terms of number, size, location, histology,
           and morphology.

        -  To determine the effect of purgative dosing on procedure efficiency by measuring (a)
           total procedure time, (b) time from anus to cecum, and (c) withdrawal time (excluding
           time taken for interventions).

        -  To evaluate the effect of purgative dosing regimen on amount of flushing required during
           the procedure (0 = none, 1 = &lt;50 ml, 2 = 50-100 ml, 3 = &gt;100 ml).

        -  To validate a new grading scale for colon cleansing using the de-identified recordings
           of colonoscopies performed during this study.
