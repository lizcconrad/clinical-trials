  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy Induced Thrombocytopenia is a common side-effect of bone marrow suppression as a
      result of a chemotherapy treatment. AS101 is a tellurium based small compound with
      immunomodulating characteristics which attributed to the direct inhibition of the
      anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. AS101 was previously shown to induce a significant
      reduction in thrombocytopenia that accompany cancer therapy with no major toxicity . This
      phase II randomized open study will evaluate the efficacy of AS101 for the treatment of
      chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia in patients with various solid tumors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18

          -  Appropriate histology of solid tumors.

          -  Platelet counts &lt; 70,000/μl.

          -  Performance Status (PS) of 0-2

          -  Adequate renal function: Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL

          -  Adequate liver function: Serum (total) bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN. AST, ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN in
             patients without liver metastases, ≤ 5 x ULN in patients with liver metastases.
             Albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL (Only for patients who will receive AS101).

          -  INR ≤ 1.5 and PTT ≤ 1.5 x ULN (Only for patients who will receive AS101).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients unable to provide fully informed consent.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding.

          -  The patient is participating in another trial of an investigational drug or has done
             so within 28 days prior to the pre-treatment visit.

          -  The patient has congestive heart failure-New York Heart Association (CHF-NYHA) grade
             II or higher, and/or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months, or any cardiac
             disorder which in the opinion of the Investigator would put the patient at risk.

          -  The patient has a history of chronic alcohol or drug abuse within the last 5 years.

          -  The patient has any other clinically significant medical condition, psychiatric
             condition or laboratory abnormality which would, in the judgment of the Investigator,
             interfere with the patient's ability to participate in the trial.
