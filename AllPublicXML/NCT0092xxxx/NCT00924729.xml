      This study is being conducted to evaluate the intraocular penetration of Moxifloxacin 0.5%
      ophthalmic solution (Vigamox) and Besifloxacin 0.6% ophthalmic suspension (Besivance) after
      pre-operative topical administration in subjects undergoing cataract surgery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Aqueous Humor Concentration of Study Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 3 to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were randomly assigned to receive one drop of either moxifloxacin or besifloxacin every 10 minutes for a total of 4 doses, with the last dose given 30 minutes prior to the time of the cataract incision. The aqueous humor was corrected through the paracentesis site. The specimen was transferred immediately to a polypropylene tube and stored upright at ≤ 20° C. Moxifloxacin and besifloxacin concentrations in the aqueous humor were determined using a validated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry method.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disk Diffusion Assay of Collected Aqueous Humor</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 3-4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>A disk diffusion assay was performed to determine the relative antimicrobial activity of the study drug in the aqueous humor. The reference organism used was a clinical isolate of S. epidermidis that will be grown and adjusted to a 0.5 MacFarland turbidity standard. The standardized suspension was inoculated onto a Mueller-Hinton II agar. A sample of the aqueous humor was applied to 6 mm sterile disks, dried, and then placed onto the inoculated Mueller-Hinton II agar plates. The plates were incubated for 24 hours at 35° C. The zone sizes were then recorded.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have a visually significant cataract and are planning to have cataract
             surgery.

          -  Subjects who are willing/able and have signed informed consent approved by the
             Institutional Review Board.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have a known hypersensitivity, allergy, or contraindication to any
             fluoroquinolone medication, in any form.

          -  Subjects who signs of ocular infection or active inflammation in the study eye.

             severe dry eye syndrome.

          -  Subjects who have used any disallowed medication (including antibiotics) during the
             time period designated as described in the protocol.

          -  Subjects who have any active or chronic/recurrent ocular or systemic disease that is
             uncontrolled and is likely to increase the risk of infection to the patient or
             confound the results of the study.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant (or suspect to be pregnant) or nursing/lactating.

          <description>Patients were randomly assigned to receive one drop of either moxifloxacin or besifloxacin every 10 minutes for a total of 4 doses, with the last dose given 30 minutes prior to the time of the cataract incision. The aqueous humor was corrected through the paracentesis site. The specimen was transferred immediately to a polypropylene tube and stored upright at ≤ 20° C. Moxifloxacin and besifloxacin concentrations in the aqueous humor were determined using a validated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry method.</description>

        <title>Disk Diffusion Assay of Collected Aqueous Humor</title>
        <description>A disk diffusion assay was performed to determine the relative antimicrobial activity of the study drug in the aqueous humor. The reference organism used was a clinical isolate of S. epidermidis that will be grown and adjusted to a 0.5 MacFarland turbidity standard. The standardized suspension was inoculated onto a Mueller-Hinton II agar. A sample of the aqueous humor was applied to 6 mm sterile disks, dried, and then placed onto the inoculated Mueller-Hinton II agar plates. The plates were incubated for 24 hours at 35° C. The zone sizes were then recorded.</description>
