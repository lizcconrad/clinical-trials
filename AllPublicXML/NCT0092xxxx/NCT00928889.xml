    <measure>Change From Baseline in Postprandial Glucose Excursion (PPGE) at the End of the Study (Week 4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of the study (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected for measurement of plasma glucose at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes following the start of a standardized meal test at Baseline and Week 4. PPGE was defined as the mean difference between the preprandial glucose value and the postprandial glucose value measured at 2 hours in a standardized meal test. Participants were fasting (no calorie intake for at least 8 hours prior to the meal test) and completed the standardized meal test between 7 and 10 AM.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Peak Postprandial Glucose at the End of the Study (Week 4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of the study (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected for measurement of plasma glucose at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes following the start of a standardized meal test at Baseline and Week 4. The peak postprandial glucose values were used in the calculation of change from Baseline at Week 4. Participants were fasting (no calorie intake for at least 8 hours prior to the meal test) and completed the standardized meal test between 7 and 10 AM.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Postprandial Glucose Area Under the Curve at the End of the Study (Week 4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of the study (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected for measurement of plasma glucose at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes following the start of a standardized meal test at Baseline and Week 4. The postprandial glucose area under the curve was calculated using values from the 4 time points. Participants were fasting (no calorie intake for at least 8 hours prior to the meal test) and completed the standardized meal test between 7 and 10 AM.</description>

Participants were fasting (no calorie intake for at least 8 hours prior to the meal test) and completed the standardized meal test between 7 and 10 AM. Total cholesterol was assessed at each study site using the same method and same reference value.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were collected for measurement of FFA prior to (fasting) and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes following the start of a standardized meal test at Baseline and Week 4. Participants were fasting (no calorie intake for at least 8 hours prior to the meal test) and completed the standardized meal test between 7 and 10 AM. FFA was assayed at a central laboratory.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Postprandial Glucose Excursion (PPGE) at the End of the Study (Week 4)</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for measurement of plasma glucose at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes following the start of a standardized meal test at Baseline and Week 4. PPGE was defined as the mean difference between the preprandial glucose value and the postprandial glucose value measured at 2 hours in a standardized meal test. Participants were fasting (no calorie intake for at least 8 hours prior to the meal test) and completed the standardized meal test between 7 and 10 AM.</description>
