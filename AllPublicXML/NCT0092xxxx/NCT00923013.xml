  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is highly responsive to but not curable by cladribine (CdA). HCL
      responds to rituximab, which is not yet standard therapy for HCL.

      Patients with the CD25-negative variant (HCLv) respond poorly to initial cladribine but do
      respond to rituximab in anecdotal reports.

      Deoxycytidine kinase phosphorylates cladribine to CdATP, which incorporates into DNA, leading
      to DNA strand breaks and inhibition of DNA synthesis. Rituximab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal
      antibody which induces apoptosis and either complement or antibody dependent cytotoxicity
      (ADCC or CDC).

      Patients in complete remission (CR) to cladribine have minimal residual disease (MRD) by
      immunohistochemistry of the bone marrow biopsy (BMBx IHC), a risk for early relapse. Tests
      for HCL MRD in blood or marrow include flow cytometry (FACS) or PCR using consensus primers.
      The most sensitive HCL MRD test is real-time quantitative PCR using sequence-specific primers
      (RQ-PCR).

      In studies with limited follow-up, MRD detected by tests other than RQ-PCR can be eliminated
      by rituximab after cladribine in greater than 90 percent of patients, but MRD rates after
      cladribine alone are unknown. Simultaneous cladribine and rituximab might be superior or
      inferior to delaying rituximab until detection of MRD.

      Only 4 HCL-specific trials are listed on Cancer.gov: a phase II trial of cladribine followed
      4 weeks later by 8 weekly doses of rituximab, and phase I-II trials of recombinant
      immunotoxins targeting CD22 (BL22, HA22) and CD25 (LMB-2).

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      To determine if HCL MRD differs at 6 months after cladribine with or without rituximab
      administered concurrently with cladribine.

      Secondary:

        -  To compare cladribine plus rituximab vs cladribine alone in terms of 1) initial MRD-free
           survival and disease-free survival, and 2) response to delayed rituximab for relapse, to
           determine if early rituximab compromises later response.

        -  To determine if MRD levels and tumor markers (soluble CD25 and CD22) after cladribine
           and/or rituximab correlate with response and clinical endpoints.

        -  To determine, using MRD and tumor marker data, when BMBx can be avoided.

        -  To compare response and MRD after the 1st and 2nd courses of cladribine.

        -  To evaluate the effects of cladribine and rituximab on normal T- and B-cells.

        -  To enhance the study of HCL biology by cloning, sequencing and characterizing monoclonal
           immunoglobulin rearrangements.

      Eligibility:

      HCL with 0-1 prior courses of cladribine and treatment indicated.

      Design:

      Cladribine 0.15 mg/Kg/day times 5 doses each by 2hr i.v. infusion (days 1-5)

      Rituximab 375 mg/m2/week times 8 weeks, randomized half to begin day 1, then repeat for all
      patients with blood-MRD relapse at least 6 months after cladribine. Also may repeat for those
      with blood-MRD relapse at least 6 months after delayed rituximab.

      MRD tests used for the primary objective will be limited to BMBx IHC, blood FACS or blood
      consensus PCR, all CLIA certified. Blood MRD relapse is defined as FACS positivity or low
      blood counts (ANC less than 1500/microl, Plt less than 100,000/microl, or Hgb less than 11).

      Stratification: 68 patients with 0 and 62 with 1 prior course of cladribine.

      Statistics: 80% power to discriminate rates of MRD of 5 vs 25%, or 10 vs 35%

      Non-randomized arm: 20 with HCLv will begin rituximab with cladribine.

      Accrual Ceiling: 152 patients (130 HCL, 2 extra HCL if needed, and 20 HCLv.)

      Patients with the CD25-negative variant (HCLv) respond poorly to initial cladribine but do
      respond to rituximab in anecdotal reports.

      Purine analogs cladribine and pentostatin have similar efficacy for HCL, both inhibiting DNA
      synthesis selectively in HCL cells. Cladribine is effective after just 1 cycle. Rituximab is
      an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody which induces apoptosis and either complement or antibody
      dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC or CDC).

      regardless of blood counts.

        have not been adequately studied. It is recommended that a patient s vaccination record and
        possible requirements be reviewed. Per the investigator s discretion, the patient may have
        any required vaccination/booster administered at least 4 weeks prior to the initiation of
        study treatment. Review of the patient s immunization status for the following vaccinations
        is recommended: tetanus; diphtheria; influenza; pneumococcal polysaccharide; Varicella;
        measles, mumps and rubella (MMR); and hepatitis B. Patients who are considered to be at
        high risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and for whom the investigator has
        determined that immunization is indicated should complete the entire HBV vaccine series at
        least 4 weeks prior to participation in the study.
