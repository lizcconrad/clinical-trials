  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves review and analysis of disease activity in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis who where treated with either conventional DMARDs (Disease Modifying Antirheumatic
      Drugs) or Biologics and have two existing, consecutive radiographs (x-ray images) of hand and
      feet taken as part of routine treatment monitoring within a time interval of 12 to 36 months.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Joint Status Assessed by Radiographic (Roentgen) Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic progression assessed using Ratingen score with range of 0 = normal joint; 1 = one or more erosions, &lt;20% of the joint surface are destroyed; 2 = 21% to 40% of the joint surface are destroyed; 3 = 41% to 60% of joint surface are destroyed; 4 = 61% to 80% of the joint surface are destroyed; 5 = &gt;80% of the joint surface are destroyed. Total possible score based on 38 joints was 0 to 190; higher scores indicated greater joint destruction. Annualized change in Ratingen score calculated as (total change in Ratingen score / time period between radiograph 1 and 2 [months])*12 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Without Radiographic Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>An increase of 4 or more points in the Ratingen score was necessary to detect a difference in radiographic progression. Ratingen score range 0 = normal joint to 5 = &gt;80% of the joint surface are destroyed. Total possible score based on 38 joints was 0 to 190; higher scores indicated greater joint destruction. A decrease of 4 (smallest detectable difference) or more points in total Ratingen score was considered a decrease in erosive damage.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Without Erosions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) up to 48 months</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joints (DAS 28)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 calculated from the number of swollen joints (SJC) and painful joints (PJC) using the 28 joints count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeters per hour [mm/hour]) and patient's global assessment (PGA) of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment with transformed scores ranging 0 to 10; higher scores indicated greater affectation due to disease activity). DAS28 ≤3.2 = low disease activity, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity.</description>

    <description>Rheumatoid Factor measured as a titer and categorized as negative (&lt;1:16 ratio) or positive. A ratio &gt;1:16 indicates a higher level of RF.</description>

        <description>An increase of 4 or more points in the Ratingen score was necessary to detect a difference in radiographic progression. Ratingen score range 0 = normal joint to 5 = &gt;80% of the joint surface are destroyed. Total possible score based on 38 joints was 0 to 190; higher scores indicated greater joint destruction. A decrease of 4 (smallest detectable difference) or more points in total Ratingen score was considered a decrease in erosive damage.</description>
