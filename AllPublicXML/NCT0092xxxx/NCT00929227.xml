  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Noninvasive cardiac stress testing is imperfect. Inconclusive test results generate
           further expensive testing.

        -  In patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, both computed tomography
           (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been shown to provide suitable results
           for detecting the disease. However, both types of scans have limitations in their
           usefulness, and it is not known whether one is preferable in either accuracy or
           cost-effectiveness.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of CT and MRI in subjects with a prior
      inconclusive heart stress test.

      Eligibility:

      - Patients 18 years of age and older who have had an inconclusive heart stress test within
      the past 90 days.

      Design:

        -  A blood test will be obtained prior to both heart tests. This will require less than a
           teaspoon of blood.

        -  A CT scan will be performed, accompanied by beta blocker medications (to slow heart
           rate) or nitroglycerin (to enlarge blood vessels) to improve picture quality, as needed.

        -  An MRI scan will be performed. Scans will be taken before, during, and after the patient
           receives vasodilators (to increase blood flow to the coronary arteries and detect
           blockages in heart blood vessels).

        -  Heart rate and function will be monitored with an electrocardiogram.

      Noninvasive cardiac stress testing is imperfect. Inconclusive test results generate further
      expensive testing. We will do both cardiac computed tomography (CT) and stress cardiac
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients who have an inconclusive noninvasive cardiac
      stress test. We will test whether MRI predicts significant coronary artery disease in a more
      cost effective and accurate manner than CT, or vice versa.
