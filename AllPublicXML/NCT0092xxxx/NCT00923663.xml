  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The activity of monotherapy with Lenalidomide will be evaluated in patients with lymphoma of
      the mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical potential of Lenalidomide to
      induce objective/histologic responses in patients with MALT lymphoma.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety of Lenalidomide in this patient
      population and to evaluate the impact of Lenalidomide on progression free survival.
