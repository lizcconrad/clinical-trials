  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some of the risk factors for bleeding following bronchoscopy is having a malignancy or an
      immunocompromised state. The etiology of this remains uncertain. The investigators suspect
      that individuals with malignancy have abnormalities involving certain factors that influence
      the coagulation pathway.

      The investigators plan to measure these factors prior to and after bronchoscopy.

      This is a prospective observational study looking at some coagulation factors in individuals
      with lung cancer. We are looking at BAL and plasma. We would like to see if there is a
      difference in the levels and if this is the reason behind the higher incidence of hemoptysis
      in patients with lung cancer.
