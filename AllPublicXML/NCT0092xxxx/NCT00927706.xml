  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of an assistive technology
      updating and tune up intervention on users and their caregivers. This intervention includes 4
      components:

        -  an in-residence assessment of the mobility preferences of the older person and his/her
           caregiver

        -  a detailed review of forms of assistance, technological and human, that are currently
           being used

        -  recommendations by an occupational therapist for possible changes in the older person's
           mobility assistive technology or assistance strategy

        -  therapist negotiation of an mobility assistive technology updating and tune-up
           intervention plan with the individual and his or her caregiver. The intervention is
           provided to the immediate treatment following the administration of baseline measures
           and the delayed intervention group six weeks later, after an additional baseline
           measurement. The treatment is six weeks long and the follow-up is 26 weeks.

      Hypothesis 1: For community-dwelling older people, an intervention that increases the
      appropriateness of existing or new assistive technology(AT) for mobility or self-care will
      alter established patterns of human assistance, such that caregiver burden is reduced or
      eliminated.

      Hypothesis 2: At the same time, AT users will report less difficulty in mobility or
      self-care, as well as enhanced subjective well-being, and satisfaction with their modified
      personal assistance strategy.

      Hypothesis 3: Following the AT intervention, caregivers will report reduced physical and/or
      psychological demands and increased satisfaction with their caregiving-related activities
      compared with

        -  the pre-intervention period

        -  caregivers in a delayed intervention control group. Hypothesis 4: Decreased physical
           and/or psychological demands on helpers will be associated with increases in device
           users' satisfaction with their personal assistance strategies.
