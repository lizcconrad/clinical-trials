  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Actinic keratoses on the face are often numerous and widespread. The application of
      Methylaminolevulinate (MAL) on individual lesions followed by the application of a plastic
      film on each lesion is difficult and takes time for subjects with many actinic keratoses. The
      waiting period of 3 hours between MAL cream application and red light exposure is also long
      for patients. The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of photodynamic
      therapy (PDT) with MAL with a shorter cream application time (90 minutes) and when MAL is
      applied on the entire face without the plastic film.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 20 patients with at least 5 non-hypertrophic actinic keratoses (AK) of the face
      were included in this open-label study. All AKs were mapped on a transparent template before
      the first PDT treatment. At Day 0, all patients received methylaminolevulinate (MAL) applied
      on the entire face (except the nose and peri-ocular area of 1-2 cm) without any skin
      preparation. One to two 2 g MAL tubes was used for the entire face. MAL was applied without
      occlusion. After a total of 90 +/- 5 minutes the skin was rinsed and exposed to 37 J/cm² of
      red light from an Aktilite™ device. Patients were seen at Week 4; if all facial AKs did not
      show a complete response to treatment, the MAL-PDT procedure was repeated at Week 4. Patients
      were seen again at Week 12 and 24.

      The primary endpoint was at Week 12. Patients came back at Week 24 for a final safety
      evaluation and to verify the recurrence of AK.

      Efficacy is evaluated by assessing the mean number of facial AK at Week 12 as compared to Day
      0.

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Griffiths photonumeric scale was evaluated by the dermatologist. Patients were placed under natural daylight or fluorescent lighting for grading. A direct comparison was then made between the subjects and photographic standards (provided in reference 1). If an exact match could not be made to a grade then an inter-grade number was used used, for example 1, 3, 5, or 7. Zero (0) is the least amount of photodamage, 8 is the most amount of photodamage.</description>

    <description>This factor represents a visual assessment of the number and depth of coarse wrinkles (i.e. deep lines, furrows, or creases). Coarse wrinkles appear on the forehead, glabella, chin, and nasolabial and periorbital areas, and they tend to be located closer to the eyes and mouth than fine wrinkles.

          <title>Mean Griffiths Photonumeric Scale for Photodamage Score</title>
          <description>Griffiths photonumeric scale was evaluated by the dermatologist. Patients were placed under natural daylight or fluorescent lighting for grading. A direct comparison was then made between the subjects and photographic standards (provided in reference 1). If an exact match could not be made to a grade then an inter-grade number was used used, for example 1, 3, 5, or 7. Zero (0) is the least amount of photodamage, 8 is the most amount of photodamage.</description>

          <description>This factor represents a visual assessment of the number and depth of superficial wrinkles (i.e. shallow indentations or lines). Fine wrinkles typically appear in periorbital and perioral regions and are usually found further from the eyes and mouth than are coarse wrinkles.
