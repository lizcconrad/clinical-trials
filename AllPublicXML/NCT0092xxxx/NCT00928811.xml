  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is undertaken to explore the safety of using Simulect at monthly dose intervals to
      reduce the need of high dose/level CNI's such as Prograf.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of CNI's after kidney transplantation is associated with typical adverse effects such
      as potential contribution to progressive impairment of renal function, hypertension, and
      metabolic abnormalities. The study consists of a run-in phase (1 month),and treatment phase
      (11 months) and safety assessment phase (1 month).
