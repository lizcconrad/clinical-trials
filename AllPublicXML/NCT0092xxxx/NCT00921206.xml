      The objective is to assess the humoral and cellular immune response of the VAX102 vaccine
      delivered IM and SC in a prime-boost regimen at dose levels 1 µg or 2 µg in healthy adults
      against the influenza A virus M2e antigen after each vaccination.

      The primary objective is to assess the humoral and cellular immune response of the VAX102
      vaccine delivered IM and SC in a prime-boost regimen at dose levels 1 µg or 2 µg in healthy
      adults against the influenza A virus M2e antigen after each vaccination. The magnitude and
      quality of the M2e-specific B and T cells will be measured. B cell responses will be
      evaluated on pre-dose Days 0, 28 and post-dose Days 7, 35, 42 and 60. T cell responses will
      be measured on pre-dose Days 0, 28 and post-dose Days 14, 42 and 60. IgG M2e antibody will be
      measured on Days 0, 7, 14, 28, 35. 42 and 60. The secondary objective is to assess the
      safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability of the VAX102 vaccine delivered IM or SC at dose
      levels 1 µg or 2 µg, in a prime-boost dosing regimen, in healthy adults 18-49 years of age,
      inclusive.

          -  Give written informed consent to participate.

          -  Healthy, as determined by medical history, physical examination, vital signs, and
             clinical safety laboratory examinations

          -  Females willing to practice birth control to avoid pregnancy during the study

          -  Comprehension of the study requirements, expressed availability for the required study
             period, and ability to attend scheduled visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or psychiatric illness
             (institution of new medical or surgical treatment, or a significant dose alteration
             for uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity within 3 months) as determined by medical
             history and/or physical exam.

          -  Cancer, or treatment for cancer, within 3 years. Persons with a history of cancer who
             are disease-free without treatment for 3 years or more are eligible

          -  Impaired immune responsiveness (of any cause), including diabetes mellitus.

          -  Documented influenza infection in the 6 months prior to study entry.

          -  Presently receiving or history of receiving any medications or treatments that affects
             the immune system such as allergy shots, immune globulin, interferon,
             immunomodulators, cytotoxic drugs or drugs known to be frequently associated with
             significant major organ toxicity, or systemic corticosteroids (oral or injectable) in
             the past 6 months. Inhaled and topical corticosteroids will be allowed.

          -  Receipt or planned administration of a nonstudy vaccine within 30 days before and
             during the study and through the Day 42 evaluation.

             during the study.

          -  Acute disease within 72 hours prior to vaccinations, defined as the presence of a
             moderate or severe illness (as determined by the investigator through medical history
             and physical examination; for example, those requiring an absence from work) with or
             without fever, or a fever &gt;37.9ºC orally. Study vaccine can be administered to persons
             with a minor illness, such as diarrhea, or mild upper respiratory tract infection with
             or without low-grade febrile illness. Vaccination can be delayed until the subject has
             recovered.
