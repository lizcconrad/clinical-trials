  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Dimethane sulfonate (DMS612) is an investigational drug that is being administered to
           humans for the first time in people with advanced tumors. More information on the
           maximum tolerated dose of DMS612 will help researchers identify whether the drug is
           suitable for use in treating certain kinds of cancer, particularly renal cell carcinoma.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of DMS612 (the highest dose that does not cause
           unacceptable side effects) and evaluate any side effects.

        -  To see if DMS612 has any effect on patients tumors through blood tests and laboratory
           studies.

        -  To learn how the body processes DMS612.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with cancer that has not
           responded well to standard treatments.

      Design:

        -  Pre-treatment evaluation visit to determine eligibility:

        -  Physical examination

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Chest X-ray; electrocardiogram; CAT scan of chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other areas of
           the body if needed

        -  Other possible tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission
           tomography (PET)

        -  Patients will receive one dose of DMS612 by intravenous infusion once a week for 3
           weeks, followed by 1 week without the drug. Doses will be adjusted based on possible
           side effects and cancer response. The disease will be evaluated after three cycles of
           the drug.

        -  Evaluations during the treatment period:

        -  Physical examination and reviews of side effects.

        -  Blood draws to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug, and how it is processed by the
           body.

        -  CAT scan at the end of every two cycles (every 8 weeks).

        -  Other scans and imaging procedures as required by the study doctors.

      Background:

        -  The dimethane sulfonates are a group of agents that were identified as active against
           renal cell carcinoma in the NCI anticancer drug screen.

        -  In vitro studies showed that dimethane sulfonates have properties in common with
           alkylating agents, but are unlike conventional alkylators (such as nitrogen mustards,
           BCNU, or busulfan) in that they are active against renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      Objective:

      Primary:

      -To determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), MTD and recommended phase II dose (RPTD) of
      dimethane sulfonate (DMS612, NSC 281612) when administered by intravenous (IV) bolus on day 1
      and 2 of a 21-day cycle.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy or lymphoma that is
           metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not
           exist or are no longer effective.

        -  Any prior chemotherapy therapy is allowed in this protocol. No more than 2 prior
           cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens are allowed.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
           currently available on the use of Dimethane sulfonate in patients less than 18 years of
           age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric
           phase 1 single-agent trials.

        -  ECOG performance status 0-2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60%,).

        -  Life expectancy of 3 months or greater.

        -  Patients must have acceptable organ and marrow function as defined below: leukocytes
           greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL, absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to
           1,500/mm(3), platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/, mm(3) total bilirubin within
           normal institutional limits, AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT), less than or equal to 2.5 times the
           institutional upper limit of normal, creatinine within normal institutional limits or
           creatinine clearance greater than 50mL/min for patients with creatinine levels above
           institutional normal.

      Design:

      This is a Phase I study of the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antitumor
      activity of IV DMS612, NSC 281612, designed as an open-label, dose-escalation study to
      determine the RPTD of DMS612, NSC 281612 based on safety and pharmacokinetics. With the
      02/09/2015 amendment and change in schedule to evaluate a day 1 and 2 dosing every 6 weeks
      the following schema will be used:

      Dose Level Dose of NSC 281612 Escalation (%)

        -  1 3.5 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 2 -33

           4A 4.5 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 2 ---

           5A 6 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 2 33

           6A 8 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 2 67

           7A 10.5 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 2 33

           7B 10.5 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 2 q 6 weeks ---

           8A 14 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 2 33

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy or lymphoma that is
             metastatic or unresectable and for which effective therapy does not exist or is no
             longer effective.

          -  Any prior chemotherapy therapy is allowed in this protocol. No more than 2 prior
             cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens are allowed for eligibility. Non-myelotoxic therapies
             such as sunitinib and sorafenib or everolimus are not considered &quot;cytotoxic
             chemotherapies&quot;.Patients must be greater than or equal to 4 weeks from prior radiation
             or cytotoxic chemotherapy, except greater than or equal to 6 weeks for mitomycin C and
             nitrosoureas; greater than or equal to 2 weeks from hormonal therapy; greater than or
             equal to 4 weeks from prior experimental therapy; greater than or equal to 4 weeks
             from monoclonal antibody therapy (cetuximab, bevacizumab), greater than or equal to 2
             weeks from sorafenib, sunitinib or temsirolimus and greater than or equal to 8 weeks
             from prior UCN01 treatment. Patients with prostate cancer may continue ongoing LHRH
             agonist therapy. Patients with bone metastases or hypercalcemia who began intravenous
             bisphosphonate treatment prior to study entry may continue this treatment.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of dimethane sulfonate in patients less than 18 years
             of age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future
             pediatric phase 1 single-agent trials.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60%,).

          -  Life expectancy of 3 months or greater.

          -  Patients must have acceptable organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mm(3)

               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/ mm(3)

               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/ mm(3)

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional upper limit of
                  normal

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR

               -  24 hour urine creatinine clearance greater than 50 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients
                  with creatinine levels above institutional normal (may use creatinine clearance
                  Cockcroft-Gault Equation).

          -  The effects of dimethane sulfonate on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
             reason and because alkylating agents are known to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for at least 3
             months after study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Willing to comply with study procedures and follow-up.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who have not recovered (CTC less than or equal to grade I) from adverse
             events due to prior treatments

          -  Patients may not have received more than 2 prior cytotoxic regimens.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agent with therapeutic
             anticancer intent.

          -  Patients with history of CNS metastasis, unless control has been achieved with either
             radiation or surgical resection at least 3 months prior to enrollment on study.

          -  Patients who have had radiation to the pelvis or other bone marrow-bearing sites will
             be considered on a case by case basis and may be excluded if the bone marrow reserve
             is not considered adequate (greater than 25% of bone marrow irradiated).

          -  Uncontrolled medical illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, chronic or acute hepatitis, renal failure, symptomatic congestive heart
             failure, myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because DMS612 is likely to have
             toxicities similar to the alklyating agents with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with DMS612,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with DMS612.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with DMS612. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Patients are not eligible for the study if taking cytochrome P450-inducing
             anticonvulsants. This applies to patients with brain metastasis or those taking
             anticonvulsant for another reason (ie. Epilepsy).

          -  Patients diagnosed with alcoholism may not be treated with disulfiram.

          -  Patients may not be receiving agents thought to inhibit or induce the cytochrome p450
             isoenzyme CYP3A4.
