  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One hundred new residents will be recruited prior to the start of residency and followed
      prospectively for a year. Monthly nasal swabs will be performed to identify colonization with
      methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).The proportion of study subjects colonized
      with MRSA at the end of 1 year will be calculated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study looking at the incidence of MRSA colonization. New
      residents will be monitored every month with nasal swabs.We would like to elucidate factors
      responsible for MRSA colonization in healthcare workers.We would like to see if health care
      workers who are colonized spontaneously cleared MRSA and if there was any factors involved.

      Nasal swabs will be plated on the spot by trained individuals and the plates then incubated
      for 48 hours. Plates will be read by microbiologist after incubation.
