  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the results of cranioplasty with CAD/CAM (computer
      aided design/manufactured) based Hydroxylapatite and Titanium implants in respect to
      infections, re-operations, antibiotic treatment or removal of the implant.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both implant materials for cranioplasty, Hydroxylapatite and Titanium, are CE certified
      medical devices used in common practices. This study is intended to get prospective data in
      addition to the empirical and retrospective existing ones to enable the decision on which
      implant material should be preferably employed in future.
