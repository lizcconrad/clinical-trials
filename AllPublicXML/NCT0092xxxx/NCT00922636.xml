             prior to randomization.

          -  Patients must have an Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV-Parent
             Version:Investigator-Administered and Scored (ADHD-RS-IV-PV:IR) total score at least
             1.5 standard deviations above the age/gender norm prior to randomization. They must
             have a Clinical Global Impression-Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-Severity
             Scale (CGI-ADHD-S) score greater than or equal to 4 at both the patients screening
             visit, prior to randomization.

          -  Patients must have laboratory results; showing no clinically significant
             abnormalities.

          -  Patients must be of normal intelligence, as assessed by the investigator.

          -  Patients/parents must have been judged by the investigator to be reliable to keep

             examinations required by the protocol.

          -  Patients of child-bearing potential agree to use a reliable method of birth control
             during the study and for 1 month following the last dose of study drug. Female
             patients of child-bearing potential must test negative for pregnancy at the time of
             enrollment based on a urine pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who weigh less than 18 kg or greater than 75 kg at screening and at
             randomization.

          -  Patients with marked anxiety, tension, and agitation sufficient, to contraindicate
             treatment with extended-release methylphenidate.

          -  Patients with a history of any seizure disorder, known electroencephalographic (EEG)
             abnormalities in the absence of seizures.

          -  If the electrocardiogram (ECG) assessed at screening/prior to randomization shows an
             abnormality meeting one or more of the absolute exclusion criteria listed in the
             Pediatric ECG Alert Criteria must be excluded from the study.

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, are at serious suicidal risk.

          -  Patients with a history of severe allergies to more than one class of medications,
             multiple adverse drug reactions, or known hypersensitivity to extended-release

             who are currently using alcohol, drugs of abuse, or any prescribed or over-the-counter
             medication in a manner that the investigator considers indicative of abuse.

          -  Patients who screen positive for drugs of abuse not prescribed by a physician cannot
             participate. Drug screen may be repeated at the discretion of the investigator, and
             the patient may be allowed to enter the study if the repeat screen is negative. All
             patients must have a negative drug screen before enrollment in the study.

          -  Patients who have a medical condition that would increase sympathetic nervous system
             activity markedly, or who are taking a medication on a daily basis that has
             sympathomimetic activity are excluded. Such medications can be taken on an as-needed
             basis.

          -  Patients with problems that would be exacerbated by increased norepinephrine tone,
             including a history of cardiovascular disease, thyroid dysfunction, glaucoma, urinary
             retention, or severe gastrointestinal narrowing.

          -  Patients who, at any time during the study, are likely to need psychotropic
             medications apart from the drugs under study.

          -  Patients who, at any time during the study, are likely to begin structured
             psychotherapy aimed at ADHD symptoms are excluded. Psychotherapy initiated at least 1
             month prior to screening is acceptable.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Conners' Comprehensive Behavior Rating Scale (CP-CBRS) Academic Difficulties Total Score and the Language and Math Subscales at Week 8</title>
        <description>The CP-CBRS academic difficulties total/language/math subscale score is a measure of academic performance. Each subscale item score ranges from 0 (never, seldom) to 3 (very often, very frequently). Total score is expressed as T-score based on gender/age norms. Academic difficulties T-score range: 0-100. Higher T-scores denote greater academic difficulties. Change scores=Week 8 score-baseline score. Least Squares Mean Change is from a restricted maximum likelihood-based, mixed model repeated measure (MMRM) analysis adjusted for fixed class effects of treatment, pooled investigative site, strata (prior stimulant use status), visit, and treatment*visit interaction, and continuous, fixed effects of baseline total score and baseline score*visit interaction.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Conners' Comprehensive Behavior Rating Scale (CP-CBRS) Academic Difficulties Total Score and the Language and Math Subscales at Week 8</title>
          <description>The CP-CBRS academic difficulties total/language/math subscale score is a measure of academic performance. Each subscale item score ranges from 0 (never, seldom) to 3 (very often, very frequently). Total score is expressed as T-score based on gender/age norms. Academic difficulties T-score range: 0-100. Higher T-scores denote greater academic difficulties. Change scores=Week 8 score-baseline score. Least Squares Mean Change is from a restricted maximum likelihood-based, mixed model repeated measure (MMRM) analysis adjusted for fixed class effects of treatment, pooled investigative site, strata (prior stimulant use status), visit, and treatment*visit interaction, and continuous, fixed effects of baseline total score and baseline score*visit interaction.</description>
          <population>Per protocol (PP) population included all randomized participants with a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline result, excluding data from participants whose data may have been compromised.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham (SNAP-IV) Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) Total Score at Week 8 in Stimulant Naive Methylphenidate Group</title>
        <description>Measures oppositional defiance disorder symptoms. Total scores range from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). Higher total scores represent greater ODD. Change scores=Week 8 score-baseline score. Least Squares Mean Change is from a restricted maximum likelihood-based, mixed model repeated measure (MMRM) analysis. Model included fixed class effects of treatment, pooled investigative site, strata (prior stimulant use status), visit, and treatment*visit interaction, and continuous, fixed effects of baseline total score and baseline score*visit interaction.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV-Parent Version:Investigator-Administered and Scored (ADHD-RS-IV-PV:IR) Total Score at Week 8 in Stimulant Naive Methylphenidate Group</title>
          <description>Assesses 18 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition, Text Revision ADHD diagnosis symptoms/severity in past week. Each item: 0 (none/never, rarely) to 3 (severe/very often). Total score ranges from 0 to 54. Higher total scores indicate greater illness severity. Change scores=Week 8 score-baseline score. LS Mean Change adjusted for fixed class effects of treatment, pooled investigative site, strata (prior stimulant use status), visit, and treatment*visit interaction, and continuous, fixed effects of baseline score and baseline score*visit interaction.</description>
          <population>Stimulant naive participants randomized to methylphenidate with a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline result but excluded the participants whose data may have been compromised.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Rapid Automatized Naming/Rapid Alternating Stimulus Test (RAN/RAS) Subtotal Scores at Week 8</title>
        <description>Assesses ability to accurately and rapidly recognize and name visual symbols. The tests consist of rapid automatized naming tests (that is, Letters, Numbers, Objects, Colors) and 2 rapid alternating stimulus tests (that is, 2-Set Letters and Numbers; 3-Set Letters, Numbers, and Colors). Scores are based on the amount of time required to name all the stimulus items in each test section. Raw scores were converted to standard scores based on participant's age and conversion tables from manual (mean=100, standard deviation=15). Higher scores=better ability. Least Squares (LS) Mean Change from restricted maximum likelihood-based, mixed model repeated measure analysis. Model included fixed class effects of treatment, pooled investigative site, strata (prior stimulant use status), visit, and treatment*visit interaction, and continuous, fixed effects of baseline score and baseline score*visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) Digit Span Subtotal Scores at Week 8 in Stimulant Naive Methylphenidate Group</title>
        <description>Measures attention, concentration, sequencing, number facility, and auditory short-term memory. Digit forward and digit backward subscales each comprise 2 trials and 8 items. Scaled scores range from 1 to 19. Higher scores denote better performance. Least Squares Mean Change is from a restricted maximum likelihood-based, mixed model repeated measure analysis. Model included fixed class effects of treatment, pooled investigative site, strata (prior stimulant use status), visit, and treatment*visit interaction, and continuous, fixed effects of baseline score and baseline score*visit interaction.</description>
