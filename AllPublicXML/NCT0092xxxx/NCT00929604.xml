  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No randomized clinical trial to date has demonstrated a survival benefit of using regular
      HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load (VL) testing to monitor patients' responses to
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection. The measurement of VL is recommended to
      monitor the response to ART in developed countries. In resource-constrained settings, the
      World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend routine VL testing, in part due to the
      cost and complex infrastructure needed for reliable results. In these settings, WHO has
      proposed the use of clinical and CD4+ lymphocyte-based criteria to guide treatment decisions.
      However, multiple studies have demonstrated the poor performance of these criteria in
      sub-Saharan Africa and the frequent discordance between immunologic and virologic responses
      to ART.

      The use of routine viral load monitoring should be evaluated in resource-constrained
      settings. The investigators hypothesize that routine viral load testing of patients on ART
      will improve patient survival, decrease disease progression and development of drug
      resistance, and will be feasible and cost-effective for resource-constrained settings.

      The study 'Effectiveness of HIV Viral Load Monitoring on Patient Outcome in Resource-Poor
      Settings,' is a dual-arm, cluster randomized trial to evaluate the use of routine plasma
      HIV-1 VL monitoring to improve survival and decrease HIV disease progression in patients
      receiving ART. The primary objective is to assess mortality at 36 months among ART na√Øve
      patients initiating therapy and receiving care at facilities with access to routine HIV VL
      testing (at ART initiation, at 3 months and at every 6 months thereafter) compared to those
      initiating first regimens and receiving care at facilities according to our local standard of
      care (which uses immunological [i.e. CD4+ lymphocyte count-based]and clinical criteria to
      diagnose treatment failure, with discretionary VL testing when the two do not agree).

    <description>Standard of care arm: utilizes the current standard of care per Zambian national guidelines to determine treatment failure and eligibility for second-line ART. HIV-1 viral load measurement is performed if the criteria for either immunologic (i.e., CD4+ lymphocyte count-based) or clinical treatment failure are fulfilled. If both immunologic and clinical treatment failure criteria are fulfilled, the ART regimen is changed to second-line without VL testing.</description>
