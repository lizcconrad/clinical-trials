  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of same
      sitting, simultaneous hybrid robotic assisted coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the treatment of obstructive multivessel coronary
      artery disease. A secondary objective is the assessment and standardization of optimal
      operator techniques and comparative study of patients undergoing CABG during study period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will consist of patients with multivessel coronary artery disease
      requiring CABG with suitable anatomy for combination CABG and PCI of non-bypassed arteries.

      The primary endpoint of this feasibility study is a 30-day composite of major adverse
      clinical events including death, repeat revascularization, stroke and/or myocardial
      infarction.

      The secondary endpoints include:

        1. Successful completion of same sitting CABG and coronary stent procedure

        2. Successful completion of CABG and PCI during single hospitalization

        3. Achievement of complete revascularization

        4. Patency of the LIMA and stented vessels as determined by coronary angiography at time of
           procedures or prior to discharge and by cardiac Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA)
           or coronary angiography at 1 year.

        5. Stent thrombosis at 24 hours (acute), 30 days (sub acute), and 1 year (late)

        6. One-year composite clinical event endpoints of major clinical events including death,
           repeat revascularization, myocardial infarction, and freedom from angina

        7. Comparative analysis of hospital, 30 day, and 1 year events of hybrid CABG patients
           compared to consecutive patients undergoing off pump CABG with standard thoracotomy
           during study period
