  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Passive smoking is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events. However, the
      exact mechanisms by which passive smoking affects cardiovascular health are not entirely
      understood. In the present study, the researchers investigate the effects of short-term
      exposure to secondhand smoke on platelet function and peripheral microvascular endothelial
      function in healthy individuals. For this purpose, platelet function and endothelial function
      are measured before and after a 1-hour exposure to secondhand smoke in a concentration that
      is encountered in bars and restaurants without smoke-free policies. The researchers'
      hypothesis is that short-term exposure leads to platelet activation and impairment of
      endothelial function.

    <description>Participants will be exposed to secondhand smoke for one hour. As a measure of secondhand smoke exposition, room carbon monoxide concentration will be continuously measured using an Ambient Carbon Monoxide Monitor APMA-360 and kept constant between 4.5-6.0 ppm. Levels in this magnitude are typically seen in smoking areas of restaurants and bars.</description>
