  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting with solitary or multiple lung nodules often require tissue confirmation
      in order to guide further management and determine if the lesion is benign or malignant.
      Several bronchoscopic techniques have emerged which have significantly improved the
      diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy in this setting, and in particular the combination of
      peripheral Endobronchial Ultrasonography (pEBUS) and Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy
      (ENB) has resulted in diagnostic yields of nearly 90%. In an attempt to reduce the
      significant cost of this combined approach, the sequential use of pEBUS followed by the more
      costly ENB technique only if a lesion is not identified on the ultrasound image could be as
      accurate. This study aims to determine the diagnostic yield of this sequential approach in
      patients with lung nodule(s).

    <description>Subject will undergo bronchoscopy with peripheral endobronchial ultrasonography to identify the peripheral lung nodule. If the lesion is identified with pEBUS, samples will be collected.
If the lesion is not found by pEBUS, the electromagnetic navigation system will be deployed and directed to the lesion of interest, once again using pEBUS to confirm final location before samples are collected.</description>

          -  Patients with lesions highly suspicious for lung cancer, potentially resectable with
             lobar or lesser resection and without significantly increased operative risk factors
