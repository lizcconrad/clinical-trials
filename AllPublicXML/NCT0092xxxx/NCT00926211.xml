    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to investigate and compare the safety and efficacy of
      the Restoration Robotics Computer-Assisted Harvesting System to the manual hair follicle
      harvesting method following a nine-month period of post-procedural evaluation.

      A major technical step in hair transplantation is harvesting of the hair follicles. There are
      two accepted techniques for obtaining the hair grafts that are transplanted during the
      procedure. The first is donor strip harvest and stereomicroscopic dissection of the
      follicular unit grafts. The second is dissection and extraction of the follicular unit graft
      directly from the patient's scalp referred to as Follicular Unit Extraction or &quot;FUE&quot;.
      Potential benefits of the FUE technique may be less scalp scarring in the Donor Area, less
      patient discomfort and faster wound healing. Although the FUE approach to harvest has highly
      desirable attributes, it is technically difficult to perform, labor intensive, tedious and
      requires an excessive amount of time to harvest follicular units. These procedural factors
      have prevented the FUE approach from gaining wider adoption.

      Restoration Robotics, Inc. has developed the Restoration Robotics ARTAS™ Computer-Assisted
      Harvesting System to assist physicians in the harvest of hair follicles during hair
      transplantation procedures. The System mimics the manual FUE approach to harvesting
      follicular units and has the potential to solve the technical challenges inherent in the
      manual FUE technique. The ARTAS™ System is capable of identifying and harvesting hair
      follicles directly from the patient's scalp through a semi-automated process. The goal of the
      ARTAS™ System is to harvest the hair follicles while maintaining their critical anatomic
      structures intact.
