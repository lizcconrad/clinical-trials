    <description>Normally, Follistim Injection 150 or 225 IU will be administered (s.c. or i.m.) once a day for 4 days as follitropin beta (genetical recombination). The dosage will be adapted to growth of follicles (75-375 IU for 6-12 days, in general). If more than 3 follicles of mean diameter 16-20 mm are confirmed by ultrasound tomography, ovulation will be stimulated by using Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) drugs.</description>
