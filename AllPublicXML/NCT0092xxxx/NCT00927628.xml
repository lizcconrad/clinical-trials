    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation was to determine the incidence and the factors that cause a
      reopening of a macular hole (MH) after a surgical closure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A reopening of a macular hole (MH) is a well-known complication of successfully closed MHs.
      Recently, internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling has become widely used as an adjunctive
      procedure during MH surgery. The incidence of a reopening of a MH is 0 to 8.6% in eyes in
      which the ILM was peeled off, and 2 to 16% in which the ILM was not peeled off. Part of the
      variation in the percentages of reopening was the length of the follow-up period; eyes with
      longer follow-up periods have higher incidences of reopening.
