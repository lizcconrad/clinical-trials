  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this protocol is to test the feasibility and utility of obtaining
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings in healthy children and also in children who have a
      psychiatric or developmental disorder. Secondary objectives are to examine and compare
      typical and atypical motor, sensory, and cognitive functioning as recorded by MEG, and to
      identify subpopulation groups for which MEG may be optimal in order to establish feasibility
      of future hypothesis-driven MEG research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy children and those who have a psychiatric or developmental disorder will undergo MEG
      recording to evaluate whether such children are candidate MEG subjects. Essentially, this
      feasibility study will examine whether children can remain still enough, complete simple
      tasks, and produce neurophysiologically consistent responses that would warrant full size
      studies.
