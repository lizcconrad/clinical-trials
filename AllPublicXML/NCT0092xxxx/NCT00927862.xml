  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether DNA analysis improves the efficiency of
      dosing and safety in patients who are being started on warfarin therapy.Warfarin, a blood
      thinner (anticoagulant) prescribed to 1-2 million patients in the United States, is a leading
      cause of drug-related adverse events (e.g., severe bleeding), in large part due to dramatic
      (20-fold) differences between individuals in dose requirements. At least half of this
      variability now can be explained by 3 common genetic variants, age, body size, and sex;
      however, warfarin therapy continues to begin with the same dose in every patient with the
      correct individual dose determined by trial and error. This study proposes to determine
      genetic variations the same day from DNA simply obtained by swabbing the inside of the cheek
      and use this information to determine the proper dose regimen individually in each patient.
      The aim is to show that the investigators can achieve more rapid, efficient, and safe dosing
      in up to 500-1000 individuals who are initiating warfarin therapy for various clotting
      disorders across a large healthcare system in order to demonstrate improved dosing
      effectiveness, efficiency, and safety with genetic-based dosing, which could lead to a
      nationwide application resulting in as much as a $1 billion dollar annual benefit in
      healthcare outcomes.

      Study Objectives:

      The specific objectives of CoumaGen-II to be tested are:

        1. To apply routine pharmacogenetic (PG)-guided dosing of warfarin in clinical practice at
           Intermountain Healthcare facilities in the Urban Central Region (i.e., Intermountain
           Medical Center [IMC], LDS Hospital, Alta View Hospital [AVH]), and selected physician
           offices that are frequent initiators of warfarin) in a major new quality improvement and
           clinical research initiative.

        2. To compare the percentage out-of-range (%OOR) international normalized prothrombin time
           ratios (INRs) during the first month (and secondarily, 3 months) of warfarin therapy
           using PG-guided dosing with parallel or historical standard (STD), empiric dosed
           controls.

        3. To compare a modified PG-guided dosing algorithm (modified-International Warfarin
           Pharmacogenetics Consortium [IWPC]) with a previously generated and validated,
           multicenter PG-guided algorithm (IWPC).

      Study Design:

      Qualifying patients being initiated on warfarin therapy with a target INR of 1.5-2.5, 2-3, or
      2.5-3.5 will be invited to participate and sign informed consent. Enrolled patients will
      receive DNA sampling by buccal swab, and samples will be processed and a PG-guided initial
      dose calculated with a goal of &lt;6 hours (maximum, 24 hours). Dosing and dose adjustments will
      be managed through the Urban Central Region (IMC/LDSH) anticoagulation management service
      (AMS). Dose adjustments through day 8 will use a PG-modified algorithm, after which
      modification will revert to the standard IHC algorithm. AMS pharmacists and study
      coordinators will ascertain warfarin doses, INRs, dose changes, and adverse events, and
      record information on case report forms.

      Study Duration:

      Each patient will participate for approximately 3 months (90 days ± 10 days). The anticipated
      enrollment period is 24 months or until 1000 patients are enrolled. The length of the
      enrollment period is subject to revision as it is dependent on the availability of a robust
      patient pool.

          <title>PG Dosing Patients</title>
          <description>Patients who were enrolled in CoumaGen-II and thus, received their warfarin dosing by the PG-dosing algorithms were randomized to receive either standard or modified International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium [IWPC] warfarin dosing. The IWPC derived and published a common algorithm to predict stable maintenance dose based on ~5000 patients across broad geographic and ethnic/racial groups (N Engl J Med 2009;360:753-764). Hence, we based our standard algorithm on the IWPC algorithm with minor modifications to accommodate different INR targets and smoking status, based on supplemental data from Gage et al (Clini Pharmacol Ther 2008;84:326 -331). The modified IWPC algorithm included 2 further modifications: (1) It ignored the CYP2C9 variant status for the first 2 days; and (2) It used a special dose-revision algorithm based on a day 4 (or day 5) INR after 3 (or 4) warfarin doses.</description>

            <description>The parallel, standard-dosing patient control cohort was identified by a query of the electronic medical records databases of the 3 participating hospitals for the time interval spanning enrollment of the randomized PG-guided cohorts (July 2008 through December 2010). Patients &gt;=18 years of age initiating warfarin therapy with a baseline and at least 1 follow-up INR level between days 3 and 14 were selected. Initial dose selection and therapy modification was at individual Intermountain-credentialed physician/healthcare provider discretion. Standard management is non-PG-based. A standard (fixed) initial maintenance dose of 5 mg/d is generally assumed, with loading doses and clinical-factor modifications not specified. However,the same standard INR-based dose-modification algorithm developed and promoted by Intermountain is generally recommended.</description>

Initial dose selection and therapy modification was at individual Intermountain-credentialed physician/healthcare provider discretion. Standard management is non-PG-based. A standard (fixed) initial maintenance dose of 5 mg/d is generally assumed, with loading doses and clinical-factor modifications not specified. However,the same standard INR-based dose-modification algorithm developed and promoted by Intermountain is generally recommended.</description>
