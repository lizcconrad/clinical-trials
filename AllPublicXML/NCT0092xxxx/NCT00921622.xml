  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is suggestive evidence that vitamin C and vitamin D deficiency may increase blood
      pressure across the range of blood pressures from normal to elevated. Information about this
      relationship is inadequate in part because of the rarity of individuals with subclinical
      vitamin C and D deficiency. The investigators have observed subnormal to deficient plasma
      vitamin C and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in a large proportion of patients under active
      treatment in the investigators' hospital. The clinical implications of widespread
      hypovitaminosis C and D are unknown. In this randomized prospective comparison trial the
      investigators will measure vitamin levels and blood pressure in clinically stable acutely
      hospitalized patients with a wide range of diagnoses, and expected to remain in the hospital
      for at least 7 more days. The investigators will examine for an inverse relationship between
      baseline vitamin level and blood pressure across the range of blood pressures. Consenting
      patients will be randomized to receive vitamin C (500 mg twice daily) or vitamin D (1000 IU
      twice daily) for as long as 10 days. Blood pressure will be re-measured every 2 days and
      vitamin levels re-measured on the last study day. Treatment courses of at least 5 days will
      be considered sufficient for analysis. The hypothesis is that either treatment will reduce
      blood pressure in patients whose baseline systolic blood pressure is 110 or more; the
      investigators will also examine whether the reduction in blood pressure with treatment is
      proportional to the increase in the circulating vitamin level with treatment.
