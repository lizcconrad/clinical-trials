    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate changes in insulin sensitivity and ß-cell function
      after 24 and 48 weeks of low-dose growth hormone (GH) therapy in adult patients with severe
      GH deficiency using highly standardized techniques. Insulin sensitivity was estimated using
      euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamps, while insulin secretion and hepatic insulin clearance
      were determined by changes in insulin and C-peptide levels during hyperglycemic
      hyperinsulinemic clamps with consecutive intravenous (i.v.) L-arginine stimulation tests.
      Moreover, the researchers investigated changes in body composition, lipolysis and
      cardiovascular risk markers. Furthermore, in order to verify the mechanisms involved in the
      pathogenesis of GH-induced insulin resistance and the GH-induced improvement in insulin
      resistance under long term treatment, the researchers intend to establish changes in
      intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) in patients with GH deficiency by magnetic resonance
      (MR)-spectroscopy before and during GH-treatment and to correlate IMCL with insulin
      resistance, insulin secretion and insulin clearance. Finally, the researchers aim to justify
      the effect of GH on adiponectin secretion as well as on the 11-ß hydroxylase activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In adult patients with GH deficiency, it is well documented that treatment with recombinant
      human GH results in a reduction of visceral fat mass and an increase in muscle mass. During
      long-term treatment, these effects seem to have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism.
      However, during the initial phase of GH treatment the insulin antagonistic effect of GH often
      induces an insulin resistant state which leads to an increase in insulin secretion or even,
      in cases with a preexisting ß-cell defect, to overt diabetes. Due to the lipolytic effect of
      GH, an impact of GH treatment on intracellular lipid homeostasis in adipose tissue, but also
      in skeletal muscle cells and liver cells can be expected. Moreover, since insulin resistance
      is known to be closely correlated with intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) content, changes in IMCL
      can play a key role in the GH-induced changes in the insulin sensitivity. Anyway, the
      mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of GH-induced insulin resistance and the GH-induced
      improvement in insulin resistance under long term treatment are presently not fully
      understood. In order to verify these mechanisms, we intend to establish changes in IMCL in
      patients with GH deficiency by MR-spectroscopy before and during GH-treatment and to
      correlate IMCL with insulin resistance, insulin secretion and insulin clearance. Finally, we
      aim to justify the effect of GH on adiponectin secretion as well as on the 11-ß hydroxylase
      activity.
