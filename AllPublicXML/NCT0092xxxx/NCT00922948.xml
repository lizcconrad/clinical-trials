  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify the oncological efficacy and safety of cryoablation
      and radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of small renal tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By enrolling all patients treated with CA or RFA, this study will document for the first time
      the safety and the short and long term efficacy of CA compared to RFA as well as provide
      urologists and decision makers currently unavailable information on CA in Canada.

  <why_stopped>
    Cryoablation is no longer offered at our hospital, and likely won't be offered in the near
    future.

    <description>Thermal injury is the predominant mechanism of action of RFA. A high-frequency alternating current emitted from the exposed noninsulated portion of the electrode generates frictional heat, agitating ions in the tissue surrounding the tip of the needle.</description>
