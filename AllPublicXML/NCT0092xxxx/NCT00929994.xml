  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that the addition of formal cardiac rehabilitation to standard care will
      result in long-term improvements in cardiovascular fitness and functional capacity in
      individuals who have suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke.

      Furthermore, it is proposed that the addition of cardiac rehabilitation will influence stroke
      risk, physical activity participation, strength, and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as an episode of neurological dysfunction caused
      by focal brain ischemia lasting less than 24 hours. Once an individual has suffered a TIA,
      preventative measures can be taken to target modifiable risk factors, one of which is
      physical inactivity. The current proposal focuses on the use of an established model of care
      (cardiac rehabilitation (CR)) and applies it to those who have suffered a TIA in order to
      maximize physical activity and minimize risk of future cardiovascular events. This will be a
      one-group pre/post design study. Participants will undergo measures at baseline, 6 and 12
      months (cardiovascular fitness, 6 minute walk test, quality of life, diet, strength, physical
      activity, and Framingham Profile stroke risk (plasma lipids, blood pressure, medication
      use)).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with TIA

          -  Three months post-TIA

          -  Ability to understand the process and instructions for exercise training and provide
             informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Resting Blood Pressure greater than 160/100 despite medication

          -  Other cardiovascular morbidity which would limit exercise tolerance (heart failure,
             abnormal BP responses or STsegment depression &gt; 2 mm, symptomatic aortic stenosis,
             complex arrhythmias)

          -  Current and extensive exercise participation

          -  Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

          -  Unstable Angina

          -  Orthostatic BP decrease of &gt; 20 mm Hg with symptoms

          -  Other musculoskeletal impairments which would limit the participant's ability to walk
             sufficient durations

          -  Pain or other co-morbidities (e.g., unclipped aneurysms, uncontrolled seizures etc.)
             which would preclude participation

          -  Cognitive or behavioural issues that would limit participation in exercise testing and
             training
