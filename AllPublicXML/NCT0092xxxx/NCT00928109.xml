      UCAN is a research program funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and is part of
      the UNC Eating Disorders Program. UCAN aims to help couples work together in the treatment of
      anorexia nervosa. Couples participate in UCAN over a period of six months and return for
      follow-up treatment three months after the end of the original six-month period. Patients
      receive weekly individual therapy, monthly psychiatry consultations, monthly dietary
      consultations in addition to being randomized to one of two types of weekly couples therapy.
      Participation in UCAN can help participants gain new confidence in facing anorexia as a team
      and can help us understand how best to involve partners in the treatment of eating disorders.

    <description>CBCT is a 20-week program consisting of 1-hour sessions between a couple and a therapist. In this program, couples learn about ways to communicate about their relationship in the context of experiencing anorexia nervosa. CBCT focuses on couple-specific skills such as communication and targets relationship domains such as exercise, body image and sexuality, eating together as a couple, and broader relationship concerns outside of anorexia nervosa.</description>
