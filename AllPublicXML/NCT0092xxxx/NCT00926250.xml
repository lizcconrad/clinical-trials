  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia, the age-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, is a frequent
      precursor to functional impairment, disability, falls, and loss of independence in the
      elderly. The prevalence of sarcopenia is high, with â‰¥ 45% of the U.S. population aged 60
      years or older sarcopenic. Some possible causative factors include a decline in muscle
      protein synthesis, inactivity, hormonal changes, pro-inflammatory conditions, and reactive
      oxygen species within the muscle mitochondria, which may all be exacerbated by inadequate
      nutritional intake. Since dietary protein is targeted to muscle and muscle mass represents
      the largest tissue in the body, protein nutrition plays a significant role in muscle
      metabolism.

      SPECIFIC AIMS The specific aim of this proposed study is to determine the effect of PS-IPC
      supplementation on muscle mass, muscle strength, muscle quality, and inflammatory / immune
      markers in healthy older adults. Subjects scoring 4 - 10 on the Short-Physical Performance
      Battery and aged 60-85 years will consume PS-IPC supplements or placebo three times daily for
      12 weeks.

      HYPOTHESES

        1. Subjects consuming PS-IPC will have a greater increase in muscle mass and muscle
           strength compared to a control group consuming a placebo supplement.

        2. Subjects consuming PS-IPC will demonstrate a greater increase in the fractional rate of
           muscle protein synthesis compared with a placebo control group.

        3. Subjects receiving PS-IPC will have a reduction in plasma concentrations of various
           inflammatory markers of immune function, compared to subjects consuming the placebo.
