  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot, prospective, comparative study. To include both male and female patients who have
      presented an ischaemic stroke (full stroke or TIA) or an ACS, 5 to 30 days prior to
      inclusion.

      The proposed study aims to investigate and analyse the differences in functional and
      structural arterial properties between the patients who presented an ischaemic stroke and
      those who presented ACS. The hypothesis is that the patients in both groups will present
      differences partly in terms of their &quot;traditional&quot; cardiovascular risk factors, but also in
      terms of their arterial properties. All of the confounding factors studied (cardiovascular
      risk factors, treatments) will be taken into account in order to explain the differences in
      the arterial properties found between the two groups. Furthermore, the prevalence of signs
      and symptoms in the two populations will be studied.

      A comparative study of structural and functional arterial properties after an ischaemic
      stroke or an acute coronary syndrome

      Objectives:

      Primary:

        -  To determine whether there is a difference in the biomechanical properties of the
           carotid arteries, assessed by studying their stiffness, after an acute vascular event,
           depending on whether the event is an ischaemic stroke (either a full stroke or a
           transitory ischaemic attack (TIA)) or an acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

      Secondary:

        -  To determine whether there is a difference in aortic stiffness and brachial endothelial
           function after an acute vascular event, depending on whether the event is an ischaemic
           stroke (full stroke or TIA) or an ACS.

        -  To compare the blood pressure (BP) levels and the vascular parameters of the two patient
           groups (the ischaemic stroke group and the ACS group).

        -  To determine whether there is a difference between the respiratory parameters recorded
           during sleep after an acute vascular event, depending on whether the event is an
           ischaemic stroke (full stroke or TIA) or an ACS.
