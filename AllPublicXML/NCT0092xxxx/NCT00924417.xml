  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled trial of a distraction protocol for peripheral intravenous
      line placement in the pediatric emergency department. Patients and parents will be randomized
      to one of two interventions: routine care or a teaching session about the cognitive technique
      known as distraction. The study seeks to enroll children ages 4-9, who are cognitively
      normal, who are without significant chronic medical illness, who are receiving intravenous
      line placement as part of routine care in the pediatric emergency department. Study
      investigators hypothesize that patients in the intervention group will report less pain than
      patients in the control group.
