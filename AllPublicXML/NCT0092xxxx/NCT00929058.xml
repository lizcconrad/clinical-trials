  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The introduction of angiogenesis inhibitors has remarkably improved treatment of
      patients with several types of cancer. One of the most common side effects of angiogenesis
      inhibitors is hypertension. In patients treated with bevacizumab hypertension had an overall
      incidence up to 32%. The etiology of hypertension caused by treatment with angiogenesis
      inhibitors is unclear.

      Objective: To study if arterial bevacizumab infusion causes acute vasoconstriction using
      plethysmography in healthy volunteers.
