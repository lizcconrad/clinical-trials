      Primary Objectives:

        -  To compare the rates of myopericarditis (subclinical, suspected, probable, or confirmed)
           in deploying military subjects who received ACAM2000® vaccine to rates among subjects
           positioned to deploy who would be personally eligible to receive ACAM2000 vaccine but do
           not receive ACAM2000 vaccine due to recency of prior vaccination (as determined by DoD
           healthcare providers) or due to conditions or characteristics of their contacts.

        -  To identify cases of subclinical myopericarditis in deploying military subjects who
           received ACAM2000 vaccine.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the rates of severe and serious dermatologic adverse events observed in
           deploying military subjects who received ACAM2000® vaccine to rates among subjects
           positioned to deploy who would be personally eligible to receive ACAM2000 vaccine but do
           not receive ACAM2000 vaccine due to recency of prior vaccination (as determined by DoD
           healthcare providers) or due to conditions or characteristics of their contacts.

        -  To compare the rates of severe and serious neurological adverse events observed in
           deploying military subjects who received ACAM2000® vaccine to rates among subjects
           positioned to deploy who would be personally eligible to receive ACAM2000 vaccine but do
           not receive ACAM2000 vaccine due to recency of prior vaccination (as determined by DoD
           healthcare providers) or due to conditions or characteristics of their contacts.

        -  To compare the rates of adverse events observed in subjects approximately 10 days
           following their ACAM2000® vaccination to rates among subjects positioned to deploy who
           would be personally eligible to receive ACAM2000 vaccine but do not receive ACAM2000
           vaccine due to recency of prior vaccination (as determined by DoD healthcare providers)
           or due to conditions or characteristics of their contacts.

        -  To evaluate potential risk factors associated with the development of confirmed,
           probable, and/or suspected ACAM2000-associated myopericarditis.

      This is a prospective safety surveillance study in a US military Department of Defense (DoD)
      population. Military subjects either naive to smallpox immunization and have received
      ACAM2000® vaccine or who have previously been immunized with a vaccinia vaccine, usually
      Dryvax®, will be enrolled into the study.

      No vaccine will be administered as part of this study.
