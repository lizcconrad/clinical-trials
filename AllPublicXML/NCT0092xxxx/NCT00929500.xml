  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether a supervised mixed aerobic and strength training
      (MAST) program is effective in improving overall physical fitness and blood flow in the brain
      and lowering risk factors of coronary artery disease (CAD) in women with metabolic syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions and disorders that increase the risk for
      coronary artery disease (CAD) and strokes. Sedentary lifestyle is one of the risk factors,
      which decrease overall physical fitness and together with aging may lead to decrease in
      physical functioning in everyday life as well as changes in blood flow in the brain and
      cognitive functions. Regular physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of
      cardiovascular disease. It may also improve blood flow velocity and cognitive functions.
      Physical activity should be as effective as possible, but also as safe as possible.
      Supervised mixed aerobic and strength training (MAST) program for 4 months enables to
      individualize the intensity of aerobic exercise based on measured maximal exercise capacity.
      Throughout each training session heart rate will be monitored with a new real time wireless
      ECG system.

    <measure>Maximal Oxygen Uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 4 months of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>To obtain peak oxygen uptake (VO2max; ml−1/min−1/kg), a symptom-limited exercise stress test was performed on a cycle ergometer. The test was preceded by a 2-minute warm-up at the intensity of 20 W. The first test load was 20 W, and was increased by 20 W at each 2-minute stage until the participants could no longer continue, i.e., they were unable to maintain pedaling frequency &gt; 40 rpm, they achieved a respiratory exchange ratio of more than 1.0, or clinical criteria for test termination was observed. VO2max was measured and monitored with a breath-by-breath gas exchange system.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity (BFV)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 4 months of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Cerebral BFV was monitored using Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound.11 The middle cerebral artery was insonated from the temporal window by placing the 2-MegaHertZ (MHz) probe against the skin of the temporal region above the zygomatic arch. The probe was positioned to obtain maximal BFV and was fixed at the desired angle using a 3-dimensional positioning system. Once instrumented, BFV was continuously recorded throughout ten minutes of supine rest and 10-minutes on a table tilted to 80° from the horizontal position (head-up with foot plate support).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trail Making Test</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 4 months of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Trail Making (TM) test is a measure of shifting attention. Participants are required to sequentially connect a series of numbered circles (Part A), and then to alternate between numbers and letters sequentially (Part B) (e.g., A-1-B-2-C-3..). Any participant who has not completed Part B within the standard 5 minutes (300 seconds) allotted for the task will be considered unable to complete the task. The scores in Part A (TM-A), Part B (TM-B) T scores ( age, education adjusted), and their difference (TM-B -TM-A) were calculated and used to measure executive function, i.e., lower scores indicates better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 4 months of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>MAST sessions were held twice a week for 16 weeks. Each exercise session consisted of 10 min of warm-up, 15-30 min of interval aerobic training by cycle ergometer according to the program, 20 min of strength training exercises, and 10 min of cool-down by stretching. The target heart rate (HR) increased progressively from 50% up to 80% of HR reserve by the end of the intervention period.The Karvonen formula ([(HRmax - HRrest)×(0.50 to 0.80)] + HRrest) was used to calculate the target HR. During every training session a new wireless computerized ECG monitoring system was used. After aerobic training, the strength training program was performed. Exercises used body mass as resistance and included squat, step-up-squat, step-up, heel rise, and sit-ups. Dumbbells were used as extra weight (5 or 10% of body weight) during other exercises except for sit-ups. The control group participated in an educational session once a month and kept physical activity diaries during the intervention period.</description>

          <description>To obtain peak oxygen uptake (VO2max; ml−1/min−1/kg), a symptom-limited exercise stress test was performed on a cycle ergometer. The test was preceded by a 2-minute warm-up at the intensity of 20 W. The first test load was 20 W, and was increased by 20 W at each 2-minute stage until the participants could no longer continue, i.e., they were unable to maintain pedaling frequency &gt; 40 rpm, they achieved a respiratory exchange ratio of more than 1.0, or clinical criteria for test termination was observed. VO2max was measured and monitored with a breath-by-breath gas exchange system.</description>

The probe was positioned to obtain maximal BFV and was fixed at the desired angle using a 3-dimensional positioning system. Once instrumented, BFV was continuously recorded throughout ten minutes of supine rest and 10-minutes on a table tilted to 80° from the horizontal position (head-up with foot plate support).</description>

        <title>Trail Making Test</title>
        <description>The Trail Making (TM) test is a measure of shifting attention. Participants are required to sequentially connect a series of numbered circles (Part A), and then to alternate between numbers and letters sequentially (Part B) (e.g., A-1-B-2-C-3..). Any participant who has not completed Part B within the standard 5 minutes (300 seconds) allotted for the task will be considered unable to complete the task. The scores in Part A (TM-A), Part B (TM-B) T scores ( age, education adjusted), and their difference (TM-B –TM-A) were calculated and used to measure executive function, i.e., lower scores indicates better performance.</description>

        <description>MAST sessions were held twice a week for 16 weeks. Each exercise session consisted of 10 min of warm-up, 15–30 min of interval aerobic training by cycle ergometer according to the program, 20 min of strength training exercises, and 10 min of cool-down by stretching. The target heart rate (HR) increased progressively from 50% up to 80% of HR reserve by the end of the intervention period.The Karvonen formula ([(HRmax – HRrest)×(0.50 to 0.80)] + HRrest) was used to calculate the target HR. During every training session a new wireless computerized ECG monitoring system was used. After aerobic training, the strength training program was performed. Exercises used body mass as resistance and included squat, step-up-squat, step-up, heel rise, and sit-ups. Dumbbells were used as extra weight (5 or 10% of body weight) during other exercises except for sit-ups. The control group participated in an educational session once a month and kept physical activity diaries during the intervention period.</description>
