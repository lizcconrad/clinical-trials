  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  It is not fully understood why prostate cancer in some men becomes androgen-independent
           (no longer responds to anti-androgen medication), but genetics likely plays an important
           role.

        -  Genes contain the hereditary information that is passed down from parents to children.
           Although everyone has the same set of genes, individuals can have different forms of the
           same gene.

        -  Differences in genes may explain, at least in part, why some people develop a more
           aggressive form of prostate cancer than others.

      Objectives:

      -To obtain blood samples from patients with prostate cancer to try to identify gene
      differences associated with progression to the androgen independent state.

      Eligibility:

      -All patients participating in NCI prostate cancer protocols.

      Design:

        -  Patients with prostate cancer are evaluated in the NCI s Medical Oncology Clinic.

        -  Blood samples are collected at the initial visit or at follow-up visits.

        -  DNA (genetic material) and white blood cells are extracted from these samples to be used
           for genotyping and establishment of cell lines.

        -  Gene variations are correlated with prostate cancer prognosis and prognostic indicators.

      Objectives:

      To obtain blood samples from patients with prostate cancer for genotyping analyses.

      Eligibility:

      All patients seen in the NCI prostate cancer clinic are eligible.

      Design:

      Patients with a prior diagnosis of prostate cancer will be evaluated in the GMB Clinic, NCI.
      Blood samples may be collected at the initial visit or at follow-up visits. Genomic DNA and
      white blood cells will each be extracted from these samples to be utilized for genotyping and
      establishment of individual cell lines. Genetic variance will be correlated with prostate
      cancer prognosis (i.e. time from diagnosis to death) and prognostic indicators (i.e.
      histological tumor grade). Healthy controls will not be compared and no correlations will be
      made with prostate cancer susceptibility.
