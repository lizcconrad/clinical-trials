  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri
      (LR) in healthy adult patients. Patients will be randomized to receive either LR or placebo
      orally each day for a total of 60 doses. The effects on fecal bacteria, circulating white
      blood cell receptors and inflammatory cytokine profiles will be measured.

      Lactobacillus reuteri oil drops are a natural product containing Lactobacillus reuteri (LR),
      which has traditionally been used for the establishment and maintenance of a well-functioning
      gastro-intestinal (GI) tract micro flora and prevention and treatment of mild diarrhea
      associated with GI-tract infections. The oil drops contain a dietary supplement of
      Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938. The patients will receive 5 drops (10^8 live organisms) by
      mouth daily for 60 days. Daily administration will include 5 drops (5x10^8) of L. reuteri or
      placebo daily for two months. During this time,circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cell
      (PBMC) toll-like receptor-2 and -4 levels will be measured, along with PBMC cytokine
      production levels in vitro. Fecal DGGE analysis(with sequencing of bacterial rDNA) will be
      completed identifying changes in fecal microbiota. Inflammation in the gut will also be
      assessed by fecal calprotectin assay (ELISA). The time on study treatment is 2 months, with 4
      months observation, for a total of 6 months. There will be 7 required visits, during which,
      we will assess safety and immune system effects.
