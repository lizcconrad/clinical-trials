      Study objectives: To assess the effects of postconditioning on infarct size in patients with
      ST-elevation infarction referred to PCI.

      Study design: Prospective, randomized, open-label study with blinded endpoint evaluation.
      Included patients will be randomly allocated to postconditioning or control. Patients with
      symptoms of acute myocardial infarction of less than 6 hours duration fulfilling ECG criteria
      for primary PCI are eligible. PCI follow established routines. In postconditioning patients,
      additional, short (1 min), intermittent balloon occlusions will be applied after initial
      opening of infarct related artery. After this intervention, PCI proceeds routinely with stent
      implantation. In the control group, stent implantation after initial opening proceeds as
      usual. Primary endpoint is final infarct size, determined by MRI after 4 months. 260 patients
      will be included. Follow-up is 1 year. Inclusion period: 18 - 24 months.

      Clinical implications: Reperfusion therapy, administered as early as possible after start of
      symptoms, has improved the prognosis in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Still,
      however, many patients suffer large infarctions, subsequently with an increased risk of heart
      failure, arrhythmias, and death. In pilot studies, mechanical postconditioning has been shown
      to reduce infarct size and thus potentially improve prognosis. However, the effect of
      postconditioning must be confirmed in larger clinical trials before implemented in routine
      treatment.
