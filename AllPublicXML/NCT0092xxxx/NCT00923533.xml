      Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K), a selective blocker of AT1 receptor subtype, showed the rapid and
      potent antihypertensive effect in many hypertensive models.

      Phase I study, Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) 20 mg ~ 480 mg single dosing with healthy subjects,
      demonstrated that the Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) was very safe and well tolerated. Another phase
      I study, Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) 120mg and 360mg dosing for 7 days, also showed that
      Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) was safe and tolerable though one temporal adverse event was observed
      in high dose.

      A open-labeled, multiple-dosing, crossover, parallel Clinical Study to Evaluate drug-drug
      interaction between fimasartan and hydrochlorothiazide.

      34 male healthy volunteers were enrolled during 2 months.

      In part A, 240 mg of fimasartan per day was taken for 1 week. After 7 day washout period, 240
      mg of fimasartan and 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day were taken for 1 week. Then blood
      and urine samples were collected 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours at 7 day
      and 21 day.

      In part B, 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day was taken for 1 week. After 7 day washout
      period, 240 mg of fimasartan and 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day were taken for 1 week.
      Then blood and urine samples were collected 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24
      hours at 7 day and 21 day.
