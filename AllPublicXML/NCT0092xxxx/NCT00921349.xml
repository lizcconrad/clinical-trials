    <textblock>
      The value of banding ligation plus beta blocker in the prophylaxis of first episodes of
      variceal bleeding has not yet been evaluated. This study was conducted to compare the
      efficacy and safety of banding ligation plus nadolol versus nadolol in the prophylaxis of
      first bleeding in cirrhotic patients with high-risk esophageal varices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) has replaced EIS as the endoscopic treatment of
      choice for management of bleeding esophageal varices. The advantages of EVL include requiring
      fewer treatment sessions to achieve variceal obliteration, lower rebleeding rates and fewer
      complications (5-9). Controlled studies that compared EVL with beta-blocker in the prevention
      of first variceal bleeding suggested that EVL was at least equal to beta-blockers in the
      prophylaxis of first variceal bleeding. However, portal pressure may be elevated after
      repeated EVL. Hence the combination of nadolol and EVL is a reasonable approach to prevent
      the first episode of variceal bleeding.
