      Sacral Nerve Stimulation (SNS) delivers non-painful, mild electrical pulses to the sacral
      nerves to modulate the reflexes that influence the bladder, sphincter, and pelvic floor to
      improve or restore normal voiding function. Sacral nerve stimulation is indicated for
      refractory voiding dysfunction including urinary urgency/frequency, urinary urge
      incontinence, and nonobstructive urinary retention. Since its introduction, SNS has undergone
      significant improvements in design and application so that implantation is now a minimally
      invasive procedure under local and intravenous (IV) sedation. However, despite the progress
      made in advancing this therapy to a minimally invasive procedure, there are neither data nor
      guidelines on ideal program settings. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      programming parameter of cyclic versus continuous stimulation on efficacy of the therapy. If
      the therapy is equally efficacious at both settings, the cyclic setting has the advantage of
      resulting in a longer battery life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The components of SNS include a quadripolar lead wire that is placed adjacent to a sacral
      nerve root (typically S3), and an implantable pulse generator (IPG) that the lead wire is
      attached to. The IPG provides the electrical impulse and has several parameters that are
      amenable to adjustment including rate, strength and length of stimulation. Additionally, the
      stimulation can be programmed to be continuous or cyclic. If the therapy is equally
      efficacious at both settings, the cyclic setting has the advantage of resulting in a longer
      battery life. This would prolong the time interval between IPG replacements which would
      reduce the number of times a patient is exposed to a surgical procedure and may have a
      substantial impact on reducing cost to the healthcare system.

      Participants will be randomized into one of two groups: either cyclic stimulation or
      continuous stimulation after IPG placement and will continue with this setting for four
      weeks. Subjects will return to the office 4 weeks post-op. They will complete a 3-day
      consecutive voiding diary just prior to their study visit. The subject will then undergo
      reprogramming to change the stimulation to the alternate pattern (from cyclic to continuous
      or vice versa as appropriate) keeping all other parameters the same. Subjects will be asked
      to return to the office 4 weeks after being switched to the alternate setting. She will
      complete a 3-day consecutive voiding diary just prior to the visit. The subject will also be
      asked their preference of mode of stimulation and the reason for their choice. After this
      visit, the participant will be switched to the mode of stimulation that is most efficacious
      for her.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  You are eligible to participate in this study if you have the diagnosis of
             urge/frequency or urge incontinence and have undergone a successful Interstim trial
             and are planning on proceeding with IPG placement.

          -  All subjects must have had a minimum of a 50% improvement of one or more of the
             parameters being measured on the voiding diary to be considered a candidate for
             implant.

          -  Eligibility criteria also include non-pregnant women over the age of 18 who are able
             to provide informed consent and are willing to accept randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:
