      This is a modified extension study to the SUmiT protocol UPC082008 (NCT00534521) to observe
      and evaluate long term therapy with PTNS on overactive bladder symptoms. Subjects must have
      completed the 12 weekly treatments of the original protocol, the 13 week follow up
      assessment, be randomized to the PTNS arm, and be considered a positive responder with
      moderate or marked improvement in the SUmiT Trial to be enrolled in this study. All
      consenting responders will continue with active PTNS therapy at an initially prescribed
      protocol for approximately 3 months followed by individualized symptom-based frequency of
      visits as determined by the subject along with their treating clinician, for up to a total of
      33 months post initial 12-week therapy for a total of 3 years.
