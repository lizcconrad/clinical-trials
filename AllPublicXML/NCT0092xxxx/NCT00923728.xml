      Background:

        -  AVN944 is an experimental cancer treatment drug, not yet approved by the U.S. Food and
           Drug Administration. To date, AVN944 as a single drug has been tested in several studies
           involving humans, including healthy volunteers, patients with leukemia, and patients
           with advanced pancreatic cancer.

        -  More research is needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of AVN944.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety of AVN944.

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (the highest dose that does not cause
           unacceptable side effects) of AVN944.

        -  To see if AVN944 has any effect on patients' tumors.

        -  To learn how the body breaks down AVN944.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients 18 years of age and older who have advanced stage solid tumors for which
           standard therapies do not exist or are no longer effective.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have a screening visit and five clinic visits during the first
           treatment cycle. Additional treatment cycles will involve two clinic visits during each
           28-day cycle. After participation in the study ends, patients will be asked to return
           within 28 days after the last dose of study drug for final study procedures.

        -  Evaluations before the treatment period:

        -  Physical examination, including vital signs and body weight checks, and pregnancy test
           for women who can become pregnant.

        -  Questions about medications and side effects.

        -  Blood and urine tests.

        -  Disease evaluation with CT, chest x-ray, and additional laboratory tests depending on
           the type of cancer.

        -  All patients will have blood samples taken at each visit.

        -  Patients will take specific doses of AVN994 as directed by researchers, and will be
           asked to keep a diary to record their doses and any side effects. They will be monitored
           with frequent blood draws at each study visit to provide information on the safety and
           effectiveness of the drug.

        -  During different cycles, patients will have their disease evaluated by researchers and
           will be asked if they wish to continue taking AVN994 as part of the study.

      Background:

        -  The rate limiting step in the synthesis of guanine nucleotides is catalyzed by the
           enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and so inhibition of this enzyme will
           result in depletion of guanine nucleotide pools, cessation of DNA synthesis, cell cycle
           block at the Gr(1)/S interface and interference with cell division.

        -  The reduction in guanine nucleotide pools interferes with the ability of G-coupled
           proteins to act as intracellular signal transducers. IMPDH inhibition.

        -  AVN944 is a small-molecule, uncompetitive inhibitor of cell proliferation.

        -  A Phase I study in patients with hematologic malignancies is active and accruing
           subjects. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) has not been reached and no pattern of
           organ-specific or dose-progressive toxicity has been observed.

      Objectives:

      Primary

        -  The dose limiting toxicities with AVN944 in patients with advanced stage solid tumors.

        -  The MTD with AVN944 in patients with advanced stage solid tumors.

      Secondary:

        -  Pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of AVN944 by study cohort.

        -  The extent of IMPDH inhibition on tumor tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
           (PBMC).

        -  The effect of AVN944 on tumors by measuring guanine nucleotide pools levels using
           PBMC's.

        -  The effect of AVN944 on tumors by analyzing expression of genes related to IMPDH.

      Eligibility:

        -  Inclusion:

             -  Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy.

             -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy and
                2 weeks since prior hormonal therapy.

             -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2.

             -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

             -  Age greater than or equal to 18.

        -  Exclusion:

             -  Patients with known active brain metastases or other CNS involvement.

             -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
                biologic.

             -  Prior treatment with an IMPDH-inhibitor.

             -  History of solid organ transplant and are on IMPDFI inhibitors therapy.

      Design:

        -  Phase I Trial using 3+3 trail design using starting cohort of 150 mg twice per day
           escalating to 750 mg twice per day.

        -  60 patients to be enrolled over 30-36 months.

        -  AVN944 will be administered in 28 day treatment cycles.

             immediately.

          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          9. Age greater than or equal to 18 Years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of AVN944 in patients less than 18 years of age,
             children are excluded from this study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients who are receiving concurrent investigational therapy or who have received
             investigational therapy within 14 days of the first scheduled day of dosing
             (investigational therapy is defined as treatment for which there is currently no
             regulatory authority approved indication). Clinically significant toxicities from this
             therapy must have resolved to less than Grade 2.

          2. Patients with known active brain metastases or other CNS involvement with less than 6
             months since curative-intent treatment

             within the past 7 days

          6. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AVN944 agent has the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             AVN944, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with AVN944.

          7. History of solid organ transplant and are on IMPDH inhibitors (mycophenolate mofetil)
             therapy
