  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if rosiglitazone, a medicine used to treat
      diabetes, improves response to anti-viral treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study will be to determine if an insulin sensitizing thiazolidinedione (TZD)
      improves (1) baseline viremia, (2) enhances viral kinetics, (3) improves cytokine profiles
      and (4) up regulates innate cellular immunity (presumably adaptive immunity is up regulated
      as well) as measured by the bioactivity of the collected biomarkers.
