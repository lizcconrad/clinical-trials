  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One thousand patients with LHD who have no history of exposure to lead will be observed for
      18 months. Blood lead level(BLL), biochemical data, hemoglobin, albumin, Cr, high sensitivity
      C-reactive protein (HsCRP), and blood cell counts are assessed at baseline. The morbidity and
      mortality are recorded in detail. Then, one hundred subjects with high BLL (&gt;20μg/dl) will be
      randomly assigned to the study and control groups. For 3-6 months, the 50 patients in the
      study group will receive lead-chelation therapy with calcium disodium EDTA weekly until the
      BLB falls below BLL&lt; 5 μg/dl, and the 50 control group patients receive weekly placebo for 12
      weeks. During the ensuing 18 months, the BLL, biochemical data will be regularly followed up
      every 3 months. BLL is measured every 6 months. If BLL of the study group patients increase
      &gt;10 μg/dl, the chelation therapy will be performed again until their BLL is &lt;5 μg/dl. The
      primary end point is morbidity or mortality during the observation and follow-up period. A
      secondary end point is the change in hemoglobin, albumin, Cr and Hs CRP during the follow up
      period.

    <description>Patients with lead poisoning (BLL&gt; 20μg/dl) are randomly assigned to a control or chelation group, on the 1:1 proportion. During the 3 months, 50 chelation group patients receive 2-hour weekly intravenous infusions of one vial (1 g) of calcium di-sodium EDTA mixed with 200 ml of normal saline until BLB is BLL &lt; 5 μg/dl. Fifty control patients receive weekly 2-hour infusions of one vial (20 ml) of 50% glucose mixed with 200 ml of normal saline over a period of 12 weeks9.</description>
