          <description>A seroconverted subject is a subject who had either a prevaccination titer &lt; 1:10 and a post-vaccination titer &gt;= 1:40 or a pre-vaccination titer &gt;= 1:10 and at least a four-fold increase in post-vaccination titer.
Data are displayed for each of the three influenza virus vaccine strains: A/Brisbane(H1N1); A/Uruguay(H3N2); B/Brisbane.</description>
