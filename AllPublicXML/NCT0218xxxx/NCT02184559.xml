    <textblock>
      The purpose of the multimodal postoperative analgesia is to improve the quality of analgesia
      and reduce side effects of morphine (nausea, vomiting, sedation, urinary retention,
      respiratory depression ...). In the case of caesarean sections, the quality of analgesia
      allows one hand to improve the mother-child relationship and the quality of breastfeeding,
      the other to reduce the risk of postpartum depression and chronic pain . Two methods of
      administration of local anesthetics have been proven effective for analgesia of the abdominal
      wall under umbilical: The Transversus Abdominal Block Plan (TAP Block) and infiltration of
      the scar continues operating. The TAP block was performed under ultrasound guidance by the
      anesthesiologist after the intervention in a single injection of local anesthetic in the
      abdominal wall and has a period of limited and variable. The infiltration continues catheter
      is placed by the surgeon before closing the wound and allows the infusion of local
      anesthetics for 48 hours.

      The purpose of this study was to compare morphine consumption between both techniques, and
      the quality of analgesia and side effects of morphine
