    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is:

      • To provide patients with LEMS/CMS/downbeat nystagmus access to amifampridine phosphate
      therapy until the product becomes commercially available.

      The secondary objective of the study is:

      • To assess the long-term safety of amifampridine phosphate in patients with
      LEMS/CMS/downbeat nystagmus

    <intervention_name>Amifampridine Phosphate</intervention_name>
    <description>Dosage form: tablets containing the equivalent of 10 mg amifampridine base per tablet.
Amifampridine Phosphate is taken with food and each patient is given an individualized dose based on Investigator assessment of optimal neuromuscular benefit. Doses range from 30 mg to 80 mg, divided into doses taken 3 to 4 times per day, with a maximum single dose of 20 mg.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female:

               -  2 years of age at 5 pediatric CMS study sites

               -  10 years of age at other study sites.

          -  Confirmed physician diagnosis of LEMS, CMS or downbeat nystagmus.

          -  Completion of anti-cancer treatment at least 3 months (90 days) before treatment.

          -  Negative urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential at Screening.

          -  If sexually active and of childbearing potential, willing to use 2 acceptable methods
             of contraception from screening visit until 3 months after the last dose of
             investigational product. No adequate clinical data on exposed pregnancies are
             available for amifampridine. No nonclinical safety data are available regarding the
             effects of amifampridine on reproductive function. Amifampridine phosphate should not
             be used during pregnancy. It is unknown whether amifampridine is excreted in human
             breast milk. The excretion of amifampridine in milk has not been studied in animals.
             Amifampridine phosphate should not be used during breastfeeding.

          -  Any subject currently participating in studies LMS-002, LMS-002EXT, or CMS 001 is
             immediately eligible for enrollment into study EAP-001, as long as inclusion/exclusion
             criteria are still met.

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent after the nature of the study has
             been explained and before the start of any research-related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of epilepsy.

          -  CMS subtypes including slow-channel syndrome, LRP4 deficiency, and
             acetylcholinesterase deficiency.

          -  Known active brain metastasis. Patients with treated brain metastasis (radiotherapy
             and/or surgery) who have completed treatment for their brain metastasis &gt;90 days
             before Screening, are neurologically stable (neurological symptoms grade &lt;1), are on a
             stable dose of corticosteroids and have no evidence of new disease on magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) are eligible, provided they meet the other inclusion/exclusion
             criteria.

          -  Current use of dalfampridine (Ampyra®; 4-aminopyridine), and any form of 3,4 DAP other
             than the investigational product provided, such as amifampridine base and does not
             agree to discontinue use for the duration of the study.

          -  Use of guanidine hydrochloride within 7 days of starting amifampridine phosphate
             treatment.

          -  History of drug allergy to any pyridine-containing substances or any amifampridine
             phosphate excipients (i.e. microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide or
             calcium stearate).

          -  Use of any other investigational product (other than 3,4 DAP or amifampridine
             phosphate) or investigational medical device within 30 days before starting treatment
             or requirement for any investigational agent before completion of all scheduled study
             assessments.

          -  An electrocardiogram (ECG) within 6 months before starting treatment that shows
             clinically significant abnormality(ies), in the opinion of the patient's personal
             physician.

          -  History of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g. history of surviving a
             near drowning due to loss of consciousness, family history of congenital QT syndrome,
             long QT syndrome, family history of unexplained early sudden death, or heart failure).

          -  Breastfeeding or pregnant or planning to become pregnant (self or partner). Male
             patients with breastfeeding partners are not excluded from the study.

          -  History of severe renal impairment or evidence of severe renal impairment at time of
             Screening on laboratory tests, specifically a creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min (within
             30 days) as calculated using the Cockcroft Gault formula.

          -  History at time of Screening of laboratory tests (within 30 days) indicating hepatic
             impairment:

             o In patients without liver metastases from cancer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
             aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and/or total bilirubin &gt;1.5 × upper limit of normal
             (ULN).

          -  Any condition that, in the view of the Principal Investigator, places the patient at
             high risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study.
