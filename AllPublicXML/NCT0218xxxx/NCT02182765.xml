  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to determine the effects of 28 days of nevirapine treatment on the steady-state
      pharmacokinetics of amprenavir and of abacavir and to further evaluate the pharmacokinetics
      of nevirapine in combination with amprenavir and abacavir compared to historical controls
      treated with nevirapine but without amprenavir or abacavir. In addition safety/tolerance of
      nevirapine, amprenavir and abacavir was to be assessed based on adverse events and clinical
      laboratory data.
