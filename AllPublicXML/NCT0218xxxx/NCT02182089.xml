  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal is to evaluate the predictive accuracy of a measure of autoregulatory
      adequacy derived from CVInsight and compare it with other measures in recognizing hypotensive
      events during hemodialysis..
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aims are as follows:

        1. Assess the accuracy of a new rule set for CVInsight® in predicting intradialytic
           hypotensive episodes.

        2. Assess the comparative predictive accuracy of CVInsight® to other measures with regard
           to intradialytic hypotensive events.

        3. Assess estimated dry weight goals by monitoring post-dialytic vascular refill using
           CVInsight® and other measures.

        4. Assess hemodialysis(HD)-induced myocardial injury by monitoring the occurrence and
           frequency of arrhythmias and the levels of cardiac Troponin T.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of intradialytic hypotensive (IDH) episodes that can be detected by the new rule set for CVInsight.</measure>
    <time_frame>3-4 hours, for two hemodialysis session, or 6-8 hours total</time_frame>
    <description>IDH defined by at least one of the following: 1) Symptoms of hypotension: dizziness, cramping, altered consciousness, nausea +/- vomiting (new since beginning of session), chest pain, shortness of breath, seizure, diaphoretic. 2) Intervention administered due to IDH; relevant interventions:a) a reduction in ultrafiltration (UF) goal programmed at start of treatment (tx); b) admin. of IV fluid, e.g. saline, mannitol or hypertonic saline; c) stopping tx early due to IDH symptoms or event. 3) A significant drop in blood pressure, regardless of symptoms, defined as:
For pts w/ a pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;110 mm Hg, an intra or post-dialysis SBP &lt;90 mm Hg, or a drop of &gt;40 mm Hg over 30 min.
For pts w/ a pre-dialysis SBP &lt;110, a decline in SBP &lt;85 mm Hg or 15 mm Hg or lower than their starting BP.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The comparative, predictive accuracy of CVInsight® and CRIT-LINE III with regard to intradialytic hypotensive events.</measure>
    <time_frame>3-4 hours, for two hemodialysis session, or 6-8 hours total</time_frame>
    <description>CVInsight® and CRIT-LINE III will have different predictive accuracies in recognizing IDH episodes.
Receiver Operator Characteristics analysis of CVInsight and CRIT-LINE
CVInsight: Event level thresholds will be triggered based upon new proprietary rule set.
CRIT-LINE: Change in hematocrit of 8% per hour or 15% over the treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Amount of post-dialytic vascular refill as separately indicated by both CVInsight® and CRIT-LINE III.</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of each dialysis session after the ultrafiltration rate (UFR) has turned off.</time_frame>
    <description>Post-dialytic vascular refill will indirectly reflect hydration status and accuracy of dry weight estimation. Vascular refill -Ten minutes prior to the end of treatment, with UFR at zero, and BFR at same rate as during treatment, measurements will continue to be taken via the CVInsight® and CRIT-LINE devices to assess vascular refill.
CVInsight: Increase in pulse amplitude.
CRIT-LINE: Increase of 0.5% increase in hematocrit (HCT) over 10 minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The occurrence and frequency of arrhythmias as indicated on the Zio ECG Patch and the levels of cardiac Troponin T, taken prior to each HD treatment. which are indicative HD-induced myocardial injury..</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours before first session of monitored dialysis to at least 24 hours after the second session on monitored dialysis sessions.</time_frame>
    <description>Arrhythmias frequency overall, on dialysis days, during long and short interdialytic periods, nocturnal, diurnal. Troponin T levels will correlate with the incidence rates of arrhythmias. Troponin T as measured by ng/mL, reference value at &lt;0.011</description>
