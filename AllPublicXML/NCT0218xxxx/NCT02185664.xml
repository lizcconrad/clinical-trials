  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannulation of the internal jugular vein (IJV) for central venous access is a standard
      practice in cardiac surgery. In this study, the authors tested the hypothesis that using an
      ultrasound (US) scanner would increase the success of IJV cannulation and decrease the
      incidence of complications in adult cardiac surgical patients.

      The study will include adult cardiac surgical patients, randomized into two groups (control
      vs. US). In the control group, IJV cannulation will be performed by the conventional landmark
      technique using Seldinger method. In the US group, the course of the IJV will be marked
      before cannulation using a 2 - 4 MHz transthoracic echocardiography probe. The success rate,
      number of attempts, cannulation time and complication rate will be compared for the two
      groups.

      Use of real time ultrasound has recently been recommended as the standard of care for
      insertion of central venous catheters. However, its usage is limited by various factors which
      include availability, space constraints and perceived lack of need according to surveys
      including cardiovascular anesthesiologists. We will conduct a prospective randomized
      controlled trial to compare the conventional landmark technique with the static ultrasound
      (US) technique that utilized the transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) ultrasound probe which
      is supplied along with the transesophageal echocardiography machines for internal jugular
      vein cannulation in adult cardiac surgical patients.

      After ethical committee approval and patient consent, adult patients scheduled for elective
      cardiac surgery will be randomized to undergo internal jugular vein cannulation by either of
      the two methods: standard landmark technique (group A: control group), static US technique
      using the TTE probe (group B: ultrasound group). The success rate, number of attempts, total
      cannulation time and complication rate in the two groups will be compared.
