  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a cruel disease that disproportionately kills and disables African-Americans,
      Latinos, Chinese-Americans and Korean-Americans; seniors with high blood pressure are at
      particularly high risk. There is a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in African
      Americans, Latinos, and Chinese Americans relative to non-Latino whites. Asian-Americans have
      up to 1.4 higher relative risk of stroke death compared to U.S. non-Latino whites. A critical
      need therefore exists for a sustainable and scalable mechanism to disseminate
      culturally-tailored stroke knowledge/prevention education in community-based settings where
      large numbers of these high-risk ethnic minority older adult groups are regularly served,
      such as in federally funded Multipurpose Senior Centers (MPCs) that exist across the nation
      (16 of which are in Los Angeles alone).

      The overall objective of the proposed study is to develop and test the implementation of a
      training program for case managers at senior centers to implement a stoke
      knowledge/prevention education program among four high-risk ethnic minority older adult
      groups--Korean-American, Chinese-American, African-American, Latinos. We propose to develop a
      culturally-tailored case manager training curriculum, implement the training at 4
      community-based sites, and evaluate the training model using a randomized wait-list
      controlled trial (n=244) testing the hypothesis that training case managers will decrease
      older adult participants' stroke risk in a sustainable fashion through increasing their
      preventative behavior (i.e. increasing their physical activity--mean steps/day--at 1 and 3
      months).

      Findings will inform similar community-academic partnership efforts around stroke and other
      disease-specific prevention research/interventions; they will also determine next steps in
      terms of whether this case manager-centric model can be scaled up and deployed in other
      community-based settings.

      As many as 30% of ischemic strokes in the U.S. population can be attributed to physical
      inactivity. With the goal of eliminating racial/ethnic stroke disparities, this
      interdisciplinary team proposes to develop, implement, and test a culturally-tailored
      behavioral intervention to reduce stroke risk (primary prevention) by increasing physical
      activity (walking) for 4 different racial/ethnic groups (Korean-Americans, Chinese-Americans,
      African-Americans and Latinos) in Los Angeles community senior centers. The intervention
      combines stroke and stroke risk factor knowledge (using materials developed by the American
      Heart Association and American Stroke Association) with theoretically-grounded behavioral
      change techniques and focuses on reducing stroke risk by increasing physical activity
      (walking). The study team will conduct focus groups (n=144) to identify culture-specific
      beliefs about stroke and stroke risk factors, to assess the feasibility and acceptability of
      the intervention, and will work with Community Action Panels to culturally-tailor the
      intervention. The intervention will consist of 4 weeks of twice-weekly 1-hour group sessions
      implemented at 4 community senior centers by trained case managers who are part of the
      regular senior center staff and supported by congressionally-mandated Older Americans Act
      Title III funding. The project team will test the effectiveness of the intervention in a
      randomized wait-list controlled trial (n=240) testing the hypothesis that the intervention
      will increase mean steps/day (measured by pedometer) at 1 and 3 months, and that the increase
      will be mediated by changes in stroke/stroke risk knowledge and self-efficacy. Blood pressure
      will be examined as a secondary outcome. In collaboration with the SPIRP Biomarker Collection
      &amp; Analysis Core, the team will collect biological specimens (finger pricks) to explore the
      relationship between the intervention and biological markers of health; they will also
      explore the relationship between the intervention and healthcare seeking or taking
      medications to control stroke risk factors. The team will evaluate the barriers and
      facilitators of successfully integrating the intervention into the senior centers in order to
      inform large-scale implementation of the culturally-tailored stroke risk factor
      reduction/walking intervention.
