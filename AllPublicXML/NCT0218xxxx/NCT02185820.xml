      TREATMENT PERIOD Patients will start the salvage treatment with CPd, as soon as the screening
      visits of the pre-treatment period have been terminated. Patients will receive 8 CPd cycles.

      PHASE I

      In the phase I part of the study, the following dose levels of pomalidomide will be studied
      with a constant dose of dexamethasone and carfilzomib:

      Level -1 Carfilzomib = 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1 of cycle 1 only followed by 27 mg/m2
      days 8, 15 in cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 27 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1, 8, 15
      followed by 13-day rest period (day 16 through 28).

      Pomalidomide = 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 every 28 days. Dexamethasone = 20 mg on days 1, 8,
      15, 22 every 28 days. Level 0 (starting dose) Carfilzomib = 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1
      of cycle 1 only followed by 36 mg/m2 days 8, 15 in cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 36
      mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1, 8, 15 followed by 13-day rest period (day 16 through 28).

      Pomalidomide = 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 every 28 days. Dexamethasone = 20 mg on days 1, 8,
      15, 22 every 28 days. Level +1 Carfilzomib = 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1 of cycle 1 only
      followed by 45 mg/ m2 days 8, 15 in cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 45 mg/m2 IV once
      daily on days 1, 8, 15 followed by 13-day rest period (day 16 through 28).

      Pomalidomide = 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 every 28 days. Dexamethasone = 20 mg on days 1, 8,
      15, 22 every 28 days. Level +2 Carfilzomib = 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1 of cycle 1 only
      followed by 56 mg/m2 days 8, 15 in cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 56 mg/m2 IV once
      daily on days 1, 8, 15 followed by 13-day rest period (day 16 through 28).

      Pomalidomide = 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 every 28 days. Dexamethasone = 20 mg on days 1, 8,
      15, 22 every 28 days. Patients will be observed during the first cycle of therapy for the
      assessment of side effects and observation of DLTs.

      Dose escalation will proceed as follows:

      3 patients will be entered at dose level 0. If none of the 3 experience DLT, dose escalation
      will continue. If one of three patients experience DLT, three additional patients will be
      added to this cohort (max 6).

      If two of three patients experience a DLT at any given dose, the MTD will have been exceeded
      and the MTD will be the preceding dose at which &lt; one of 6 patients experienced a DLT.

      If no further patients experience DLT (1 of 6) dose escalation will continue. If 2 patients
      experience DLT (2 of 6) the MTD will have been exceeded and the MTD will be the previous dose
      at which &lt;1 patient of 6 experienced DLT.

      The phase I of the study will end once the MTD has been defined.

      PHASE II The phase II of the study will start after the MTD has been defined in the phase I
      of the study. The dose used to treat patients in the phase II will be the MTD defined in the
      phase I of the study.

      In the second part of the study, the MTD of the association CPd (or in absence of any MTD
      observed) the doses of dose level 3 (maximum per protocol dose) will be administered to a
      total of 45 consecutive patients in order to assess response rate and clinical efficacy.

      THE PHASE 2 OF THE STUDY WILL START ONLY AFTER THE ANALYSIS OF THE PHASE 1 RESULTS AND THE
      RELEVANT STUDY REPORT.

      MANTEINANCE PERIOD

      At the end of 8 courses, maintenance phase will start. Patients will receive:

      Carfilzomib = at the MTD achieved in the phase I of the study on days 1, 8, 15 in 28-days
      cycles.

      Pomalidomide = 4 mg daily on days 1 - 21 every 28 days. Dexamethasone = 20 mg on days 1, 8,
      15, 22. Patients will be stopped at PD or intolerance. For the maintenance period a
      continuous assessment of the toxicity and tolerability profile of the CPd combination could
      permit to the Investigators to continue the treatment using Pomalidomide or Carfilzomib alone
      according to the dose modification plan.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Age &gt; 18 years. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2. Patient
        is, in the investigator(s) opinion, willing and able to comply with the protocol
        requirements.

        Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any
        study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that
        consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future
        medical care.

        Female patient is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an
        acceptable method of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device,
        diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the
        study.

        Male patient agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception (i.e., condom or
        abstinence) for the duration of the study.

        Patients who are primary refractory or relapsed/refractory to Lenalidomide. Subjects must
        have been received at least 2 consecutive cycles of a prior treatment that include
        Lenalidomide alone or in combination.

        Subject must be primary refractory or relapsed/refractory to Lenalidomide, defined as: 1)
        never achieved any response better than progressive disease (PD) to any
        Lenalidomide-containing regimen; 2) documented disease progression during or within 60 days
        of completing their last myeloma Lenalidomide-containing regimen.

        Both relapsed and/or refractory to Bortezomib and naive to Bortezomib patients can be
        enrolled.

        consent.

        Nonhematologic malignancy within the past 3 years with the exception of a) adequately
        treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell skin cancer, or thyroid cancer; b) carcinoma in
        situ of the cervix or breast; c) prostate cancer of Gleason Grade 6 or less with stable
        prostate-specific antigen levels; or d) cancer considered cured by surgical resection or
        unlikely to impact survival during the duration of the study, such as localized
