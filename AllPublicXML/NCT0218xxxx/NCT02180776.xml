      The objective of this study is to evaluate clinical effectiveness and the effect on quality
      of life of an inelastic thoracolumbarasacral orthosis in male and female hyperkyphotic
      patients with moderate to severe back pain disability and to demonstrate the safety of the
      intervention through detailed reporting and analysis of adverse events.
