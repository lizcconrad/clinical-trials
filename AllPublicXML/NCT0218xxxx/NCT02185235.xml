  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Female pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) include urinary incontinence,pelvic organ prolapse
      (POP), and fecal incontinence—which often occur together.

      Pelvic floor disorders impair multiple aspects of the life quality, including the sexual
      function of women.

      Surgery became the first choice of treatment, however, and not until 1980s was the renewed
      interest in conservative therapies.

      This may be because of higher awareness among women and cost of and morbidity after surgery.

      The conservative treatment included pelvic floor muscle training, electrical stimulation,
      vaginal cones, and biofeedback.

      The outcome was up to 35~70 % improved rate as the literature before. Current guidelines
      recommended conservative management as a first-line therapy. However, there was no consistent
      consensus on this issue due to variations in stimulation parameters、adjuvant concurrent
      modality or duration of treatment course, and insufficient result about large and long term
      follow up of randomized- controlled studies.

      Therefore, the investigators try to conduct one randomized-controlled trial to evaluate the
      efficacy of conservative treatment for Pelvic floor disorder (Pelvic organ prolapse, urinary
      incontinence, chronic pelvic pain etc.).

      At the aspect of Quality of life, our studies tried to focus on the different domains of
      pelvic disorder and sexual quality by means of validated questionnaire more objectively.

    <description>A pad test is a tool to used to measure urine leakage amount . Pad testing can be done over a period of time to one hour.
A sanitary napkin is weighed and then worn for sixty minutes, during which time the individual is asked to perform certain activities which may include:
Walking briskly for three minutes
Sitting and then standing ten to twenty times
Walking up and down stairs for one to two minutes
Picking up objects from the floor five to ten times
Coughing twelve times (at various strengths; may be repeated)
Running in place for one minute (may be repeated) The pad is then removed and weighed again to calculate the amount of urine voided.</description>
