  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gender identity disorders (also known as transsexualism) is defined as a condition in which a
      person with apparently normal somatic sexual differentiation is convinced that he or she is
      actually a member of the other sex. Most patients therefore undergo so called cross-sex
      hormone treatment. Treatment protocols follow international consensus statements but vary
      considerably between different centres and countries since no prospective and controlled
      trials are available on this subject and recommendations are mainly based on retrospective
      data analysis and experience of the individual centres. Applying high doses of testosterone
      to biological females and vice versa high doses of estradiol to biological males definitely
      impacts myriads of body functions, from which it has to be assumed that only a minority has
      already been elucidated so far. Especially in male-to-female-transsexuals there seems to be
      an increased risk for the development of mood disorders and cardiometabolic comorbidities. In
      this multi-center observational study we want to investigate, if there is any difference with
      regard to these outcomes, according to the varying standards of cross-sex hormone treatment
      between the different centers. Different outcome measures described below will be assessed
      each time during routine visits at the different centers.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of depressive and anxious symptoms following initiation of cross-sex hormone treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of depressive and anxious symptoms by means of clinical interview and questionnaires in the the study period defined by different cut-off points in the point scales of the corresponding questionnaire (Beck Depression Inventory II = BDII and Symptomcheckliste bei psychischen Störungen = SCL90 for depression and State and Trait Anxiety Inventory = STAI-X1, X2 for anxiety). A comparison will then be done between the different treatment modes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in the effects of the different treatment types on cardiometabolic parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Differences in the effects of the different treatment types (differing in dose, application route and type of antiandrogen used) on cardiometabolic risk-parameters such as BMI, body-composition, fasting Insulin, fasting glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, intima media thickness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effects of cross-sex hormone treatment on cortisol secretion by hair cortisol measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of cortisol secretion by a hair sample which provides information about the mean cortisol secretion during the last months. One cm of scalp hair resembles approximately 1 month of growth. This may provide additional information concerning overall cortisol secretion during the last 3 months. One small hair will be sampled by scalp and this will be analysed in regard to psychological and metabolic profiles.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effects of cross-sex hormone treatment on stress-response by means of Dex/CRH-testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Dex/CRH-Test has been in use for several years for testing the physiological cortisol-response in psychiatric and neurologic patients and is performed on a routine basis in the Max-Planck Institute for Psychiatry in patients suffering from depressive disorders. It is assumed that regulation of cortisol secretion and responsiveness of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis is pathophysiologically related to depression. The test has been proven to be save. Common transient side-effects include flushing, palpitation, tachypnoea and feeling of warmth which usually resolve within minutes without further intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Genetic predictors for treatment response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Predictive value of different polymorphism in genes such as the ERa, ERb and AR (Androgen Receptor), GR (Glucocorticoid-Receptor) or genes involved in steroid metabolism and function on metabolic profiles, breast development and psychiatric outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effects of cross-sex hormone treatment on the metabolome</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Differences in plasma and urine metabolome in plasma such as amino acids; carbohydrates and related; catecholamines and related; complex lipids and related; energy metabolism and organic acids; fatty acids (free and from lipids); purines, pyrimidines and related; steroids and related; vitamins, cofactors and related.</description>

    <description>The following interviews will be used:

personality (EPQ, TPQ,NEO-FFI)

Depressive symptoms (BDI II)
Psychopathology in general (SCL-90)

The other questionnaires will be used for multidimensional modelling.</description>
