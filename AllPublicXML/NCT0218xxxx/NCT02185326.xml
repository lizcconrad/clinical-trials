      The effect of use of the microflare down regulation protocol on the outcome of the IVF/ICSI
      cycles in poor responders
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The microflare as a method of down regulation protocol can be used to prepare the females
      suffering from poor ovarian reserve to undergo IVF/ICSI cycles. In this study we are trying
      to outline its effect on the clinical pregnancy rate as a main primary outcome, and to
      compare its use with the addition of growth hormone to the same protocol.

    <description>the patients in this group were given oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for 28 days, this was followed by 2 days free. Triptorelin (Decapeptyl Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Germany) 0.05 mg/day S.C. was then started daily followed by human menopausal gonadotropin IM daily (HMG 75 IU, Merional, IBSA) 3 days later. Growth hormone (Norditropin, Novo nordisk) was administrated on day 6 of HMG stimulation daily in a dose of 2.5 mg S.C. till the day of hCG administration.</description>
