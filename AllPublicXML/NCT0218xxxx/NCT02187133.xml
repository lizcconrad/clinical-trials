    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as a Phase Ib, open-label, non-randomized, single-institution
      study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of carfilzomib in combination with bendamustine
      and rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL and to determine the recommended
      phase II dose and preliminary efficacy of this combination. The study will have two phases: a
      dose-escalation phase to determine the maximal tolerated dose of carfilzomib in this
      combination where participants will be monitored for toxicity, tolerability and response and
      a dose-expansion phase that will determine the preliminary efficacy in patients with Mantle
      cell lymphoma or any other disease subtype in which there is a preliminary efficacy signal
      observed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of carfilzomib when combined with bendamustine
      (bendamustine hydrochloride) and rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of carfilzomib with bendamustine and
      rituximab in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (dose escalation) and with specific
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes (dose expansion).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carfilzomib.

      Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes twice weekly on days 1, 2, 8,
      9, 15, and 16 or weekly on days 2, 9, and 16; bendamustine hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes
      on days 1 and 2; and rituximab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 9 (course 1 only) and day 1
      (subsequent courses). Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks for 6 months,
      every 3 months for 6 months, and then every 6 months thereafter.
