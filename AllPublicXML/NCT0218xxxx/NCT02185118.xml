  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a major cause of death in intensive care units. Despite the investigators improved
      understanding, which has reduced the risk of dying with sepsis, the number of people who die
      each year continues to increase due to an overall increase in the number of cases.In our
      previous study, the investigators have showed that 100% oxygen or 0.5 minimum alveolar
      concentration (MAC) isoflurane/sevoflurane in 60% oxygen protect mouse macrophage cell line
      against in-vitro sepsis induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

      In this study, the investigator hypothesized that treatment of 100% oxygen or 0.5 MAC
      isoflurane/sevoflurane in 60% oxygen protected against clinical in-vitro models of sepsis
      induced by LPS or plasma from septic patients.

      100% oxygen or 0.5 MAC isoflurane/sevoflurane in 60% oxygen would inhibit increases of tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6 in the cell culture supernatant
      after stimulation of LPS or plasma from septic patients, and also inhibit the nuclear
      location of nuclear factor-kappa B p65 subunit.
