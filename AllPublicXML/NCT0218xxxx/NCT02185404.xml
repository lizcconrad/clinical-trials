      The objective of this research is to test a passive shoe capable of to test the capability of
      a mobile shoe to enhance gait improvements in individuals with asymmetric walking patterns.
      Individuals with central nervous system damage, such as stroke, often have irregular walking
      patterns and have difficulty walking correctly. Recent research has shown that using a
      split-belt treadmill can create after-effects that temporarily correct the inefficient
      walking patterns. However, the corrected walking pattern does not efficiently transfer from
      the treadmill to walking over ground. The Gait Enhancing Mobile Shoe (GEMS) may allow a
      patient to practice walking in many different locations, such as their own home, which we
      hypothesize will result in a more permanent transfer of learned gait patterns. To enable
      long-term use, our proposed shoe design is passive and uses the wearer's natural forces
      exerted while walking to generate the necessary motions.

      Hemiparesis and other impairments are a frequent and disabling consequence of stroke and can
      lead to asymmetric and inefficient walking patterns. Training on a split-belt treadmill,
      which has two separate treads driving each leg at a different speed, can correct gait
      asymmetries post-stroke (Reisman et al. 2005, Reisman et al. 2007). However, the effects of
      split-belt treadmill training only partially transfer to everyday walking over ground and
      extended training sessions are required to achieve long-lasting effects (Reisman et al.
      2009). Our previous studies suggest that the Gait Enhancing Mobile Shoe (GEMS) that has been
      developed in our laboratory can be used as an alternative gait training device for people
      with stroke (Handzic, Reed, and colleagues 2011, 2011, 2012, 2013). The GEMS mimics the
      actions of the split-belt treadmill, but can be used during over-ground walking and in one's
      own home, thus enabling long-term training. This GEMS does not require any external power and
      is completely passive; all necessary forces are redirected from the natural forces present
      during walking since it utilizes the wearer's weight to generate its movements. While the
      movements of the GEMS are similar to the split belt treadmill, and the GEMS generates a
      similar aftereffect, the efficacy of this shoe in modifying the gait of an individual with
      stroke is not yet verified. This research aims to test the GEMS on individuals with stroke to
      determine if the related effects that show up on healthy subjects can benefit individuals
      with stroke.

      In this study, we will test the efficacy of the GEMS on individuals with stroke. Efficacy
      will be evaluated based on the change in gait coordination and also based on subjects'
      self-reported comfort on the device. We predict that the GEMS will result in changes to
      interlimb coordination of gait. Note that this is a efficacy study, not an effectiveness or
      safety study of the device; this distinction is made clear in a paper by Singal et al.
      (2014).

      The asymmetric nature of hemiparetic gait can have a large impact on functional walking
      ability. For example, swing phase asymmetry is a significant predictor of hemiparetic walking
      performance because it strongly correlates with stages of motor recovery, walking speed, and
      falls (Brandstater et al. 1983; Titianova and Tarkka 1995). Another measure of temporal
      asymmetry - double support duration - is similarly correlated with walking speed (Olney et
      al. 1994). In addition, spatial (e.g. step length) asymmetry is associated with decreased
      propulsive force on the paretic leg (Balasubramanian et al. 2007; Bowden et al. 2006), which
      limits forward motion of the body and reduces gait efficiency (Brouwer et al. 2009; Kahn and
      Hornby 2009). The importance of gait efficiency should not be understated - the elevated
      energy demands of hemiparetic gait combined with physical deconditioning post-stroke can
      greatly limit performance of activities of daily living, contributing to poor cardiovascular
      fitness and metabolic syndrome. In turn, this can increase the risks of a second stroke or
      cardiovascular event and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates (Ivey et
      al., 2005). Therefore, improving gait symmetry should be an important goal for therapy, to
      not only improve functional mobility and reduce injury, but also to enhance general health
      and well-being post-stroke.

      Practicing walking on a split-belt treadmill can correct abnormal interlimb coordination of
      gait in individuals with hemiparesis following stroke or other central nervous system lesions
      (Reisman et al. 2005, Reisman et al. 2007). Asymmetric gait can manifest as a spatial
      asymmetry, in which steps taken on one side are longer than those on the other. It can also
      manifest as a temporal asymmetry, where the timing is uneven on the paretic and non-paretic
      sides. Temporal asymmetries are often measured as differences in the duration of double
      support periods, which are the amount of time both feet are simultaneously contacting the
      ground and are measured separately for the paretic and non-paretic sides. The GEMS is
      designed to cause changes in both spatial and temporal gait symmetry. We predict that the
      GEMS would cause the steps on the side with the GEMS to be larger since individuals would
      compensate for the backward rolling motion by placing their foot farther forward in stance,
      thus increasing the distance between the two feet. Similarly, since the stride is longer, it
      may also shorten the duration of stance relative to the other side. With shortened stance
      duration, the amount of time spent in double-support at the end of stance would likely
      decrease as well. An alternative is to have a GEMS that moves the foot forward, which would
      have the opposite effect, shortening steps and lengthening double-support durations of the
      foot that it is placed on. Therefore, the same effect could be obtained by using a
      backward-moving GEMS on the healthy-side foot as would be obtained using a forward-moving
      GEMS on the paretic-side foot. In this study, we will focus on the backward moving GEMS.

      Although the original idea of the GEMS is derived from the motion of the
      split-belt-treadmill, there are distinct differences between walking on the GEMS and walking
      on a split-belt treadmill with asymmetric belt velocities (Handzic and Reed, 2013). While the
      body's velocity relative to ground is zero on a split-belt treadmill, the relative velocity
      of the GEMS is non-zero and forward. The GEMS forces the wearer's foot forward or backward
      whereas the treadmill moves both feet backward, but at different speeds. For both the
      split-belt treadmill and the GEMS, the relative velocity between both feet is similar and the
      backward-moving GEMS takes the place of the faster tread. Our short-term study will examine
      how the motion of the shoe affects the change in gait.

      We hypothesize that training over ground will lead to a change in the interlimb coordination
      in individuals with asymmetric gait and allow individuals to develop a more persistent
      symmetric gait. There are several differences between training on ground and a treadmill,
      such as visual flow and vestibular information signaling forward movement that likely limit
      the expression of learning in the over-ground context when trained on a treadmill. Visual
      cues appear to be particularly important for context awareness (Keamey, 2003). Visual cues,
      coupled with prior experience, are so powerful that predictive postural responses cause an
      individual to stumble when stepping onto an escalator that is not moving (Reynolds and
      Bronstein 2003; Bronstein et al. 2009). The body has learned an internal model that expects
      an acceleration when stepping onto an escalator, but when that acceleration does not occur,
      the person stumbles. A recent study of split-belt walking showed that transfer to over-ground
      walking is enhanced when subjects are blindfolded during training on the treadmill and tested
      over ground (Torres-Oviedo and Bastian, 2010). Since blindfolding eliminates visual cues
      about the environment, this also suggests that vision is a key factor in determining the
      context-dependence of learning. Since it is not realistic to blindfold stroke patients during
      gait training, we designed the GEMS so that training could occur during over-ground walking,
      thus visual cues during training and later walking over ground would be the same.

      Data from control subjects using an earlier version of the GEMS has been published (Handzic
      et al. 2011) and a video of this previous version can be found at
      http://reedlab.eng.usf.edu/publications/handzic2011GEMS.mp4. In this study, we found that
      this earlier version of the GEMS was capable of changing step length as predicted, however
      the previous design was too heavy and too tall to be considered practical for testing in
      stroke populations. The current version of the GEMS produces similar motion to the previous
      version, but it weighs less (~1 kg) and is shorter (~4.4 cm). We will test the efficacy of
      wearing the current GEMS on gait coordination during walking over ground on individuals with
      stroke. All walking will be performed while subjects are wearing a gait belt and are closely
      guarded by an experienced physical therapist to prevent falling. Subjects may wear a safety
      harness attached to the SOLO-STEP® System (Solo-Step, Sioux Falls, SD ) if necessary. The
      effects of the GEMS on gait coordination will be compared to those induced on a split-belt
      treadmill.

      The proposed project represents one of the first attempts to build a device that corrects
      walking symmetry while walking over ground. Not only would this allow people to experience
      gait corrections while performing normal movements, but the simplicity and relative low cost
      of these devices would also open up potential opportunities to train at home (for
      high-functioning individuals with supervision) and in clinics where a split-belt treadmill is
      not available. The studies outlined here will establish whether the GEMS is capable of
      changing interlimb coordination of gait, and whether individuals with stroke can use these
      devices for rehabilitation purposes. This work will thus build the foundation for future
      training studies examining the effectiveness of long-term use of the GEMS for improving
      symmetric walking patterns.

      The question that this study targets is the modification of human walking patterns for use in
      stroke rehabilitation. It is our ultimate objective to show that the GEMS can change a
      person's temporal and spatial gait asymmetry into a symmetric gait. Our points of reference
      are results obtained by previous studies with split-belt treadmills. We are also interested
      in how altering the interface between a foot and the ground influences the adaptation to new
      walking patterns.

    <description>During a symmetric gait, step lengths on each side are the same; during an asymmetric gait, step lengths are different. We will quantify the amount of adaptation and the change in gait asymmetry by comparing the magnitude of step length differences during baseline, at the beginning of training, during training, and after training. Step length asymmetry is a standard accepted measure for measuring gait asymmetry. To measure the gait, a ProtoKinetics Zeno Walkway (ProtoKinetics, Havertown, PA) or a motion capture system will be used. The analysis will be conducted using a repeated measures ANOVA to compare baseline gait symmetry at the start of the experiment to post-adaptation at the end of the experiment and on the 1 and 3 month follow-ups.</description>

    <description>The long-term training will consist of four weeks of training with three training sessions performed each week. The training sessions will consist of up to forty minutes of training over up to eight shorter sessions of walking on the GEMS with breaks between walking sessions and as needed if the subject requests an additional break. Subjects will place the GEMS on their foot in which they have the shortest step length, as measured during the pre-training gait analysis. This is typically the healthy side foot. For split-belt treadmill sessions, the format will be exactly the same, but they will walk on a split-belt treadmill instead of the GEMS with the faster tread moving on the same foot that would wear the GEMS in the over-ground walking sessions.</description>
