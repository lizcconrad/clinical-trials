    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether an improvement in aerobic fitness, as
      judged by an increase in VO2peak, can be achieved within 31 days via HIT programme in a group
      of older, colorectal cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      12 high intensity interval training exercise sessions on a static cycle ergometer, over a
      period of 31 days. Each session lasts 18 minutes.

      At the beginning and end of the study the following measures will be used to assess change in
      fitness, body composition and muscle metabolism. DXA scan, USS of thigh, VO2 peak cycling
      test, short performance battery tests, quality of life questionnaires and muscle biopsy.
