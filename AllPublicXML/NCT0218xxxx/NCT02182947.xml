      Most of the studies evaluating the roles of MRE and WCE conducted in pediatric patients have
      been retrospective with the main goal of making a diagnosis in patients with suspected IBD.
      The current study is the first prospective study in children with known IBD assessing the
      roles of MRE and WCE in identifying disease exacerbation. This study will help to identify if
      capsule endoscopy is superior or complementary to MRE in the evaluation of suspected disease
      exacerbation in IBD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is growing concern with recurrent radiation exposure particularly from routine
      radiologic modalities in children, this is especially relevant in pediatric Crohn's Disease
      in so far as CT entercolysis abdomen and small bowel series are often seen as complementary.
      Although small bowel series is accepted as a routine diagnostic modality in pediatric IBD if
      fluoroscopy time is kept to a minimum, its limitations are well defined and are especially
      relevant in the early stages of IBD wherein fistulising, stricturing disease is less common.
      Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) has a diagnostic effectiveness comparable to other
      radiological modalities for evaluation of adult patients with CD, but without radiation
      exposure. However it is limited by expense, the availability of the requisite equipment and
      software, need for sedation in pediatric population, limited expertise in accurate
      interpretation especially in early lesions such as are more common in pediatric IBD, and
      overall insensitivity to early mucosal lesions including vascular abnormalities.

      Alternative modalities for small bowel imaging are being studied and include the routine use
      of wireless-video capsule endoscopy (WCE) which allows visualization of the small-bowel
      mucosal lesions in Crohn's disease. Because the risk for capsule retention in suspected or
      established Crohn's disease is significantly increased; in some series up to 13%; pre WCE
      small bowel imaging or patency capsule has become standard of care.

      The main indications for WCE in Crohn's disease are to establish the diagnosis, to assess
      disease prognosis, disease activity, and mucosal healing post therapy, and to define the
      extent and severity of disease A small, prospective study of 27 patients suspected to have
      Crohn's disease, revealed a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 84% for the WCE examination
      compared to surgical and enteroscopic tissue samples, and demonstrated a significant change
      in their management Another prospective randomized blinded study adults (N = 21) reported the
      sensitivity and specificity of CD in terminal ileum were 100% and 91% by WCE. Jensen
      suggested WCE as first line modality for detection of small bowel CD beyond the reach of
      colonoscopy. In adults with known CD, Karoui et al evaluated WCE in a prospective study (N =
      20) comparing it to radiological techniques and concluded that WCE is more accurate in
      detection of small bowel lesions in CD.
