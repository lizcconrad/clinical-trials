  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to investigate the effect of chloride dosing on the development
      of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients. The investigators hypothesis is that
      administering intravenous fluids with higher chloride content are more likely to lead to
      acute kidney injury.

      Retrospective chart review from 2008-2012 evaluating chloride dosing and serum chloride
      levels and their effects on acute kidney injury in the pediatric ICU. Patients will be
      included for the first seven days of their PICU stay.
