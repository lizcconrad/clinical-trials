  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is the greatest risk factor for upper aerodigestive cancers (thoracic or head and
      neck) and negatively impacts survival and other outcomes, but many patients have difficulty
      quitting after their diagnosis. Smoking cessation interventions for cancer patients thus far
      have had limited success. This is a pilot randomized controlled trial designed to determine
      if a new comprehensive, evidence-based smoking cessation intervention can improve quit rates
      for cancer patients who smoke.
