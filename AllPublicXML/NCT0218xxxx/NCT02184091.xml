      Study to assess the effects of varying degrees of renal dysfunction and hepatic insufficiency
      on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of nevirapine and nevirapine metabolites in order to
      establish an appropriate dose and/or dosing frequency for renally- and hepatically-impaired

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients of any race between the ages of 18 and 75 years with weight
             within 30% of normal for gender, height and frame as specified by the Metropolitan
             Life Insurance Table

          -  For patients in the renal group: stable creatinine clearance based on two estimations
             taken at least 3 days apart, corresponding to one of four groups:

               -  Group 1 (mild dysfunction) = 50 ml/min &lt;= Creatinine Clearance (CLcr) &lt; 80 ml/min

               -  Group 2 (moderate dysfunction) = 30 ml/min &lt;= CLcr &lt; 50 ml/min

               -  Group 3 (severe dysfunction) = CLcr &lt; 30 ml/min and

               -  Group 4 = end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis

          -  For patients in the hepatic group

               -  Two baseline creatinine clearances (taken at least 3 days apart) &gt; 80 ml/min

               -  clinically diagnosed with hepatic insufficiency and Class A or B liver disease
                  according to Child-Pugh's Classification; subjects must have a Child-Pugh score
                  of 5-9 points

          -  For patients in the normal group, i.e. normal with respect to hepatic and renal
             function

               -  matched with hepatic group regarding gender, age (+- 10 years), weight (+- 30
                  pounds) and smoking history

               -  Two baseline creatinine clearances (taken at least 3 days apart) &gt; 80 ml/min

               -  No abnormalities on clinical or laboratory evaluations

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use a reliable form of
             contraception which must include a medically approved form of barrier contraception

          -  Patients who are able to provide written consent and comply with study requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  Seated systolic blood pressure either &lt; 100 mmHg or &gt; 150 mmHg and/or heart rate
             either &lt; 50 beats/min or &gt; 90 beats/min

          -  History of any illness or drug allergy that in the opinion of the investigator might
             confound the results of the study or pose additional risk in administering nevirapine
             to the subject

          -  Patients who have had an acute illness or hospitalization other than for routine
             dialysis within 2 weeks prior to study initiation

          -  Patients who are currently taking any over-the-counter drug within 3 days prior to
             study initiation, or who are currently taking any prescription drug that in the
             opinion of the investigator in consultation with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals
             Incorporated (BIPI) medical monitor and pharmacokineticist might interfere with the
             absorption, distribution or metabolism on the test drug

          -  Significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities
