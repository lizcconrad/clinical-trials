    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research project is to assess the effectiveness of intra-articular
      injections of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) after arthroscopic microfracture. Our
      hypothesis is that platelet-rich plasma will improve patient's clinical outcomes and chondral
      healing following microfracture performed during femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) hip
      arthroscopy.

      The purpose of this research project is to assess the effectiveness of intra-articular
      injections of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) after arthroscopic microfracture. Our
      hypothesis is that platelet-rich plasma will improve patient's clinical outcomes and chondral
      healing following microfracture performed during femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) hip
      arthroscopy.

      This study has two aims:

        1. Evaluate clinical efficacy of intra-articular injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP)
           following arthroscopic microfracture.

        2. Evaluate if microfracture followed by PRP injections improves chondral healing.

      Microfracture has shown good results with chondral lesions of the hip. However, microfracture
      does not regenerate normal hyaline cartilage. There is growing evidence that PRP can improve
      articular cartilage healing. Injection of PRP following microfracture may help regeneration
      to normal hyaline like articular cartilage together with soft tissue healing, thereby
      improving patients' early and long-term outcomes of chondral healing.

      Patients will be randomized to one of two study arms - microfracture with PRP (treatment arm)
      and microfracture with saline (control arm) in a 1:1 ratio.
