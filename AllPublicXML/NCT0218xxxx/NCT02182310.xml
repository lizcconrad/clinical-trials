      To demonstrate that BI 201335 does not prolong the QT interval more than placebo.

      To assess the tolerability of 1200 mg of BI 201335 as single dose in female subjects
      (double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled) before inclusion of female subjects in the
      cross-over part of the trial.
