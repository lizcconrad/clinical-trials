  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burning produces changes in the biomechanical properties of the skin causing limitation of
      movement. The increase in skin suppleness is very important in the rehabilitation process,
      since its increase makes therapeutic interventions aimed at increasing the range of motion,
      thus improving functional pattern. Will be evaluated 60 volunteers of both sexes aged 20-80
      years seen at the Burns Unit of the Clinical Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão
      Preto. There will be a traditional physical therapy evaluation as well as evaluation of the
      specific characteristics of the burn and scar. The temperature of the region will be assessed
      by thermography, and biophysical parameters and biomechanical skin evaluated by Cutometer and
      their accessory probes (mexameter, reviscometer, sebometer) before, immediately after and 10,
      20 and 30 minutes of application of therapeutic resources. Volunteers will undergo continuous
      application of ultrasound with 3 MHz and intensity of 1 W/cm2 in the region due to scar deep
      second degree burn or third degree, and the application time of 2 minutes for each effective
      radiation area of the head (ERA) in a predetermined region of 9X5 cm a total of 4 minutes of
      application, therapy paraffin 20 minutes and 4 minutes endermology negative pressure between
      100 and 200mmHg, in a continuous mode with glass head (1.5cm in diameter .) Applications will
      be set by random draw (design crusader cross-over) with an interval of 7 days between
      applications (wash-out). The data will be submitted to analysis of normality by the
      Shapiro-Wilk test, and the behavior of the effect between groups and pre-and
      post-intervention will be evaluated by two-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc (Bonferroni) or
      Friedman, p &lt;0.05
