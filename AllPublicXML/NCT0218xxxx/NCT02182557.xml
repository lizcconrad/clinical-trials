        Inclusion Criteria:

        For inclusion in this study, patients must be pediatric atopic dermatitis patients that
        meet the following criteria and thus be appropriate for observation of pruritus. Diagnosis
        of atopic dermatitis was conducted in accordance with the &quot;Definition and Diagnostic
        Criteria of Atopic Dermatitis&quot; issued by the Japanese Dermatological Association.

          -  15 years of age or younger

          -  Body weight of 14 kg or more

          -  Outpatients

          -  One week or longer has passed since the patient started to use an external steroid
             preparation at &quot;Strong&quot; or lower grade, or stopped using any external steroid
             preparation, at the time of obtainment of consent from the patient

          -  Pruritus with &quot;2&quot; or higher grade, immediately before initial administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of sustained release adrenocorticotropic hormone (Kenacort® A, Depo-medrol®,
             etc.), oral preparation of methotrexate, or oral preparation of ciclosporin, within 4
             weeks before initial administration of the investigational product

          -  Oral intake, inhalation and injection of any steroid within 2 weeks before initial
             administration of the investigational product

          -  Use of any external steroid preparation at &quot;Very Strong&quot; or higher grade in any sites
             other than the face or scalp within 2 weeks before initial administration of the
             investigational product

          -  Undergoing phototherapy

          -  Undergoing specific desensitization therapy or modulation therapy

          -  Past history of contact dermatitis caused by external steroid preparation

          -  Possibility of exacerbation by an external steroid preparation of infectious skin
             disease caused by bacteria, fungi, or virus

          -  Present and past history of convulsive disorder, such as epilepsy (convulsion
             threshold values may be lowered by the reference drug, Ketotifen Fumarate)

          -  Clinically significant hepatic, renal, or cardiac disease or other complications:
             therefore, judgement that the patient is ineligible for inclusion in this study
             (Please note that patients must be excluded from the study if the patients fell under
             Grade 2 or more, in the MHW (Ministry of health and welfare) Adverse Reaction Severity
             Classification Criteria.)

          -  Past history of allergy to any drug

          -  Participation in any other clinical study, or history of participation in any other
             clinical study within 6 months before the date when the patient gave consent to
             participate in this study

          -  Judgement by the Principal Investigator or Investigator that the patient is ineligible
             for inclusion in this study
