    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II/III trial studies how well pazopanib hydrochloride, combination
      chemotherapy, and radiation therapy work and compares it to radiation therapy alone or in
      combination with pazopanib hydrochloride or combination chemotherapy in treating patients
      with newly diagnosed non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas that can be removed by
      surgery. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether
      radiation therapy works better when given with or without combination chemotherapy and/or
      pazopanib hydrochloride in treating patients with non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the dose of pazopanib hydrochloride (pazopanib) that is feasible when given in
      combination with radiation or chemoradiation in pediatric and adult patients newly diagnosed
      with unresected intermediate- and high-risk non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas
      (NRSTS).

      II. To compare the rates of near complete pathologic response (&gt; 90% necrosis) with the
      addition of pazopanib to preoperative chemoradiation versus preoperative chemoradiation alone
      for potentially resectable &gt; 5 cm, grade 3 intermediate to high risk chemotherapy-sensitive
      NRSTS in the phase II portion of the study for this cohort.

      III. To compare the rates of near complete pathologic response (&gt; 90% necrosis) with the
      addition of pazopanib to preoperative radiotherapy versus preoperative radiotherapy alone for
      potentially resectable intermediate to high risk adult and pediatric NRSTS in the phase II
      portion of the study for this cohort (using a phase II decision rule to go onto the phase III
      portion of the study).

      IV. To compare the rates of event-free survival (EFS) with the addition of pazopanib to
      preoperative radiotherapy versus preoperative radiotherapy alone for localized intermediate
      to high risk adult and pediatric NRSTS in the phase III portion of the study for this cohort
      if the phase II decision rule is passed.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the rates of local failure, regional failure, distant metastasis free
      survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival with the addition of pazopanib to
      preoperative chemoradiation or preoperative radiation in intermediate to high risk adult and
      pediatric NRSTS.

      II. To compare the pattern of recurrence (local, regional and distant) between preoperative
      chemoradiation or radiation with the addition of pazopanib for adult and pediatric NRSTS.

      III. To define the toxicities of ifosfamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride (doxorubicin)
      chemotherapy and radiation when used in combination with pazopanib in intermediate to high
      risk adult and pediatric NRSTS.

      IV. To define the toxicities of preoperative radiotherapy when used in combination with
      pazopanib in intermediate to high risk adult and pediatric NRSTS.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To gain insight into the disease biology of childhood and adult NRSTS through analysis of
      actionable mutations and whole genome sequencing.

      II. To determine if microvessel density and circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      predict response to pazopanib and outcome.

      III. To determine the effect of pazopanib on doxorubicin exposure in children and adults with
      NRSTS.

      IV. To evaluate change in fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)
      maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) from baseline to week 10 or 13 in patients with
      unresected tumors and to correlate this change with pathologic response and EFS.

      V. To compare the rate of response by standard imaging and pathologic assessment to determine
      which correlates better with local tumor control, distant tumor control, EFS, and overall
      survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pazopanib hydrochloride.

      CHEMOTHERAPY COHORT: Patients eligible for chemotherapy cohort are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment regimens.

      REGIMEN A:

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on
      weeks 1-12, ifosfamide intravenously (IV) over 2-4 hours on days 1-3 on weeks 1, 4, 7, 10,
      and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1-15 minutes on days 1-2 on weeks 1 and 4. At least 24
      hours after the completion of week 4 doxorubicin hydrochloride, patients undergo radiation
      therapy on weeks 4-10.

      SURGERY: Patients undergo surgery on week 13.

      CONTINUATION PHASE: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD on weeks 16-25, ifosfamide
      IV over 2-4 hours on days 1-3 on weeks 16 and 19, and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1-15
      minutes on days 1-2 on weeks 16, 19, and 22. At least 24 hours after the completion of
      doxorubicin hydrochloride, if required, patients undergo radiation therapy on weeks 16-25 for
      a total of 45 Gy. Patients with impaired wound healing within 6 weeks of the date of surgery,
      have week 16 chemotherapy postponed until radiation therapy (if needed) begins. Patients with
      impaired wound healing within 8 weeks of the date of surgery, are removed from protocol
      therapy effective the date 8 weeks after week 13 surgery.

      REGIMEN B:

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 2-4 hours on days 1-3 on weeks 1, 4, 7,
      10 and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1-15 minutes on days 1-2 on weeks 1 and 4. At least
      24 hours after the completion of week 4 doxorubicin hydrochloride, patients undergo radiation
      therapy on weeks 4-10.

      SURGERY: Patients undergo surgery on week 13.

      CONTINUATION PHASE: Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 2-4 hours on days 1-3 on weeks 16 and
      19 and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1-15 minutes on days 1-2 on weeks 16, 19, and 22. At
      least 24 hours after the completion of doxorubicin hydrochloride, if required, patients
      undergo radiation therapy on weeks 16-25 for a total of 45 Gy. Patients with impaired wound
      healing within 6 weeks of the date of surgery, have week 16 chemotherapy postponed until
      radiation therapy (if needed) begins. Patients with impaired wound healing within 8 weeks of
      the date of surgery, are removed from protocol therapy effective the date 8 weeks after week
      13 surgery.

      NON-CHEMOTHERAPY COHORT: Patients eligible for non-chemotherapy cohort are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment regimens.

      REGIMEN C:

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD on weeks 1-9. Patients
      undergo radiation therapy on weeks 1-7.

      SURGERY: Patients undergo surgery on week 10.

      CONTINUATION PHASE: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD on weeks 13-25. Patients
      undergo radiation therapy on weeks 13-16 for a total of 50 Gy. Patients with impaired wound
      healing within 8 weeks of the date of surgery, are removed from protocol therapy effective
      the date 8 weeks after week 10 surgery.

      REGIMEN D:

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients undergo radiation therapy on weeks 1-7.

      Patients with impaired wound healing within 8 weeks of the date of surgery, are removed from
      protocol therapy effective the date 8 weeks after week 10 surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48,
      and 60 months.
