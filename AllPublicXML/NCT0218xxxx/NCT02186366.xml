  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by the presence of persistent worry or
      fear of no explicit object and fixed content, or things that might occur in real life，which
      not corresponds with the realities. Patients with GAD may occur a series of somatic symptoms
      including muscle tension, backaches, headaches, fatigue, insomnia, restlessness, as well as
      psychological feelings of anxiety, worry and feeling overwhelmed. And it always brings some
      type of functional disability or decrease in quality of life. GAD is treated by Selective
      Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Serotonin, Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors(SNRI)
      and 5-ht1a receptor agonists as regular medication which have the definite effects. But, some
      adverse reaction of SSRIs or SNRI leads to the compliance of taking medicine of patients with
      GAD. There is an impressive data suggesting that Abdominal Massage Therapy is effective in
      decreasing some symptoms of somatic symptoms and psychological feelings.

      This study is designed as a parallel group, positive control, non-inferiority study. It will
      recruit 140 cases of generalized anxiety disorder of deficiency of both heart and spleen
      type. Both the treatment group and the control group will be randomly assigned 70 cases.
      Patients in the treatment group will be treated by Abdominal Massage for 6 weeks，and the
      control group by buspirone . The total study includes 4 views that are respectively before
      the treatment，after 3 weeks treatment, after the whole treatment , and 3 months after the
      whole treatment. At all of the 4 views, all participants will be estimated the scores of
      Hamilton Depression Scale(HAMD) ,self-rating anxiety scale(SAS), and Quality of life
      assessment scale. At the second, third and the forth views, all participants will be
      estimated Clinical Global Impression ( CGI). At the first and the third views, all
      participants will be collected the data of content of hydroxytryptamine（5-HT）, Norepinephrine
      and total cortisol in blood plasma, and of blood stream speed, vascular resistance index and
      pulsatility index of middle cerebral artery （MCA）, anterior cerebral artery（ACA）, posterior
      cerebral artery （PCA） and basilar artery（BA）. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of
      Abdominal Massage Therapy vs. buspirone, and discover the correlation between these scales
      and these objective indicators.
