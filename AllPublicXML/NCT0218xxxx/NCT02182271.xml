  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current study is to investigate safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of BI 201335 ZW following administration of single rising doses from 5 mg to
      1500 mg. In addition Two stage intra-subject bioavailability comparison of 600 mg BI 201335
      ZW as a liquid formulation given with and without food.
