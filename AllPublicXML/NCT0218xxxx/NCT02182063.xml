    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of two different doses of BIBF 1120 (250
      mg twice daily versus 150 mg twice daily) in an exploratory manner. Safety, quality of life
      and pharmacokinetic parameters on a sub-sample of 20 patients were also analysed for the two
      different doses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient written informed consent obtained prior to any study procedures and consistent
             with ICH-GCP (International Conference on Harmonization - Good Clinical Practice)
             guidelines and local law

          2. Presence of histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          3. Presence of metastatic disease

          4. Life expectancy of at least 3 months

          5. Progression after orchidectomy or during LH-RH (Luteinising hormone - releasing
             hormone) analogs with castrate testosterone serum levels &lt;30 ng/ml (chemical
             castration had to be continued) and absence of anti-androgen withdrawal syndrome

          6. Minimum value of PSA = 20 ng/ml at screening

          7. Stopping the previous treatment with docetaxel based regimen or/and with antiandrogen
             4 weeks before the inclusion of the patient

          8. ECOG performance status ≤ 2

          9. Progression after only one previous chemotherapy with docetaxel based regimen:

               -  Appearance of a new lesion or increase of an existing measurable / non measurable
                  lesion

               -  Increase of PSA ≥ 25% documented by two successive exams

               -  Increase of pain if there is a correlation with a radiological progression or
                  with a PSA increase as defined above

         10. Adequate hepatic function: total bilirubin within normal limits, ALT (Alanine
             aminotransferase) and/or AST (aspartate aminotransferase) ≤ 1.5x upper limit of normal
             (ULN). Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT): maximum 50%
             deviation from normal limits

         11. Adequate renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 2 x upper normal limit (UNL)

         12. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/mL, Platelets ≥ 100,000/mL, Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0
             g/dL (hemoglobin may be supported by transfusion or erythropoietin or other approved
             hematopoietic growth factors)

             psychiatric-, infectious disease or active ulcers (gastro-intestinal tract, skin) or
             laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation
             or study drug administration and in the judgment of the investigator would make the
             patient inappropriate for entry into the study

          3. Significant cardiovascular diseases (i.e. uncontrolled hypertension, instable angina,
             history of myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure &gt;NYHA II (New York Heart
             Association) during the 6 previous months

          4. Strontium or equivalent radioactive isotope during the 6 previous months

          5. Concomitant second malignancy, with the exception of treated basal cell carcinoma of
             the skin or a recovered cancer at least since 5 years

          6. Major injuries and surgeries within the past 4 weeks. Planned surgical procedures
             during the trial. Patients with incomplete wound healing

          7. History of haemorrhagic or emerging thrombotic event. Known inherited predisposition
             to hemorrhage or thrombosis

          8. Patients who require full-dose anticoagulation or heparinization or continuous
             treatment with acetylsalicyclic acid &gt; 325 mg

          9. Concomitant treatment with other experimental drugs or anti-cancer therapy including
             hormone therapy (except LH-RH agonists)

         10. Biphosphonates during the study since four weeks prior to the inclusion of the patient

         11. Known or suspected symptomatic brain metastases

         12. Known or suspected symptomatic epiduritis

         13. Treatment with other investigational drugs or participation in another clinical trial
             within the past four weeks before start of therapy (visit 2) or concomitantly with
