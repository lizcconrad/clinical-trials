        Inclusion Criteria:

        For inclusion in this study, subjects must be pediatric atopic dermatitis patients that
        meet the following criteria and thus be appropriate for observation of pruritus. Diagnosis
        of atopic dermatitis will be conducted in accordance with the &quot;Definition and Diagnostic
        Criteria of Atopic Dermatitis&quot;, issued by the Japanese Dermatological Association.

          -  15 years of age or younger

          -  Body weight of 14 kg or more

          -  Outpatients

          -  The patient has been undergoing treatment with a &quot;very strong&quot; or lower-grade external
             steroid preparation for &gt;= 1 week at the time informed consent is obtained

          -  Pruritus with &quot;2&quot; or higher grade at the start time of administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of sustained release adrenocorticotropic hormone (Kenacort® A, Depo-medrol®,
             etc.), oral preparation of methotrexate, or oral preparation of ciclosporin, within 4
             weeks before initial administration of the investigational product

          -  Oral intake, inhalation and injection of any steroid within 2 weeks before initial
             administration of the investigational product

          -  Use of any external steroid preparation at &quot;Strongest&quot; in any sites other than the
             face or scalp within 2 weeks before initial administration of the investigational
             product

          -  Undergoing phototherapy

          -  Undergoing specific desensitization therapy or modulation therapy

          -  Past history of contact dermatitis caused by external steroid preparation

          -  Possibility of exacerbation by an external steroid preparation of infectious skin
             disease caused by bacteria, fungi, or virus

          -  Clinically significant hepatic, renal, or cardiac disease or other complications:
             therefore, judgement that the patient was ineligible for inclusion in this study.
             Patients must be excluded from the study if the patients fell under Grade 2 or more,
             in the MHW (Ministry of health and welfare) Adverse Reaction Severity Classification
             Criteria

          -  Past history of allergy to any drug

          -  Participation in any other clinical study, or history of participation in any other
             clinical study within 6 months before the date when the patient gave consent to
             participate in this study

          -  Judgement by the Principal Investigator or Investigator that the patient is ineligible
             for inclusion in this study
