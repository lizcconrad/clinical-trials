  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 3-part dose titration study will assess MK-8189 safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), and central nervous system activity. Part 1 will assess MK-8189 administered as
      monotherapy in participants with schizophrenia. Part 2 will assess MK-8189 administered as
      add-on to atypical antipsychotic treatment in participants with schizophrenia. Part 3 will
      assess monotherapy with MK-8189 in healthy participants, including those of Japanese descent.
      The primary hypothesis is that there is at least one dose of MK-8189 that is generally safe
      and well-tolerated which will have the desired PK parameters in participants with
      schizophrenia.
