  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      National Guard members, especially those who have been combat-deployed, are at high risk for
      developing alcohol- and prescription-related drug problems. The use of novel Web-based
      interventions combined with either Web-based boosters or Peer support sessions, may have a
      major public health impact for the National Guard by reducing hazardous use of alcohol of
      prescription drugs. The aims of the study are to develop, refine and test tailored
      motivational Brief Interventions (BIs) with varied continuing booster reinforcements (Web vs.
      Peer) and to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of these BIs (W+W;
      W+P) to usual care on subsequent alcohol/drug consumption and consequences, including injury,
      mental and physical-health functioning, and HIV risk behaviors at 4-, 8-, and 12-months
      post-enrollment.

      The proposed study will test the efficacy of an easy-to-use, &lt;40-minute, state-of-the-art
      tailored Web-based SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment)
      intervention combined with subsequent Web- or Peer-based boosters, compared to enhanced usual
      care (EUC). All participants will also receive a booklet with prevention information that
      includes general alcohol, opioid, and sedative use information as well as other health
      behaviors. The proposed study will screen ~ 4,300 unique Service Members as part of Soldier
      Readiness Processing in the Michigan National Guard (NG) to enroll 750 participants within 35
      armories with alcohol and/or prescribed opioid or sedative misuse (AOS misuse). We will
      identify AOS misuse with a combination of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification
      Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) and an adapted version of the Pain Medication Questionnaire (PMQ).
      Computerized screening with touch-screen computer tablets will be used to recruit NG Service
      Members with AOS misuse in the prior 4 months. Participants will be randomized to one of
      three conditions:1) Web-delivered alcohol/prescribed drug misuse brief intervention with Web
      booster sessions (1/month for 3 months; W+W; n=250); 2) Web-delivered brief intervention with
      Peer-delivered booster sessions (at least 1/month for 3 months; W+P; n=250); or 3) Enhanced
      Usual Care (EUC; n=250). Random assignment will be stratified by gender and alcohol vs.
      prescription opioid/sedative misuse.

    <description>Quantity and frequency is measured by number of days misused, and the NIDA-Modified ASSIST and adapted Pain Medication Questionnaire (PMQ) are used to assess medical misuse of prescribed opioids and medical misuse of prescribed sedatives.

    <description>3a) Injury is measured using the Revised Injury Behavior Checklist (RIBC). 3b) Mental and physical health functioning is measured using a brief version of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), the Post-Traumatic Disorder Checklist-Military Version (PCL-5) and items from the Unit Risk Inventory, developed by the Army Substance Abuse Program.
3c) HIV-risk behaviors are measured using questions from the HIV Risk-Taking Behavior Scale (HRBS).</description>

    <description>Web-delivered brief intervention: Participants receive a 30-40 minute Web-based intervention which includes a tailored review of participants' goals/values, feedback regarding their present alcohol/prescribed opioid/sedative use patterns and consequences, developing a discrepancy between their alcohol or prescribed drug use, ability to meet goals and values through a decisional balance exercise, and formulation of a tailored &quot;change plan&quot;.
Web booster sessions: Web boosters will be completed at 1, 2 and 3 months post-BI. Content is tailored to the individual based on answers to baseline questions and responses during Web-based BI. Web-based Booster will: 1) briefly ascertain current AOS use, 2) changes in AOS since completing Web BI, 3) progress toward goals, and 4) plans and encouragement for next steps.</description>
