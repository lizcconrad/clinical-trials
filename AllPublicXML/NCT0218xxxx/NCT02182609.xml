      The objectives of this study are:

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of a single dose of 99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128
           administered as an intravenous bolus over 10-20 seconds.

        -  To determine the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and radiation dosimetry of
           99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128 in normal healthy adult volunteers.

    <description>Type and incidence of AEs, as well as severity and relatedness to the study medication will be tabulated.

    <description>Laboratory data (Hematology, coagulation, biochemistry, and urinalysis) will be analysed with respect to the normal ranges of values provided by the local laboratory and with respect to pre-defined levels of change in these values.
Abnormal laboratory test results will be tabulated.</description>

    <measure>Vital signs</measure>
    <time_frame>At each study visit</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics of the vital signs (pulse rate and blood pressure) observed values as well as for the changes from baseline value will be created. Frequency tabulations with values within, below or above the normal ranges will be made.</description>
