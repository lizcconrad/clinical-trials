  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common sites for GIST to occur are the stomach (60-70%) and proximal small
      intestines (20-25%). Therefore patients with GIST often have altered GI-tract due to tumor
      resection or palliative surgery which might affect imatinib exposure. Indeed, Yoo et al.
      showed that steady state imatinib trough levels in patients with advanced GISTs after major
      gastrectomy are lower compared to patients with a previous wedge resection or without gastric
      surgery. Patients that underwent major gastrectomy had an average imatinib plasma trough
      levels below 1000 µg/L. This while imatinib trough levels above 1000 µg/L are correlated to
      more beneficial treatment out-comes (longer Progression Free Survival).

      Since imatinib easily and rapidly dissolves at pH 5.5 or less, a lack of gastric acid
      secretion might be causing the decreased exposure in the patients that underwent major
      gastrectomy.

      Therefore the investigators would like to study if the exposure to imatinib in patients after
      major gastrectomy can be improved by creating a more acidic environment for absorption
      through combining imatinib intake with Coca-Cola.
