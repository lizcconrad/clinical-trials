  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to establish the relative bioavailability of a new soft
      gelatin capsule (SGC) formulation of BI 201335 NA compared to the current solution
      formulation (powder in bottle, PIB) for two doses (40 mg, 240 mg) in a parallel, two-way
      cross-over study design.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy males and females according to the following criteria: Based upon a complete
             medical history, including the physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure (BP),
             pulse rate (PR)), 12-lead ECG (electrocardiogram), clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age ≥18 and Age ≤50 years

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥18.5 and BMI ≤29.9 kg/m2

             accordance with GCP (Good Clinical Practice) and the local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding from the medical examination (including BP, PR and ECG) deviating from

          -  Infected with hepatitis A, hepatitis B or hepatitis C viruses (defined as either being
             hepatitis A antibody positive, hepatitis B surface antigen or HBV DNA positive, or
