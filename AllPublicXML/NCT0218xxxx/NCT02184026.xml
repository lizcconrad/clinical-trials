      The study implements a trauma-related nightmare treatment for children aged 8 to 13 years.
      Relevant outcome progress and outcome measures on symptoms, nightmare distress and duration,
      academic indicators, and sleep quality will be examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Untreated trauma-related nightmares and sleep-related disorders are associated with chronic
      health problems, burdening both the suffering individual and the health-care system. The
      study implements an innovative, cost-efficient, nightmare treatment for trauma-exposed
      children. It is one of the first randomized clinical trials with children, adapting an
      efficacious adult therapy to a 5-session nightmare treatment for 8-13 year-olds. Trauma
      nightmares are a mechanism in development and maintenance of secondary post-trauma
      psychopathology, medical problems, and family dysfunction. Therefore, this treatment may
      prevent long-term secondary health and behavioral problems. It provides a viable health care
      option to Montanans, lessening long-term financial, medical, and behavioral health expenses.
      Scientific models currently view PTSD treatment as primary, often leaving nightmares
      untreated. That approach does not address the pernicious impact of trauma-nightmares in
      individuals with sub-threshold PTSD or whose nightmares are a primary condition. The
      theoretical innovation of this therapy can advance the field's understanding of the
      development of trauma sequelae.
