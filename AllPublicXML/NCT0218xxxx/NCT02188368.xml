    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness (good
      and bad effects) of pomalidomide given as part of a combination therapy that include more
      than just steroids to treat subjects with relapsed (subjects whose disease came back) or
      refractory (subjects whose disease did not respond to past treatment) multiple myeloma (MM).

      Pomalidomide (alone or in combination with dexamethasone) has been approved by the United
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of MM patients who have received
      at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and bortezomib, and have demonstrated
      disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of their last therapy. However, the
      use of pomalidomide in combination with other drugs used to treat MM, such as
      chemotherapeutic agents and proteasome inhibitors, is currently being tested and is not
      approved. Pomalidomide is in the same drug class as thalidomide and lenalidomide. Like
      lenalidomide, pomalidomide is a drug that alters the immune system and it may also interfere
      with the development of small blood vessels that help support tumor growth. Therefore, in
      theory, it may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. The testing done with
      pomalidomide thus far has shown that it is well-tolerated and effective for subjects with MM
      both on its own and in combination with dexamethasone. Using another drug class, namely
      proteasome inhibitors, we have demonstrated that simply replacing a proteasome inhibitor with
      another in an established anti-myeloma treatment regimen can frequently overcome resistance
      regardless of the other agents that are part of the anti-myeloma regimen. Importantly, the
      toxicity profile of the new combinations closely resembled that of the proteasome inhibitor
      administered as a single agent. Based on this experience, we hypothesize that the replacement
      of lenalidomide with pomalidomide will yield similar results in a similar relapsed/refractory
      MM patient population.

      This is a phase 2, multicenter, open-label and non-randomized study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of pomalidomide as a replacement for lenalidomide among MM patients who have
      failed lenalidomide-containing regimens that include more than steroids within 6 months of
      their last dose of lenalidomide. Pomalidomide will replace lenalidomide in a combination
      regimen containing an alkylating agent (cyclophosphamide), anthracycline (doxorubicin or
      PLD), proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib or carfilzomib) and/or a glucocorticosteroid
      (prednisone, dexamethasone or methylprednisolone). Pomalidomide will be administered on days
      1-21 of a 28-day cycle, whereas other drugs (anthracyclines, proteasome inhibitors, steroids
      or alkylating agents except melphalan) will be administered using the same schedule(s),
      dose(s) and drug combination as the last lenalidomide-containing regimen that the patient
      received and failed. This study will enroll patients resistant to a lenalidomide-containing
      combination regimen as demonstrated by PD while being treated or that has relapsed within 6
      months of the last dose of lenalidomide in their last lenalidomide-containing combination
      regimen or while on lenalidomide or lenalidomide and steroid maintenance therapy. Forty-five
      patients will be enrolled in the study.

      The study consists of: 1) a screening period; 2) up to eight 28-day, treatment cycles; 3) a
      final assessment to occur 28 days after the end of the last treatment cycle; and 4) a
      follow-up period.

      Subjects eligible for this study will receive treatment with study drug for a maximum of
      eight 28-day treatment cycles, depending on the schedule of their last
      lenalidomide-containing regimen. Subjects are to be treated to a maximum response (lowest
      level of paraprotein) plus 1 additional cycle, without exceeding a total of 8 cycles, or
      complete 8 cycles of therapy without progressing (PD).
