  <brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Berodual® Inhaled Via Respimat® Compared to MDI (Metered Dose Inhaler) in Pediatric Patients With Asthma</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomized, Double-blind Study to Compare the Safety and Efficacy of Berodual® Inhaled Via the Respimat® Device in Two Dosages (50 µg Fenoterol Hydrobromide + 20 µg Ipratropium Bromide and 25 µg Fenoterol Hydrobromide + 10 µg Ipratropium Bromide, 1 Puff t.i.d.) With That of Berodual® Inhaled Via the MDI With Aerochamber® (50 µg Fenoterol Hydrobromide + 21 µg Ipratropium Bromide, 2 Puffs t.i.d.) in Pediatric Patients With Asthma Over a 4 Week Period</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to demonstrate that at least one of the two doses of Berodual® (50 µg fenoterol
      hydrobromide + 20 µg ipratropium bromide and 25 µg fenoterol hydrobromide + 10 µg ipratropium
      bromide, 1 puff t.i.d.) administered via Respimat® device gives a bronchodilator response
      which is not inferior to that obtained from one dose of Berodual® (50 µg fenoterol
      hydrobromide + 21 µg ipratropium bromide, 2 puffs t.i.d.) administered via the MDI
      (chlorofluorocarbon-metered dose inhaler) with Aerochamber® and that the safety profile is at
      least as good when paediatric asthma patients are treated for four weeks.

             Aerochamber®

          -  Ability to be trained in proper use of MDI with Aerochamber® and Respimat®

          -  Ability to perform technically satisfactory pulmonary function tests

          -  Patients who have taken an investigational drug one month or six half-lives (whichever
