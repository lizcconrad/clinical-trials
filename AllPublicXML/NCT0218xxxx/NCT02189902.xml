      The goal is to determine the vit D supplementation dose that safely results in optimal serum
      vitamin D (25D) concentrations in HIV-infected children and adults living in Botswana. To do
      this the investigators will test two oral daily doses (4000 vs. 7000 IU) of cholecalciferol
      (D3) dietary supplement over a 12-week period in 60 children and adults with HIV/AIDS living
      in Botswana (5.0 to 50.9 yrs), to assess safety as determined by serum calcium and 25D
      concentrations and efficacy to replete vit D status as determined by achieving a minimum
      serum 25D concentration of 32 ng/mL (80 nmol/L).

      Many people living with HIV/AIDS in African countries are vit D deficient or insufficient.
      Vit D deficiency in HIV/AIDS may be due to low dietary vit D intake, increased requirements,
      malabsorption, specific drug therapies (antiretrovirals, in particular), reduced outdoor
      physical activity, reduced vit D synthesis from UV light exposure in dark skin pigmented
      individuals, or unknown HIV-associated factors. Vit D deficiency likely contributes to
      abnormal immune status and increased inflammatory state, and to poor growth, bone, and muscle
      function, and may contribute to risk for tuberculosis (TB) infection. The goal is to
      determine the vit D supplementation dose that safely results in optimal serum 25D
      concentrations in HIV-infected children and adults living in Botswana.

      To do this the investigators will test two oral daily doses (4000 vs. 7000 IU) of
      cholecalciferol (D3) dietary supplement over a 12-week period in 60 children and adults with
      HIV/AIDS living in Botswana (5.0 to 50.9 yrs), to assess safety as determined by serum
      calcium and 25D concentrations and efficacy to replete vit D status as determined by
      achieving a minimum serum 25D concentration of 32 ng/mL (80 nmol/L).
