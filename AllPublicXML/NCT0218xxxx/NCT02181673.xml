  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intravenously (administration of a
      fluid into the vein) administered golimumab 2 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) in participants
      with active psoriatic arthritis (a chronic inflammatory arthritis that is associated with
      psoriasis).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is
      compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect) study of
      golimumab compared with placebo in participants with active psoriatic arthritis. The study
      will include 4 phases: Screening phase (up to 6 weeks), Double-blind placebo-controlled phase
      (Week 0 to Week 24), Active treatment phase (Week 24 to Week 52), and Safety follow-up phase
      (8 weeks from last study drug administration). Total duration of the study will be 60 weeks
      per participant. Eligible Participants will be randomly assigned to either Treatment Group 1:
      Placebo or Treatment Group 2: Golimumab. Participants randomized to Placebo Group, will
      receive intravenous infusions of placebo at Weeks 0, 4, 12 and 20. At Week 24, all
      participants receiving placebo will begin receiving intravenous infusions of golimumab (2
      mg/kg) at Week 24, 28 and thereafter every 8 weeks up to Week 52. Participants randomized to
      Golimumab Group, will receive intravenous infusions of golimumab 2 mg/kg at Week 0, 4 and
      thereafter every 8 weeks up to Week 52. At Week 24, participants randomized to golimumab
      Group will receive a placebo infusion to maintain the blind. The efficacy will be assessed
      primarily by measuring percentage of participants who achieve a 20 percent improvement from
      baseline in the assessment used in active psoriatic arthritis at Week 14. Participants'
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 to 3 (0=no difficulty and 3=inability to perform a task in that area). Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Psoriatic Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 Response at Week 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas were assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 to 6, and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 75 response represents participants who achieved at least a 75 percent improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) at Week 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a survey of participant health. It consists of 8 individual domains, which are weighted sums of the questions in their section. The 8 domains are: vitality (VT), physical functioning (PF), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), Role-Physical (RP), Role-Emotional (RE), social functioning (SF) and mental health (MH). Each of these 8 scales (domains) is scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health. Based on the scale scores, the summary physical component score (PCS) is derived. Scales contributing most to the scoring of the SF-36 PCS include the PF, RP, BP and GH. Other domains not noted contribute to the scoring but to a lesser degree. The scoring is derived based on an algorithm that has been developed in a software provided by the developer. The summary PCS score is also scaled from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 14</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 to 3 (0=no difficulty and 3=inability to perform a task in that area). Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>

        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas were assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 to 6, and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 75 response represents participants who achieved at least a 75 percent improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

          <description>Enthesitis will be assessed using the Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI). The LEI was developed to assess enthesitis in participants with PsA, and evaluates the presence (score of 1) or absence of pain (score of 0) by applying local pressure to Lateral elbow epicondyle, left and right, Medial femoral condyle, left and right, and Achilles tendon insertion, left and right. LEI scores ranging from 0 (0 sites with tenderness) to 6 (worst possible score; 6 sites with tenderness).</description>

        <description>The SF-36 is a survey of participant health. It consists of 8 individual domains, which are weighted sums of the questions in their section. The 8 domains are: vitality (VT), physical functioning (PF), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), Role-Physical (RP), Role-Emotional (RE), social functioning (SF) and mental health (MH). Each of these 8 scales (domains) is scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health. Based on the scale scores, the summary physical component score (PCS) is derived. Scales contributing most to the scoring of the SF-36 PCS include the PF, RP, BP and GH. Other domains not noted contribute to the scoring but to a lesser degree. The scoring is derived based on an algorithm that has been developed in a software provided by the developer. The summary PCS score is also scaled from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health.</description>
