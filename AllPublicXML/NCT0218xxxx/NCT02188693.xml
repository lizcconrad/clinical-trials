    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of our study is to evaluate whether gemcitabine as a single agent is
      superior to observation in improving progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who achieved disease control with an initial six cycles of PG
      as their first-line treatment
