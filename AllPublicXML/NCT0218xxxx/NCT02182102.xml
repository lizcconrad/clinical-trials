  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerate dose
      (MTD) of BIBF 1120 in combination with pemetrexed. Secondary objectives were to characterize
      the pharmacokinetic profiles of BIBF 1120 and pemetrexed and to obtain preliminary
      anti-tumour efficacy information.
