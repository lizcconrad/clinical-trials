  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the &quot;Sensing Atrial High Rate Episodes with DX System in Implantable
      Cardioverter Defibrillators Trial&quot; (SENSE Trial) is to assess the efficacy of a implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) lead with dedicated atrial sensing dipoles in detecting
      atrial high rate episodes.

      The study hypothesis is that an ICD system with a lead with dedicated atrial sensing dipoles
      will have a diagnostic yield comparable to that of a standard dual chamber ICD system and
      superior to that of a standard single chamber ICD system.

      The SENSE Trial is designed to study the efficacy of the DX System in detection of atrial
      high rate episodes (AHREs) in subjects with no prior history of atrial fibrillation. The DX
      System, or &quot;DX,&quot; consists of a Biotronik DX ICD, and the Biotronik Linox Smart S DX lead
      which is an FDA approved ICD system that incorporates use of an implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) lead with dedicated atrial sensing dipoles.

      The SENSE Trial will be conducted at 8-12 U.S. sites. The lead coordinating site will be at
      Weill Cornell Medical College. Subjects will be followed for 1 year to assess for the primary
      endpoints of the trial.
