  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to determine the safety and tolerability of ASP2215 as well
      as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on the onset of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and/or
      determine the recommended dose (RD) of ASP2215 for the next phase in subjects with relapsed
      or treatment-refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to determine the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and efficacy of
      single and repeated oral dosing of ASP2215 once daily in patients with relapsed or refractory
      AML. After the determination of the MTD and/or RD, an expansion cohort might be set to
      further investigate the safety and efficacy of ASP2215.

      This study will consist of a single-dose period (Cycle 0, 2 days) and a repeated-dose period
      (Cycle 1 and subsequent cycles, each cycle consisting of 28 days). The enrolled subjects will
      orally receive their assigned single dose in Cycle 0 (Day −2), followed by a 2-day
      observation period (dosing day inclusive). In Cycle 1 and subsequent cycles (one cycle is
      defined as 28 days), the subjects will receive oral ASP2215 once daily repeatedly until one
      of the discontinuation criteria is met. Another dosing regimen may be considered such as
      dosing twice daily based on the safety and PK data that will become available.

      In this study, the Bayesian-Continual Reassessment Method (hereinafter, Bayesian-CRM) will be
      used as a reference for dose-escalation procedures, and based on the onset of DLTs, the RD
      level of the subsequent cohort will be set higher or lower. DLTs will be assessed during
      Cycle 0 and Cycle 1 (30 days).

      ASP2215 may be escalated by one dose level if the subject meets the criteria at the end of
      each cycle after Cycle 1 and the investigator/sub-investigator judges escalation of ASP2215
      is of clinical benefit. Dose reduction of ASP2215 will be considered if study drug-related
      toxicities are observed in a subject.

             history of congestive heart failure of NYHA class 3 or 4 and in whom echocardiogram or
             Multiple Gate Acquisition (MUGA) scan performed within 3 months prior to screening or
             at screening showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of &lt; 45%.

          -  Subject requires treatment with concomitant drugs that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4 or of P-gp with such exceptions of antibiotics, antifungals, and
             antivirals that are considered absolutely essential for prevention or treatment of
             infections and for which the physician judged that there are no interchangeable drugs.

          -  Subject requires treatment with concomitant drugs that target serotonin 5HT1R or
             5HT2BR receptors or sigma nonspecific receptors, with the exception of drugs that are
             considered absolutely essential for treatment of the subject.

          -  Subject has an active uncontrollable infection

          -  Subject is known to have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          -  Subject has active hepatitis B or C or other active hepatic disorders
