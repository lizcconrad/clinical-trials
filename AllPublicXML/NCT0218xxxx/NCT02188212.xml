      Open, controlled, 5-year, prospective, clinical, multi-center study. A total of 143 adult
      patients will be treated. Female or male, with an age range from 18 (or age of consent) to 70
      years, provided they fulfill the inclusion criteria and need two single tooth restorations on
      contralateral teeth in the same arch. Each patient will receive in minimum one NobelProceraTM
      Crown Shaded Zirconia and one NobelProceraTM full contour crown IPS e.max CAD in lithium
      disilicate on the 1st or 2nd molar randomly allocated to the same tooth position
      contra-laterally in the maxilla or mandible. The patients will be followed for 5 years after
      receiving their final prosthetic restorations. Possible dropouts and withdrawals, as well as
      possible adverse events, will be carefully monitored during the entire investigation period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must be at least 18 (or age of consent) and less than 70 at the time of
             inclusion.

          -  The subject is healthy and compliant with good oral hygiene.

          -  The subject is in need of at least two paired contalateral single-tooth full coverage
             molar restorations in the maxilla and/or mandible.

          -  The subject shall have a stable occlusal relationship with a fully restored, fixed
             opposing dentition.

          -  Obtained informed consent from the subject.

          -  No apical disorder or inflammation of abutment teeth, adjacent and opposing teeth.

          -  Good gingival / periodontal / periapical status of restoring, opposing and adjacent
             teeth. Healed situation of soft tissue augmentation is allowed.

          -  The subject is available for the 5-year term of the investigation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is not able to give her/his informed consent to participate.

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse as noted in patient records or in patient history.

          -  Reason to believe that the treatment might have a negative effect on the patient's
             total situation (psychiatric problems), as noted in patient records or in patient
             history.

          -  An existing condition where acceptable retention of the restoration is impossible to
             attain

          -  Mobility of the tooth to be restored.

          -  Pathologic pocket formation of 4 mm or greater around the tooth to be restored.

          -  Severe bruxism or other destructive habits.

          -  Amount of attached soft tissue is insufficient (no attached gingiva on the buccal side
             of the tooth).

          -  Health conditions, which do not permit the restorative procedure.
