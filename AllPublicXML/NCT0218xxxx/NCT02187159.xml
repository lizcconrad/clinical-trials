    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to compare change in weekly average daily pain score
      (ADPS) from baseline to Week 13 in subjects receiving either dose of DS-5565 versus placebo.
      Weekly ADPS is based on daily pain scores reported by the subject that best describes his or
      her worst pain over the previous 24 hours.

    <measure>Change from baseline in weekly average daily pain score (ADPS) at Week 13 for either dose of DS-5565 versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Weekly ADPS is based on daily pain scores reported by the patient that best describes his or her worst pain over the previous 24 hours. A daily pain score has a scale of 0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants who answered &quot;much improved or better&quot; on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale at Week 13 receiving either dose of DS-5565 versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rate PGIC on a categorical scale from 1 = very much improved to 7 = very much worse</description>

    <measure>Change in fibromyalgia index questionnaire (FIQ) total score from baseline to Week 13 in subjects receiving either dose of DS-5565 or placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The FIQ is composed of 10 items. The first item contains 11 questions related to physical functioning - each question is rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale. Items 2 and 3 ask the patient to mark the number of days that they feel well and the number of days they were unable to work (including housework) because of fibromyalgia (FM) symptoms. Items 4 through 10 are horizontal linear scales marked in 10 increments on which the patient rates work difficulty, pain, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety, and depression. A higher score indicates a greater impact of the syndrome on the patient. Scores will be collected from participants who complete the assessment at Week 13.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) measure, DS-5565 versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS questionnaire is a reliable, widely-used self-assessment scale to assess symptoms of anxiety and depression. The instrument consists of 7 questions related to anxiety and 7 related to depression, each rated on a 4- point scale (score of 0 to 3). Scores for anxiety and depression are independently summed to compute HADS-Anxiety and HADS-Depression subscale scores, with ranges from 0 to 21, where higher scores indicate greater severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Short Form 36 (SF-36) measure, DS-5565 versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a generic health survey that asks 36 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the patient's point of view. It is a practical, reliable, and valid measure of physical and mental health widely used across various disease areas, including FM. The SF-36 provides scores for 8 health domains (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health) as well as psychometrically-based physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) measure, DS-5565 versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a well-standardized instrument that shows high construct validity and responsiveness in patients with chronic pain and has been used specifically in FM. The EQ-5D includes a descriptive section with 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) that are combined into an overall health utilities index, and an NRS (100 mm VAS) that measures perception of overall health, with zero indicating worst health and 100 representing best imaginable health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Pain-associated Sleep Interference, DS-5565 versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Pain-associated sleep interference will be assessed using electronic daily diaries using an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain, ranging from 0 (pain does not interfere with sleep) to 10 (pain completely interferes with sleep, unable to sleep). The diary is to be filled out every day, along with the pain diary question, from the start of the Baseline Period through the last day on blinded study drug (including the morning following the last dose of blinded study medication).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) measure, DS-5565 versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-SF has been used in many clinical studies across a wide variety of chronic pain conditions, including FM. This instrument measures pain severity and interference within the past 24 hours. Each item is rated on an 11-point NRS from 0 to 10.</description>

             or any other concurrent disease within 12 months prior to screening that in the
             opinion of the investigator would interfere with study participation or assessment of

          -  Abnormal investigative tests (i.e. electrocardiograms [ECGs]) and laboratory values
             judged by the investigator to be clinically significant at screening, with particular
             focus on: a. Abnormal renal function defined as calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl)
             &lt; 60 mL/min determined by the central laboratory using the modified Cockcroft-Gault
             equation; blood urea nitrogen&gt; 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN); creatine kinase &gt;

             defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 2.0 × ULN, alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT) &gt; 2.0 × ULN; alkaline phosphatase &gt; 1.5 × ULN; total bilirubin&gt; 1.2 × ULN. If a
             subject has total bilirubin &gt; 1.2 ULN, unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin fractions
             should be analyzed and only subjects documented to have Gilbert's syndrome may be
             enrolled.
