             importance. Examples include, but are not limited to, QRS interval &gt;120 ms.

          -  Pre-menopausal women (last menstruation &lt;1 year prior to the date of informed consent)

                  and do not agree to periodic pregnancy testing during their participation in the
                  trial. Acceptable methods of birth control include transdermal patch, intra
                  uterine devices/systems (IUDs/IUSs), oral, implantable or injectable
