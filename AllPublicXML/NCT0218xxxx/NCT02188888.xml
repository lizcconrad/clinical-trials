  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical study suggests that beta-blockers by decreasing heart rate together with an increase
      in stroke volume do not negatively affect cardiac output allowing an economization of cardiac
      work and oxygen consumption in patients with septic shock. Whether this hemodynamic profile
      leads to an amelioration of myocardial performance is still unclear. The objective of the
      present study is therefore to elucidate whether a reduction in heart rate with esmolol is
      associated to an improvement of cardiac efficiency in patients with septic shock who remained
      tachycardic after hemodynamic optimization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After 24-36 hours of initial hemodynamic stabilization, 44 septic shock patients with heart
      rate &gt; of 95 bpm and requiring norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP)
      between 65 and 75 mmHg despite adequate volume resuscitation,will receive a continuous
      esmolol infusion to maintain heart rate between 94 and 80 bpm. Norepinephrine will be
      titrated to achieve a MAP between 65 and 75 mmHg. To investigate myocardial performance, we
      will simultaneously assess LV ejection fraction (LVEF), tricuspidal annular plane solid
      excursion (TAPSE) by echocardiography, the dP/dt MAX and the cardiac cycle efficiency (CCE)
      both estimated from the arterial pressure waveform. Finally we will analyze changes in static
      arterial elastance. Data will be obtained at baseline and after four hours once achieved the
      predefined heart rate threshold.
