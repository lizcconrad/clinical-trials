  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective cohort study aims to determine if apparently healthy children with no
      significant co-morbidities who undergo general anaesthesia for minor surgery before 1 year of
      age will develop measurable deficits in neurocognitive development compared to apparently
      healthy children with no significant co-morbidities who do not undergo general anaesthesia or
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that healthy children exposed to general anaesthesia for minor surgery before
      1 year of age will have significantly lower neurocognitive scores at 6,18, 24 and 36 months
      of age compared with age, and gender matched healthy children from the GUSTO cohort without
      prior exposure to general anaesthesia or surgery. (GUSTO: Growing Up Towards Healthy Outcomes
      in Singapore: a prospective longitudinal study providing normative data from the local
      population).
