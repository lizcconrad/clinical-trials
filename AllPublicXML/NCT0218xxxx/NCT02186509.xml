      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of alisertib when combined with
      fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery in treating patients with high-grade gliomas that have
      returned after previous treatment with radiation therapy (recurrent). Alisertib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking an enzyme needed for the cells to divide. Radiation therapy
      uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Stereotactic radiosurgery uses special
      positioning equipment to send a single high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and cause
      less damage to normal tissue. Delivering stereotactic radiosurgery over multiple doses
      (fractionation) may cause more damage to tumor tissue than normal tissue while maintaining
      the advantage of its accuracy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study treatment. II. To determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of daily oral alisertib when combined with fractionated stereotactic
      radiation treatment for recurrent high grade glioma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate 6 month progression free survival rate. II. To estimate the median time to
      progression. III. To estimate overall survival. IV. To estimate the impact on quality of life
      (QoL).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alisertib.

      CONCURRENT PHASE: Patients undergo fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery once daily (QD)
      every weekday for 10 days and receive alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) concurrently
      with radiation therapy for 10 days.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive alisertib PO BID on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 4-6 months thereafter.

             disease-free for less than 2 years, with the exception of adequately treated basal or
             squamous cell carcinoma of skin, superficial bladder cancer or carcinoma in situ of
             cervix, AJCC (version 7.0) stage 0 or I breast cancer, AJCC (version 7.0) stage I, or
             II prostate cancer.
