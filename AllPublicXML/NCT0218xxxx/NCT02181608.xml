      Background:

      - Researchers want to see if people with alcohol dependence have more trouble learning to
      feel calm, or learn to fear things more easily, than non-alcoholics and to study how early
      life stress (ELS) affects these things.

      Objective:

      - To see if people with alcohol dependence and/or ELS have a harder time learning to feel
      calm than people without these conditions.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adults age 21 65 with diagnosed alcohol dependence, with/without ELS.

        -  Healthy volunteers age 21 65 with/without ELS.

      Design:

        -  All participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will have
           blood and urine tests, and a psychological assessment.

        -  Participants with alcohol dependence will:

        -  be at the NIH Clinical Center for 4 weeks. Then they will have weekly telephone calls
           and 3 in-person visits over 3 months.

        -  follow the NIH alcohol treatment program during the study. They cannot take psychiatric
           medications.

        -  rate their alcohol craving, depression, and anxiety throughout the study.

        -  have fear conditioning and extinction sessions that use noise and mild electric shock.
           Some take place during a functional MRI (fMRI) scan. Participants will lie in a machine
           that takes images, while they perform tasks.

        -  listen to recordings that describe stressful events. They will rate their feelings and
           have blood drawn through an intravenous (IV) line.

        -  have their hormone response to stress tested. They will take a pill and get a hormone
           via an IV, then have blood drawn.

        -  Healthy volunteers will:

        -  have 2 inpatient stays, each lasting a few days. They will answer questions about how
           they feel.

        -  have fear conditioning and extinction sessions, including fMRI.

        -  have blood drawn several times.

      Objective:

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the role of early life stress (ELS),
      alcohol dependence (AD), and their interaction in psychophysiology and neural mechanisms of
      fear conditioning and extinction.

      The main outcome of interest is fear extinction, as measured by laboratory-based and fMRI
      paradigms. Secondary objectives of the study include: (1) explore the impact of early life
      stress on behavioral and endocrine response to challenge procedures among individuals with
      AD; (2) explore differences in reward processing, emotion processing, and neural response to
      alcohol beverages as measured by fMRI as a function of AD and ELS; and (3) examine the
      relationship between fear extinction and clinical outcomes in our patient sample.

      Study Population:

      The study sample includes four groups: 1) treatment-seeking individuals with alcohol
      dependence (AD) and ELS exposure; 2) treatment seeking individuals with alcohol dependence
      without ELS exposure; 3) healthy social drinkers without alcohol use disorders (AUD) but with
      ELS exposure; and 4) healthy social drinkers without AUD and without ELS exposure. Target
      accrual for each of these groups is 25.

      Design:

      All participants will be evaluated for fear conditioning and extinction using two separate
      paradigms: an out-of-the scanner shock conditioning extinction procedure that utilizes
      acoustic startle, and a shock conditioning extinction procedure combined with fMR imaging
      that utilizes galvanic skin response. In addition, the two alcohol dependent groups will be
      evaluated for several biomarkers including a guided imagery procedure designed to induce
      stress and/or craving for alcohol, and an assessment of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
      axis function.

      Outcome Measures:

      Primary outcome measures include fear-potentiated startle responses and galvanic skin
      responses; and neural BOLD fMRI responses during presentation of fear associated stimuli.
      Secondary and exploratory measures in alcohol dependent subjects include measures of distress
      and craving for alcohol in response to guided imagery scripts; neuroendocrine stress
      responses and clinical outcomes (alcohol consumption and self-reported anxiety and mood
      symptoms).
