    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to compare the efficacy and safety of Roxane's clotrimazole
      troches vs. Mycelex troches in HIV positive patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis, where
      this condition has been diagnosed by clinical examination and confirmed by fungal culture.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented HIV positive status

          -  Clinical examination of oropharynx is consistent with diagnosis of oral Candidiasis
             (such as creamy, white, curdlike patches or erythematous lesions on mucosal surfaces)

          -  Findings on direct microscopic examination (Gram Stain or potassium hydroxide smear)
             consistent with Candida species or positive fungal culture for Candida species, with
             culture obtained in the 2 days preceding initiation of therapy with the study drug

          -  Male or female patients ≥ 18 years

          -  For women of childbearing potential: negative blood or urine pregnancy test and
             agreement to use adequate contraception (investigator's discretion) while on study
             drug

          -  Mental status allows comprehension of instructions for troche administration

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Sings of symptoms suggestive of esophageal Candidiasis (such as dysphagia or
             odynophagia) unless the results of an endoscopic evaluation of the esophagus are
             negative

          -  Presence of perioral lesions only

          -  Use of other antifungal agents within 5 days of enrollment to the study

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  History of hypersensitivity to imidazole or azole compounds

          -  Patient unwilling or unable to be followed at the study center for the duration of the
             study (3 weeks)

          -  Patients has received an investigational drug in the last 30 days

          -  Treatment with another investigational drug is planned within the next 3 weeks
