  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      West Nile virus (WNV) is considered an emerging virus in the United States, and infection can
      lead to severe illness in older adults. This study will evaluate the safety of and immune
      response to a live West Nile virus vaccine (WN/DEN4Δ30) for the prevention of West Nile
      encephalitis in adults 50 to 65 years old.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      WNV is the leading vector-borne cause of viral encephalitis in the United States. Severe
      illness is most common in older adults, and in this population, the virus can cause
      hepatitis, meningitis, and encephalitis leading to paralysis, coma, and death. WNV illness is
      a public health issue and is an emerging disease in the United States. This study will
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live attenuated West Nile/dengue chimeric virus
      vaccine (WN/DEN4Δ30) for the prevention of West Nile encephalitis in adults 50 to 65 years
      old.

      This study will enroll healthy adults, 50 to 65 years old, who have no history of previous
      flavivirus infection. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the WN/DEN4Δ30
      vaccine or placebo vaccine at study entry (Day 0). At the entry visit, participants will
      undergo a medical history review, physical examination, blood collection, and vital sign
      measurements; female participants will also take a pregnancy test. Participants will then
      receive their assigned vaccine, and they will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes after the
      vaccination for monitoring. Participants will record their temperature and symptoms 3 times a
      day for 16 days after each vaccination. Additional study visits will occur on Days 3, 6, 8,
      10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, and 150. These visits may include the same study procedures
      that occurred at the entry visit. At a study visit on Day 180, participants will receive
      another dose of their assigned vaccine. Additional study visits will occur on Days 183, 186,
      188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 201, 208, 236, 270, and 360. All study procedures after the second
      vaccination will be the same that occurred after the first vaccination.
