    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact that treatment with a cellular
      concentrate derived from an individual's own fat, known as the stromal vascular fraction
      (SVF), has on the quality of life of people with Parkinson's disease (PD). SVF contains
      components with &quot;regenerative&quot; properties, including stem cells that may be capable of
      ameliorating specific disease conditions. This study is designed to evaluate quality of life
      changes in individuals with PD for up to 12 months following SVF treatment.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Overall Quality of Life Over the Course of a 12 Month Period as Measured by the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQUALIF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline over the course of 12 months using participants' assessment of their overall quality of life. Mean scores will be used for baseline (day 0) and all interviews up to month 12 (months 1, 3, 6, and 12). Answer options are graded according to one of seven various five-point Likert response scales.</description>
