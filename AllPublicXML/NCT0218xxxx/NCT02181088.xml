  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess two new malaria vaccines, ChAd63 RH5 and MVA RH5, at
      different doses and alone or in combination. The study will enable us to assess the safety of
      the vaccines and the extent of the immune response in healthy volunteers. We will do this by
      giving volunteers one or two vaccinations, doing blood tests and collecting information about
      any symptoms that occur after vaccination. This is the first trial to use these vaccines in
      humans.

    <time_frame>240 days</time_frame>
    <description>P. falciparum RH5-specific immunogenicity will be assessed by a variety of immunological assays. These may include ex vivo ELISpot assays for interferon gamma and flow cytometry assays, as well as antibody ELISAs, functional antibody assays and B cell analyses. Other exploratory immunological assays including cytokine analysis, other antibody assays, anti-adenovirus antibodies, DNA analysis of genetic polymorphisms potentially relevant to vaccine immunogenicity and gene expression studies amongst others may be performed at the discretion of the Investigators.</description>
