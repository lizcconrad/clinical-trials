  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the SIMCA study was to analyse the impact of structured medication
      counselling by community pharmacists on medication adherence, economic, clinical and
      humanistic outcomes of depressed primary care patients who started a new treatment with
      antidepressants.

      A clustered RCT was set up in the Surplus Network, a pharmacy chain in Flanders, Belgium. At
      the time of the start of the study, the Surplus Network included 97 pharmacies, in all five
      Flemish provinces, including Brussels. During pre-trial meetings, all pharmacists were
      informed about the SIMCA-study and instructed how to approach eligible patients.

      Randomisation was obtained at the pharmacy level by a computerized random-number generator,
      following a permuted block design (1:1). The Surplus Network contains a number of local
      pharmacy chains; stratiÔ¨Åcation was used to ensure equal distribution within local pharmacy
      chains.

      Pharmacists in the intervention group were trained in communication skills related to
      depression treatment counselling in groups of no more than 10 participants over a single day.
      In total, 10 training days were scheduled between November and December, 2010.

      Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if they started using at least one
      antidepressant drug, if they were at least 18 years old, if they were able to understand and
      complete Dutch questionnaires and if they could be reached by telephone for follow-up.
      &quot;Starting&quot; was defined as not having been prescribed antidepressants over the last six
      months, which was checked in the pharmacy records. If the patient gave verbal consent to the
      pharmacist, to be contacted by the research team, the patient was provided with written and
      oral information about the SIMCA project and a consent form. At the same time an automatic
      e-mail was generated from the pharmacy software to inform the research team about the
      patient's willingness to be contacted about the study. The patient was contacted by the
      research team, as soon as possible to give more information about the study, to ask for
      informed consent and to schedule a first telephone survey interview. If the patient wished to
      participate, he/she completed the consent form, and sent it back with the included
      postage-paid envelope addressed to the research team. Upon receipt of the consent form, the
      recruited patient's prescribing doctor was contacted and asked to complete and return a brief
      questionnaire to provide the diagnosis and its severity related to prescribing
      antidepressants.

      Telephone survey interviews based on validated scales were used to collect data at the start
      of treatment (as close as possible to the time of recruitment), after one month, three months
      and six months of treatment.
