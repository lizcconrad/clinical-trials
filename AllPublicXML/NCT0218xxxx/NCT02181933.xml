  <brief_title>Efficacy of Nevirapine Compared to ZDV + 3TC Administered in Labor and Again at Postdelivery in HIV Positive Women</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Prospective Randomised Open Label Clinical Trial to Determine the Efficacy of Nevirapine, Compared With a Combination of ZDV + 3TC, in Decreasing the Peripartum Mother to Child Transmission of HIV. Women, Who Present After 38 Weeks Gestation or in Labour After 35 Weeks Gestation and Who Are Anti-retroviral Naive, Will be Included.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of nevirapine versus ZDV+3TC
      (Zidovudine + Lamivudine), when administered in labor and again at postdelivery, in reducing
      peripartum mother to child transmission of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus).

      The secondary objective was to assess the overall HIV transmission rate between the 2 groups
      (intrauterine, intrapartum and postpartum up to 6 weeks) as well as to explore the
      relationship between infection and timing of maternal dose relative to birth, infant feeding
      method, maternal peripheral blood viral load, and other potential risk factors for
      transmission.

      Following the introduction of the second and third Amendments to the Protocol, 2 substudies
      were added. The objectives of these substudies were to evaluate the frequency of
      resistance-conferring mutations to nevirapine (Amendment 2) and to ZDV+3TC (Amendment 3); to
      determine whether there was a reversion of any resistant virus to the wild type; and to
      determine if the resistant virus was transmitted from the mother to the child.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women who present after 38 weeks gestation or in labour after 35 weeks
             gestation who are tested HIV positive. Estimated gestational age will be determined by
             one or more of the following:

               -  Reliable menstrual history, which corresponds with uterine size

               -  Physical examination

               -  Estimated fetal weight

          -  A consent form for the mother and neonate will be signed by either the mother or the
             guardian prior to inclusion
