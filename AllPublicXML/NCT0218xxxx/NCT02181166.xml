  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myofascial pain considerably affects women undergoing treatment for breast cancer, is
      characterized by the presence of myofascial taut bands and trigger points. This study aims to
      evaluate the effects of ischemic compression, high-voltage electrical stimulation and
      rehabilitation of kinesio in women with myofascial pain following treatment of breast cancer.
      This is a randomized blind controlled study. For this, we invited 60 volunteers undergoing
      treatment for breast cancer, randomized and allocated into three groups: G1 (cinesioterapia),
      G2 (ischemic compression cinesioterapia +) and G3 (high voltage electrical stimulation
      cinesioterapia +). The stance, the plantar pressure distribution and the balance will be
      assessed by means of photogrammetry and baropodometry respectively. Myofascial trigger points
      will be assessed with the use of infrared thermography, algometry and numerical rating scale
      of pain (END). Moreover, the quality of life of the volunteers will be assessed by the
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B +4). The volunteers will undergo 10
      sessions of treatment, and reassessed at the end of treatment and after thirty days.
      Normality test is used to verify data distribution and consistent statistical test for proper
      intra and comparisons between groups, being thus considered two factors in the comparisons,
      time and group. A significance level of 5% is assumed.

    <description>Same protocol group kinesiotherapy + high voltage electrial stimulation with two rectangular electrodes (3x5 cm) active silicon-carbon and an electrode rectangular dispersive (10x18cm) aluminum wrapped with a damp felt in water. The active electrodes are positioned in central myofascial trigger point of the upper trapezius muscle after application of water soluble gel. The dispersive electrode was placed in the lumbar region. The following parameters will be use: frequency of 10 Hz, twin pulses of 20μs to 100ms between pulses and the maximum voltage tolerated by voluntary until the motor threshold (visible muscle contraction) to increase every five minutes, totaling 30 minutes of stimulation. The negative polarity will be use.</description>

    <description>The volunteer will be subjected to the following protocol: These exercises involve stretching of the cervical, anterior and posterior chain of the upper trunk and active mobilization of the cervical, shoulder movements of flexion, extension, abduction and adduction of the shoulder and upper limb. The exercises lasted 50 minutes, with 10 minutes of walking, and stretching was performed with two repetitions of 20 seconds, and active mobilization exercises of three sets of eight repetitions and final relaxation of 10 minutes were performed.</description>
