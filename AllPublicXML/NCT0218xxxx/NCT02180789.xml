    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, prospective interventional study to assess the
      tolerability and efficacy of Harnalidge® OCAS® 0.4 mg in Taiwan patients who are unsatisfied
      with tamsulosin 0.2 mg for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated
      with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

      After obtaining informed consent, subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and not violating
      the exclusion criteria will be enrolled to receive Harnalidge® OCAS® 0.4 mg for treatment.
      The interventional period for the study is three months after the first date of enrollment or
      until the patients are discontinued the treatment of Harnalidge® OCAS®. All subjects will be
      instructed to contact the site if a patient's partner becomes pregnant during or within 90
      days from the discontinuation of dosing, the investigator should report the information to
      the sponsor as if it is an SAE.
