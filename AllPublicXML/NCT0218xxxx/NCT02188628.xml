  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Locally, stroke remains the 4th cause of death, causing 8.4% of deaths annually in Singapore,
      and a leading cause of neurological disability worldwide. Nearly 40% of the stroke survivors
      will require specialized rehabilitation. In recent years, robot-aided therapy has been
      proposed as a means of complementing traditional therapy to alleviate the burden on
      therapists and on the healthcare system. For shoulder/elbow rehabilitation, dozens of robots
      have been proposed in the literature but only half a dozen have been commercialized and
      typically none are seen in local clinics, due to exceedingly high costs. A novel, compact,
      inexpensive robotic interface, named 'H-Man', was recently designed and developed at NTU for
      experiments in motor control neuroscience. The H-man can generate computer-controlled force
      fields to assist or resist a subject's motion and is potentially an optimal trade-off between
      clinical efficacy and robotic complexity. A first prototype of the H-Man is available at
      NTU.The primary aim of this proposed project is to assess to what extent the investigators
      H-Man is suitable for rehabilitation purposes using a feasibility pilot clinical trial design
      involving stroke survivors. The investigators believe that H-Man can be used for
      neuro-rehabilitation of stroke patients with hemiparetic weakness, motor incoordination and
      motor ataxia of the upper limbs.In close cooperation between clinicians at the TTSH and NTU
      engineers, a portable version of the H-Man will be developed which will be tested in a 12
      subject Pilot study, refined and then used in a 44 subject Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)
      study. At the same time, the feasibility of H-Man integration for a pared down home use model
      will be assessed in 4 subjects.

      The investigators primary hypothesis is that sub-acute/chronic patients will exhibit
      clinically significant decreases of impairment when training with the H-Man combined with
      standard arm therapy on robot-measured scales and standardized clinical scales, at the level
      of elbow/shoulder after 18 sessions of training on the H-Man.
