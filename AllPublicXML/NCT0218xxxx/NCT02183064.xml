    <textblock>
      Study to compare the percentage of treatment successes or failures in patients randomized to
      meloxicam 7.5 mg vs. usual care prescription NSAIDs. Additionally, health care utilization,
      efficacy and safety of patients in a managed healthcare setting with osteoarthritis (OA) of
      the hip, knee, hand or spine will be assessed.

             within 30 days prior to entering the trial

          -  In the opinion of the investigator the patient has any disease or condition that may
             result in altered absorption, excess accumulation or impaired metabolism or excretion

          -  The patient has a history of recurrent peptic ulcer or history (within the past 6
             months) of gastrointestinal perforation, peptic ulceration documented by endoscopy or
