    <description>Soft Tissue Regeneration's L-C Ligament is an investigation, interventional device intended for ACL reconstruction surgery within 18 weeks of acute rupture of the ACL and no previous surgical treatment. The L-C Ligament temporarily replaces the human anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and provides a bioresorbable scaffold within and around which the native ACL will regenerate over time.</description>

    <description>Hamstring autograft is the active comparator for this study. Autograft tissue is the gold-standard treatment for primary ACL reconstruction.</description>

    <description>The L-C Ligament is a bioresorbable, three-dimensional (3-D) braided scaffold made from poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) fiber. One device is used to replace the ACL. The L-C Ligament is an interventional device. The L-C Ligament is comprised of three regions: (1) The femoral tunnel attachment site, (2) The ligament region (intra-articular zone), and (3) The tibial tunnel attachment site. For several months after surgery, the L-C Ligament replaces the function of the ACL. During this time, ligament tissue regenerates within and around the L-C Ligament, which is slowly absorbed and replaced by the ACL.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Hamstring Autograft</intervention_name>
    <description>The gold-standard treatment for ACL reconstruction is autograft tissue. Autograft is a piece of tendon harvested from another part of the patient's body, such as the hamstring or kneecap. In this study, the hamstring tendon from the back of the thigh of the injured (target) leg will be harvested and surgically transferred to replace the torn ACL. The attachment of the autologous tendon in the femoral and tibial bone tunnels will utilize techniques that are similar to those for the L-C Ligament. Over time the replacement tendon resorbs and a new ACL is regenerated.</description>
