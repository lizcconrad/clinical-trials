      This study will assess the efficacy of products, implants, and procedures for knee and hip
      replacement.

      This registry will prospectively collect a core set of data on patients undergoing knee or
      hip replacement. This registry will include a variety of different products, implants,
      technologies and procedures. The registry will also collect any adverse events/complications
      that occur during or following these surgeries. This database can also be utilized in the
      future to answer research questions, by retrospectively going back through the data. This
      information also may go to insurance companies or hospitals for quality measurement and
      metrics reporting. The data will be utilized to develop strategic treatment pathways that
      will improve patient care. Ultimately, the goal of the registry is to enhance the
      understanding of treatment associated with knee and hip replacement and the resulting patient
      outcomes. The registry will also be used to provide quality measurement and metrics
      reporting.
