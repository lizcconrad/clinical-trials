        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female volunteers according to the following criteria: Based upon a
             complete medical history, including the physical examination, vital signs (Blood
             Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)), 12-lead ECG (electrocardiogram), clinical laboratory
             tests

             the trial)

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

        For female subjects only:

          -  Positive pregnancy test, pregnancy or planning to become pregnant during the study or
             within 2 months after study completion

          -  No adequate contraception during the study and until 1 month after study completion,

             surgical sterilisation (including hysterectomy). Females, who do not have a
             vasectomised partner, are not sexually abstinent or surgically sterile will be asked
             to use an additional barrier method (e.g. condom, diaphragm with spermicide)
