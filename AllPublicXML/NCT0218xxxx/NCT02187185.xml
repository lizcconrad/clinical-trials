  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study has 2 aims. One aim is to see if saliva testing can show if a person has
      healthy gum tissue, gingivitis, or one of three degrees of periodontitis - mild, moderate, or
      severe. The second aim is to examine the effect of the Sonicare Elite/Flexcare toothbrush on
      periodontitis.

    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial to determine clinical and inflammatory benefits of Sonicare
      Flexcare tooth brushing following experimental induction of biofilm overgrowth in various
      periodontal conditions.

      This research study has both a Diagnostic Aim and a Treatment Aim. Aim #1 is to examine the
      utility of candidate inflammatory biomarkers within saliva to discriminate between health,
      gingivitis, mild, moderate and severe periodontis; and to discriminate between active versus
      inactive states of periodontal disease to see if these basal levels can predict the clinical
      response to biofilm overgrowth among various periodontal conditions; Aim #2 is to extend the
      claim of the anti-inflammatory and anti-infective efficacy of the Sonicare/Elite-Flexcare as
      compared to manual brushing to include 4 levels of periodontal disease [BGI-G, P1, P2 and
      P3].

    <description>Arm 1 participants will abstain from brushing and flossing teeth in selected sites which will typically be one maxillary and mandibular posterior sextant during a three week, no-hygiene phase via placement of acrylic stents. After the stent-induced biofilm overgrowth (SIBO) induction, the resolution phase of the study will involve a randomization that places half of the subjects on the Sonicare/Elite/Flexcare toothbrush. Thus, the resolution phase is a RCT designed to treat SIBO in subjects with varying levels of disease. Participants will reinstate normal full mouth oral hygiene and daily plaque control, exclusive of flossing, with dispensed dentifrice and toothbrush. Participants will be followed for four weeks during SIBO resolution.</description>
