    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct an observational investigation of a novel care path
      used to manage emergency department (ED) presenting syncope patients on an outpatient basis.

      OBJECTIVES To conduct a prospective observational study assessing a unique outpatient care
      model in which syncope patients are provided with, and trained to use, a wearable
      defibrillator prior to discharge from the emergency department (ED). Observational data will
      be collected to assess the logistics of equipping patients with the device and providing
      training in the ED, and the ability of patients to receive follow-up care on an outpatient
      basis. In addition, data will be collected to confirm that the device meets expected safety.
      The experience gained from this stage of the study will be used to guide future studies of
      device's functionality enhancements and definitive device safety and efficacy.

      STUDY POPULATION Participants will be patients presenting to the ED following a syncope event
      which has been defined as cardiac, or potentially cardiac, i.e. undiagnosed in nature.

      INTERVENTION A wearable defibrillator optimized for short-term ambulatory use with adhesive
      electrodes will be prescribed for up to 14 days of use following emergency department
      discharge or until the physician responsible for the subject's care defines an alternative
      treatment plan.

      STUDY DESIGN This is a single-arm feasibility study.

      STUDY SIZE The study will enroll a minimum of 50 and a maximum of 80 subjects. A maximum of
      20 centers will be used for enrollment.

    <measure>Percentage of time rhythm monitoring by the Short-term Wearable Defibrillator (SWD1000) is compromised due to ECG noise.</measure>
    <time_frame>Device use is expected to last at least 24 hours and no more than 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of time that the SWD1000 is able to effectively monitor the subject's rhythm status is the primary safety measure. It is expected that monitoring will be inhibited by noise no greater than 2% of the time worn and monitoring using single lead analysis will be no greater than 5% of the time worn.</description>

          3. Either one of the following profiles(A or B) apply:

        A. ED workup indicates that the patient may have experienced syncope that is cardiac in
        nature (any one or more of the following apply:

          -  History or diagnosis of structural heart disease

          -  History of cardiovascular disease

          -  Age ≥ 40

          -  Palpitations experienced pre-syncope

          -  Major ECG abnormalities:

               -  QRS-duration greater than 140 ms

               -  PR-interval greater than 200 ms

               -  Non-specific repolarization abnormality

          -  Syncope experienced without any warning

          -  Syncope experienced while supine

          -  Syncope during exercise B. ED workup does not indicate a clear cause of the syncopal
             event

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clear diagnosis of non-cardiac syncope (e.g. orthostatic hypotensive syncope,
             vasovagal syncope, carotid sinus syncope, situational fainting)

          2. An active implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)

          3. An active unipolar pacemaker

          4. Significant risk or suffering a cardiovascular event such as:

               -  Symptoms of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure

               -  ED diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome

               -  Having required resuscitation in response to the index syncopal event

               -  Advanced directive prohibiting resuscitation (DNR)
