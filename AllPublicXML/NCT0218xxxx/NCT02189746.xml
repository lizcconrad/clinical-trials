      The overall hypothesis is that better adherence to Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) in combination
      with existing WHO thermoregulation care will reduce the incidence of moderate hypothermia
      (32-36 degrees C) or severe hypothermia (&lt;32.0 degrees C) in preterm infants (32-36 6/7 weeks
      of gestational age) when compared with routine WHO thermoregulation alone.

      The overall hypothesis is that better adherence to Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) in combination
      with existing World Health Organization (WHO) thermoregulation care (warm delivery rooms,
      immediate drying after birth, KMC whenever possible, early and exclusive breastfeeding,
      postponement of bathing and weighing, appropriate bundling, and use of air incubator, radiant
      warmer, or heat mattress if the neonate develops hypothermia) will reduce the incidence of
      moderate hypothermia (32-36 degrees C) or severe hypothermia (&lt;32.0 degrees C) in preterm
      infants (32-36 6/7 weeks of gestational age) when compared with routine WHO thermoregulation
      alone.

    <description>Infants will receive the standard WHO thermoregulation care with encouragement from study personnel to keep infant in Kangaroo Mother Care for as much as possible until 1 hour of birth. In KMC, the naked newborn infant with cap and diaper will be placed prone on mom's bare chest with blanket covering infant's back. All infants will be resuscitated as usual per Neonatal Resuscitation Program guidelines and hospital standard practices. The nursing staff will supervise mother-infant when mother is sleeping with infant in KMC. If infant becomes hyperthermic (&gt;38 degrees Celsius), the infant will be removed from KMC and routine bundling practices will be used. The infant's temperature will be taken via axillae with a digital thermometer at one hour of age.</description>
