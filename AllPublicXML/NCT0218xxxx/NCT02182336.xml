  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial was to quantify the effect of oral single-dose (480 mg) and
      steady-state BI 201335 NA (240 mg BID) on intestinal and hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) and
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) probe drugs as a means of predicting drug interactions. The AUCs for
      the probe drugs caffeine, warfarin, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, midazolam, and digoxin were
      assessed.
