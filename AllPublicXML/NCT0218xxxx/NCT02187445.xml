  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute and chronic pulmonary complications with concomitant inflammatory response are a
      leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). Acute
      chest syndrome (ACS), defined broadly as an increase in respiratory effort, fever and new
      radiodensity on chest x-ray, is a major cause of death in children and adults with SCD. There
      is a high rate of ACS in children between 1 and 4 years of age that is associated with an
      asthma diagnosis, and children with ACS events before 4 years of age have a 50% rate of being
      hospitalized for either ACS or pain within 1 year of admission. For children with SCD that
      develop ACS, the investigators propose that the use of budesonide inhalation suspension (BIS)
      will attenuate pulmonary inflammation after an ACS episode and will decrease future
      vaso-occlusive pain and ACS episodes. Through a single-arm prospective feasibility trial and
      in preparation for a limited-institution randomized trial, the investigators plan to test the
      following primary hypothesis for a phase III definitive trial: In children with SCD admitted
      to the hospital for an ACS episode between 1 and 4 years of age, low dose BIS for 6 months
      will result in a 50% reduction in the recurrent incidence rate of ACS or pain requiring
      hospitalization. Through this trial, the investigators will determine the acceptability of
      and adherence to BIS in the study population. The investigators will track respiratory
      symptoms in cases versus controls over 6 months. Finally, the investigators will explore the
      impact of BIS on biological correlates (sVCAM-1).

    <description>Specific Aim 1: To determine the acceptability of budesonide inhalation suspension (BIS) 0.5 QD for 6 months for children with SCD that develop ACS between 1 and 4 years of age (n=10). We will determine the proportions of eligible families who were willing to participate and families that enrolled and elected to stay throughout the six months of the trial. We will also assess adherence to BIS using the Morisky scale; this will be our primary outcome. If the participation rate for the trial is less than 60%, the dropout rate is greater than 20%, or if our adherence rate is poor as measured by the Morisky scale, then alternative strategies for recruitment, retention and adherence must be considered.</description>

    <description>Specific Aim 2: To explore the impact of BIS on biological correlates of inflammation. For this purpose, a blood sample measurement will be taken at baseline, at 12 weeks (between 8-16 weeks) and at 24 weeks (between 20-28 weeks), as per routine clinic visits. The research visit will be coordinated with the standard care visits and phlebotomy. Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), a marker of chronic vasculopathy, will be the primary measure of vascular injury. Secondary outcome measures will include additional inflammatory markers (sP-selectin, sE-selectin, IL-1B, IL-6, TNFÎ±, IFN-y, leukotrienes).</description>
