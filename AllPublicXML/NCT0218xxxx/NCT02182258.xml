  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of BIBF 1120
      administered as intravenous (iv) infusions of 1, 3, 10, and 20 mg, and to assess the absolute
      bioavailability of orally administered 100 mg BIBF 1120 as soft gelatine capsules. A
      secondary objective was the exploration of the pharmacokinetic (PK) of BIBF 1120 after single
      iv dosing, including dose proportionality.
