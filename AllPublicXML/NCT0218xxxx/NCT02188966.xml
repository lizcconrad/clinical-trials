  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Emergency Department Regional Hospital Horsens a monitor will display Geographical
      Information System data (GIS data) for all ambulances with the hospital as final destination.
      The location, estimated time of arrival (ETA) and urgency code for the ambulances will be
      showed. Furthermore the patient's name, personal identification number and the primary
      message received by the emergency medical dispatch center resulting in ambulance dispatch
      will be displayed. This may enable the coordinating nurse to optimize timing of the ad hoc
      trauma team and medical emergency team activation. The teams are activated if the patient's
      condition is assessed to be of the highest urgency and/or severity - triage 1 or &quot;red&quot;. The
      coordinating nurse makes this assessment on the basis of information from the ambulance
      personnel and makes the decision to activate the team and when to do it. In this study the
      investigators want to examine if the availability of GIS data in the emergency department
      results in reduced waiting time for the members of the trauma team and medical emergency
      team. The study will be conducted as a before and after study.

    <description>Triage 1 or &quot;red&quot; of a patient indicates the highest urgency and/or severity of illness. If the coordinating nurse at the emergency department assess that a patient on the to the department is &quot;red&quot; the trauma team or medical emergency team is activated. The time is registered automatically in the internal telephone system of the hospital. The patient's time of arrival is registered manually. The time from activation to arrival can then be calculated and is defined as &quot;Waiting time&quot;.</description>
