  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics and
      demonstrate bioequivalence of a reconstituted new lyophilized formulation of caplacizumab for
      subcutaneous (s.c.) injection as compared to an equal nominal s.c. dose of the reference
      liquid formulation of caplacizumab.

      The secondary objective of the study is to compare the safety and tolerability, and the
      pharmacodynamic parameters of the new formulation with those of the reference formulation.
