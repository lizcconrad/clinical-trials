  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the leading causes of hip arthritis is developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). DDH
      can lead to major damage in the hip joint and may result in hip arthritis later in life.
      Patients recruited into this study will be undergoing corrective hip surgery within the next
      6 months with a goal of preventing further hip problems down the road. This study is being
      done to see how well a newer type of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) detects hip cartilage
      damage compared to an older but well validated MRI method.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The start of arthritis can first be detected in certain molecules in the joint. Proteoglycan
      is a molecule that is important to cartilage structure, and is lost as arthritis develops.
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the best ways to image cartilage, and an
      investigational MRI technique that has shown great promise in detecting proteoglycan amounts
      is called T1-rho.

      In this study, patients with hip dysplasia will undergo this investigational MRI in addition
      to a well validated MRI method (called dGEMRIC) to see if T1-rho is as good as dGEMRIC at
      detecting cartilage damage. The dGEMRIC MRI requires an injection of a contrast agent, while
      the T1-rho MRI does not. If the T1-rho is shown to be as useful as the dGEMRIC method it can
      then be used to look at cartilage damage in the hip without having to have an injection.

    <description>Our aim is to correlate T1-rho with dGEMRIC values in painful hips with underlying DDH. To achieve this, we will assess whether T1-rho MRI values correlate with dGEMRIC MRI values in hips with DDH.</description>

    <measure>Change in WOMAC Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) is widely used as a standard assessment of arthritis in the hip joint. The Index is self-administered and assesses the three dimensions of pain (5 items), joint stiffness (2 items), and Physical Function (17 items) in hip osteoarthritis using 24 questions. The Likert Scale uses the following descriptors for all items: none, mild moderate, severe, and extreme. These correspond to an ordinal scale of 0-4. Scores are summed with higher scores indicating worse pain, stiffness, and function.</description>

    <measure>Change in iHOT 12 Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-12) is a questionnaire that has recently been validated in young active patients with early hip disease. The questionnaire is self-administered and assesses across 4 domains: symptoms and functional limitations; sport and recreational activities; job-related concerns; and social, emotional, and lifestyle concerns. Questions are answered by marking a visual analog scale between 2 anchor statements (100-mm scale). The total score is calculated as a simple mean of these responses ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the best possible quality-of-life score.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo 2 different MRIs of the affected hip. Both MRIs assess hip cartilage degeneration. A contrast agent, Gadolinium, will be used to visualize cartilage during the MRI. The contrast agent is injected through an intravenous (a small plastic tube inserted into a vein in the patients' arm) before the MRI.</description>
