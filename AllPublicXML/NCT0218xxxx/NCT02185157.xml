  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The training of a secondary task while walking, whether it is reasoning activities, memory or
      motor tasks, may enhance automation, walking performance, and postural control and, thus,
      minimize the risk of falls influenced by the walking patterns variability. However, the
      literature is scarce regarding the influence of dual-task training on changes in gait
      parameters.

      The purpose of this prospective, blinded randomized controlled trial is to compare the short-
      and long-term effects of dual-task and aerobic training on gait stride variability and
      superior cerebral functions of independent community-dwelling elderly women.

      The participants will be randomly allocated into either experimental or control groups.The
      experimental group will undertake 50 minutes/day of dual-task training, three times/week over
      12 weeks, totaling 36 sessions, whereas the control group will receive the same doses of
      aerobic training. At baseline, after 18 and 36 sessions, and 12 weeks after the cessation of
      the interventions, researchers blinded to group allocations will collect the outcome
      measures.The interventions will be delivered by trained physical therapists.

      Primary outcome will include gait stride variability, which will be assessed by a movement
      analysis system: the GaitRite® system, during cognitive and motor dual-tasks, at both normal
      and fast speeds. Secondary outcome measures will include a battery of global and specific
      cognitive function tests.

      The findings of this trial may help better understand whether cognitive-motor interventions
      with older adults, when compared to traditional aerobic training, would result in greater
      improvements in gait under dual-task conditions and lead to improvements in cognitive tasks.
      Furthermore, the findings could potentially bring important insights regarding the impacts of
      improvements in walking abilities and cognition.

      Socially speaking, the findings could potentially bring important insights regarding the
      impacts of improvements in walking abilities and cognition. If the elderly maintain safe gait
      patterns that prevent falls, they could reach self-sustained community participation and
      consequently reduce the burden of care on the family and caregivers. Additionally, the public
      health system may ultimately receive important positive economic and social impacts. This
      clinical trial may be reproduced in research and clinical practice environments.

    <description>The change in gait stride variability will be measured by a movement analysis system: The GaitRite® system that gives another gait parameters as speed, step width, double support, etc.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, at the sixth week as a intermediary measure, final and three months after the end of study months later</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure will be assessed by the Brazilian version of the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) that is a global cognitive assessment instrument with high sensitivity and specificity to detect mild dementia and differentiate frontotemporal dementia from Alzheimer's disease. This instrument assess orientation and attention, memory, verbal fluency, language and visual-spatial skills.
A maximum score of 100 is calculated from five sub-scores: Orientation and attention (18 points); memory (26 points); verbal fluency (14 points); language (26 points); and visual-spatial skills (16 points) [26]. The validation study of the English version of the ACE-R proposed a cut-off score of 88 points for higher sensitivity (sensitivity 94 %, specificity89 %). A cut-off score of 82 points was proposed for better specificity (specificity: 100 %, sensitivity: 84%), with population-based norms also available for the Brazilian population.</description>

    <measure>Changes on Stroop test or the Color-word interference test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,at the sixth week as a intermediary measure, final and three months after the end of the study</time_frame>
    <description>This test consists of two tasks. For the first task, the participants are asked to name, as fast as possible, the color seen in a square with various color circles. Then, the same colors are shown as written words, instead of the circles. However, the colors are printed in an incongruent way, that is, the word is written in red, but the color is yellow and the participant should be able to identify the color, and not read the word. The examiner takes note of the time and the number of mistakes. The Stroop effect is said to be the difference between the time of execution of the first and the second tasks. Both the time, in minutes, and the number of errors will be registered for analyses.</description>

    <measure>Changes on Trail making test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at the sixth week as a intermediary measure, final and three months after the end of the study</time_frame>
    <description>The trail making test is a classic executive function test and several studies have shown the relationships between its scores with gait abilities. Overall, the test assesses the time to execute visual-motor tasks, as a dimension of a cognitive flexibility test.The test includes two parts:The first consists of drawing a simple line that requires that the individual links numbers 1 to 25, consecutively.The second requires the same consecutive number linking, but now have the interference of letters, so that the linkage is made by alternating letters and numbers. It is also a time-measured test and the time, in minutes, to conclude both parts, will be registered for analyses.</description>

    <description>Dual-task training, includes 18 sessions model of cognitive and 12 motor dual-task exercises model, were administered in groups of four participants in a comfortable environment, without distraction effects. The 50-minute sessions included 30 minutes of motor dual-task exercises, and then, the participants were divided into pairs. The first pair performed free walks during 10 minutes at their maximal speeds, while the other received individual cognitive dual-task training for the same time, and these activities will be exchanged, so that all pairs could walk and receive cognitive training.</description>
