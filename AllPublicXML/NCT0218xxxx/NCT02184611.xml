  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies to date provides substantial evidence for the effectiveness for UMEC 62.5 microgram
      (mcg) as a long term maintenance therapy for the treatment of COPD; this study further
      evaluates the efficacy and safety of UMEC 62.5 mcg administered once-daily (OD) for 24 weeks
      via a NDPI compared with placebo in Asian subjects with COPD. Over approximate 27 weeks of
      entire study duration, 10 study clinic visits will be conducted on an outpatient basis.
      Pre-screening visit will be conducted for the informed consent form, review demography, COPD
      history and COPD concomitant medications. Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria at
      screening will complete a 7 to 14 day Run-in period and will be provided with
      albuterol/salbutamol as rescue medication on an &quot;as-needed&quot; basis. Further, subjects will be
      randomized to the UMEC 62.5 mcg or matching placebo in a 1:2 ratio for 24 week treatment
      period. A follow up for adverse event assessment will be scheduled approximately 7 days after
      the treatment period or the Early Withdrawal Visit.

             absence of hormone replacement therapy. However, in questionable cases, post-menopause
             status may be confirmed by analysis of a blood sample with follicle-stimulating
             hormone (FSH) &gt;40 million international units per milliliter (MIU/ml) and estradiol
             &lt;40 picogram (pg) /ml (&lt;140 picomole per liter (pmol/L) as confirmatory. OR Child

          -  COPD History: An established clinical history of COPD in accordance with the
             definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society as follows:
             COPD is a preventable and treatable disease state characterized by airflow limitation
             that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and is
             associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or
             gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it also
             produces significant systemic consequences.

          -  Tobacco Use and Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of
             cigarette smoking of &gt;= 10 pack-years [Number of pack years = (number of cigarettes
             per day /20) x number of years smoked (e.g. 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10
             cigarettes per day for 20 years both equal 10 pack years)]. Former smokers are defined
             as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Note: Pipe
             and/or cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack-year history. COPD patients who only
             use a pipe and/or cigar are not eligible.

          -  Severity of Disease: A pre and post-salbutamol/albuterol FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt;0.70 and a
             pre and post-salbutamol/albuterol FEV1 of &lt;=70% of predicted normal values calculated
             using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III reference equations at
             Visit 1.

          -  Dyspnea: A score of &gt;=2 on the Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale (mMRC)
             at Screening (Visit 1)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy: Women who are pregnant or lactating or are planning on becoming pregnant
             during the study.

          -  Asthma: A current diagnosis of asthma.

          -  Other Respiratory Disorders: Known alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, active lung
             infections (such as tuberculosis) and lung cancer are absolute exclusionary
             conditions. A subject, who in the opinion of the investigator has any other
             significant respiratory conditions in addition to COPD should be excluded. Examples
             may include clinically significant bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis
             or interstitial lung disease.

          -  Other Diseases/Abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic,
             immunological, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             haematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled and/or a previous history of cancer
             in remission for &lt;5 years prior to Visit 1 (localized carcinoma of the skin that has
             been resected for cure is not exclusionary). Significant is defined as any disease
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk
             through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the
             disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

          -  Chest X-Ray: A chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan that reveals evidence of
             clinically significant abnormalities not believed to be due to the presence of COPD. A
             chest X-ray must be taken at Visit 1 if a chest X-ray or CT scan is not available
             within 6 months prior to Visit 1.

          -  Contraindications: A history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any
             anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2-agonist, lactose/milk protein or
             magnesium stearate or a medical condition such as of narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic
             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the study physician
             contraindicates study participation or use of an inhaled anticholinergic.

          -  Hospitalization: Hospitalization for COPD or pneumonia within 12 weeks prior to Visit
             1.

          -  Lung Resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior
             to Screening (Visit 1).

          -  12-Lead electrocardiogram (ECG): An abnormal and significant ECG finding from the
             12-lead ECG conducted at Visit 1, including the presence of a paced rhythm on a
             12-lead ECG which causes the underlying rhythm and ECG to be obscured. Investigators
             will be provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist
             to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility. Specific ECG findings that precluded
             subject eligibility are as listed. An ECG finding that would preclude a subject from
             entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead tracing that is interpreted as, but not
             limited to, any of the following: Sinus tachycardia ≥120 bpm*Note: sinus tachycardia
             ≥120bpm should be confirmed by two additional readings at least 5 minutes apart. Sinus
             bradycardia &lt;45bpm*Note: Sinus bradycardia &lt;45bpm should be confirmed by two
             additional readings at least 5 minutes apart.Multifocal atrial
             tachycardia.Supraventricular tachycardia (&gt;100bpm).Atrial fibrillation with rapid
             ventricular response (rate &gt;120bpm). Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response

             monomorphic). Ventricular flutter. Ventricular fibrillation. Torsades de Pointes.
             Evidence of Mobitz type II second degree or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block.
             AV dissociation. Trifascicular Block. For subjects with QRS duration &lt;120 ms: QTc(F)
             ≥450msec or an ECG that is unsuitable for QT measurements (e.g., poor defined
             termination of the T wave). For subjects with QRS duration&gt;120: QTc(F) ≥480msec or an
             ECG that is unsuitable for QT measurements (e.g., poor defined termination of the T
             wave). Myocardial infarction (acute or recent) * Note: Evidence of an old (resolved)
             myocardial infarction is not exclusionary. The study investigator will determine the
             medical significance of any ECG abnormalities not listed above.
