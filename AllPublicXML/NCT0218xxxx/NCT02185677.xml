    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to compare the score to the Behavioral Dysexecutive
      Syndrome Inventory (BDSI) between Parkinsonian Multiple system Atrophy MSA-P patients and
      cerebellar Multiple System Atrophy (MSA-C) patients matched on disease duration, age (± 3
      years) and sex .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder which is characterized by
      a variable combination of parkinsonism, cerebellar dysfunction, autonomic failure, and
      additional signs. According to the consensus criteria for the diagnosis of MSA, the presence
      of dementia is considered an exclusion criteria. However, several studies have reported
      cognitive impairment in patients with MSA, dominated by a dysexecutive syndrome. Some studies
      have compared the cognitive profile of MSA-P patients and MSA-C but any have studied the
      behavioral dysexecutive syndrome in this population. In 2010, the GREFFEX has established
      criteria for dysexecutive syndrome and described two distinct parts: the dysexecutive
      syndrome and cognitive behavioral dysexecutive syndrome. Our clinical impression is that
      according to the type of MSA, the dysexecutive syndrome seems to be different : the MSA-P
      patients seem to have a cognitive dysexecutive syndrome and the MSA-C patients a behavioral
      dysexecutive syndrome.

      We want to compare the BDSI score between MSA-P patients and MSA-C patients matched on
      disease duration, age and sex The specific involvement of the cerebellum in behavioral
      disorders could explain the behavioral differences experienced by clinicians caring for these
      patients but never demonstrated. The presence of these disorders could have an impact on the
      relationship between the patient and the caregiver. In addition, few studies have correlated
      with cognitive imagery data. Therefore, the exact areas involved in cognitive and behavioral
      MSApatients remain poorly understood.
