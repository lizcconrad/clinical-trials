  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilonidal sinus is a chronic inflammatory disorder of intergluteal sulcus. The disease seen
      in between 15-35 years of age and 3-4 times more in males. The incidence of the disease is
      found as 8.8% in Turkish soldiers. The disorder mainly affects the quality of life.

      There are numerous methods in surgical treatment of Pilonidal sinus. The main difference in
      between those methods is the closing of the defect that occurs after the excision of the
      sinus tract. The defect can be closed by primary sutures or it can be left for secondary
      healing. Nowadays, the recurrence rate of flap procedures are lower therefore, flap
      procedures are commonly used. However, it has been reported that there is no difference
      between flap procedures and tension free primary closure. This result triggered the
      controversy that; if the healing side is tension free, midline suturing may have no
      importance. The aim of this study is to compare the results of 3 different surgical
      procedures used in treatment of pilonidal disease.
