  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetic Analysis in obese children after one single oral dose of Pantoprazole. The PK parameters for pantoprazole will be measured from Cmax, Tmax, Ka, Kel, AUC, VDss/F &amp; CL/F</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The pharmacokinetic blood samples will be 1.0 ml each and collected at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, &amp; 8 hours after receiving one dose of Pantoprazole study drug. For those subjects with the poor metabolizer CYP2C19 genotype, an additional PK sample will be obtained at 12 hours after dosing.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The CYP2C19 genotype and its association with CYP2C19 phenotype (PK) will be measured with the analysis of a blood sample</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>At screening a 1.0 ml venous blood sample will be placed into a tube for CYP2C19 genotyping. For those subjects with the poor metabolizer CYP2C19 genotype, an additional PK sample will be obtained at 12 hours after dosing to better characterize the drug disposition profile in those with two non-functional alleles.</description>

             assent requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of pantoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole or rabeprazole within 48
             hours prior to dose of study drug

          2. Use of fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, ketoconazole, ticlopidine, felbamate, topiramate,

             seven days prior to dose of study drug

          3. Consumption of food after midnight on the day of the baseline visit

          4. Symptomatic asthma

          5. Type I diabetes

         11. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, makes
             participation unadvised or unsafe.
