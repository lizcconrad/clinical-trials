      Primary objective: to evaluate the procoagulant effect of TNK-tPA compared to rt-PA and
      streptokinase, administered to patients with AMI, by measuring the concentration of TAT at 2
      hours after the start of treatment versus baseline values.

      Secondary objective: change from baseline in concentration of TAT at 6 and 24 hours; change
      from baseline in concentration of D-dimers, F1+2, PAI-1, PAP at 2, 6 and 24 hours. Incidence
      of adverse events (AE's), in -hospital complications, major or minor bleedings and serious
      adverse events.
