      Aim of the study protocol is to evaluate in a prospective investigation of health statistics
      if the dysfunctions of the lower urinary tract in women aged between 18 and 40 years may be
      the result of past urinary pediatric dysfunction. The aim is to be able to identify the &quot;risk
      conditions&quot; which, if treated properly in early childhood, to help avoid debilitating
      problems that manifest themselves as adults and possibly to implement a strategy of
      prevention.

      The choice of this age group is due to the fact that it allows for easier retrieval of data,
      as it is presumed that the concerned can more easily remember their history of pediatric and
      / or have parents still young enough to ask for such information. The problems of urinary
      disorders in childhood era have been the subject of increased attention by pediatricians from
      the end of the 70s, therefore, history taking may be more complete.

      A study by Fitzgerald evaluated female subjects with mean age of 56 Â± 9 years, and therefore
      our study aim is to investigate an age group that does not appear in the literature to
      supplement these findings, already reported.

      Ultimate goal is the need to raise awareness of Pediatric Urologists to interact with adult
      Urologists in order to implement a shared strategy for the management of patients with
      problems of impaired bladder function in order to improve the future lower urinary tract
      function.

      Materials and Methods: A self administered questionnaire will be used in accordance with the
      guidelines of the International Children's Continence Society. The questionnaire consists of
      two parts: the first explores the history of urological clinic patient until the age of 14,in
      order to evaluate any symptoms reported in a specific category of typical dysfunction of
      childhood; the second part refers to the present together with urological disorders of sexual
      function which, as emerges from the data of the literature may be of relevance urological
      diseases detectors. The data obtained will then be subjected to statistical calculations by
      which will evaluate the significance of the symptoms present in childhood in relation to
      their penetrance in various forms of adult diseases dysfunctional bladder and / or sexual
      abuse, with the prediction of the evolution of the same.

      The questionnaire is anonymous in order to protect privacy. The questions that comprise it
      have been partly extracted from the questionnaire validated by the International Children's
      Society Continent and partly made by the authors of this study on the basis of the scientific
      evidence.

      Patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Urogynecology Urology Clinic,
      University of Perugia, while the healthy controls will be recruited by submitting a
      questionnaire to the women chosen to sample a healthy population of Graduate Schools found in
      the framework of Urology, Pediatrics and Pediatric Surgery, University of Perugia.

      The Investigators defined that the statistically significant number of healthy and
      pathological subjects can not be less than 200 units per reference category.

      The time duration of the collection of anamnestic data depend on the ability of the authors
      of this research in finding the subjects to be analyzed.

      There are no conflicts of interest to declare, no drugs or medical equipment will be tested .
