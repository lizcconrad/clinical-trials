        Inclusion

          1. Written informed consent is obtained from each patient's parent or legal guardian and
             written assent is obtained from each patient.

          2. The patient is a boy or girl 10 through 17 years of age.

          3. The patient is within the 2.5 to 97.5 percentile for body mass index (BMI) on the
             basis of age and sex and is within the following weight range, as appropriate:

               -  boys: more than 27 kg and 127 kg or less

               -  girls: more than 27 kg and 111 kg or less

          4. The patient has a documented history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, or
             any condition for which the use of antipsychotic medication (eg, risperidone,
             olanzapine, aripirazole, haloperidol, etc.) is warranted and/or administered. Note:
             Patients currently receiving treatment for any condition must be on a stable regimen
             (dose and frequency) for a minimum of 28 days before administration of ADASUVE.

          5. The patient is in good general health as determined by a complete medical history
             (including psychiatric and respiratory), clinical laboratory tests (include
             hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), physical examination, body weight,
             12-lead ECG, spirometry, vital signs measurements (blood pressure [systolic and
             diastolic], heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate), pulse oximetry, chest
             auscultation, neurologic examination, suicidality assessment, and concomitant
             medication usage inquiry.

          6. Female patients who are postmenarche or sexually active must have a negative pregnancy
             test result, must have exclusively same sex partners or be using an acceptable method
             of contraception, and must agree to continued use of this method for the duration of
             the study and for 30 days after discontinuation of ADASUVE. Acceptable methods of
             contraception include abstinence or an intrauterine device (known to have a failure
             rate of less than 1% per year).

          7. The patient has negative alcohol test and urine drug screen (UDS) results. A positive
             UDS result with appropriate medical explanation (eg, prescribed amphetamines) may be
             permitted after consultation with the medical monitor. Note: The UDS will also detect
             the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). A positive result for THC may be permitted
             after discussion with the sponsor if the result is low and is consistent (eg, positive
             at all predose assessments). If a patient tests negative for THC at screening, the
             result must remain negative at check-in for the patient to be eligible for study
             participation.

          8. The patient and parent/legal guardian must be willing and able to comply with study
             restrictions and to remain at the investigational center for the required duration at
             each visit.

        Exclusion

                  other drugs that affect blood pressure or reduce heart rate)
