      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety of multiple doses of DWP-450
      (Botulinum purified neurotoxin, Type A) Injection in treatment of moderate to severe
      glabellar lines in adult subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three hundred and fifty subjects will be enrolled and injected with the study drug DWP-450
      over the course of the 365 day study.

      Subjects with moderate or severe glabellar lines at maximum frown on the 4 point Glabellar
      Line Scale (GLS, 0=none, 1= mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe), as judged by the investigator, will
      be eligible for injection with DWP-450. After each injection, subjects will be followed and
      are eligible for a repeat injection if their GLS is ≥2 at maximum frown, as judged by the
      Investigator. If a subject does not have a GLS≥2 they will be followed monthly until eligible
      for repeat treatment.

      Subjects may receive up to a maximum of 4 treatments and will be followed for 365 days from
      initial treatment.

    <description>The subject is to be injected intra-muscularly into a total of five sites: the mid-line of the procures muscle, the inferomedial aspect of each corrugator muscle and the superior middle aspect of each corrugator, at least 1 cm above the bony orbital rim. Each site is injected with 0.1 ml (4U), for a total of 20 U and 0.5 ml.</description>

          -  Subject is able to provide informed consent and comply with study instructions

          -  Subject has moderate to severe glabellar lines on maximum frown as assessed by the
             investigator using the GLS

          -  Subject is willing and able to complete the entire course of the study

        Exclusion Criteria (A subject must not meet the following exclusion criteria in order to be
        eligible for enrollment in the stud)y:

          -  Previous treatment with botulinum toxin of any serotype in the forehead area within
             the last 8 months

          -  Previous treatment with any facial aesthetic procedure (e.g. injection with fillers,
             chemical peeling, photo rejuvenation) in the glabellar area within the last 12 months

          -  Previous insertion of permanent material in the glabellar area

          -  Planned treatment with botulinum toxin of any serotype in any other body region during
             the study period

          -  Any surgery in the glabellar area including surgical removal of the corrugator,
             procerus, or depressor supercilii muscles or a combination of these, or scars in the
             glabellar area and the surrounding areas (including eye brow)

          -  Energy based or cryo-therapy based treatment of facial muscles superior to the lateral
             canthus

          -  Any other planned facial aesthetic procedure during the trial period, superior to the
             level of the lateral canthus (subjects can continue with their usual skin care
             routine)

             them apart

          -  Marked facial asymmetry

             participation or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the Investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             study

          -  Pregnant or sexually active female subjects who are of childbearing potential and who
