  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to confirm long-term efficacy and safety of LCI699 for the treatment of
      patients with Cushing's disease. It is a pivotal trial intended to support the registration
      of LCI699 for the treatment of patients with Cushing's disease in the EU, Japan, and other
      countries.
