  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find the maximum tolerated dose of a drug called
      romidepsin when given with a treatment regimen called GemOxD. GemOxD is a routine treatment
      for certain types of lymphoma, and involves the administration of three drugs: gemcitabine,
      oxaliplatin, and dexamethasone. In addition to finding the maximum tolerated dose of
      romidepsin, the investigators want to look at the side effects of these drugs when given
      together, as well as how the lymphoma responds to this treatment.

    <description>Three participants will be treated at each dose level. If 0/3 patients experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT), 3 patients will be treated at the next dose level. If a DLT attributable to the treatment is experienced in 1 of 3 patients, three more patients (for a total of six participants) will be treated at that dose level. If no additional DLTs are observed at the expanded dose level (i.e. 1 of 6 with DLT), the dose will be escalated. Escalation will terminate as soon as two or more participants experience any DLT attributable to study combination, at a given dose level. If 2 or more DLTs occur at the starting dose level, a decreased dose level will be explored at dose level -1.
There will be no more than 2 patients dosed for the first time within the same week, and patients in the next higher cohorts will not be enrolled until the last patient of the lower cohort has completed the DLT monitoring period, defined as 21 days after first dose of Cycle 1 therapy.</description>
