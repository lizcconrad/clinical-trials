  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG) is an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor approved in the United States, Canada,
      Australia and EU. A dispersible tablet has been developed for pediatric use as an alternative
      to the granule formulation, already in development, and the approved film-coated tablet. This
      is a single-center, randomized, open-label, 5-way crossover study in healthy adult subjects.
      The study will evaluate the relative bioavailability of five dosing regimens: 20 mg DTG
      pediatric granules (Treatment A) and of DTG 20 mg dispersible tablets (DTG 20 mg DT) after
      dispersed in: low mineral content(LMC) water (Treatment B); dispersed in CONTREX™ mineral
      water (Treatment C); dispersed in low mineral content water and consumed after standing for
      30 minutes (Treatment D) and dispersed in CONTREX mineral water and consumed after standing
      for 30 minutes (Treatment E). Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected
      during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after the last dose of
      study drug. CONTREX is a trademark of Nestlé Waters Corporation.
