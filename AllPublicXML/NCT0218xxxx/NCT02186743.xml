  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the clinical trial portion of this study is to assess whether an
      individualized dietary plan based on a commercial food sensitivity assay provides specific
      benefit in a randomized controlled trial in adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel group, randomized control trial, powered to assess changes in validated
      outcomes in adult patients with symptomatic irritable bowel syndrome. Subjects will receive
      dietary counseling and be asked to adhere to dietary instructions for 4 weeks. Assessments
      will occur at baseline, 4-weeks, and 8-weeks post-baseline.

    <description>The IBS-GIS is a single item assessment of overall IBS symptoms. It poses the question to study participants &quot;Compared to the way you felt before you entered the study, have your IBS symptoms over the past 7 days been:&quot; Subjects respond on a scale of 1-7 where: 1 = Substantially Worse, 2 = Moderately Worse, 3 = Slightly Worse, 4 = No Change, 5 = Slightly Improved, 6 = Moderately Improved, 7 = Substantially Improved.</description>

    <description>The IBS-QoL is a 34-item measure assessing the degree to which IBS interferes with patient quality of life. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale and a linear transformation yields a summed score with a theoretical range of 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating better quality of life.</description>
