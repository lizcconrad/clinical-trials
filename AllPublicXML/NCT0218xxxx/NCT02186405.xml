  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal and cardiovascular effects of subclinical hypothyroidism, defined by a high TSH and
      normal T4 are less known and the indications for treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism are
      subject to controversies.

      The investigators propose to assess whether the hormone replacement for subclinical
      hypothyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease is beneficial for hemodynamic and
      renal functions and which mechanisms are involved.

      Isotopic measurements of glomerular filtration and renal blood flow and an hemodynamic
      evaluation by transthoracic echocardiography and flow-mediated vasodilation will be carried
      out before and 6 months after substitution.

    <textblock>
      Animal experimental hypothyroidism is associated with renal and hemodynamic abnormalities. In
      human, exact measurements of GFR showed a decline in GFR after thyroidectomy and an increase
      in GFR and renal blood flow after hormone replacement. Renal and cardiovascular effects of
      subclinical hypothyroidism, defined by a high TSH and normal T4 are less known and the
      indications for treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism are subject to controversies. A
      retrospective study suggests that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism may slow the
      degradation rate of renal function estimated by MDRD. However, the potential hemodynamic
      benefit of treatment has not yet been studied.

      The investigators propose to assess whether the hormone replacement for subclinical
      hypothyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease is beneficial for hemodynamic and
      renal functions and which mechanisms are involved.

      Isotopic measurements of glomerular filtration and renal blood flow and an hemodynamic
      evaluation by transthoracic echocardiography and flow-mediated vasodilation will be carried
      out before and 6 months after substitution. This open prospective study will include 16
      patients in order to detect an increase of 1.2 standard deviation for the measured glomerular
      filtration.
