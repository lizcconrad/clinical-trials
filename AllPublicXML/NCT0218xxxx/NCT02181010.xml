    <textblock>
      The BHCK study will develop, implement, and evaluate a community-based obesity prevention
      program, which operates at multiple levels of an urban food system (policy, wholesaler,
      corner stores, carryout, household, individual; in Baltimore, MD), and will improve the
      healthy food supply chain to increase affordability, availability, purchasing and consumption
      of healthy foods within low-income, minority neighborhoods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our overarching goal is to develop and evaluate a community-based obesity prevention program,
      which operates at multiple levels of an urban food system (policy, wholesaler, corner stores,
      carryout, household, individual; in Baltimore, MD), and will improve the healthy food supply
      chain to increase affordability, availability, purchasing and consumption of healthy foods
      within low-income minority neighborhoods. Our research will include stakeholders/ partners at
      different levels, e.g., the policy, wholesaler, retailer, adult caregiver, and individual
      child levels, and then develop, implement, and assess a two year multi-level systems-based
      child obesity prevention strategy targeting minority and low-income children (predominantly
      AA). Thirty low-income, predominantly AA geographic zones will be identified (&quot;healthy eating
      zones&quot;). Half of these zones will be randomized to intervention, while the other half will be
      control. Within each intervention zone we will work with 3-5 small food stores and prepared
      food sources to increase access to healthy foods through wholesaler discounts, display point
      of purchase promotional materials, and provide nutrition and food preparation education
      targeting youth and caregivers. We will work with local policymakers to institutionalize and
      sustain these changes.

      The project will evaluate the impact of the program on: a) healthy food pricing and
      availability, b) low income African American adult food purchasing and preparation, and c)
      low-income African American youth diet, and associated psychosocial factors.

    <description>A food environment checklist (a modified from the NEMS questionnaire) will be conducted before and after the intervention to assess healthy food availability in both intervention and comparison neighborhoods/ stores.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Household Healthy Food Purchasing</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>At the adult consumer level, we will use an Adult Impact Questionnaire to examine trends in frequency of purchasing of specific promoted foods pre- and post-intervention. We will score the questionnaire to look at individual food items, as well as at changes in groups of foods developed previously (e.g., healthy and unhealthy food scores, and based on Healthy Eating Index categories).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary intake of urban, African American youth participants (specifically total calories and fat consumption.)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Block 2004 Kids Food Frequency questionnaire to assess differences in dietary intake from pre- to post intervention. Data from the FFQ will include total caloric intake and fat intake, along wit other dietary markers.</description>

    <description>The intervention is a multi-level, multi-component intervention designed to increase access to and consumption of healthier foods in low-income, urban, minority neighborhoods. Intervention components will occur at the policy level; food wholesaler level; small food retail outlet level; neighborhood level; household level.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Control</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Similar to many community- based public health research programs, the control arm will not receive any intervention components during the initial intervention period. However, after all assessments are completed they will receive a 'delayed intervention' protocol, where the community receives the intervention elements as described in the intervention arm after assessment measures have been completed.</description>

    <description>Intervention components will occur at the policy level (working within Baltimore City policy makers to sustain intervention components, and develop virtual simulations of the Baltimore food environment); food wholesaler level (working with wholesalers to stock healthier food items and provide pricing incentives to storeowners on healthier foods); small food retail outlet level (working with corner store and carry-out owners to stock, promote, and sell healthier foods and beverages); neighborhood level (working with Baltimore college students to deliver nutrition intervention sessions to younger youth in recreation centers in intervention neighborhoods); household level (providing a text messaging and social media program that provides parents and caregivers tips for healthier eating in their respective neighborhoods).</description>
