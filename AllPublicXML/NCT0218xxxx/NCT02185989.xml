  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early mobilization (from the first day if possible), first passive and then passive and
      active, is recommended for critically ill patients in whom it reduces the duration of
      mechanical ventilation, the length of hospital stay, improves functional status, muscle
      strength and quality of life after hospital discharge. The early addition of leg bicycling on
      a cyclo-ergometer is now part of common practice in the ICU. It can preserve or improve
      muscle strength and further increase the beneficial effects of early mobilization. Electrical
      muscle stimulation of the quadriceps, is practiced in some intensive care units, and it
      should, in theory, also through an improvement of muscle strength, increase the beneficial
      effects of early mobilization.

      We hypothesized that early quadriceps electrical stimulation and early work on a
      cyclo-ergometer associated with a standard protocol of early passive/active mobilization in
      the ICU may improve muscle function and reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation, length
      of stay, the number of readmissions and improve the quality of life in the mid term in
      critically ill patients, as compared to a conventional protocol of early passive/active
      mobilization.
