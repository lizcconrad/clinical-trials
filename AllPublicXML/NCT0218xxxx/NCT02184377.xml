  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mandarin Chinese phonemically distinguishes four tones, with Tone 1 having high-level pitch,
      Tone 2 high-rising pitch, Tone 3 low-dipping pitch, and Tone 4 high-falling pitch The same
      segmental context carries different meanings depending on the tone. The function deficit of
      cricothyroid (CT) muscle, innervated by external branch superior laryngeal nerve (eSLN),
      would impair the speech tone adjustment. The defect in tone adjustment may interfere with the
      communication function in Mandarin Chinese speaker more than other language users. This may
      explain while peripheral unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) patients with eSLN injury had
      worse outcomes than those with sole recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. The neuromuscular
      control of laryngeal muscle can be evaluated by laryngeal electromyography (LEMG). The
      investigators have utilized a quantified LEMG (denoted Q-LEMG) in their previous research to
      measure the neuromuscular control of thyroarytenoid- lateral cricoarytenoid (TA-LCA) adductor
      complex. However, the task to measure the CT muscle function by Q-LEMG has not been developed
      yet. It is of thus of utmost interest to develop a standardized task to measure the
      neuromuscular function of CT muscle in Mandarin speakers. In Mandarin speaking patients with
      UVFP, the lexical tone influence from CT muscle can be discovered by the technique. The
      investigators also want to measure the lexical tone correction by conventional laryngoplasty
      and its influence in CT muscle activity. The data of lexical tone and its correlation with CT
      contractile activity is important in attempting pitch adjust artificial electrolarynx.

      Purposes: 1. Searching for a standard task to measure CT function by Q-LEMG. 2. Correlate the
      data among Q-LEMG activity of CT muscle, lexical tone in Mandarin and vocal cord position and
      its impaction on vocal functions. 3. Detect the influence of lexical tone from conventional
      laryngoplasty for peripheral UVFP with eSLN injury.

      Study designs: The current research is a two-year study. In the first year, the investigators
      will develop a standardized task for quantified LEMG analysis for CT muscles which were
      controlled by eSLN. In the second year, patients with acute UVFP will be enrolled into the
      study. By comprehensive evaluation including Q-LEMG analysis, the impact of injection
      laryngoplasty on tone adjustment can be identified. The results between UVFP with or without
      CT muscle damage will also be compared.

      Predictive outcomes: 1. Developing a standard tool, Q-LEMG, to measure the function CT
      muscles. 2. Achieve the correlation of the neuromuscular control of lexical tone and CT
      muscle. 3. Analyze the impaction of early temporary injection on speech modal tone in
      Mandarin speakers and neuromuscular control in CT muscles. 4. Applying the data of tone and
      CT signals to future pitch controlled artificial electrolarynx animal models.
