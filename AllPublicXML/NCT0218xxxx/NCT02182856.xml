    <textblock>
      Study to compare the effects of nebulised salbutamol or ipratropium alone in patients with
      COPD with those of combined salbutamol and ipratropium nebuliser solution on arterial oxygen
      saturation (SaO2) and to characterise patients with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease) at risk of significant arterial oxygen desaturation following nebulised salbutamol.
