    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the effects of self-administered acupressure therapy for
      psychiatric in-patients with constipation

      Two main research questions include:

        1. What are the effects of the standardized self-administered acupressure program on
           reducing those adult psychiatric patients' symptoms of constipation?

        2. What are the psychiatric patients' (participants') perceived benefits and limitations of
           self-administered acupressure on management of their constipation?

      In this study, the participants who met the study criteria and completed the baseline
      measurement would be randomly assigned into either the self-administered acupressure program,
      or a sham control group who receive a placebo, non-acupoint pressure. The null hypotheses of
      this study are:

        1. There is no significant difference between the acupressure and sham group immediately
           and/or two weeks after the completion of intervention on patients' symptom severity of
           constipation; and

        2. There is no significant difference between the acupressure and sham group on patients'
           perceived quality of life at immediately and two weeks after treatment completion.

      Main outcomes of this study include the Constipation Assessment Scale (CAS), Patient
      Assessment Constipation Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAC-QoL), and the socio-demographic
      and clinical data collected by a trained assessor who was blind to the intervention
      assignment of the participants. These data would be measured at recruitment (baseline) and
      immediately (Post-test 1) and two weeks (Post-test 2) after completion of the 10-day
      intervention. Qualitative focus group interview data would be collected after Post-test 2 .

    <description>The Patient Assessment Constipation Quality of Life Questionnaire is a self-administered questionnaire for assessment of the magnitude and degree of interference associated with constipation symptomatology. The scale is composed of 28 items categorized into four subscales, including dissatisfaction (5 items), physical discomfort (4 items), psychosocial discomfort (8 items), and worries and concerns (11 items). Subjects rate each item on a 5-pont likert scale, ranging from '0 = none of the time or not at all to 4 = all of the time or extremely'. The overall and subscale scores can range from 0 to 4, with a lower total score indicating a better health-related quality of life.</description>

    <description>A 10-day self-administered acupressure program was implemented by the participants who were adult psychiatric in-patients and randomly assigned into this treatment group. The patients would receive a 3-session training of this therapy conducted by a qualified acupressure therapist and each session lasted about an hour. They would be assessed by the trainer to ensure that they are able to identify the five acupoints and applied a constant and an appropriate pressure on each acupoint before actual implementation.</description>
