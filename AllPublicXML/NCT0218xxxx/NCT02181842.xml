    <textblock>
      The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the effects on glycemic control and to evaluate the
      safety of long-term use of pioglitazone tablets (Actos Tablets) in type 2 diabetic patients
      with inadequate glycemic control and a prior history of cerebral infarction.

      This survey was designed to evaluate the effects on glycemic control and to evaluate the
      safety of long-term use of pioglitazone tablets (Actos Tablets) in type 2 diabetic patients
      with inadequate glycemic control and a prior history of cerebral infarction.

      For adults, 15-30 mg of pioglitazone is usually administered orally once daily before or
      after breakfast. The dose should be adjusted depending on sex, age, and symptoms; however,
      the maximum daily dose should not exceed 45 mg.

    <measure>Frequency of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>For 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The frequencies of all adverse events observed during the observation period will be tabulated by symptom, type, and seriousness. In addition, the frequency of recurrence of cerebral infarction will be tabulated by time from first onset of cerebral infarction, risk factors for cerebral infarction, concomitant antihypertensive medications (if any), and concomitant antiplatelet/anticoagulant medications (if any).
Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or diseases temporally associated with administration of pioglitazone whether or not it was considered related to treatment. Among these, events that are considered as having a causal relationship with pioglitazone are defined as adverse drug reactions.</description>
