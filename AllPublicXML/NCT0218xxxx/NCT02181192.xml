    <textblock>
      PSA-recurrence prostate carcinoma is associated with two general problems.

        1. Localisation of PSA-recurrence is unconfident. In many cases it's not clear if a local,
           locoregional oder systemic relapse is available.

        2. There is no standard therapy proved by randomised clinical trials. Recommended
           radiotherapy starting with PSA-value &lt; 0.5 ng/ml according to german S3 guidelines is
           based on retrospective data.

      These difficulties may lead to a therapy potentially not adapted to patients situation of
      disease.This study aims to randomised examine if an instant radiotherapy of prostate
      PSA-recurrence (PSA-value between 0.2 - 0.99 ng/ml) or a delayed radiotherapy with additional
      imaging (PSA value &gt;= 1 ng/ml) including PET/CT and bone scintigraphy for reliable
      information about tumor location and expansion is beneficial regarding therapy efficiency,
      quality of life and social economic aspects.
