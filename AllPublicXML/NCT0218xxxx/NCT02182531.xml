  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to compare the bioavailable fraction of epinastine and pseudoephedrine when
      administered as a fixed dose combination in tablet form (new pharmaceutical formulation),
      with that obtained with each of these drugs when administered separately to healthy
      volunteers.
