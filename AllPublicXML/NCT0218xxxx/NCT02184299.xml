             antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA, or a second antibody test by a method other than ELISA at
             any time prior to study entry

          -  A CD4+ cell count of 100 cells/mm³ documented within 30 days of baseline visit. If a
             patient had a history of a clinical AIDS defining event, i.e. Pneumocystis carinii

             cells/mm³

          -  Patients could have either a) no prior antiretroviral therapy or b) prior

               -  Patients Optimizing Therapy: Patients who had responded with substantial drops in
                  HIV-RNA counts without reaching BLQ or patients who had failed their current
                  regimen and needed to change to a new drug regimen

               -  Patients Re-starting Therapy: Patients who were antiretroviral experienced but
                  had not received antiretroviral therapy in the previous three months before
                  enrolling in this study All antiretroviral experienced patients had to have been
                  on a stable regimen or for at least three months immediately prior to their
                  enrollment or they had to have been on no antiretroviral therapy for at least
                  three months immediately prior to their enrollment
