    <textblock>
      The investigators will investigate whether video-assisted informed consent is superior to
      routine discussion for cataract patients about risks, benefits and alternatives to receiving
      phacoemulsification cataract extract and intraocular lens implantation, and will determine
      whether video-assisted informed consent can reduce the work load of physicians.

      Patients with age-related cataract who scheduled for elective phacoemulsification cataract
      extract and intraocular lens implantation surgery and their physicians who on charge of these
      patients will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be randomized to the video assistance
      group watched a video in Cantonese or Mandarin explaining the surgery procedure and its
      risks, benefits and alternatives before discussion with their physicians. The control group
      will receive traditional verbal information and discussion from their physicians. A
      questionnaire for patients will be administered to assess the comprehension and satisfaction
      with the informed consent process before surgery.
