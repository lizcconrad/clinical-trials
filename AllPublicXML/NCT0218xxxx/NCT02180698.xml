  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of toll-like
      receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA)-stable-emulsion (SE) when given
      together with radiation therapy in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma that has spread
      to other parts of the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). TLR4
      agonist GLA-SE may stimulate the immune system to kill sarcoma cells. Radiation therapy uses
      high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving TLR4 agonist GLA-SE with radiation therapy may
      be a better treatment to treat sarcoma that cannot be removed by surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of weekly injections of GLA-SE (TLR4 agonist GLA-SE) in combination
      with palliative radiation in patients with metastatic sarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To look for preliminary evidence of efficacy at distant tumor sites following the
      combination of radiation and intra-tumor injection of GLA-SE.

      II. To analyze changes in tumor-immune infiltrates following radiation and intra-tumor
      injection of GLA-SE.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of TLR4 agonist GLA-SE.

      Patients receive TLR4 agonist GLA-SE intratumorally once weekly for 8 weeks. Within 2 weeks
      of starting treatment, patients also undergo radiation therapy over 2 weeks for a total of
      5-6 fractions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks for 6 months and
      then every 3 months for up to 1 year.
