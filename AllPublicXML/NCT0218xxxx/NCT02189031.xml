  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper limb amputation is a devastating injury that leaves many thousands of typically young
      and active individuals in the US to rely on artificial arms and hands to help restore their
      lost function. The investigators research is focused on helping these individuals to feel
      where their prosthetic limbs are moving without having to look at them by developing devices
      and approaches to provide sensory feedback of limb movement through the nerves that once
      served the missing limb.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the investigators research the investigators seek to understand the organization and
      (function/operation) of sensory neural systems in order to develop methods for restoring
      function to injured populations. One of the primary focus areas of the investigators research
      is working to integrate physiologically relevant sensory feedback with prosthetic limbs. To
      this end the investigators employ a variety of approaches that interweave disciplines such as
      electrophysiology, psychophysics, biomedical engineering and cognition. The investigators
      research team is composed of an interconnected and communicative network of clinicians,
      engineers, and scientists. This helps us to provide pathways from basic science discoveries
      that can be used to address clinical needs with transition directly to patient care.
