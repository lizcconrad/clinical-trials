  <brief_title>Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Multiple Rising Doses of BI 201335 NA in Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
  <official_title>Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Multiple Rising Oral Doses of 20 mg, 48 mg, 120 mg, and 240 mg Once a Day of BI 201335 NA (Oral Solution) in Healthy Male Subjects, in a Randomized Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Study</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective was to investigate the safety, tolerability and the pharmacokinetics (PK)
      of BI 201335 NA in healthy male subjects without Gilbert's syndrome or polymorphism (GS)
      following oral administration of a single dose (Day 1) and repeated doses (Days 4-24) of 20
      mg, 48 mg, 120 mg, and 240 mg. Additionally, the safety, tolerability, and the PK of the
      highest tolerated dose of BI 201335 NA (determined during the multiple-rising-dose phase)
      were assessed in healthy male subjects with GS over a 28-day continuous drug administration
      period.
