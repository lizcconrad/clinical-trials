  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a research study to learn about the safety and benefit of
      using a medication called buprenorphine for patients with difficult to treat depression. This
      research study is testing whether combining two medications will be effective in treating
      depression when initial treatment with just one antidepressant does not relieve the
      depressive symptoms; this is what is called &quot;difficult to treat depression&quot; or &quot;treatment
      resistant depression&quot;. The two medications the investigators are using are: an
      anti-depressant medication called venlafaxine extended release (venlafaxine XR), which is the
      generic form of Effexor, and buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is a medication that is FDA
      approved for the treatment of opioid dependence. The investigators are testing whether adding
      buprenorphine to venlafaxine XR enhances treatment response.

      We will consent approximately 100 participants, aged 50 and older, of both sexes and all
      races. Participation may last up to 32 weeks. We will utilize a clinical trial that has 3
      Phases. In Phase 1 we will treat participants with an approximate 12 week course of
      open-label venlafaxine XR. This is the same lead-in treatment as in our ongoing &quot;IRL Grey&quot;
      (&quot;Incomplete Response in Late Life Depression: Getting to Remission&quot;) multi-site R01 for
      late-life treatment resistant depression (LL-TRD), and we have found it to be highly
      successful. Participants who find relief from their depressive symptoms on venlafaxine XR
      alone will exit the study. Participants meeting criteria for an incomplete response (those
      still feeling depressed or withdrawn), will be randomly assigned to receive either low-dose
      buprenorphine or placebo augmentation of venlafaxine xr for 8 weeks (Phase 2), with the goal
      of achieving remission. There will be up to 3 combined positron emission tomography and
      magnetic resonance imaging scans (PET/MRI) during Phase 2 as well as one computerized
      tomography (CT) scan in order to determine the effects of buprenorphine on the brain. At the
      conclusion of Phase 2, the blind will be broken for all participants. The participants who
      were on placebo will be able to begin taking buprenorphine immediately for Phase 3
      (approximately 8 weeks). The participants who were already on buprenorphine in Phase 2 can
      continue to take it during Phase 3. Buprenorphine (BPN) will be tapered upon exiting the
      study, under the guidance of the P.I. The Phase 3 variations will allow all participants a
      chance to experience the benefits of buprenorphine (BPN). Efficacy and tolerability data will
      provide a clinically informative estimate of benefits and risks of buprenorphine augmentation
      for late-life treatment resistant depression (LL-TRD). We will randomize approximately 20
      subjects into Phase 2. Additionally, we will collect buprenorphine (BPN) plasma levels on all
      those randomized to explore a dose-effect relationship on treatment response.

      A small pilot study (ages 21 and up) of up to 5 healthy control subjects will be studied over
      a 2 week period in order to ensure all of our procedures are working and to determine that
      there are clinical effects from buprenorphine. Control subjects will undergo a baseline
      PET/MRI before taking buprenorphine. At least 24 hours after the imaging, control subjects
      will receive a small dose of BPN starting at 0.2 mg/day and will titrate up as tolerated to
      1.2 mg/day for the first week. Each subject will remain at approximately 1.2 mg/day for the
      duration of week 2. At the end of the 2 week period, subjects will undergo a second PET/MRI.
