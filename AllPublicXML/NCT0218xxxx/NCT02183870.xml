      EUCROSS is a phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of crizotinib in patients
      with adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring ROS1 translocations. Patients will be treated with
      250mg crizotinib bid until progression or intolerable toxicity.

      EUCROSS is a phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of crizotinib in patients
      with adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring ROS1 translocations. In individual treatment
      attempts and an ongoing phase I trial crizotinib has shown remarkable effects on this
      selected subgroup of lung cancer patients. Crizotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
      blocking the catalytic activity of rearranged ALK and ROS1 as well as MET. The patients
      eligible for the trial will be treated with 250mg crizotinib twice-daily. Tumor response to
      treatment will be assessed every 6 weeks by CT or MRI scans. In case of progression treatment
      beyond may be conducted if clinically indicated. To identify mechanisms of resistance to
      crizotinib treatment, an optional re-biopsy may be performed in these cases and fresh frozen
      tumor material will analyzed at the University of Cologne.

             least 2 weeks prior to initiation of study medication

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline
             phosphatase (AP) ≤ 2,5 x ULN or ≤ 5 x ULN in case of liver involvement
