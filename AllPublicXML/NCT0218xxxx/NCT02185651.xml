  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: the effectiveness of treatment of Pompe disease with rhGAA enzyme replacement
      therapy (ERT) is limited at least in part because patients develop antibodies against the
      provided rhGAA enzyme. Treatment with Zavesca® prior to infusion may dampen or eliminate the
      anti-rhGAA immune response in patients receiving ERT, thereby allowing for greater ERT
      efficacy.

      Treatment with Zavesca® before a enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) may decrease the severity
      of, or eliminate infusion associated reactions (IAR) in people with Pompe Disease receiving
      ERT.

      This Study is designed to assess the effects of Zavesca® as immunomodulatory therapy on
      anti-rhGAA immune responses in patients with Pompe disease, as well as their health and
      disease progression. Subjects will either receive Zavesca® at 100 mg or 300 mg dosing levels
      during study participation (n=3 @ 100 mg dosing; n=3 @ 300 mg dosing).

      The first 3 subjects enrolled will be prescribed 100 mg Zavesca® 60 minutes prior to ERT
      infusion. The subsequent 3 subjects enrolled will be prescribed 300 mg Zavesca® 60 minutes to
      ERT infusion.

      Eligible participants are on standard ERT for Pompe disease and have a history of infusion
      associated reaction. Travel to the study site in Gainesville, Florida is required for 3
      visits. Participants are prescribed medication Zavesca® and have blood tests, punch muscle
      biopsy, physical exams, and answer questionnaires over 3 months study participation.
