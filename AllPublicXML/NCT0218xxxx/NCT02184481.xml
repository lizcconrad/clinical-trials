  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is associated with impairments in executive functions, including working memory
      (WM) which is needed to maintain and manipulate goal-relevant information. Due to these WM
      impairments depressed individuals have difficulties inhibiting and shifting from irrelevant
      (negative) information and updating goal relevant information. This study explored whether
      training WM decreases these impairments and reduces clinical symptoms of depression, anxiety
      and rumination. Sixty-one students with an elevated score on the BDI-II, representing a
      dysphoric mood state, executed a working memory training (n = 34) or placebo training (n =
      27). Before and after training their depression, anxiety, rumination and working memory were
      assessed. Furthermore, they executed a working memory task while their pupil dilation was
      measured to assess their fatigue. Moreover, the investigators compared the dysphoric students
      with a healthy student population on all measures.

    <description>Participants executed the training for three weeks, three times a week, half an hour per session. The training was a game in which the participant was a person who had to become strong to fight with a fantasy figure. The person could become stronger when giving the right answers in eight different working memory tasks. The level adapted to the working memory capacity of the participant.</description>

The training was a game in which the participant was a person who had to become strong to fight with a fantasy figure. The person could become stronger when giving the right answers in eight different working memory tasks. The level in the placebo condition was easy and did not adapt to the working memory capacity of the participant.</description>
