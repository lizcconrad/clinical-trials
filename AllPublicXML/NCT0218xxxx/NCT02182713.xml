      The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether 2 puffs of fixed combination of aerosolized
      120 mcg salbutamol sulphate (equivalent to 100 mcg of the base) + 20 mcg ipratropium bromide
      confers significant additional protection against metacholine induced bronchoconstriction in
      asthmatic atopic patients when compared to 2 puffs of aerosolized 100 mcg salbutamol alone.
