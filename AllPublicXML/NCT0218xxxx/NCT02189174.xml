        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained prior to any screening procedures

          -  Phase I: Patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors, with measurable or
             non-measurable disease as determined by modified RECIST version 1.1 who have
             progressed despite standard therapy or be intolerant of standard therapy, or for whom
             no standard therapy exists, who have tumors harboring one of the following: confirmed
             PIK3CA mutation or amplification, PTEN loss of function, EGFR mutation, cMET
             activation and/or HER2 overexpression. Endometrial carcinoma will not be selected for
             any molecular status.

          -  Phase II: Patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors, with at least one measurable
             lesion as determined by modified RECIST version 1.1, who progressed despite standard
             therapy or be intolerant of standard therapy, or for whom no standard therapy exists,
             fitting in one of the following groups: Group 1: patients with PIK3CA mutated or
             amplified ER positive (ER+) breast cancer ; Group 2: patients with endometrial
             carcinoma (not selected for any molecular status); Group 3: patients with solid tumors
             (with the exception of PIK3CA mutant/amplified ER+ breast cancer and endometrial
             carcinoma) harboring PIK3CA mutation or amplification/any PTEN status; Group 4:

             PTEN loss of function/ PIK3CA wild type; Group 5: non-small cell lung cancer harboring
             cMET activation and/or EGFR mutation. Up to 3 lines of chemotherapy allowed in
             advanced/metastatic setting.
