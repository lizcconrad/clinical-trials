      Aim of the registry is to evaluate all colon capsule endoscopies performed in Germany. This
      is to investigate safety, quality assurance and quality control of colon capsule endoscopy.

      Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE, Pill Cam Colon 2, (Given Imaging Ltd, Yoqneam, Israel and Given
      Imaging EMEA, Hamburg, Germany) provides direct visualization of the colon mucosa, enabling
      the investigator to diagnose colonic disease. CCE is a complementary means to flexible
      ileo-colonoscopy andt safety, quality assurance and quality control of CCE is not well
      understood. There are about 15 000 investigations performed worldwide until now, but
      systematic data on performance in a community based setting are lacking.

      This study aims to investigate safety, quality assurance and quality control of colon capsule
      endoscopy.
