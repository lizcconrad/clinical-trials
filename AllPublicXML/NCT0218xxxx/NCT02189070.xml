      The purpose of this study is to determine the preference of patients regarding the approach
      for follow-up after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures. We hypothesize that
      patients prefer questionnaires for annual follow-up assessment when compared to telephone or
      email.

      Rationale: Assessment and reporting of long-term clinical follow-up after medical
      interventions is essential for transparency of medical care and its quality improvement.
      However follow-up adherence is a serious challenge in clinical trials. Taking the patient
      preference of the mode of follow-up into account is likely to enhance trial adherence, reduce
      withdrawals, and facilitate a longer follow-up duration. No data on patient preference of
      annual follow-up have been reported.

      Objective: To investigate the patient preference of approach to obtain follow-up information
      after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

      Study design: Single-center, prospective, observational registry

      Study population: All patients enrolled in the percutaneous coronary intervention studies
      TWENTE trial (a broad study population reflecting real-world PCI patients) and DUTCH PEERS
      trial (an all-comers population), who were treated at Thoraxcentrum Twente in Enschede
      between June 2008 and May 2012

      Intervention: All subjects will receive a questionnaire with questions regarding their
      preference with regards to the approach of acquiring follow-up information after PCI.

      Main study endpoints:

        -  The primary endpoint is the patient preference on how to be approached for annual
           follow-up after PCI procedures.

        -  Secondary endpoints include

             1. least preferred approach of follow-up

             2. the preferred number of follow-up moments per year

             3. the from the patients' perspective maximum acceptable number of questions to be
                answered

             4. the assessment of potential relationships between the most and least preferred
                approach of assessment and patient age, gender urgency of PCI treatment, and
                history of previous revascularizations
