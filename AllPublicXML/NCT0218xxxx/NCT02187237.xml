      The YOLO TOUCH consists of a console and multi-probes that are placed on the treatment area
      that emit laser light to reduce the circumference waistline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The YOLO TOUCH device is class II device intended for use in circumference reduction of the
      waist as a non-invasive, non-thermal, and low energy laser. Typical area of the body for use
      with the YOLO TOUCH is the abdominal area.

      The YOLO TOUCH low-level therapy device consists of a main console and 8 multi-probes that
      are constructed so that each probe contains 12 laser emission diode sources at a power output
      of 35mW per diode.
