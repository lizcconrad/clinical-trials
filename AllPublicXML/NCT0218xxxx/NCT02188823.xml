    <textblock>
      The study is a pilot, designed to provide data regarding the feasibility and acceptability of
      conducting such a study on a larger scale. The present study is a clinical trial assessing a
      programs to help people manage prediabetes and lose weight with a low-carbohydrate diet (LC)
      along with information about positive affect, mindful eating strategies, exercise, and sleep.

      Individuals with prediabetes will be assigned to the treatment group. Classes will occur
      online. Participants will be evaluated at 0, 8, and 16 weeks. Our main outcome of interest is
      HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin, a measure indicative of blood glucose levels and tied to diabetes
      severity) at 16 weeks.

    <description>Participants will be instructed to follow a low carbohydrate, ketogenic diet: carbohydrate intake 20-35 grams a day not including fiber. Foods permitted include: meats, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese, cream, some nuts and seeds, green leafy vegetables, and most other non-starchy vegetables. Because most individuals self-limit caloric intake, no calorie restriction will be recommended.
Participants will also be taught information about exercise, sleep, mindfulness, and positive affect practices. The mindfulness-based curriculum will focus on the following elements: training on topics such as mindful meditation, mindful eating, awareness of fullness and hunger signals, and taste satiety. The positive emotion curriculum will include: training on topics such as noticing and savoring positive events, gratitude, positive reappraisal, personal strengths, attainable goals, and acts of kindness.</description>

      <textblock>
        -  Inclusion criteria

               1. Self-reported clinical diagnosis of prediabetes occurring within the past year.

               2. Aged 18 years old and older

               3. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Diabetes Prevention
                  Recognition Program have a self-reported body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 24 kg/m2 (≥
                  22 kg/m2 if Asian).

               4. Willing and able to participate in the intervention such as having sufficient
                  control over their food intake. Must have the ability to make choices about the
                  food they eat; cannot have a lifestyle in which they eat out most of their
                  meals.)

          -  Exclusion criteria

               1. Unable to provide informed consent.

               2. Non English speaker. The intervention groups are conducted in English.

               3. No current use of insulin, no immediate plans to start or increase diabetic
                  mediations, and no use of diabetes medications besides metformin. Insulin and
                  other diabetes medications other than metformin can alter the safety of the
                  diets, so to ensure greater safety, we will exclude diabetics using insulin or
                  medications besides metformin.

               4. A substance abuse, mental health, or medical condition that, in the opinion of
                  investigators, will make it difficult for the potential participant to
                  participate in the intervention. Such conditions may include: cancer, liver
                  failure, unstable coronary artery disease, severe emphysema, binge eating
                  disorder or history of binge eating disorder, bulimia or strong history of
                  bulimia.

               5. Previous use or recent changes in medications that can interfere with the
                  measures used in the study: current use of insulin; use of systemic (oral or IV)
                  corticosteroids in the 1 month prior to enrollment or severe autoimmune disorders
                  or other conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, lupus), that are likely to
                  require these medications; and initiation of new class of psychiatric medications
                  in past 2 months. Such medications can alter measures used in our research, such
                  as assessments of markers of inflammation, or negatively influence the safety of
                  the diets.

               6. Pregnant or planning to get pregnant in the next 12 months, breastfeeding or less
                  than 6 months post-partum. The intervention is not designed for the particular
                  diet considerations during pregnancy and breast-feeding.

               7. Current use of weight loss medications or supplements such as Alli or
                  amphetamine-based drugs that are believed to have some effect on weight. Use of
                  weight loss aids by potential participants will be reviewed by a core study team
                  to determine whether participant would be eligible if they stop using the
                  substance.

               8. History of or planned weight loss surgery. The intervention is not designed to
                  address either the often substantial food intake limits that often result from
                  weight loss surgery or the significantly disordered eating that people who fail
                  this extreme intervention may have.

               9. Vegan or vegetarian. The intervention diets are more challenging for vegan and
                  vegetarian participants.

              10. No or very limited internet access at a computer. Must be able to complete the
                  online assessments and access the online class materials.
