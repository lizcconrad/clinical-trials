  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Massive bleeding is expected when performing distraction osteotomy for craniosynostosis
      patients. Since such operation is performed at very young age, many efforts are performed in
      order to reduce the total amount of bleeding and the transfusion during and after the
      surgery. Our study aims at correcting the coagulopathy from massive bleeding and transfusion
      during distraction osteotomy using continuous infusion of antifibrinolytic agent, tranexamic
      acid. Tranexamic acid infusion is determined according to the pharmacokinetic model, and the
      changes in coagulopathy will be defined using thromboelastography.
