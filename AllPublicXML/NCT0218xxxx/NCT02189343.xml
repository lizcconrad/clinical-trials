      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), if present, and to identify a recommended dose
      and schedule of ricolinostat administered in an alternative liquid formulation (ALF)
      (10mg/mL) in combination with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in patients with
      relapsed or relapsed-and-refractory multiple myeloma.

      To evaluate the safety and any anti-tumor activity of ricolinostat administered in
      combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone as treatment for patients with relapsed or
      relapsed-and-refractory multiple myeloma, including duration of response.

      To assess the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of all three medications administered in
      combination, and to assess the Pharmacokinetics of ricolinostat and pomalidomide
      specifically. An evaluation of the relationship between response and biomarkers relating to
      interacellular acetylation may also be completed.
