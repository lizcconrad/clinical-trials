  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in the degree of spasticity in gastrocnemius according to modified Ashworth scale (AS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The AS is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. In spastic muscles the resistance to passive movement is assessed. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension).</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline in patient percentage in groups by the degree of gastrocnemius spasticity according to modified Ashworth scale</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to day 90</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of decrease in M-response magnitude and area recorded from the lateral and medial gastrocnemius heads, from baseline values</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Electromyography: The amplitude of a compound muscle action potential (M-wave) is recorded. An electrical stimulation is considered supramaximal when the M-wave amplitude no longer increases while increasing the stimulus. The measurements include the M-wave amplitude and the negative peak area of the M-wave.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in the ratio of M-response recorded from the lateral and medial gastrocnemius heads and from tibialis anterior</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to day 90</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in angles and angle ratio of ankle joints at passive and voluntary extension</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to day 90</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in motor activity according to Gross Motor Function Classification Systems (GMFCS) criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to day 90</time_frame>
    <description>GMFCS is a 5-level classification system that is a standardized observational instrument for children with CP developed to measure change in gross motor function over time.</description>
