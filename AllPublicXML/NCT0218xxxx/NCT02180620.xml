    <textblock>
      With many medications we prescribe them relative to time of day or a meal. This study
      established if pre dinner vs post dinner exercise was more effective at altering post dinner
      glucose and triglyceride levels vs no exercise at all.

    <textblock>
      All participants completed three trials in a random order in which they consumed a
      standardized dinner meal with 1) no RE (NoRE), 2) pre-dinner RE (RE→M), and 3) post-dinner RE
      beginning 45 min after dinner (M→RE). Diet was standardized during the day of testing.
      Participants reported to the lab for testing sometime between 3 - 5:30 p.m. and upon arrival
      a venous catheter was inserted into a forearm vein. Frequent blood sampling, indirect
      calorimetry measurements, and subjective well-being measurements ensued for ~5.75 h while the
      participants were in the lab.
