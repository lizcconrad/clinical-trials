  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to perform a comprehensive molecular characterization of
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) in patients exposed to well-known or putative risk
      factors (such as asbestos) for this malignancy, in order to identify possible &quot;molecular
      signatures&quot; associated to such different risk factors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to distinct risk factors of the enrolled ICC patients will be assessed by modified
      ReNaM questionnaire. Molecular characterization of ICC tissue samples will be carried out by
      RNAseq. Briefly, after surgical resection tissue samples will be immediately suspended in
      RNAlater. RNAseq analysis will be performed on the Illumina HiScanSQ platform. Any possible
      mutations identified by RNAseq will be validated by Sanger sequencing. Putative identified
      fusion transcripts will be confirmed by RT-PCR, using specific primers pairs located on the
      sequences from the exons of the two putative fusion genes. Variations in gene expression will
      be validated by the real-time PCR. The bioinformatic analysis will be made by using CentOS5
      Server. For evaluation of asbestos fibers in tumor tissues, samples embedded in paraffin will
      be incinerated and then analyzed in a scanning electron microscope and by EDS spectroscopy.

    <description>For each patient enrolled, molecular profile of ICC tissue samples will be correlated to the anamnestic data collected by modified ReNaM questionnaire. For bio-informatic analysis, the collected data will be analyzed in order to identify signals that significantly deviate from the expected SNVs distribution in the general population, then analyzing the presence of clustering for the selected genes group. A two-way unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis will be run to assess gene expression in the study groups (exposed / unexposed to the different risk factors). Random permutation test will be also conducted to assess the presence of genes whose expression is different in the study groups. Statistical analyses will be conducted using the R software (R Foundation and for Statistical Computing).</description>

      Tumor tissue samples will be immediately collected after surgery: one part will be suspended
      in RNAlater to prevent RNA degradation and stored at -20°C, the other will be formalin-fixed
      and paraffin-embedded for histopathology examination and evaluation of asbestos fibers. For
      each patient enrolled, peripheral blood will be also collected and stored at -20°C. Total RNA
      and genomic DNA will be extracted from tumor tissue and peripheral blood and stored at -80°C
      until use.
