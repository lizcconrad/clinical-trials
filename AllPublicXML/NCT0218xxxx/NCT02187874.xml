  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early cord clamping after delivery has been common practice for many decades as part of the
      active management of the third stage of labour. However in recent years, several studies have
      shown that delayed cord clamping may offer important benefits to the newborn. The data
      gathered indicate that delayed cord clamping may be particularly useful in premature babies,
      between 26 and 32 weeks of gestational age, reducing the need for blood transfusion and the
      incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage.

      However it is argued that the described potential benefits of delayed cord clamping could be
      negated by the increased risk of polycythaemia and jaundice in the newborn, as well as by
      potential interference with the postpartum haemorrhage management, initial care and
      reanimation of the premature newborn, and the possibility of cord blood donation. These
      factors, together with as the lack of homogeneity among existing studies regarding the
      delayed cord clamping technique create the need, in our opinion, for further research, to
      establish the proper place of this measure.

      Our hypothesis is that delayed cord clamping in the premature newborn significatively reduces
      the need for blood transfusions and intraventricular haemorrhage, compared with usual early
      cord clamping.

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  To define the impact of delayed cord clamping on neonatal assessment parameters after
           delivery: APGAR score, cord pH, need for mechanical ventilation or reanimation.

        -  Neonatal mortality and morbidity

        -  Effect of the procedure on the incidence and severity of maternal postpartum haemorrhage

        -  To study the correlation between Iron metabolism and reticulocitary haemoglobin levels
           in cord and infant blood.

    <description>One of the paediatricians will hold the newborn ( in vaginal deliveries between 20-30 cm under the mother, in C-sections between the legs of the mother) until clamping of the umbilical cord is indicated by a second paediatrician who will be controlling the time and overall state of the baby. The baby will be wrapped during this time in a thermal blanket in a flexed lateral decubitus position to minimise stress and heat loss. Time of clamping: after 30 to 60 seconds( preferably 60). If loss of the baby's wellbeing is suspected, the paediatrician will assess the newborn's heart rate , stopping the procedureif this falls under 100ppm, initiating at that moment the necessary reanimation procedures.
60 second after the delivery of the new born 10 IU of oxytocin will be administered intramuscularly.</description>
