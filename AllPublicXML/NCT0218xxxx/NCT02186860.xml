  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional standard treatments of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is not perfect for
      fighting cancer. Many people do not respond to the standard treatments of ALL. One possible
      treatment is chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cell infusions. Third generation
      CAR-T which contains Cluster of Differentiation 28 (CD28) and Cluster of Differentiation 137
      (CD137) has stronger effect of anti-tumor capacity compare with second generation CAR-T. The
      investigators believe that the cells with CD28 and CD137 will have a better chance of killing
      the lymphoma cells. In the lab, the investigators constructed a third generation CAR
      containing both CD28 and CD137. The investigators start Phase I study aimed to chemotherapy
      resistant or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. The purpose of this study is
      to assess the safety and effectiveness of third generation CAR-T cells in patients.

      Third generation CAR-T has stronger effect of anti-tumor capacity. While people have been
      able to control the clinical complications now, so conducting third generation CAR-T clinical
      trials has a strong demand and value. The investigators construct a third generation CAR
      containing both CD28 and CD137.
