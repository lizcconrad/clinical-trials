  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study specifically evaluates the effects of electromagnetic stimulation for diaphyseal
      femur fractures using a device developed by the investigators.

      The hypothesis is that patients with femoral diaphysis treated with the electromagnetic
      stimulation have less non-union after six months than patients treated with a placebo device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The inclusion criteria were: patients of any sex, age between 18 and 60 years, with a closed
      fracture in their femoral diaphysis or an open fracture secondary to a low-speed bullet;
      treated with open or closed reduction and intramedullary reamed blocked nail.

      Patients were excluded if they had a pathological fracture, an open fracture from another
      etiology, or if they were treated after 10 days from the day of fracture.

      64 patients were included.

      Randomization took place six weeks after fracture day, allocating participants to either one
      of two groups: group A (electromagnetic stimulation) or group B (placebo).

      Each group had a device exactly the same. Patients used the device during one hour every day
      for eight weeks.
