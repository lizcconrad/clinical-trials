  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroparesis, also referred to as delayed gastric emptying, is a debilitating, chronic
      disorder that slows or stops the passage of food from the stomach to the small intestine. The
      purpose of this study is to test whether TC-6499 is safe and effective at reducing gastric
      emptying time in diabetic subjects with gastroparesis.

      This is a 4-way crossover study to assess the effect of TC-6499 on gastric emptying time in
      diabetic subjects with gastroparesis. The length of study participation for a subject is up
      to 50 days. During screening, eligible subjects will complete an oral 13-C-spirulina breath
      test also known as the Gastric Emptying Breath Test (GEBT). During the treatment period,
      subjects will complete 4 overnight drug assessment visits (treatment arms) where they will
      receive a randomized single dose of study drug and the GEBT. Each overnight visit will be
      separated by approximately 7 days. At least 18 subjects will be randomized and complete all 4
      dosing arms (actual = 23 randomized subjects and 21 completing all 4 arms of the crossover).
