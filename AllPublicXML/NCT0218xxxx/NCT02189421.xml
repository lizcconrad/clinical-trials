  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of a newly developed multibending
      ultra-slim upper endoscope for the successful direct peroral cholangioscopy (POC) without
      assisting accessory in comparison with conventional ultra-slim endoscope. The investigators
      expect that multibending endoscope will show more higher successful performance than
      conventional endoscope.

      Direct POC using an ultra-slim upper endoscope permits various diagnostic and/or therapeutic
      intraductal interventions under direct endoscopic visualization in selected patients who has
      dilated distal CBD and widened papillary orifice. Because the bile duct has anatomical
      position in acute angle with the duodenum, assisting accessories such as intraductal
      anchoring balloon, guidewire or overtube is usually required for the successful direct POC.
      Recently, direct peroral cholangioscopes have been developed for free-hand direct advancement
      of the endoscope into the bile duct from duodenum. Multibending ultra-slim endoscope may be
      expected to facilitate the advance into the bile duct by overcoming the acute angle between
      the bile duct and the duodenum. After randomization of enrolled patients into two groups,
      direct POC will be performed by using a conventional slim endoscope in control group and by
      using a multibending endoscope in study group.
