  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Balanced general anesthesia with neuromuscular blocking agents has been widely used for
      surgery.. At the end of surgery, neostigmine has been given for the reversal of neuromuscular
      blocking agents with several adverse effects such as bradycardia and profuse secretion.
      Atropine has been used to prevent those side effects of neostigmine. The routine dosages of
      the two drugs are 2.5 mg of neostigmine and 1.2 mg of atropine.

      Tribuddharat S ey al. (1) has demonstrated that after giving 0.9 mg atropine together with
      2.5 mg of neostigmine the mean heart rate during 1-8 minutes after the administration was
      increase 2-26 beats/min (bpm). At 9 and 10 minutes after administration of the drugs, the
      mean heart rate were decrease 0.9 and 1.6 bpm In the control group which receiving 1.2 mg of
      atropine, the mean heart rate during 1-10 minutes after administration was increase 4-32 bpm.
      However this study did not report the incidence of bradycardia and blood pressure. The mean
      heart rate prior to atropine and neostigmine was 74.43 + 11.82 bpm.(1)

      Salem MG et al. (2) has demonstrated that after receiving 1.2 mg of atropine and 5 mg of
      neostigmine the mean heart rate during 2-110 minutes was decrease 5-29 bpm with the lowest
      heart rate at 40 minutes after administration. This study also did not report the blood
      pressure.

      The baseline heart rate (HR) before administration of the reversal was associated with the
      following heart rate. Heinonen J et al. (3) has demonstrated that 80% of the patients after
      receiving 0.015 mg/kg of atropine 3 minutes before 0.03 mg of neostigmine for the reversal of
      pancuronium experienced bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 50 bpm) compared with none in patients
      receiving alcuronium. However, before administration of atropine and neostigmine, the mean
      heart rate of patients was significantly lower in the pancuronium group.

      Either tachycardia or bradycardia with hypotension causes adverse affect to patient
      especially in specific group like patient with coronary artery disease or undergoing
      craniotomy.

      The primary objective of our study is to demonstrate the effect on heart rate (HR) and blood
      pressure of 0.6 mg atropine and 2.5 mg neostigmine for the reversal of muscle relaxant
      compare to 1.2 mg atropine.
