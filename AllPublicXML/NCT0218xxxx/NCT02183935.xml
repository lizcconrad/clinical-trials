  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and its complications have a significant effect on morbidity and mortality in these
      subjects. Especially at risk are subjects with extremely increased BMI (above 99th percentile
      for age and gender in adolescents). In these subjects classical treatment with diet and
      cognitive therapy has a limited effect. Bariatric procedures, at the moment, are the only
      feasible therapeutic possibility.

      Bariatric procedures are based on several principles; restrictive, malabsorptive and
      combined. They can be surgical or endoscopic. The later are used in subjects that do not
      qualify for surgical procedures that decline them or are used before a planed definite
      bariatric procedure.

      Duodena-jejunal liner (DJL) is an endoscopic tool, that is efficiently and safely used to
      decrease body weight and ameliorated obesity complications, especially those associated with
      diabetic state.

      Aims of the study are:

        -  To determine (short and long-term) efficacy of DJL in decreasing body weight in
           adolescents.

        -  To determine (short and long-term) efficacy of DJL in ameliorating complications of
           morbid obesity - abnormal glucose metabolism, dislipidemia, altered adipokine secretion
           pattern, altered secretion pattern of gastrointestinal hormones in adolescents.

        -  To visualize functional alternations in the selected central nervous system regions
           associated with appetite regulation upon insertion of DJL.
