  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to identify chemical compounds in the blood and sputum (i.e.,
      biomarkers) that are associated with objective measurements of health status in patients with
      cystic fibrosis (CF). This study builds upon observations that blood levels of hepcidin-25, a
      protein that regulates how the body uses and stores iron, vary during CF pulmonary
      exacerbation (CFPE).

    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is the characterization of 3 groups (i.e., &quot;low,&quot; &quot;intermediate,&quot; and &quot;high&quot;) of serum hepcidin-25 responders to CFPE treatment. Response will be defined as the ratio of post- to pre-treatment serum hepcidin-25 concentration for each subject.</description>

    <measure>Change in CFRSD-CRISS Score After Hospitalization for CF Pulmonary Exacerbation (CFPE) Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of hospitalization, an expected average of 12 days</time_frame>
    <description>CFRSD-CRISS is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument developed by the Seattle Quality of Life Group at the University of Washington and used herein under license to evaluate the severity of symptoms of CF in adults and adolescents (â‰¥12 years) with a chronic respiratory infection. Symptoms assessed in the CFRSD-CRISS are: difficulty breathing, cough, cough up mucus, chest tightness, wheeze, feeling feverish, tired, and chills/sweats. The 8 items quantify symptom severity for the previous 24 hours to capture the magnitude of symptoms in stable CF, during medically treated CF exacerbations, and during recovery from an exacerbation. We will determine the within-subject differences in CFRSD-CRISS score associated with CFPE treatment.</description>
