    <description>Plasma cortisol levels will be collected at baseline and 45 minutes post-exercise for the Grapefruit visit intervention and for the Apple juice intervention. The interventions are acute ( 1 day), there is no follow up. The interventions are at least 1 week apart. For a given subject, the estimated time for study completion for the 2 treatments is 14 to 30 days.</description>
