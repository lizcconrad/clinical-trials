  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim was to detect EEG complexity in a specific group of patients to contribute to the
      discussion whether schizophrenia is associated with increased or decreased complexity. We
      included the EEG recordings of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. We hypothesized
      that chronic residual schizophrenia is characterized by decreased complexity in EEG.

      Twenty right-handed patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, residual subtype, by two senior
      psychiatrists according to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition
      (DSM-IV)were recruited from Neuropsychiatry Istanbul Hospital. Only patients scoring 4 or
      higher on the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity (CGI-S) were included. They were
      assessed with the Turkish version of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Data was
      collected with a 16-channel Neuroscan Synamps II (Neuroscan Products, Compumedics, Charlotte,
      NC, USA), silver-silver chloride electrodes were applied to the scalp surface according to
      the international 10-20 system
