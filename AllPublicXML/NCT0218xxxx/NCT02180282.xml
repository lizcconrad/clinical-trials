    <description>The M22 is an advanced computer-controlled light emission system that incorporates several different light modules.
The IPL hand piece operates at a spectrum of 400-1200nm with 7 different filters that can be easily inserted to the hand piece to treat different conditions. The IPL hand piece also includes 2 different sapphire cooled light guides of 8x15mm and 15x35mm. The cut-off filter that will be used for this evaluation is the Acne Filter that cuts off all light with the wavelength of 400-600 and 800-1200nm.</description>
