  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are trying to understand the role of specific genes in the function of
      airway surface cells. The investigators know that there are some common genetic markers that
      are associated with various lung diseases. However, most people with these genetic markers
      never develop any evidence of lung disease, so it is not understand how or if these markers
      play a role in disease. Investigators are asking healthy people to provide three (3) tubes of
      blood as well as a sample of cells from their nose. Investigators will use the blood sample
      to provide genetic information (specifically, presence or absence of alleles known to be
      associated with pulmonary fibrosis). Nose cells from individuals with the genetic markers
      that investigators are studying will be grown in the the lab to allow investigators to learn
      more about how the cells respond to various forms of environmental stress, such as exposure
      to cigarette smoke. The goal of this study is to understand how specific genes affect airway
      cell function.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>in vitro epithelial integrity measured by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), reported in ohms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The in vitro epithelial cell culture process will take approximately 4-6 weeks after the cells collected are thawed. (At the time of collection from study subjects, cells will be frozen until the time of thawing and culturing.) The in vitro epithelial process will take 6 weeks to differentiate epithelial monolayers at which time the tests of epithelial integrity can be performed. Study subjects themselves are not being followed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>gene expression (DSP, MUC5B, genes associated with ER Stress), reported as &quot;fold-change&quot; or &quot;CT mean&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Gene expression assays (designed by Taqman/Life Technologies) will be used to examine expression of genes that we believe are associated with pulmonary fibrosis -- specifically, various mucins (MUC5B, MUC5AC, DSP, and numerous genes associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress). This will be measured on epithelial monolayers derived in vitro from cells collected from study subjects. The differentiation of epithelial monolayers can take 3-6 weeks depending on the vagaries of the cell culture technique.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Epithelial monolayer permeability (protein and cell permeability)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Epithelial monolayer permeability as measured by dextran/protein and neutrophil traffic through monolayer in vitro. This will be measured on epithelial monolayers derived in vitro from cells collected from study subjects. The differentiation of epithelial monolayers can take 3-6 weeks depending on the vagaries of the cell culture technique.</description>
