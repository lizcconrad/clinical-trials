    <textblock>
      FibroScan® (Echosens, Paris, France) is an active non implantable medical device marketed in
      Europe since December 2003 and is currently used in many countries. FibroScan® is an
      ultrasound-based vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE™) device dedicated to
      liver stiffness measurement (LSM).

      Several clinical studies have shown the accuracy of LSM by FibroScan® to predict liver
      fibrosis.

      Some other studies have already shown the good correlation between LSM, assessed by
      FibroScan® based on VCTE™ technology, and the presence of portal hypertension (PHT).

      PHT is a clinical condition characterized by a high blood pressure in the portal vein and its
      tributaries and it is defined as a gradient between portal and systemic blood pressure &gt; 6
      mmHg.

      The development of oesophageal varices (OV) in cirrhotic patients, as well as their potential
      bleeding, represent one of the most severe and life-threatening complication of cirrhosis.

      Upper endoscopy is the best diagnostic tool for detecting the presence of OV, gastric varices
      or congestive gastropathy, for estimating the grade of OV and for the recognition of the
      presence of red color signs and wale marks or other indicators of high risk for bleeding.

      However these two methods are quite invasive and associated with some risks; at the same
      time, not all cirrhotic patients present OV at endoscopic screening.

      The aim of this study is the validation of SSM, assessed by a FibroScan® with acquisition
      parameters and algorithm optimized for SSM, as surrogate noninvasive marker for the presence
      of OV in liver cirrhosis patients.

    <description>Fibroscan® is an active non implantable medical device using ultrasound. It has been designed to measure liver stiffness in a painless, rapid and non invasive manner. It is a diagnostic aid tool. In this study, Spleen Stiffness Measurement will be assessed using a dedicated FibroScan® device which has been developed specifically to assess spleen stiffness.</description>
