  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research is to advance our knowledge of how information from the
      labyrinth is brought to perception and how adaptation to vestibular imbalance influences
      motion sensation. Patients with vestibular disorders frequently have disabling disturbances
      of perception. Related to these symptoms is that large areas of the cerebral hemispheres and
      the cerebellum receive information from the vestibular, visual and somatosensory systems that
      is integrated within a vestibular cortical network into an accurate perception of spatial
      orientation. Interrupting the pathways that process information about the direction of
      gravity and angular velocity leads to impairment of the internal estimate of gravity and the
      perception of body motion. The strategy of this research is to use repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to produce transient focal lesions that allow study of acute loss
      of function within the central vestibular pathways at the very beginning of adaptation. Our
      underlying hypothesis is that the immediate effects of a lesion in the cerebellum will be to
      affect ocular motor control of vestibular reflexes and perception alike but with a cortical
      lesion there will be dissociation between ocular motor control and perception. This research
      helps to understand the mechanisms involved in the perception of vestibular information and
      the cerebellar influence on processing vestibular input and offers a unique opportunity to
      make major inroads into the understanding and eventually treatment of the often
      incapacitating symptoms of patients with vestibular disease
