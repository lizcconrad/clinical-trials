      The purpose of this study is to determine whether chlorthalidone is more effective than
      hydrochlorothiazide at preventing cardiovascular outcomes in Veterans over age 65 with
      hypertension. Both medications are thiazide-type diuretics that have been used for more than
      50 years and are considered first-line treatment for hypertension. Patients currently
      prescribed hydrochlorothiazide will be randomized to either continue taking
      hydrochlorothiazide or to receive chlorthalidone, and followed for major cardiovascular
      events, such as myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. The study will use a new, efficient
      and less expensive study design termed 'point of care', in which study operations will be
      conducted centrally and patient data will be collected passively through the electronic
      medical record.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 1 million Veterans are prescribed a thiazide-type diuretic each year; over 95% receive
      hydrochlorothiazide, and fewer than 2.5% receive chlorthalidone. Both medications are
      thiazide-type diuretics that have been used for more than 50 years and are considered
      first-line treatment for hypertension. Indirect evidence has been accumulating, however, that
      chlorthalidone may be more effective than hydrochlorothiazide at preventing cardiovascular
      events. This will be the first randomized head-to-head comparison of the effectiveness of
      these two drugs. The study plans to enroll 13,500 Veterans over 3 years and follow them on
      average for 3 years, resulting in a total study duration of 4.5 years. Patients currently
      prescribed hydrochlorothiazide will be randomized to either continue taking
      hydrochlorothiazide or to receive an equivalent dose of chlorthalidone. The unique 'point of
      care' or 'clinically integrated' study design will identify, enroll and follow subjects using
      the electronic medical record system and national VA and non-VA databases. The primary
      outcome is an event composite consisting of: stroke, myocardial infarction, non-cancer death,
      urgent revascularization, and hospitalization for acute congestive heart failure. All patient
      care, including the study drug, will continue to be managed by the primary care provider.

      Primary Care Providers will also be included as participants in this research study. Adding
      providers as subjects will allow us to study the implementation of the point of care protocol
      design in addition to the original research question. The study team will collect data on
      diuretic management within the study and may contact providers by phone or email to learn
      reasons for declining a particular patient or discontinuing a new chlorthalidone order or an
      ongoing diuretic prescription.

      If cardiovascular events are reduced by even a small amount by chlorthalidone, the public
      health effect will be considerable because of the large number of patients who take
      diuretics. A randomized trial, now feasible due to the investigators' efficient and
      inexpensive design, will provide evidence needed to better inform practice throughout the VA.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Veterans who:

          -  Are over age 65 years

          -  Are receiving hydrochlorothiazide from the VA pharmacy at a daily dose of 25 or 50 mg

          -  Have a most recent systolic blood pressure (SBP) in CPRS greater than or equal to 120
             mm Hg, with no SBP less than 120 mm Hg recorded in CPRS in the previous 90 days

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Impaired decision-making capacity rendering the patient unable to provide informed
             consent (i.e., if there is any question during the nurse's EMR chart review that the
             individual does not have the ability to make an autonomous decision or the PCP
             declines permission to randomize)

          -  Death expected within 6 months (inferred by PCP permission to randomize)

          -  K&lt;3.1 meq/L (or K&lt;3.5 meq/L if on digoxin) in the past 90 days

          -  Na&lt;130 meq/L in the past 90 days

          -  Known to be enrolled in Medicare Part C (assessed on consent phone call). This
             exclusion will only be employed if the investigators determine that sufficient
             information from Part C data cannot obtained.
