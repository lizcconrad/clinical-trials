  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress hyperglycaemia is commonly observed during hospitalization in the intensive care unit
      (ICU) and has been shown to adversely influence outcome. It has been hypothesized that, when
      it occurs in previously non-diabetic patients, it reflects a latent disturbance of the
      glucose metabolism. Assessing the incidence of this phenomenon and identifying its risk
      factors could support prevention, detection and early treatment of impending diabetes
      mellitus type 2. We will perform a glucose tolerance test approximately 6-9 months post-ICU
      admission to screen for disorders of glucose metabolism. Furthermore, we examined
      characteristics that could have predicted the post-discharge disturbances: patient
      characteristics, parameters of disease severity and of glucose metabolism, as well as the
      FINDRISC (Finnish Diabetes Risc Score). We plan to enroll 400 patients.

    <description>At a follow-up visit, patients will have their blood glucose levels sampled both after fasting and 2 hours after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). HbA1c levels will be sampled once as well. Possible disturbances in glucose metabolism are the following: isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG) = fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 100-125 mg/dl with the 2-h value after OGTT &lt;140 mg/dl. Isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) = 2-h value after OGTT of 140-199 mg/dl with the fasting level &lt;100 mg/dl. Patients with combined characteristics of IFG and IGT fulfill both criteria (FPG = 100-125 mg/dl and 2-h value after OGTT = 140-199 mg/d). Diabetes mellitus is diagnosed when a patient has one of the following criteria: FPG more or equal to 126mg/dl, 2-h value after OGTT more or equal to 200 mg/dl, HbA1c more or equal to 6.5%.</description>

    <measure>Patient characteristics predicting adverse outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>6-9 months after ICU discharge</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the effect of the patient's length, weight, body mass index (BMI), reason for admission, preadmission home medication, treatment during admission (steroids, vasopressors, inotropics, mechanical ventilation, insulin, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), laboratory values including blood glucose and HbA1c on intensive care unit (ICU) admission on our primary outcome parameter. Moreover, we will take into account the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS-3) and the daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score as parameters for disease severity, together with vasopressor or inotropic therapy, mechanical ventilation and length of stay at the hospital and ICU. Furthermore, our patients will complete the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) questionnaire during their follow-up visit, and we will compare this result with the primary outcome parameter as well.</description>
