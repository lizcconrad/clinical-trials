  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was primarily to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of
      TMC114/rtv in addition to an individually optimized background antiretroviral therapy in
      HIV-1 infected participants. In addition, antiviral activity and immunological effect were
      also evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase II, open label, multicenter trial of an investigational protease inhibitor
      TMC114 in the presence of ritonavir (rtv) in HIV-1 infected participants who were randomized
      in trials TMC114-C201, TMC114-C207 or in sponsor selected phase I trials and who might derive
      benefit from TMC114 therapy, as judged by the investigator.

      The trial consisted of a screening period of a maximum of 4 weeks, a 96-week treatment period
      and a 4-week follow-up period. The maximal trial duration for each participant was104 weeks.
      During the treatment period, all participants were receiving TMC114 in combination with RTV,
      orally, as 600/100 mg dose twice daily, in addition to an individually optimized background
      regimen of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, selected by the investigator at a baseline of the
      study.

      Sponsor provided a follow-up treatment with TMC114 for all participants who continued to
      benefit from treatment with TMC114/RTV until it became commercially available for the
      participant. Participants, who completed the 96 weeks of treatment period with TMC114, had
      the opportunity to roll over to the extension of this trial, if TMC114 was not locally
      commercially available.

    <description>The Time to Loss of Virologic Response (TLOVR) algorithm will be used to derive response. Response will be confirmed at 2 consecutive visits and participants who discontinue will be considered nonresponders after discontinuation. Resuppression after confirmed virologic failure will be considered as failure. Virologic Failure will include participants who are rebounders (ie, confirmed viral load &gt;= 50 copies/mL after being a responder) or who were never suppressed (no confirmed viral load &lt;50 copies/mL); non-VF censored: participants who discontinue treatment due to reason other than Virologic Failure will be excluded.</description>
