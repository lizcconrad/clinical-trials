  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Oxy-CAHN study is to improve the monitoring capabilities of newborn
      infants recovering from congenital heart surgery. Currently, we utilize important but
      unsophisticated measures, such as vital signs and lactate measurements, to monitor these
      patients. Although they are useful in categorizing patients as well or unwell, these signs
      currently lack the power quantify a patient's risk for cardiac arrest. More to the point,
      they are mostly indirect measures of what we really are assessing, which is tissue oxygen
      delivery.

      Our group has signiﬁcant expertise with devices which quantify the amount of oxygen that a
      baby consumes every minute. Historically, these values are more commonly used in combination
      with other measures to assess nutritional and metabolism status. In critically ill patients,
      however, the volume of oxygen consumed by a patient may be limited by the amount of oxygen
      their circulation delivers. This may represent a critical relationship, which has been
      previously described, but not exploited for the purpose of identifying patients with
      critically low oxygen delivery.

      The aims of this study are therefore (1) to demonstrate that oxygen consumption can be safely
      and precisely measured continuously in newborns undergoing one of two common congenital heart
      surgeries, (2) to determine whether postoperative circulatory failure is associated with a
      precedent change in oxygen consumption, and (3) to determine whether the addition of the
      oxygen-based measurements (including oxygen consumption and venous oxygen saturations) to
      standardly measured parameters will add power in predicting which patients will experience
      postoperative circulatory failure.

      If successful, this study may improve our capacity to non-invasively and continuously monitor
      patients following the highest risk congenital heart surgeries, and in the future,to create
      an algorithm which quantiﬁes a patients risk for having a cardiac arrest. This may permit
      providers to intervene on these patients earlier, improving the morbidity and mortality
      associated with congenital heart disease.

    <description>The oxygen-based measurements which are central to this study, including VO2, SVC saturation, as well as all ventilatory parameters listed above will be saved to a computer program (S5 Collect, GE Healthcare) attached to the patient's monitor. This program saves data in time stamped fashion Q1 second.
Time-stamped vital sign data listed above will be exported daily from the hospital's in situ T3 program (Etiometry)
The labs, treatments and other clinical parameters (see previous section) will be extracted in time-stamped fashion from the medical record each day by amember of the study team.</description>
