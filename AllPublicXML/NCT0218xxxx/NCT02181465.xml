  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic, gastric, and colorectal cancers have all been shown to overexpress the gastrin
      gene and to be sensitive to the trophic effects of the gastrin in animal models. The
      hypothesis of this study is that G17DT will elicit specific and high-affinity antibodies that
      will bind gastrin-17, thus preventing the trophic activity of cancer cells.
