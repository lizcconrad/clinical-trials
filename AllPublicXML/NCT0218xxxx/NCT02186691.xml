  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long term survival of patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot is excellent (about 85% at
      35 year-old). However these patients are exposed to residual pulmonary stenosis (PS) and/or
      pulmonary regurgitation (PR). It is well established that these lesions can lead to
      irreversible sequelae such as right ventricle dilatation and dysfunction. Pulmonary valve
      replacement technique was developed to avoid long term right ventricular dysfunction.
      Pulmonary valve replacement indications are based upon the presence of symptoms at exercise
      and/or morphological or functional parameters such as severe pulmonary regurgitation with
      right ventricle dilatation/dysfunction. The best timing of such intervention is still
      underdebate with the main aim of having the right balance between avoiding long term sequelae
      of PR or PS and being the latter possible to push ahead the need for new intervention. Recent
      publication showed that myocardial diffuse fibrosis can contribute to irreversible alteration
      of myocardial contractility. Quantification of diffuse fibrosis by magnetic resonance imaging
      is feasible and could help the physician to best determine the right timing for PVR in this
      population of patients. Cardiac function assessment at rest and during exercise is possible
      using MR and our centre has developed a program for cardiac exercise during MRI. This could
      help to detect infra clinic abnormality and to analyse myocardial adaptation during exercise.
