  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ketorolac is administered as current practice to the majority of patients undergoing knee
      arthroscopy, the appropriate dose of ketorolac to be administered has not been evaluated.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Past studies have examined different doses of ketorolac administered to patients after spinal
      fusion surgery and found that 7.5 mg every 6 hours was as effective as 15 or 30 mg every 6
      hours in decreasing postoperative pain and patient opiate consumption. Since ketorolac side
      effects such as gastrointestinal and surgical site bleeding seem to be dose related,
      utilizing a lower dose of ketorolac may be more efficacious.
