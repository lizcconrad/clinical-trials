        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female subjects according to the following criteria: based upon a
             complete medical history, including physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR),
             12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests

             accordance with GCP and the local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding of the medical examination (including BP, PR, and ECG) deviating from
             normal and of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy)

             halflives of the respective drug prior to administration or during the trial

          -  Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial or based on the
             knowledge at the time of protocol preparation within 10 days prior to administration
             or during the trial

          -  Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within 2 months prior to
             administration or during the trial

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

        For female subjects:

          -  Pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test, planning to become pregnant during the study,

             abstinence (for at least 1 month before enrolment), vasectomised partner (vasectomy
             performed at least 1 year prior to enrolment), or surgical sterilisation (including
             hysterectomy). Females who did not have a vasectomised partner, were not sexually
             abstinent, or were not surgically sterile were asked to additionally use barrier
             contraception methods (i.e. condom, diaphragm with spermicide)

        For male subjects:

          -  Male subjects who did not agree to minimise the risk of female partners becoming
             pregnant from the first dosing day until the completion of the post study medical
             examination. Acceptable methods of contraception included barrier contraception and a
             medically accepted contraceptive method for the female partner (intra-uterine device
             with spermicide, hormonal contraceptive for at least 2 months)
