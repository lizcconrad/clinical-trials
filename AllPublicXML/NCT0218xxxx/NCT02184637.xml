  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-centre, 5-cohort, randomized open-label, parallel-group study in
      healthy volunteer subjects. This study aims to provide sufficient pharmacokinetic (PK)
      evidence to support the safe usage of Tafenoquine (TQ) in studies and markets where the
      Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs) are the standard of care for patients with
      Plasmodium vivax malaria (i.e., co administration with TQ). The objective of this study is to
      assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of TQ when co-administered with the
      chosen ACTs (AL and DHA + PQP), administered concomitantly in healthy subjects. Specifically,
      the study will evaluate whether there are drug-drug interactions between TQ and each of the
      ACTs and if these interactions are considered to be clinically significant. The co-primary
      objectives of this study are to characterize both the effects of a 300 milligram (mg) single
      dose of TQ on the pharmacokinetics; changes in (area under the concentration-time curve from
      0 to time t) AUC (0-t), AUC (0-infinity), and maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of each
      of the two Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACT) according to their prescribed dose
      when co-administered as well as the effects of the ACTs on the PK of TQ.

      A total of 120 subjects (24 subjects in each of 5 cohorts) are planned to be enrolled in
      order to ensure a target sample size of at least 22 subjects completing the study per cohort.
      All subjects will arrive in the unit at least 24 hours prior to dosing and be discharged
      after 72-hour post first dose assessments have been completed. Subjects will return for
      outpatient visits on Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 56 after first dose.

             heart failure or family history of Long QT Syndrome).

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy
             [for this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the
             investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study
             eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's
             medical records]; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in
             questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)

             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to
             use one of the contraception methods, if they wish to continue their HRT during the
             study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
             status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse
             between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type
             and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can
             resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.];

             human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing AND Agrees to
             use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined
             by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently
             minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use

          -  The subject's average triplicate (at screening after approximately 5 minutes at rest
             in the semi-supine position) systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 80-140
             millimeters of mercury (mmHg), or diastolic blood pressure is outside the range of
             45-90mmHg or heart rate is outside the range of 40-100 beats per minute (bpm).
