  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in glucose control, fitness, and
      body composition between a standard aerobic and resistance exercise training program and a
      shorter-duration, high-intensity CrossFit training program in overweight and obese physically
      inactive adults.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Both groups would improve glucose control, with the CrossFit group improving
           significantly more than the aerobic and resistance training group.

        2. Both groups would improve fitness, with the CrossFit group improving significantly more
           than the aerobic and resistance training group.

        3. Both groups would demonstrate decreases in body fat percentage and fat mass and
           increases in lean body mass, with the CrossFit group improving significantly more than
           the aerobic and resistance training group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight or obese participants will take part in an 8-week exercise intervention after
      clearance from a doctor, that is expected to improve glucose control, fitness (Eurofit and
      peak aerobic capacity), and body composition (body fat percentage, fat mass, and lean body
      mass). After stratification by age and body mass index, participants will be randomized to
      either a standard aerobic and resistance training exercise program or a relatively higher
      intensity, shorter duration CrossFit exercise program.

    <description>Fasting plasma glucose levels were taken after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours. An oral glucose tolerance test was conducted after ingestion of a 75g oral dextrose solution with finger sticks at 30, 45, and 60 minutes from time 0. The following equation was used to calculate glucose area under the curve which was the metric utilized to ascertain changes in glucose control: [(Time 45 - Time 30) * ½ (OGTT 30 + OGTT 45)] + [(Time 60 - Time 45) * ½ (OGTT 60 + OGTT 45)]</description>

    <description>Participants completed 24 exercise sessions based on current guidelines. Aerobic exercise (50 min) was performed on machines every session and resistance training (20 min) was performed on machines two sessions per week. Aerobic intensity was prescribed at 40-50% of heart rate reserve (HRR) Weeks 1-4 and 50-60% HRR Weeks 5-8. Resistance training was supervised by an ACE certified personal trainer. One-repetition maximums (1-RM) were assessed Week 1 (i.e., seated bicep curl, military press, seated lat pulldown, seated leg extension, triceps pulldown, bench press, reverse leg curl, seated leg press). For Weeks 2-3 participants completed, 3 sets of 15 reps at 50% 1-RM; Weeks 4-5, 3 sets of 12 reps at 60% 1-RM; Weeks 6-7, 3 sets of 10 reps at 70% 1-RM; Week 8, 3 sets of 8 reps at 75% 1-RM. Three sets of 15 unweighted crunches were completed each day. One minute of rest was taken between each set and each exercise.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants completed a total of 24 sessions that were pre-programmed and led by a certified instructor (CrossFit Level 2), which lasted up to 60 minutes in duration. The first two class periods were structured as an introduction to common movements used in high-intensity functional training (HIFT; e.g., squats, deadlift, press, jerks, barbell, dumbbell, and medicine ball cleans, pullups, kettlebell swings, among others). No scheduled workouts were given on days 1 and 2. Beginning on day 3 each HIFT class consisted of 10-15 minutes of stretching and warmup, 10-20 minutes of instruction and practicing techniques and movements, and 5-30 minutes for the workout of the day, performed at vigorous intensity, relative to each person's ability and fitness level. All weights and movements were individually prescribed and recorded for each participant.</description>

    <description>Participants were instructed to work as hard as they could while maintaining safe technique and proper form to achieve as many reps or rounds as possible in the prescribed time frame. As HIFT participants became accustomed to specific movements, less time was dedicated to practicing movements and technique.</description>
