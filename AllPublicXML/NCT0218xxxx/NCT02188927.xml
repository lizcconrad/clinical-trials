  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participation in a primary screening colonoscopy programs remains low. Advanced notification
      letter has been shown to increase participation in colorectal cancer screening with fecal
      occult blood testing and to be cost effective compared to standard invitation. It is unknown
      whether advanced notification letter increases participation rate in primary colonoscopy
      screening program.

      We hypothesize that an Advance Notification Letter will have significant influence on
      participation in screening colonoscopy, comparing to standard invitation procedure and will
      thus result in higher efficiency of the program.

      This randomized controlled study aims to compare the participation rate in screening
      colonoscopy in response to advanced notification plus standard invitation letter and standard
      invitation letter alone.

      Material and methods: 6800 individuals aged 55-64 years will be drawn from the Population
      Registry and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the group invited for screening colonoscopy
      with advanced notification letter (send two weeks before standard invitation) plus standard
      invitation (send six weeks before planned screening colonoscopy) or to standard invitation
      only (send six weeks before planned screening colonoscopy). The sample size was calculated to
      detect 3% difference in participation rate between the groups (25% vs 28%) with 80% power.
