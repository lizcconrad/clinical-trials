  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fecal incontinence (FI) has an increasing prevalence in the geriatric population which cannot
      be explained by co-morbidity or anatomical and psychological changes of aging alone. In the
      nursing home population previous studies suggest a prevalence between 10 and 69%, but is most
      often reported to be between 40 and 55%. FI leads to a high direct and indirect economic
      burden to the health-care system, and is an important cause og institutionalization of the
      elderly patients. In addition, FI is associated with shame, social isolation and reduced
      quality of life.

      The importance of identifying treatable causes of FI in the frail elderly, rather than just
      managing passively, is strongly emphasized. It is indicated that the level of awareness among
      health personnel regarding appropriate assessment and treatment options is limited, and that
      FI is considered a normal part of aging.

      This study is based on the assumption that FI among nursing home patients can be prevented,
      cured or ameliorated by offering nursing home staff knowledge of best practise. The primary
      objective of the study is to test the hypothesis that a multifaceted educational program for
      staff on assessment and treatment of FI, is associated with a reduction in patients'
      frequency of FI.

      The design of the study is a two armed cluster randomized trail (C-RCT) with a repeated
      cross-sectional approach.The results will be analysed according to multilevel and
      longitudinal modelling, and the study will use mixed effect models with the cluster treated
      as a random effect.

    <description>As measured by The Long-Term Care Facilities Assessment System (interRAI-LTCF 2012), section H: Continence. Because of relatively high risk of death and movement out of clusters, a repeated cross-sectional opproach to analyses will be used. Frequency of FI will thereby be analysed on a across-sectional group level.</description>
