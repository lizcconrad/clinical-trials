  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease which includes coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease
      remains the leading cause of death among women in the United States. The impact of
      cardiovascular in women was not recognized by clinicians for a long time. It is now evident
      that, women suffer the consequences of cardiovascular at rates at least as high as those
      observed in men but there are still major gaps in our understanding this disease in women.
      Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous mediator plays an important role in the cardiovascular
      system. Research has demonstrated it's critical role in animal ischemia reperfusion models.
      Hydrogen sulfide exists in distinct biological pools in blood. Recently, the Kevil lab has
      pioneered the development of new analytical techniques for accurate measurement of all
      biological pools of H2S. By measuring these distinct pools of H2S in women with and without
      cardiovascular disease the investigators hope to further understanding of role of H2S in
      pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. This research will help to assess the ability of
      H2S and its distinct biological pools to potentially be a diagnostic marker or a therapeutic
      target for cardiovascular disease.
