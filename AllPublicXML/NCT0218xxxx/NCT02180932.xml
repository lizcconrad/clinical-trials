  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of otolaryngology (OLR) cancer is based on surgery, radiation, sometimes used
      in combination with chemotherapy. Patients treated with radiotherapy have multiple oral
      diseases: mucositis, hyposalivation, tissue fibrosis, exacerbation of periodontitis. Over 70%
      of patients with head and neck cancers treated with radiotherapy have a lower level of dental
      clinical attachment and 92% have loose teeth or missing. The management of these oral
      complications is a priority in OLR oncology. The aim is to improve the oral health of
      patients to achieve a comfortable life acceptable and necessary for healing.

      This project proposes to deepen the investigation with two main objectives:

        1. To study in vivo the effect of radiation treatment on the evolution of the viral flora
           of the periodontium in a cohort of patients and matched controls.

        2. To study in vitro the effects of irradiation on the replication EBV (herpesvirus) in
           producing websites lymphoepithelial tonsillar, and atypical dendritic cells associated
           with EBV that existence were recently discovered.
