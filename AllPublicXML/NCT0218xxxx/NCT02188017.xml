      An randomized trial of two maintenance doses of Acthar Gel for patients with chronic
      pulmonary sarcoidosis. Patients will be observed for 24 weeks of treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center double-blind trial to determine dose and effect size. A total of 20
      chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis patients will be recruited at eight clinical sites across the
      United States.

      After initial evaluation, including pulmonary function, CT and PET scanning, patients will be
      randomized to receive 80 Units if Acthar gel daily for 10days, followed by either 40 or 80
      units of Acthar gel twice a week for an additional 22 weeks.

      At the end of total 24 weeks of treatment, they will undergo repeat evaluation including
      pulmonary function, CT, and PET scanning.
