    <textblock>
      The goal of this retrospective chart review is to evaluate if the implementation of lumbar
      plexus block placement for postoperative pain and administration of multimodal oral analgesia
      have improved conditions in the postoperative period for patients undergoing total hip
      arthroplasty when compared to the placement of epidurals for postoperative pain management.

    <description>This is a retrospective, cohort study utilizing electronic medical records to examine patients who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) at our institution from January 2010 till June 2013. Based on previously published studies, 48 hour morphine consumption in the epidural group was expected to be 30mg +/-4mg. Assuming 30mg consumption in the epidural group, a sample size of 58 subjects per group was needed to provide 80% power to detect a 10% change from 30mg in morphine consumption between the epidural and lumbar plexus patients for a two-sided test at a significance level of Î± = 0.05. Calculations were based on a t-test hypothesis testing framework. Since the analysis involved repeated observations of each subject, power was likely underestimated.</description>
