  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to remarkable advances in childhood cancer therapy the 10-year survival rate increased to
      over 80% and late sequelae come to the fore. Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) suffer from
      significant excess in mortality risk associated with treatment-related complications at least
      for 25 years after the initial cancer diagnosis. In particular, the prevalence of
      cardiovascular disease seems to be elevated compared to the general population. The CVSS
      study is a multi-disciplinary cooperation project between the Institute for Medical
      Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI) and the German Childhood Cancer Registry
      (GCCR), the Preventive Cardiology and Preventive Medicine and the Pediatric Hematology and
      Oncology all at the University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz. The
      central element is a thorough clinical cardiovascular examination of all patients, which
      permits detecting subclinical disease. Therapy data will be extracted retrospectively from
      various sources. The study intends to describe the current situation of a cohort of
      approximately 1000 CCS in Germany aged 24 to 49 years with respect to cardiovascular health.
      The role of risk factors (treatment related and classic cardiovascular risk factors), as well
      as related predisposing genetic factors is investigated. The results will contribute to
      recommendations to improve follow-up care.
