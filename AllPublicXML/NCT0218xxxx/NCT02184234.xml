        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic venous insufficiency stage I or II according to Widmer, e.g., resulting in
             lower-leg oedema

          -  Male or female out-patients of any ethnic origin

          -  Florid venous ulcers

          -  Arterial occlusive disease, irrespective of the severity

          -  Phlebitis or thrombophlebitis

          -  Clinical indication for an acute phlebologic intervention, e.g., compressive
             treatment, phlebectomy, etc.

          -  Evidence of diabetic micro-angiopathy or polyneuropathy in medical history

          -  Poor general health (based on the investigator's judgement)

          -  Addiction to alcohol abuse

          -  Mental illness and inability (or limited ability) to work, or inability (or limited

          -  Patients receiving compression therapy, high-ceiling diuretics (e.g., furosemide), or
             any other anti-CVI preparations (e.g., vasoprotectives to treat varicosis, such as
             heparin-containing preparations, sclerosing agents, or bioflavonoids other than the
             study medication) during the trial. Medications or measures for CVI had to be stopped
