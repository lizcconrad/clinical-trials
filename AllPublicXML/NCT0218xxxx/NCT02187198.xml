      This is a randomized, open-label clinical trial with 200 Veteran opioid dependent men and
      women. Veterans will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: low dose range of
      buprenorphine (&lt;8mg) vs. high dose range of buprenorphine (&lt;16mg). During induction into
      buprenorphine, all participants will be started at a dose of 2mg, and this dose will be
      increased as needed for stabilization of opioid withdrawal symptoms, up to 8mg for the low
      dose group, and up to 16mg for the high dose group, within a 5 day period. Participants will
      be seen on a daily basis (excluding weekends) for the initial 5 day induction. At the end of
      the 12-week study, participants will either be referred to a buprenorphine clinic if they
      wish to continue this medication, or if they wish to be drug free, will undergo
      detoxification from buprenorphine for up to a 4-week period. Follow-up visits, scheduled at
      1, 3, and 6 months after study completion, will evaluate the durability of treatment effects
      on drug use and psychosocial outcomes. Veterans will be recruited primarily through
      advertisement, but also through the clinical facilities at the VA and from other
      collaborators.
