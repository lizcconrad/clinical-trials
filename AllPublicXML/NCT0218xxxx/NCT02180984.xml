  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of binge eating (BE) is a core feature of bulimic syndromes. Binge eating
      disorder (BED) is a new category in DSM-5 highly associated with higher body mass index
      (BMI). The neural mechanisms that underlie BE are of great interest in order to improve
      treatment interventions. Brain mechanisms underlying drug and food craving are suggested to
      be similar. These mechanisms demonstrated hyperactivity in the orbitofrontal and anterior
      cingulate cortex and lack of regulatory influence from lateral prefrontal circuits. Several
      novel studies began to assess the potential benefits of brain stimulation in reducing craving
      and associated addictive behaviors with promising results. Previous findings testing a
      one-off session of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in healthy women
      identified as strong cravers and individuals with bulimia nervosa or bulimic-type eating
      disorders reported reduction of food craving and BE, providing evidence to support a broader
      and deeper investigation of the benefits associated with rTMS. Importantly, the use of brain
      imaging studies contributes to the understanding of psychiatric disorders and underlying
      mechanisms being target by the rTMS intervention.

      Objectives: The primary aim is to investigate the effects of rTMS over BE frequency.
      Secondary aims include the evaluation of the effects of rTMS on food craving, body weight,
      brain activity, cognition, general psychopathology, hormonal regulation and neurobiological
      markers. Methods: Sixty obese females with BED will be randomized to receive 20 sessions of
      rTMS (n=30) or placebo (n=30) scattered 3 days/week.

      Expected Results: Primarily it is expected that rTMS intervention will decrease BE frequency.
      Consequently, body weight will be reduced. It is also expected that food craving be
      decreased, cognitive performance be enhanced, and neurobiological markers be improved.

    <description>30 obese individuals currently diagnosed with BED and meeting criteria for the study will be randomized to active rTMS treatment.
Intervention: Neurosoft device targeting the left DLPFC (neuro-navigational method).
Proposed schedule of treatment:
20 sessions of neuronavigated rTMS, one session per day, 3 days/week over approximately 7 weeks. Focal rTMS will be performed using a Neurosoft device and a 'figure of eight' coil. Brainscience Neuronavigation will be used to guide the placement of the coil to the target PFC region using a template MRI for all participants. The coil will be placed at a 45° angle to the mid-sagittal line to induce a posterior to anterior current in the underlying neural tissue. For the real treatment condition, stimulation will target the left DLPFC at 110% of the resting motor threshold. Each session of 10 Hz stimulation will apply 1000 pulses to the left hemisphere, with a duty cycle of 5s on and 55s off, for a total stimulation time of 20 min.</description>

    <description>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation has developed into a powerful tool that utilizes magnetic fluxes to non-invasively stimulate the human cortex. The technique involves placement of a small coil over the scalp; passing a rapidly alternating current through the coil wire, which produces a magnetic field that passes unimpeded through the scalp and bone, resulting in electrical stimulation of the cortex.</description>
