  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of providing newly diagnosed prostate
      cancer patients and their caregivers with an interactive mobile tablet technology-based
      application delivered by a community navigator versus providing National Cancer Institute
      (NCI) information booklets delivered by a Community Navigator (CN) on patient outcomes
      (decisional satisfaction, quality of life, knowledge, decisional conflict) and shared
      decision making practices (decision making involvement).

    <description>Investigators plan to assess if the psycho-educational intervention, PHIN, delivered by a CN is more efficacious as compared to NCI Information Booklets (IB) delivered by a CN. Participants will be asked to complete a baseline set of surveys and follow-up surveys at three additional time points: (1) 6 weeks after receiving the educational intervention; (2) after the follow-up decision with their doctor or health care provider; and (3) 6 months after the baseline surveys were done.</description>

    <description>The application (or &quot;app&quot;) titled Personalized Health Information Navigator (PHIN) is an interactive psycho-educational intervention that will be delivered via mobile tablet technology. The PHIN provides patient-centered education. At the first meeting, the community navigator will provide a visual demonstration of PHIN on the Apple iPad. The community navigator will leave the iPad with the participant for 6-weeks and will stress the importance of using the PHIN app to address any educational or psychosocial needs.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a packet of information booklets (&quot;What You Need to Know About Prostate Cancer&quot;; &quot;Taking Time: Support for People with Cancer&quot;; and &quot;Facing Forward, Life After Cancer Treatment&quot;) that address prostate cancer treatment options, the late and long term effects, follow-up care, and sources of support. At the first meeting, the community navigator will provide a review of the print materials and stress the importance of reading the booklets carefully to help prepare for the discussion with your healthcare provider. The community navigator will leave the print materials with the participant for 6-weeks.</description>
