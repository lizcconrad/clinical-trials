      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, outpatient study with a between-groups design.
      Sixty male and female heavy social drinkers will be randomly assigned to minocycline (200 or
      400 mg/day) or placebo for 10 days. In the first 7 days of treatment, subjects will have 3
      outpatient visits for medication administration, dispensing of take-home doses and monitoring
      of any adverse effects from study medications. On days 8 and 10 of treatment, subjects will
      have 2 laboratory sessions where alcohol or placebo will be administered intravenously using
      a clamp procedure. Alcohol administration will use a breath alcohol concentration (BrAc)
      method, targeting 100 mg %. The alcohol clamp procedure will allow collection of multiple
      outcome measures including subjective, motor, cognitive measurement and plasma cytokine
      levels.
