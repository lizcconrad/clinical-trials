      This study will assess environmental emissions of selected compounds in a test chamber after
      cigarette smoking or e-cigarette vaping.

      Secondhand smoke is the aged and diluted combination of smoke exhaled by a smoker and
      sidestream smoke (smoke from the lit end of a cigarette). Electronic cigarettes are different
      from tobacco-burning cigarettes in that they produce vapor, not smoke. For consistency with
      common usage, secondhand smoke (SHS) refers to true secondhand smoke from cigarettes and
      secondhand vapor from e-cigarettes.

      The goals of this study are to 1) increase understanding of the composition of SHS from
      e-cigarettes, 2) quantitatively compare the amount of SHS generated by e-cigarettes and a
      market sample of commercial e-cigarettes to leading brand styles of commercial
      tobacco-burning cigarettes, and 3) quantitate the emission factors of e-cigarettes including
      the market-sample e-cigarettes.
