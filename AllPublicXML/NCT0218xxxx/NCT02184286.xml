      The objectives of this study are to determine the effects of nevirapine on the steady-state
      pharmacokinetics of saquinavir-sgc and to determine the effects of saquinavir-sgc on the
      steady-state pharmacokinetics of nevirapine. This study will also evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of nevirapine in combination with saquinavir-sgc compared to historical
      controls treated with nevirapine but without saquinavir-sgc.
