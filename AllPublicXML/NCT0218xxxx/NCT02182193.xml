  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess pharmacokinetics and the relative bioavailability of a single dose of BIBF 1120
      soft gelatine capsule charge 1 vs. BIBF 1120 soft gelatine capsule charge 2 vs BIBF 1120
      drinking solution in healthy male subjects respectively. To establish an in-vitro-in-vivo
      correlation (IVIVC) for oral soft gelatine capsules with 150 mg BIBF 1120 in healthy male
      volunteers (if feasible)
