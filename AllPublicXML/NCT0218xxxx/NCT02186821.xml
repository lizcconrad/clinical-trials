      The purpose of this signal seeking study is to determine whether treatment with ceritinib
      demonstrates sufficient efficacy in select pathway-activated solid tumors and/or hematologic
      malignancies to warrant further study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a confirmed diagnosis of a select solid tumor (except ALK+ NSCLC) or
             hematological malignancy and is in need of treatment because of radiologic progression
             or relapse.

          -  Patient must have been pre-identified as having a tumor with an ALK or ROS1 positive
             mutation, translocation, rearrangement or amplification. The qualifying alteration
             must be assessed and reported by a CLIA-certified laboratory. ALK positivity as
             assessed by IHC or FISH are allowed.

          -  Patient must have received at least one prior treatment for recurrent, metastatic
             and/or locally advanced disease and for whom no standard therapy options are
             anticipated to result in a durable remission.

          -  Patient has progressive and measurable disease as per RECIST 1.1 or other appropriate
             hematological guidelines.

          -  Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has received prior treatment with ceritinib.

          -  Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases who are neurologically unstable or have
             required increasing doses of steroids within the 2 weeks prior to study entry to
             manage CNS symptoms.

          -  Patient has received chemotherapy or anticancer therapy ≤ 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosourea, monoclonal antibodies or mitomycin-C) prior to starting study drug.
