    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, multi center post-authorization safety study that includes all
      patients diagnosed as Unresectable Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma (DTC) and treated with
      Sorafenib within a certain period. The investigator should have made the choice of treatment
      (NEXAVAR) according with the Japanese Package Insert prior to enrolling the patient in this
      study.

      The enrollment period is of 9 months. The observation period for each patient starts when the
      therapy with NEXAVAR is initiated. Patients will be followed for 9 months or until it is no
      longer possible (e.g. lost to follow-up); this will be considered the standard observation
      period. Those patients, to whom a total of 24 month follow up is possible, information on
      effectiveness including treatment duration and survival status of the patient and of
      keratoacanthoma and/or squamous cell cancer development will be collected.
