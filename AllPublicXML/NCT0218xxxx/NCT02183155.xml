  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of meloxicam tablets (7.5, 15 mg
      and 30 mg) with meloxicam placebo. Extended-release indomethacin capsules (75 mg) was an
      active control to assess trial sensitivity on bleeding time in healthy subjects. The
      secondary aim of this study was to assess effects of treatment on other platelet function and
      coagulation parameters.

                  partial thromboplastin time (APTT)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on testing days
