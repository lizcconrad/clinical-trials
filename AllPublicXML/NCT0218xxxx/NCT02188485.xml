  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the long-term goal of improving interventions for late-life suicide, the purpose of this
      study is to examine whether a mechanism by which behavioral interventions reduce risk for
      late-life suicide is by increasing social connectedness. The investigators propose to examine
      whether a manualized intervention that targets connectedness--ENGAGE--increases connectedness
      in older adults who report clinically significant depression and
      disconnectedness—operationalized as feeling lonely and/or like a burden on others. The
      investigators propose a randomized controlled trial comparing the ENGAGE intervention with
      care-as-usual (CAU), using n=100 primary care patients aged ≥ 60 years who report social
      disconnectedness (i.e., loneliness or burdensomeness) and either Minor or Major Depression.
      At baseline, 3-week, 6-week and 10-week assessments, subjects will report on social
      connectedness, depression, and suicide risk. The investigators hypothesize that those
      subjects assigned to ENGAGE will report greater increases in connectedness—measured as
      greater belongingness and lower burdensomeness—compared to CAU; that ENGAGE will produce
      greater reductions in depression and suicide ideation than CAU; and that changes in
      depression will be accounted for changes in social connectedness.

    <description>ENGAGE is a brief psychotherapy that specifically targets increased social engagement and activity. The study will use the ENGAGE manual developed by Drs. Alexopoulos, Arean and their colleagues, focusing on increased engagement in activities that allow subjects to be social (targeting thwarted belongingness) or contribute to the well-being of others (targeting perceived burdensomeness).</description>
