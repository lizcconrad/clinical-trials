               -  Without clinically remarkable findings or clinically evident complications based
                  on their concurrent illness, past medical history, physical examination, vital
                  signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature), 12-lead ECG, and
                  laboratory test results

               -  Age ≥20 and Age ≤35 years

               -  Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥18.0 and ≤25.0 kg/m2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding of the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate, body
             temperature, and ECG) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological, or hormonal disorders

          -  Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy)

             than 10 half-lives of the respective drug before administration of the investigational

             does not see any problem for the subject to enter the study based on the result of
             assessment of physical examination and other clinical examination, the subject will be
             able to participate in the study. In this regard, however, subjects who meet one of
             the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

               -  FPG (Fasting plasma glucose) ≥110mg/dL

             QTc interval &gt;450 ms)

          -  A history of additional risk factors for TdP (torsade de pointes) (e.g., heart
             failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome)Samsung2014

          -  Renal glucosuria or elevated urinary glucose levels at screening (&gt;15 mg/dl)
