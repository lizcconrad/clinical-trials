      The purpose of this study is to collect samples of blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF,
      the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord), wound tissue and/or wound fluids, and
      other body fluids and tissues from people who have been seriously injured or ill. The samples
      will be used to develop and assess tests and/or tools that doctors can use to decide the best
      treatment plan for seriously injured or ill military personnel and for civilians. Additonal
      protocols to use the samples will be submitted as separate protocols.

        Patients with injury or illness requiring surgical care or treatment in a critical care or
        emergency setting who are being cared for at SC2I sites, including Grady Memorial Hospital,
        Emory University Hospital, and Duke University Health System. Also, healthy volunteer
        control subjects to include individuals without any known injury or end-stage organ disease
        and patients who have recovered from prior injury.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with injury or illness requiring surgical care or treatment in a critical
             care or emergency setting who are being cared for at SC2I sites (Grady Memorial
             Hospital, Emory Univeristy Hospital, and Duke University Health Systems)

          -  Healthy volunteer control subjects to include individuals without any known injury or
             end-stage organ disease and patients who have recovered from prior injury.

          -  Ability to understand the purposes and risks of the study and willingly give written
             informed consent, or in the case of incapacitated patients, a willing surrogate able
             to give written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the attending physician, would place the patient
             or volunteer subject at undue risk by participating. Specific conditions include but
             are not limited to anemia prohibitive of phlebotomy, coagulopathy, or technical
             considerations that would prevent acquisition of sufficient tissue or fluid for
             clinical use. Acquisition of samples from patients requiring active transfusion or
             with transfusion-associated coagulopathy will be considered as appropriate study
             candidates at the discretion of the attending physician.
