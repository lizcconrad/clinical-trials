    <textblock>
      220 patients with metastatic and/or advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with sunitinib
      (Sutent) will be randomized into two arms :

        -  Control arm: Followed with standard care

        -  Experimental arm: Followed with standard care plus a call center

      Principal assumption : reduce the percentage of adverse events of grade 3, 4 by 20% between
      the control arm (60%) and the experimental arm.

      Observational study, prospective that randomized metastatic and/or advanced renal cell
      carcinoma patients into two arms

        -  Control arm: Followed with standard care

        -  Experimental arm: Followed with standard care plus a call center All eligible metastatic
           and/or advanced renal cell carcinoma patients seen by investigators who will participate
           in the study will be enrolled and randomized into the study. If an eligible patient is
           not enrolled in the study, the oncologists will have to complete that point in a
           registry of non inclusion.
