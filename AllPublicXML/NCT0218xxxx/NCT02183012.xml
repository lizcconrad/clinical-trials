      -  Study to demonstrate average bioequivalence between a 400 mg ibuprofen extrudate tablet
           (Test) and a 400 mg ibuprofen lysinate tablet (Dolormin extra ®; reference 1) under
           fasted conditions.

        -  Study to determine the relative bioavailability of ibuprofen following single
           administration of a 400 mg ibuprofen extrudate tablet (Test) compared to a 400 mg
           ibuprofen tablet (Brufen® 400mg, Denmark; Reference 2) under fasted conditions.
