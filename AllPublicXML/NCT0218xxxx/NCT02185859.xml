    <textblock>
      Postsurgical pain is a relevant side effect following surgery which increases the risk of
      various complications and delays postoperative patient recovery. Among the many types of
      surgeries, mastectomy causes not only acute but also chronic pain in many patients.
      Therefore, it is important to control pain and increase patients' recovery satisfaction
      following many kinds of operations by using as small an opioid analgesic dose as possible and
      adding a nonopioid analgesic to reduce the side effects of narcotic analgesics. Among
      nonopioid analgesics, lidocaine and magnesium are drawing attention, having been shown to be
      helpful in controlling postoperative pain by lowering pain hypersensitivity to surgical
      stimuli. An intraoperative intravenous injection of lidocaine has been reported to improve
      postoperative pain control by reducing postoperative pain and opioid consumption. Another
      report showed that an intraoperative intravenous injection of lidocaine improved the quality
      of postoperative functional recovery after general anesthesia in a laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy patient. In addition, a review article on the effect of intraoperative
      intravenous injection of magnesium found it to be an effective analgesic that may be added to
      conventional opioid-based therapy because it generally reduces opioid consumption, decreases
      pain assessment for 24 hours after surgery, and lacks severe side effects in relation to
      magnesium administration. However, there has been insufficient research comparing the
      intraoperative intravenous injection of lidocaine or magnesium in terms of which is more
      helpful for general functional recovery and decreased postoperative pain. Recently, the scope
      of research on anesthesia has come to embrace postanesthetic recovery; to help patients
      return to daily life, the research trend is now shifting from the improvement or resolution
      of a specific symptom to the measurement of general recovery. A widely used method to measure
      postoperative recovery is the Quality of Recovery 40 (QoR-40) survey.

      Therefore, in this study, the researchers investigated the intraoperative intravenous
      injection of lidocaine and the intravenous injection of magnesium to compare these drugs'
      helpfulness in the functional recovery of mastectomy patients after general anesthesia.

    <description>The investigators will evaluate the quality of recovery after general anesthesia by considering the global score (200 points in total) of QoR-40 surveys, which is obtained by summing the subtotal scores for emotional status, physical comfort, psychological support, physical independence, and pain. The QoR-40 administered 24 hours after the operation is the primary endpoint of this research.</description>

    <description>The lidocaine group (Group L)- 1% lidocaine 40 mL is prepared in a 50 mL syringe; A bolus dose of the studied drugs are administered for 15 minutes immediately after a subject is brought into the operating room, and the vital signs are checked (from the beginning of anesthesia induction). Subsequently, an intravenous injection of the maintenance dose is continuously performed and later stopped just before transferring the subject to a recovery room. (Group L subjects are administered lidocaine 2 mg/kg for 15 minutes immediately after the anesthesia induction, and then lidocaine 2 mg/kg/h is continuously injected. The dose of lidocaine and magnesium in this study has been shown in previous studies to be safe and to have an analgesic effect.)</description>
