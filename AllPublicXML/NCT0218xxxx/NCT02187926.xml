  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of patients selected for
      treatment with roflumilast and the effectiveness and safety of roflumilast in patients with
      severe or very severe COPD treated in Hospital and outpatient specialist ward settings in
      Greece.

      The drug being observed in this study is called roflumilast. Roflumilast is used to treat
      people who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) associated with chronic
      bronchitis with a history of worsening symptoms. This study looked at side effects and the
      lung function of people who take roflumilast. The study enrolled 2577 patients who were
      already prescribed roflumilast as an add on to bronchiodilator treatment by their healthcare
      provider. This multi-centre trial was conducted in Greece. The overall time to participate in
      this study was up to 6 months. Participants were evaluated during routine appointments with
      their healthcare provider.

    <description>A COPD exacerbation is an event characterised by a worsening in the patient's baseline dyspnoea, or cough and/or sputum beyond day-to-day variability sufficient to warrant a change in management, and may be accompanied by increased wheeze, chest tightness, purulent sputum and symptoms of cold and/or fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Months 3 and 6</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be evaluated using the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) 10-item questionnaire. The questions in the CCQ are divided into three area's, or domains: Symptoms: items 1, 2, 5 and 6; Functional state: items 7, 8, 9 and 10; Mental state: items 3 and 4. Individual items within the CCQ are equally weighted. The total score is calculated by adding the scores of the ten items and dividing that number by ten (= number of items). The total CCQ score, and the score on each of the three domains, varies between 0 (very good health status) to 6 (extremely poor health status).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in MRC Dyspnea Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Months 3 and 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Research Council (MRC) breathlessness (dyspnea) scale comprises five statements that describe almost the entire range of respiratory disability: 1 - Not troubled by breathlessness except on strenuous exercise; 2 - Short of breath when hurrying or walking up a slight hill; 3 - Walks slower than contemporaries on level ground because of breathlessness, or has to stop for breath when walking at own pace; 4 - Stops for breath after walking about 100m or after a few minutes on level ground; 5 - Too breathless to leave the house, or breathless when dressing or undressing. The highest numbered question to which the subject answered 'Yes' is the Dyspnea Scale Score.</description>
