    <textblock>
      The VIP-U Study is a clinical trial designed to investigate the effect of ustekinumab
      (Stelara) and placebo on reducing vascular inflammation and cardiometabolic risk biomarkers
      in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.

      This study will look for systemic vascular inflammation in study participants with a test
      called FDG PET/CT (fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography). The
      study will also look for cardiometabolic identifiers (heart disease and metabolic factors) in
      blood samples, including markers of high cholesterol, cholesterol efflux function (the
      ability of cholesterol to move in the body), metabolic factors, and inflammation.

      The study will also examine the effects of ustekinumab compared to placebo on psoriasis
      activity, severity and safety.
