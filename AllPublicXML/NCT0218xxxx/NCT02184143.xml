  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to conduct a two-group randomized control trial (RCT)
      to compare which of two treatments provided by telephone - a cognitive-behavioral based
      physical therapy (CBPT) program focusing on self-management strategies or an education
      program about postoperative recovery - are more effective for improving patient-centered
      outcomes in older adults recovering from lumbar spine surgery for degenerative conditions.
      Our central hypothesis is that the CBPT intervention focusing on self-management will
      decrease pain and disability and improve general health, physical activity and physical
      function in community-dwelling adults undergoing spine surgery, through reductions in fear of
      movement and increases in pain self-efficacy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Radiographic evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis secondary to degenerative changes

          2. Surgical treatment of a lumbar degenerative condition (spinal stenosis, spondylosis
             with or without myelopathy, and degenerative spondylolisthesis) using laminectomy with
             or without arthrodesis procedures

          3. English speaking due to feasibility of employing study personnel to deliver and assess
             the study intervention

          4. Age older than 21 years (younger individuals do not typically have a lumbar
             degenerative condition).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients having microsurgical techniques as the primary procedure, such as an isolated
             laminotomy or microdiscectomy (individuals having these minimally invasive surgical
             techniques tend to have a less severe case of lumbar degeneration and a shorter
             recovery time than individuals having arthrodesis or laminectomy without arthrodesis)

          2. Patients having surgery for spinal deformity as the primary indication (patients with
             spinal deformity as the primary spinal disorder tend to have a different recovery
             trajectory compared to the inclusion population)

          3. Patients having surgery secondary to pseudarthrosis, trauma, infection, or tumor

          4. Presence of back and/or lower extremity pain &lt; 3 months indicating no history of
             chronic pain

          5. History of neurological disorder or disease, resulting in moderate to severe movement
             dysfunction. Including but not limited to Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis,
             Epilepsy, Brain tumors, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Muscular Dystrophy,
             Stroke, Autonomic Nervous System disorders, Traumatic Brain Injury, Cerebral Palsy,
             and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

          6. Presence of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder, including but not limited to
             Brief Psychotic disorder and Delusional disorder

          7. Patients not able to return to clinic for standard follow-up visits with surgeon due
             to time and travel limitation

          8. Patients having surgery under a workman's compensation claim

          9. Unable to provide a stable address and access to a telephone indicating the inability
             to participate in either the telephone-based CBPT or education program.
