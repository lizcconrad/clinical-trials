  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the disease being studied. The main objective of this study is to assess the
      clinical efficacy of mobile phone short message service (SMS) reminder and consultation on
      the self-management and outcomes of poorly controlled asthma which is first diagnosed in a
      time period of 3 months. The secondary objective is to explore the cost-benefit and
      cost-effectiveness of the proposed intervention.

      Aims: The main aim of this study is to assist asthma patients to practice asthma
      self-management at home by sending reminders and responding to patients' consultations with
      mobile phone short message service (SMS), which will eventually help them to control their
      asthma, and prevent asthma exacerbation. Thus, the ultimate goal of this proposed study is to
      improve patient health outcome via enhancing patient-physician interaction through mobile
      phone short message service (SMS) that is low-cost and could be followed easily by the
      patients and their physicians.

      The hypothesis is that asthma patients who receive weekly text message reminders to educate
      them and reinforce adherence will have better asthma outcome, such as asthma control, while
      the intervention integrating patient consultation and reminders by SMS improve asthma outcome
      even more. The investigators further hypothesize that these subjects under intervention will
      have an improvement in secondary measures including quality of life and patient satisfaction.
      The investigators also anticipate that such an approach in asthma management will be
      cost-effective.

      After examined for their eligibility and recruited into this study at outpatient service, all
      participants have their case records which contain their baseline data and receive the same
      standard asthma education(including basic knowledge about asthma, how to use their medicine,
      what to do when an asthma attack happens and when to come back for their disease review and
      so on). Each patient is given a paper asthma diary and a peak expiratory flow(PEF) measurer
      for free. In addition, they are told what intervention they will receive and revised
      face-to-face one month after the beginning of intervention. After the 3-month study period,
      when they return to the hospitals, they will return the asthma diaries, be asked to fill in
      the questionnaires and take pulmonary function tests.
