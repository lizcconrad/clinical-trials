    <textblock>
      Treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is aimed at salvaging viable but ischemic brain by
      opening the occluded artery and restoring anterograde perfusion as quickly as possible. Time
      saved while making critical decisions correctly is vital in AIS management. Conventional
      angiography is invasive, resource intensive and not feasible as a fast diagnostic tool.
      Perfusion CT and MRI are both susceptible to patient motion, need trained personnel to
      process and take at least 10-30 min to acquire and interpret. The investigators have
      developed a new imaging tool, multi-phase CT Angiography (CTA), which generates multiple time
      resolved images of backfilling arteries beyond a blocked artery filled by collaterals.

      Investigators seek to determine: i) if patients with AIS will have a differential clinical
      response to early recanalization based on collateral status assessed on multi-phase CTA, ii)
      if the extent to which collateral assessment on multi-phase CTA resembles perfusion CT in
      predicting which patients will have good clinical outcome with early recanalization, iii)
      Identify determinants of variability in native collateral status in patients with acute
      ischemic stroke.

      Investigators hypothesize that patients with good and intermediate collaterals on multi-phase
      CTA achieve good clinical outcome with early recanalization (within 4 hours of baseline
      imaging); patients with poor collaterals do not do well even with early recanalization.

      Prove-IT is a prospective multi-center hospital-based cohort study of 500 consecutive
      patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting within 12 hours of stroke symptom onset with
      evidence of intracranial occlusion on routine CTA over 3 years. Calgary and seven other
      comprehensive stroke centers will recruit patients into this study. Primary outcome is
      defined as a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 0 to 2 at 24 hours or
      an 8-point drop in NIHSS score from baseline to 24 hours. Secondary outcomes are a) 90-day
      modified Rankin Score (mRS) 0-2 or equal to the pre-stroke mRS; b) percent neurologic
      improvement comparing NIHSS at baseline to 24 hours; c) 90-day NIHSS score 0-2; d) infarct
      volume on 24 hour imaging and e) parenchymal intracerebral hemorrhage type 1 and 2 (ECASS II
      criteria) at 24 hrs.

      Prove-IT looks to establish the ideal imaging selection tool for intra-arterial (IA) and
      thrombolysis decisions in the setting of AIS which is widely available, and can quickly and
      reliably detect salvageable brain.
