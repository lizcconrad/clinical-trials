  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three clinical groups will be evaluated. Each group of patients will undergo one method of
      Resin Composite application (multi-layer technique 'control group' - bulk-fill Technique -
      Sonicfill technique). The restored teeth will be followed-up till one year. A comparison is
      going to be made between the three groups in relation to the modified United Sates Public
      Health Service (USPHS) criteria of good restorations.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The modified USPHS criteria include the evaluation of seven characteristics of the
      restorations: color match, marginal integrity, surface texture, wear of both restoration and
      antagonist, recurrent dental caries, fracture or detachment, and gingivitis around the
      abutment.

    <measure>Change in Color Match</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment will be done at (T0) within the first hour following composite sitting, (T1) after 3 months, (T2) after six months, (T3) after six months, (T4) at 12 months following application.</time_frame>
    <description>Color match
The restoration appears to match the shade and translucency of adjacent tooth tissues.
The restoration does not match the shade and translucency of adjacent tooth tissues, but the mismatch is within the range of tooth shade.
The restoration does not match the shade and translucency of adjacent tooth tissues, and the mismatch is outside the normal range of tooth shade and translucency.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Marginal Integrity</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment will be done at (T0) within the first hour following composite sitting, (T1) after 3 months, (T2) after six months, (T3) after six months, (T4) at 12 months following application.</time_frame>
    <description>Marginal integrity
The explorer does not catch when drawn across the surface of the restoration toward the tooth, or, if the explorer does catch, there is no visible crevice along the periphery of the restoration.
The explorer catches and there is visible evidence of crevice, into which the explorer penetrates, indicating that the edge of the restoration does not adapt closely to the tooth structure.
the explorer penetrates a crevice defect.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Surface Texture</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment will be done at (T0) within the first hour following composite sitting, (T1) after 3 months, (T2) after six months, (T3) after six months, (T4) at 12 months following application.</time_frame>
    <description>Surface texture:
Surface texture is similar to polished enamel as determined by means of a sharp explorer.
Surface texture is gritty similar to a surface subject to a white stone or similar to a composite containing supramicron sizes particles.
Surface pitting is sufficiently coarse to inhibit the continuous movement of an explorer across the surface.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Restoration Wear</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment will be done at (T0) within the first hour following composite sitting, (T1) after 3 months, (T2) after six months, (T3) after six months, (T4) at 12 months following application.</time_frame>
    <description>Wear
The restoration is continuation of existing anatomic form or is slightly flattened.
A surface concavity is evident.
There is a loss of restorative substance such that a surface concavity is evident. Replacement or restorative treatment is required.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Recurrent dental caries</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment will be done at (T0) within the first hour following composite sitting, (T1) after 3 months, (T2) after six months, (T3) after six months, (T4) at 12 months following application.</time_frame>
    <description>Recurrent dental caries:
The restoration is a continuation of existing anatomic form adjacent to the restoration.
There is visual evidence of dark deep discoloration adjacent to the restoration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>The Fracture/detachment Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment will be done at (T0) within the first hour following composite sitting, (T1) after 3 months, (T2) after six months, (T3) after six months, (T4) at 12 months following application.</time_frame>
    <description>Fracture/detachment:
No bulk fracture/detachment is present.
Bulk fracture/ detachment is evident.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Change in gingival status</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment will be done at (T0) within the first hour following composite sitting, (T1) after 3 months, (T2) after six months, (T3) after six months, (T4) at 12 months following application.</time_frame>
