      Primary Objective:

      To estimate the incidence of treatment-emergent and treatment-related adverse events during
      treatment with blinatumomab in pediatric and adolescent subjects with B-precursor ALL in
      second or later bone marrow relapse, in any marrow relapse after alloHSCT, or refractory to
      other treatments

      Secondary Objective(s):

      To describe key efficacy outcomes, including incidence of complete response (CR) within 2
      cycles of blinatumomab, minimal residual disease (MRD) remission within 2 cycles of
      blinatumomab, relapse free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), incidence of alloHSCT, and
      100-day mortality after alloHSCT.

      Hypotheses:

      A formal statistical hypothesis will not be tested. The incidence of treatment-emergent and
      treatment-related adverse events will be estimated.

      Study Endpoints:

        -  Incidence of treatment-emergent and treatment-related adverse events

        -  Incidence of CR within 2 cycles of blinatumomab

        -  MRD remission within 2 cycles of blinatumomab

        -  RFS

        -  OS

        -  Incidence of alloHSCT

        -  100-day mortality after alloHSCT

      Study Design:

      Multi-center, open-label, single-arm expanded access protocol

    <description>A single cycle of blinatumomab (CIVI) treatment is 6wks, 4wks of treatment followed by a 2wk treatment-free interval. Up to 5 cycles will be administered per subject. In the first cycle, for patients with an M3 bone marrow, the initial dose will be 5μg/m2/day for the first 7days, escalated to 15μg/m2/day on D8-D29. For all subsequent cycles 15μg/m2/day will be the dose for all 4wks of continuous treatment. In case of M2 bone marrow or M1 bone marrow with an MRD relapse at screening, the initial dose will start at 15μg/m2/day for the first 7days of treatment &amp; no dose step at D8. For all subsequent cycles the dose will remain 15μg/m2/day. A dose of 9μg/day for the initial dose (if applicable) &amp; 28μg/day for the escalated dose after dose step should not be exceeded.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria 101 Immunophenotypic evidence of CD19 positive B-precursor ALL (pro B-,
        pre B-, common ALL) 102 Age &gt; 28 days and &lt; 18 years at the time of informed consent/assent
        103 Morphological or molecular evidence of relapsed/refractory disease, defined as one of
        the following:

          -  Second or later bone marrow relapse (defined as M3 marrow or M2 marrow or M1 marrow
             but with MRD level ≥ 10E-3), or

          -  Any marrow relapse after alloHSCT (defined as M3 marrow or M2 marrow or M1 marrow but

               -  For patients who have not achieved a first remission: failure to achieve
                  remission following a full standard induction regimen

          -  Subjects previously treated with blinatumomab may be eligible, if subject ended
             treatment for reason(s) other than disease progression or intolerability to
             blinatumomab
