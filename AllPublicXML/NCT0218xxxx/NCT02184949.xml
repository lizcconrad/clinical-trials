  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between annual procedural volume and patient outcome remains a debated issue
      in the field of interventional medicine. An under-explored issue in a UK context is whether
      or not such a relationship exists for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). In recent
      years, this procedure has replaced thrombolysis as the standard intervention method used in
      UK hospitals for widening patients' obstructed coronary arteries. However, the actual number
      of such procedures currently undertaken annually remains variable across hospitals where
      these interventions are performed. The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
      has consequently called for research into whether such differences in volume play any role in
      patient outcome for this particular procedure. The current study is intended to address that
      research need, and will do so by looking at whether the annual number of PCI procedures
      undertaken by individual hospitals is predictive of patient mortality post-procedure.

      Using data collected as part of a UK national audit of percutaneous coronary interventions,
      this study will:

        -  Establish whether annual hospital volume is a clinically important novel risk factor for
           30-day mortality post-PCI when examined relative to a newly developed risk model
           intended for use in clinical practice.

        -  Establish whether the nature of this volume-outcome relationship is best fit as a linear
           or non-linear model.

        -  Establish whether annual hospital volume is a clinically important novel risk factor for
           30-day mortality post-primary PCI when examined relative to a newly developed risk model
           intended for use in clinical practice.

        Percutaneous coronary interventions undertaken in UK hospitals are recorded in the UK
        National Audit of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention. Patients who contribute data to this
        audit will be eligible for inclusion in this study. Additional inclusion criteria, as
        described below, will be applied to ensure that data are appropriate for the intended
        analysis.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  are aged between 18 and 100 (inclusive) on the date of their procedure;

          -  do not have pre-operative ventilation;

          -  undergo a PCI procedure in a UK hospital that contributes data to the National Audit
             of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; and

          -  have a tracked mortality status at 30 days' post-procedure.

        To account for potential dependencies in the data, patients' non-index (i.e. follow-up) PCI
        procedures occurring during the data collection period will be excluded from the study
        sample.
