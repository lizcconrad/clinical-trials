      Our goal in this study is to decrease the severity of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder symptoms
      in sexually abused children between the ages of 8-12. We also aim to improve children's
      quality of life, decrease levels of anxiety and depression as well as improve their levels of
      attachment.
