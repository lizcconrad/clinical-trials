  <brief_title>Tolerability and Potential ECG Effects After a Single Oral Dose of Pentoxyverine Citrate in Healthy Male and Female Volunteers</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase I, Single-dose, Two-way Crossover Study to Investigate Tolerability and Potential ECG Effects After a Single Oral Dose of 192 mg Pentoxyverine Citrate (Corresponding to 121.5 mg Pentoxyverine Base) in Healthy Male and Female Volunteers (Randomised, Single-blind, Placebo-controlled)</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial was to investigate the potential effects of pentoxyverine
      on the ECGs of healthy subjects. A secondary objective was the exploration of safety and
      tolerability. Pharmacokinetics (PK) were only to be investigated if necessary for the
      explanation of ECG effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male and female subjects according to the following criteria:

             Based upon a complete medical history, including the physical examination, vital signs
             (blood pressure (BP), pulse rate (PR)) 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory tests

          2. Age ≥21 and ≤45 years

          3. Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥18.5 and ≤29.9 kg/m²

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any finding of the medical examination (including BP, PR, and ECG) deviating from
             normal and of clinical relevance

          2. Any evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease

          3. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          4. Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy)

          7. Chronic or relevant acute infections

          8. History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to drug or its
             excipients)

          9. Intake of drugs with a long half-life (&gt; 24 hours) within at least one month or less
             than 10 half-lives of the respective drug prior to administration or during the trial

         10. Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial or that prolong
             the QT/QTc interval based on the knowledge at the time of protocol preparation within
             10 days prior to administration or during the trial

         11. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within two months prior to
             administration or during the trial

         12. Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or &gt; 3 cigars or &gt; 3 pipes/day)

         16. Blood donation (more than 100 mL within four weeks prior to administration or during
             the trial)

         17. Excessive physical activities (within one week prior to administration or during the
             trial)

         18. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance

         19. Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

         20. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a
             QTc interval &gt;450 ms);

         21. A history of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., heart failure,
             hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome)
