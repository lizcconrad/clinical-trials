      The aim of the study was detection of pepsin in effusion in children with OME using Peptest
      as new quick and cheap method of detection and comparison results with results of other
      studies in which pepsin was detected by more demanding methods. Such a type of study hasn't
      been done so far.

    <textblock>
      Children at the age between 1 to 7 years diagnosed with bilateral or unilateral OME who
      underwent adenoidectomy and myringotomy with insertion of ventilation tube were included in
      the prospective study. OME was defined as effusion in the middle ear behind intact eardrum
      longer than 3 months. Diagnosis was made on the basis of otomicroscopic findings, pneumatic
      otoscopy, type B tympanometry and audiometry (in older cooperative children). Children with
      no fluid in middle ear during myringotomy were revised as having tympanosclerosis and were
      excluded from the study. Children with craniofacial abnormities (Down syndrome, Treacher
      Collins syndrome, clefts etc.) were excluded from the study, as well. Demographic data and
      symptoms of EER disease were provided by parents, who were particularly inquired regarding
      the hoarseness, recurrent lower respiratory infection (bronchitis, pneumonia) and bronchial
      asthma of their child.

      Myringotomy using microscope was done in anterior inferior part of the tympanic membrane.
      Type of middle ear effusion (fluid, mucous) was registered. Middle ear fluid was collected by
      special suction device with collecting bottle and ventilation tube was inserted in the
      tympanic membrane. In case of bilateral OME, effusion was collected and analysed separately.
      Specimen was first standardized. An amount of 0.1 ml of 10 % citric acid was added, specimen
      was centrifuged for 10 minutes and subsequently original migration reagent was added.
      Afterwards, specimen was examined using Peptest, which contains monoclonal antibodies
      targeted against pepsin. Result of the Peptest was stated as positive (2 lines), negative (1
      line) and invalid (no line). Peptest detection limit is 16ng/ml of pepsin. Statistical
      analysis was done using MS Excel.
