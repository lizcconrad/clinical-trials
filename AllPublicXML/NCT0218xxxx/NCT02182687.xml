  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to trans-arterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) as a bridging strategy for patients with HCC undergoing orthotopic
      liver transplantation. We propose that SBRT will be associated with longer time intervals
      between initial treatment and the need for retreatment, compared to TACE, as a &quot;bridge&quot; to
      orthotopic liver transplantation.

    <textblock>
      For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are waiting for a liver transplant,
      local treatment of their disease has become the standard of care in an effort to decrease
      dropout rates and as a means of reducing tumor recurrence after transplantation. However, the
      best modality for patients undergoing treatment as a bridge to transplantation is unclear.
      This study will compare stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to trans-arterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) as a bridging strategy for patients with HCC undergoing orthotopic
      liver transplantation. We propose that SBRT will be associated with longer time intervals
      between initial treatment and the need for retreatment, compared to TACE, as a &quot;bridge&quot; to
      orthotopic liver transplantation.
