  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a single-center, prospective clinical study of a medical device, controlled,
      randomized, non-stratified, double-blind (neither the patient nor the parents know which area
      is irradiated / practitioner who performs the measures and evaluates the class I achievement
      or non also ignores the irradiated area) .

      Children included in this clinical trial will be their own control, an area receiving LASER
      irradiation the other receiving a simulation LASER irradiation (placebo side, inactive laser)
      .

      In the maxilla, it will be segmented using a technique by the introduction of sectional side
      (portion of elgiloy arch supporting molars, canines and premolars) which serve as a support
      for Intermaxillary Strength II (or Intermaxillary Elastics II).

      The patient should put his own Intermaxillary Elastics II, force adapted to the amount of
      class II dental, and this 24h/24. The patient should position him/herself these
      intermaxillary elastics in the first mandibular molar to the maxillary canine ; their action,
      in case of maximum mandibular anchorage, is to reduce maxillary canine in order to obtain
      reports of class I. In the mandible, a maximum anchor will be realized. Maximum molar anchor
      is to place the roots of mandibular molars in the vestibular cortex in order to anchor them
      there. This allows the lower canines, premolars and maxillary molars under the action of FIM
      without causing mutual advancement of the mandibular arch.

      This procedure does not differ from the usual treatment. The application of laser diode
      appears, by biomodulatrice action, to show promising results on accelerating the kinetics of
      tooth movement during orthodontic treatment. The main hypothesis of the research is an
      increase in the rate of correction of Class II irradiated side, i.e. a 1-month shortest delay
      in obtaining the class I for irradiated areas vs. non irradiated ones.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the application of low energy
      laser (LLLT) on the time required to obtain a Class I canine on patients undergoing FIM II
      (Class II elastics)

    <description>For each sector, obtaining or not the class I will be assessed each month up to 6 months. The difference of delay in obtaining Class I between sectors will be calculated for each patient. For this reason, the primary outcome assessment will be done after 6 months of follow-up + 18 months of inclusion period, i.e. 24 months after starting inclusions.The comparison will be made from a student test on the difference in time required to obtain Class I between sectors.
If class I is obtained on each sector (right and left) prior to the 6-month FUp, the corresponding visit is considered as the last one for the patient within the study.</description>

    <description>The low-energy laser (LLLT Low Level Laser Therapy) SIROLaser Advance: laser diode (970nm) is applied twice at day 0 and at M1. For each patient, randomized in this arm, only the right maxillary canine is actually irradiated. Irradiation is performed by scanning an area from the mesial surface of the maxillary canine to the distal surface of the maxillary first molar in the sagittal direction and the cement enamel junction (CEJ) to the bottom of the vestibule in the vertical direction as well in buccally as in Palatine.
The same procedure will be applied to the left non-irradiated area, the only difference being that the laser will not be activated (placebo, laser inactive). Indeed, only the beam director will be lit and a beep start and end will be heard by the patient. In addition, the practitioner evaluating obtention or not of the class I will not know either which area has been irradiated or not.</description>
