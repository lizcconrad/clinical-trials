      The overarching goal of this study is to develop PET/MR techniques to accurately detect nodal
      metastases for surgical planning and assessment of treatment response.

      Patients (n = 30) with head and neck cancer who are scheduled for node dissection surgery are
      eligible. Enrolled subjects will undergo one research PET/MR scan at the Center for
      Biomedical Imaging (660 First Avenue) within one week prior to the planned surgery. During
      the dissection, the locations of removed lymph nodes will be noted in terms of conventional
      neck lymph node levels. PET/MR data will be used for development of a combined kinetic model
      analysis of PET and MRI data (Aim 1). The final PET/MR findings will be compared with
      pathological evaluation results in order to assess the accuracy of PET/MR for detection of
      nodal metastases (Aim 2).

    <time_frame>2 years after beginning of study (July 2014 - June 2016)</time_frame>
    <description>This study is to assess PET/MR techniques for detection of nodal metastases for surgical planning and assessment of treatment response. Our central hypothesis is glucose metabolic rate (GMR) measured using a simultaneous PET/MR scanner can more accurately detect nodal metastases than standardized uptake value (SUV) measures from PET alone. SUV depends on both tumor metabolic rate and tracer delivery, which makes the interpretation of SUV challenging. For instance, an inflammatory node can have high SUV due to increased vascularity and vascular permeability and cannot be easily differentiated from a metastatic node, based on SUV. However, we hypothesize that inflammatory nodes will have lower GMR than metastatic nodes that contain highly proliferating cancer cells, such that they can be differentiated from metastatic nodes more reliably. This study will also determine if simultaneously acquired MRI can reduce uncertainty in GMR measurement of PET.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with head and neck cancer who are scheduled for node dissection surgeries at NYU
        Langone Medical Center or Bellevue hospital are eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Normal MRI exclusion criteria will apply, including those on the following list. A standard
        MRI safety form will be used to identify potential conditions warranting exclusion.

          -  Electrical implants such as cardiac pacemakers or perfusion pumps

          -  Ferromagnetic implants such as aneurysm clips, surgical clips, prostheses, artificial
             heart, valves with steel parts, metal fragments, shrapnel, bullets, tattoos near the
             eye, or steel implants

          -  Ferromagnetic objects such as jewelry or metal clips in clothing

          -  Claustrophobia

          -  History of seizures

          -  Diabetes In addition, patients with GFR &lt; 15 ml/min/1.73m2 or who are on dialysis will
             be excluded from the study.
