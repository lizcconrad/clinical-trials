  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      18F-FDOPA PET-CT is currently the gold standard in the evaluation of Pheochromocytomas and
      Paragangliomas (PHEO - PGL) since these tumors can also decarboxylate amino acids such as
      dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). This property is common to tumors of the APUD system (Amine
      Precursor Uptake and Decarboxylation). In recent years, PET (Positron Emission Tomography)
      imaging using peptide receptors has gained an increasing role in the management of NETs. The
      use of somatostatin agonists, radiolabeled with gallium-68 (68Ga) enables targeting of
      Somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) with a PET resolution. This has improved diagnosis of
      SSTRs-expressing tumors, including PGLs.

      In the present study, the investigators have chosen DOTATATE (Nal3-octreotate) rather than
      other agonists (DOTATOC and DOTANOC), because of its higher affinity for SST2 which is the
      most overexpressed subtype in PHEO/PGL. However, performances of 18F-FDOPA PET-CT and
      68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT have never been compared in this clinical setting.
