        Inclusion Criteria:

        The patients with COPD (chronic bronchitis, emphysema) and who satisfy the following
        criteria

          1. Patients with FEV1.0/FVC (Forced vital capacity) of &lt;= 70% in the screening test and
             whose symptoms are stable

          2. Patients aged &gt;= 40 years or older

          3. Patients must be able to understand the patient information form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients complicated with bronchial asthma, making the assessment of drug efficacy
             against COPD difficult

          2. Patients who have taken an long acting corticosteroids(i.m.) within 1 month before the
             study

          3. Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at a dose in excess of the equivalent 5
             mg/day of prednisolone

          4. Patients with glaucoma

          5. Patients who have prostatic hypertrophy

          6. Patients with hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs

          7. Patients with serious hepatic disease, kidney disease or heart disorder and who are
             judged by the investigator as inappropriate as the subjects of study

          8. Women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant, or nursing women
