  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, research study is looking at the safety and acceptability of a new vaccine
      adjuvant (immune booster) called PAL when combined with the seasonal flu vaccine (Fluviral)
      to test the safety and effectiveness of new vaccines and medications on healthy volunteers.

      The study will enroll approximately 48 healthy adult participants, and occur over 3 years. In
      the first six months/180 days of the study participants will have visits to the study site
      during which safety and immunogenicity outcomes will be measured. From Day 181 to Year 3,
      participants will be contacted by telephone or email to collect information on any adverse
      events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, dose-ranging, randomized (5:1), observer-blind, controlled study of the
      safety and immune response to intramuscular injection of PapMV (Papaya Mosaic Virus) rVLP
      (Recombinant Virus-Like Particles) which is PAL adjuvant, or &quot;PAL&quot; combined with Trivalent
      Influenza Vaccines (TIV) at one of four dose levels of PAL, combined with one of two dose
      levels of TIV, or active control (TIV). The study will enroll approximately 48 healthy adult
      participants, and occur over 3 years. In the first six months/180 days (Epoch 1) of the study
      participants will have visits to the study site during which safety and immunogenicity
      outcomes will be measured. In Epoch 2 (Day 181 to Year 3) participants will be contacted by
      telephone or email to collect unsolicited adverse events.

      This is a controlled clinical trial. The control group will receive the standard dose of TIV,
      0.5 mL, which consists of 15 μg haemagglutinin (HA) of each influenza strain recommended by
      the World Health Organization (WHO) for the 2013-2014 influenza season in the northern
      hemisphere. An active control is used so that the attributable risk of adverse events can be
      estimated, and so that outcome measures can be assessed in a blinded fashion. Only adults in
      stable health will be eligible in order to minimize participant risk. Only non-pregnant
      females of childbearing age are eligible, and they must agree to continue adequate
      contraception for 180 days after injection. Study holding rules and a safety evaluation by a
      Safety Review Committee (SRC) will be in place. The study will follow a staggered
      dose-escalation design, with each of four steps introducing a new dose of the adjuvant (30,
      60, 120 and 240 μg respectively).

      The first dose level of PAL adjuvant FB-631 is 0.5 X 60 µg (i.e., 30 µg), which is half the
      dose that was found to be most immunogenic in animal studies. The adjuvant is co-administered
      with 0.25 mL of TIV, which is half the dose of TIV that is routinely administered to adults
      (i.e. 7.5 μg of each of the three influenza subtypes contained in the vaccine). The next dose
      level is 60µg of FB-631 combined with 0.25 mL TIV. The third dose level is 120 μg of FB-631
      with 0.25 mL TIV. In the fourth and final step the dose of adjuvant is 240 μg of PAL adjuvant
      combined with 0.25 mL TIV (8 participants) or 0.125 mL TIV (i.e. 3.75 μg HA of each influenza
      subtype contained in the vaccine) (8 participants).

      Any safety signal observed in the study will lead to a hold until the decision of Safety
      Review Committee to continue, modify or suspend the conduct of the study.
