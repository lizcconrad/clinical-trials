  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mandible bears a wide range of mechanical load from the contraction of masticatory
      muscles, and has a significant function in normal chewing movements. Mandibular fractures are
      the most common maxillofacial fractures, accounting for 40%-71% of all maxillofacial fracture
      cases with an average of 62%. The etiology of mandibular fractures mainly includes assaults,
      road traffic accidents (RTAs), falls, and sports injuries. Although a wide variance exists in
      the reported percentage of anterior mandible fractures, aggregate analysis approximates these
      fractures at 17% of all mandibular fractures. The rigid internal fixation (RIF) technique has
      become a common treatment for mandibular fractures, in which titanium plates are used in the
      operation. Some patients have to remove the titanium plates in a second operation following
      bone healing because of sequelae, such as stress shielding. Biodegradable plates and screws
      have been developed to eliminate the problems associated with titanium fixtures. In this
      study, we aim to compare the clinical performance between biodegradable and titanium fixation
      systems after 12 months of follow-up in fixation of mandibular symphysis and parasymphysis
      solitary fractures. We also investigate the stress distributions of biodegradable and
      titanium fixation systems at mandibular symphysis solitary fracture on the conditions of
      intercuspal position, labial teeth occlusion, and premolar and molar occlusion using finite
      element analysis.
