      This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of interferon α among patients undergone
      unmanipulated blood and marrow transplantation following day 60 post-transplantation who were
      minimal residual disease positive after transplantation.

      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an effective treatment option for acute
      leukemia and many other hematological malignancies. However, post-transplant relapse can
      occur in some patients, and the prognosis of these patients is usually very poor.The
      persistence or recurrence of minimal residual disease (MRD) in the post-transplant period is
      an independent risk factor of relapse. Therefore, MRD monitoring can be used to screen
      patients with a high risk of relapse to provide timely intervention and prevent
      post-transplant relapse.Interferon α-2b exerts a relatively strong immunomodulatory effect.
      It can kill acute leukemia (AL) cells by regulating T-cell and/or natural killer cell
      functions.Consequently, interferon α-2b may have potential therapeutic value for AL patients
      with MRD-positive after transplantation.

      The study hypothesis:

      Prevention of relapse using interferon α-2b following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      in patients with standard risk acute leukemia can reduce relapse rate.

    <textblock>
      Standard risk acute leukemia patients (except t(9;22)(q34; q11), t(15;17), inv(16)(p13q22),
      t(16;16)(p13; q22), or t(8;21)(q22; q22) cytogenetic abnormalities.) undergone unmanipulated
      blood and marrow transplantation following day 60 post-transplantation who were minimal
      residual disease positive after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation received interferon
      α-2b. The end points were safety and immunologic response. Following time is 12 months.

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      *The feasibility and efficacy of administering of subcutaneous interferon α-2b in this
      patient population. [ Time Frame: 1 years ]

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      *The immunologic impact and clinical outcomes of subcutaneous interferon α-2b in patients
      after unmanipulated blood and marrow transplantation [ Time Frame: 1 years ] Estimated
      Enrollment:81 Study Start Date: Jun 2014 Estimated Study Completion Date: Jun 2016

      Intervention Details Description:

      *Drug:Interferon α-2b (subcutaneously at dosages of 3 million units 2-3 times per week) for 6
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Acute leukemia patients who were MRD positive after day 60 post-transplantation receive
      interferon α-2b(subcutaneously at dosages of 3 million units 2-3 times per week). Interferon
      α-2b continues for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Participants will be seen periodically while they are receiving interferon α-2b. Physical
      exams and blood tests will be performed weekly for the first two weeks and then every other
      week until the completion of 6 months therapy.

      Eligibility Ages Eligible for Study: 1-60 Years Genders Eligible for Study: Both Accepts
      Healthy Volunteers: No Criteria

      The trial will be terminated in following situation

        1. Severe toxicity occurrence

        2. Cumulative incidence of relapse increased) (≥ 30%)

        3. Cumulative incidence of mortality increased (≥ 30%)

        4. Cumulative incidence of severe graft-versus-host disease increased (≥ 30%)

        5. Although large enough sample had been enrolled, it did not reach statistical
           significance
