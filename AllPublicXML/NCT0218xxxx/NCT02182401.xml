  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to investigate the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction potential of BI 207127 NA and
      BI 201335 NA on each other at steady-state and to quantify the effect of BI 207127 NA, and BI
      207127 NA combined with BI 201335 NA, on the activity of CYP 2C9 and CYP 3A4 using the probe
      substrates tolbutamide (CYP 2C9) and midazolam (CYP 3A4).
