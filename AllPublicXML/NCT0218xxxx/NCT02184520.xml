      This postmarket surveillance study is being conducted to evaluate the TRANSITION
      Stabilization System as an adjunct to fusion in the treatment of acute or chronic
      instabilities or deformities of the thoracic, lumbar and sacral spine. The study will involve
      up to 360 subjects at no more than 20 sites, to be treated with the TRANSITION Stabilization
      System. The data from this postmarket surveillance study will be provided to FDA in
      accordance with the 522 order.
