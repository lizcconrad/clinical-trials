      The primary objective of the Spine Registry is to enhance the understanding of spinal disease
      and treatment of spinal disease with the goal of guiding treatment options.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enhance the understanding of the variability, progression and treatment of
      spinal disease with the ultimate goal of better guiding and assessing therapeutic
      intervention. Researchers will collect complications and safety following cervical and lumbar
      surgeries to determine best options for patients. Prospective reports will be collected on
      patients undergoing lumbar or cervical spinal surgery. Patients will be enrolled in registry
      after signing informed consent. Data will be collected at various time points. The registry
      will serve as a database of cervical and lumbar surgeries in which retrospective analysis and
      exploratory analysis of specific research questions can be answered.

        Approximately 10,000 patients undergoing lumbar or cervical surgery will be screened to
        decide whether they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study/patient
        registry. Patients who meet the study criteria will be informed by the investigator and
        should read the 'patient information' document. Patients must give their written informed
        consent to be enrolled into this study.
