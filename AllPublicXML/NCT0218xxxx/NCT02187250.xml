  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether monotherapy treatment with
      phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor roflumilast is more effective than treatment with
      glucagon-like protein 1 (GLP-1) liraglutide or treatment with metformin as monotherapy in the
      treatment of obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) regarding weight reduction who
      have not been treated before. The investigators anticipated greater changes in body weight in
      patients on roflumilast treatment than in liraglutide or metformin.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The main outcome was change in body weight.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient's body weight was mesured at the base point and every four weeks during 12 weeks of clinical trial.</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's body weight was measured in kilograms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary outcome was change in body mass index (BMI).</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient's body weight were measured at the basepoint and every four weeks during the 12 weeks of clinical trial. Patient's height was measured at the basepoint.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's BMI was defined as the patient's body mass in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The other outcomes was changes in fasting concentrations of glucose.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient's fasting blood was drawn at the base point and at the endpoint of 12 weeks of clinical trial.</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Patient's fasting blood was drawn at the base point and at the endpoint of 12 weeks of clinical trial.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's blood was drawn between 8 and 9 a.m. Concentration of LH was measured in U/L.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Other outcome was change in blood concentrations of FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone).</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient's fasting blood was drawn at the base point and at the endpoint of 12 weeks of clinical trial.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's blood was drawn between 8 and 9 a.m. Blood concentrations of FSH was measured in U/L.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Other outcome was change in blood concentration of testosterone.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient's fasting blood was drawn at the base point and at the endpoint of 12 weeks of clinical trial.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's blood was drawn between 8 and 9 a.m. Blood concentration was measured in nmol/L.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Other outcome was change in blood concentration in androstenedione.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient's fasting blood was drawn at the base point and at the endpoint of 12 weeks of clinical trial.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's blood was drawn between 8 and 9 a.m. Blood concentrations of androstenedione was measured in nmol/L.</description>
