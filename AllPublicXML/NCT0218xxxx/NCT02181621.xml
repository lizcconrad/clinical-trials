      This study is a prospective comparative study to determine if an Iodine Gel (Iodosorb◊) is
      better than standard dressing (Solosite◊ gel) in disruption of biofilm (small microorganism
      bacteria similar to plaque on teeth) on the wound bed diabetic foot ulcers.

          6. The patient has a DFU of Grade 1 or 2 according to the Meggit-Wagner scale. Grade 1 -
             Superficial ulcers limited to the dermis Grade 2 - Ulcers are transdermal with exposed
             bone or tendon, and without osteomyelitis or abscess formation

          7. The patient's ulcer is suitable to be dressed with IODOSORB or SOLOSITE.
