  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of clinician education, electronic health
      record integrated patient reported outcomes, and electronic health record integrated decision
      support on pain-related care quality, outcomes, and service utilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initiative has three components to aid clinicians' care of patients with chronic
      noncancer pain: (1) education, (2) standardized patient reported outcomes data collection,
      and (3) evidence-based brief treatment reminders. Practices will be randomized to either
      receive the three novel components (treatment group) or continue with usual care (control
      group).

      Providers in the treatment group will be asked (a) to complete a series of six online
      education modules in pain care, (b) will be given access to new patient reported outcomes
      questionnaire data collected from patients within the electronic health record, (c) asked to
      review this data and related care recommendations during the patient visit, and (d) asked to
      complete baseline and monthly online surveys related to experiences and satisfaction with
      providing care to patients with chronic noncancer pain.

      Providers in the control group will provide care as usual to patients and will be asked to
      complete baseline and monthly online surveys related to experiences and satisfaction with
      providing care to patients with chronic noncancer pain.

      Primary study outcomes include comparison of treatment and control group provider and patient
      satisfaction surveys. Secondary outcome measures include provider referral rates, patient
      outcomes, patient treatments recommended/ordered, and patient service utilization/costs.

    <time_frame>Up to 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 16 item web based questionnaire about general experiences and satisfaction with providing care to patients with chronic noncancer pain. Data will be collected at baseline (June 2014) and monthly thereafter through the end of the study period (July 2014 - September 2015). Provider satisfaction data for both the treatment and control groups will be compared.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a four to five question phone survey (depending on whether patient is seeing a provider in a treatment or control group) about general and pain-specific satisfaction with visit. Data will be collected after each visit for chronic noncancer pain through the study period (July 2014 - September 2015). Patient satisfaction data for both the treatment and control groups will be compared.</description>
