  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the current study is to determine difference in glycemic control between
      traditional split mix regimen with Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) and regular insulin vs
      basal bolus regimen with glargine and humalog in a population of type 2 diabetes commonly
      encountered in the investigators county hospital setting which include newly diagnosed type 2
      patients and patients on relatively high dose of insulin (dose &gt;0.4 units/kg body weight.
      Primary outcome of the study is to determine differences in glycemic control between
      treatment group as measured by the mean daily blood glucose. Secondary outcome is to measure
      number of hypoglycemic events, number of severe hypoglycemia and length of hospital stay.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of insulin depends not only on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a
      particular preparation, but also on patient specific factors which includes state of
      inflammation, obesity etc. Although effect on glucose disposal is the central to insulin
      action, there could be differences of insulin action on other metabolic parameters. It is not
      known if there is a difference in suppression of inflammation with improved glycemic control
      which could vary with analog insulin. It is unknown if natural insulin (NPH, recombinant
      human insulin with protamine) differs from insulin analogs (glargine and detemir, made by
      substituting amino acid in the native sequence) in terms of metabolic outcome other than
      glucose disposal.

      At this point it is uncertain if there is any clear benefit of use of lantus over NPH in
      inpatient glycemic management. Currently, both lantus and NPH based regimen is practiced in
      inpatient hospital setting. Current practice of inpatient insulin regimen is based more on
      familiarity of physicians with a particular insulin type and personal preference rather than
      evidenced based knowledge. Lantus is an expensive insulin preparation compared to NPH with
      uncertain benefit in inpatient setting. Current research proposal will compare this two
      insulin based regimen in the management of diabetes of hospitalized patients. Information
      obtained through this research will guide the investigators practice in this institution as
      well as in other institutions.

    <description>For the group receiving NPH and regular 2/3 and 1/3 formula will be followed. If Nil per os (NPO), patient will receive NPH twice daily but AM dose will equal to PM dose. Regular insulin given along with NPH will be held while patient is NPO. A correctional dose of regular insulin will be given for any blood glucose &gt;180 mg/dL. If subjects were not eating, they could also receive correctional doses of regular insulin. Correctional insulin could be given four times daily with meals or at bedtime.</description>

    <description>Half of the total insulin dose will be given as glargine once daily, either in the AM or in the PM, depending on when the patient was enrolled. The other half of the total daily insulin dose was given as humalog; doses were divided equally between breakfast, lunch, and dinner. An additional correctional dose of humalog will be given for any blood glucose &gt;180 mg/dL. If subjects were not eating, they received glargine once daily and could also receive correctional doses of humalog. Correctional humalog could be given four times daily with meals or at bedtime.</description>
