  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence-based guidelines recommend cancer surveillance procedures for breast cancer
      survivors including physical examination, mammography, breast self-exam, and gynecologic
      follow-up. The early detection of recurrent and new cancers can best be achieved through the
      combined, on schedule use of these surveillance procedures. Yet, data suggest that up to 55%
      of breast cancer survivors do not undergo these procedures as recommended. This study tests a
      telephone-based psychosocial intervention aimed at improving adherence to recommended
      surveillance in breast cancer survivors. The psychosocial intervention for improving
      adherence is compared to treatment as usual.
