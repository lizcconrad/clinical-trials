  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to compare the effect on simulated driving performance
      of multifocal (MF) versus monovision (MV) soft contact lenses in mid-late presbyopes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this crossover study, subjects wore lotrafilcon B MV (AOAMV) and lotrafilcon B MF (AOAMF)
      soft contact lenses as randomized for 2 weeks each. Subjects were assessed using a
      standardised driving simulation for each of the two treatments. A fresh pair of lenses was
      dispensed for the assessment. Subjects also wore lotrafilcon B single vision distance (SVD)
      and comfilcon A MF contact lenses during Period 1 and Period 2 respectively for an additional
      same-day assessment. Habitual correction was worn for an acclimatization drive in the driving
      simulator during Period 1.

          <title>Standard Deviation of Lateral Positioning</title>
          <description>The standard deviation of lateral positioning (staying in the lane) was assessed during simulated night time driving and measured as the distance of deviation from the reference point, in meters. This outcome measure is prespecified for AOAMV and AOAMF.</description>
          <population>This analysis population includes all randomized subjects in the groups to which they were randomly assigned who successfully completed both study lens follow-up evaluations without a protocol deviation that was documented as impacting the assessment of the hypotheses (Per-Protocol).</population>

      <time_frame>Adverse events (AEs) were collected for the duration of a subject’s participation in the study (up to 4 weeks). This analysis group includes all randomized subjects who successfully tried at least one study lens, based on treatment-specific exposure.</time_frame>
      <desc>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the medical device. Ocular adverse events are presented for both study eye and non-study eye.</desc>
