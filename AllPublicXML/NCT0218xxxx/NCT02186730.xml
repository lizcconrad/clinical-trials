    <textblock>
      This study forms the second phase of previous work to examine the effectiveness of
      computerised Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (cCBT) to treat adolescents with low
      mood/depression.

      Depression affects around 2% of adolescents. Antidepressants are not recommended for this age
      range as a first line treatment because of concerns about their usefulness and side effects.
      Government guidelines have supported using Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), which is
      effective and one of the main treatments recommended for depression. It has been suggested
      that computerised versions of CBT (cCBT) may be effective for treating depression in young
      people who may prefer this to seeing a therapist face-to-face, but little research exists to
      date to support this. This study examines the feasibility of running a large scale randomised
      controlled trial (RCT) to compare a promising cCBT program (Stressbusters) with self-help
      websites for adolescents with low mood and depression (LMD).

      Eligible and consenting participants will complete several questionnaires to assess their
      mood before being randomly assigned to either cCBT (Stressbusters) or equivalent access to
      selected websites providing self help for LMD. Participants will complete further mood
      questionnaires 4 and 12 months after treatment completion/withdrawal. We have already
      recruited 97 individuals to this trial but aim to recruit a further 48 participants to
      collect further information.

      We are also keen to find out whether sending participants text messages before sessions and
      around follow up periods will increase attendance/completion. Therefore all trial
      participants will receive text messages from the research team during their participation.

    <description>Computerised Cognitive Behaviour package consisting of eight 30-45 minute sessions of CBT designed for 12-18 year olds. Each Stressbusters session is an interactive presentation featuring narration synchronised with videos, animations, graphics and printouts.
The programme has a narrator guiding individuals through each of the eight sessions in a linear progression. Each session builds on the knowledge gained in previous sessions and on tasks carried out at home. Sessions contain flexible &quot;add-ons&quot; such as written fact sheets (for example about bullying, sleep problems) which can be printed out and taken away together with home practice related handouts from the programme (for example mood diary sheets). Session topics include getting activated, relapse prevention, challenging negative thoughts and problem solving</description>

    <description>Any individuals randomised to arm 2 of the trial will spend the equivalent time accessing currently available self help websites that provide information about low mood/depression. These four websites will be the same as those used in our initial feasibility study of which, based on our preliminary data, there is evidence for their usefulness.</description>
