  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see whether the combination of Selinexor (KPT-330),
      liposomal doxorubicin and dexamethasone can help people with relapsed and refractory Multiple
      Myeloma. Researchers also want to find out the combination of Selinexor (KPT-330), liposomal
      doxorubicin and dexamethasone is safe and tolerable.

    <description>After the initial screening visit and registration in the study, participants will receive Selinexor orally at a dose of 80 mg for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks of dosing with selinexor and dexamethasone, patients will receive weekly selinexor at a starting dose of 40 mg/m² in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin at a starting dose of 20 mg/m², and dexamethasone at 40 mg orally weekly.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least 2
             prior therapies which must include lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Patients
             must have disease refractory to the most recent therapy. Refractory myeloma is defined
             as progressive disease during or within 60 days of last therapy. Patients must have
             previously received or be ineligible for (or refused) autologous stem cell transplant.

          -  Must have measurable myeloma paraprotein levels in serum (≥ 0.5 g/dL) or urine (≥ 0.2
             g excreted in a 24-hour urine collection sample) or by free light chain (involved free
             light chain greater than 100 mg/L).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1. ECOG 2 allowed if
             due to bone disease

          -  Must have an echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan indicating left
             ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% within 42 days prior to first dose of study
             drug

             clearance of ≥ 30 mL/min, (Cockcroft and Gault)

          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential must agree to use dual methods of
             contraception and have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening. Male patients
             must use an effective barrier method of contraception if sexually active with a female
             of child-bearing potential. For both male and female patients, effective methods of
             contraception must be used throughout the study and for three months following the
             last dose.

          -  Known to be HIV seropositive

          -  Known active hepatitis A, B, or C infection; or known to be positive for hepatitis C
             virus (HCV) RNA or HBsAg (HBV surface antigen)

          -  Any underlying condition that would significantly interfere with the absorption of an
             oral medication

          -  Grade &gt;2 peripheral neuropathy at baseline (within 14 days prior to loading phase (day
             -7))
