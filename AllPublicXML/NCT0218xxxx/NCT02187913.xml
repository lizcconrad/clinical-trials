  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  About two-thirds of adults in the United States are overweight or obese which can cause
           adverse health consequences for those individuals. Post-prandial hyperglycemia is one of
           these possible consequences and is associated with a higher risk for Type 2 Diabetes.
           Controlling hyperglycemia is important in the prevention of the onset of diabetes and
           obesity. Resistant starch is a dietary carbohydrate which is not completely digested in
           the gut and produces energy for the body to use. The investigators are interested in
           assessing the effects of resistant starch on postprandial blood glucose and insulin
           concentrations.

        -  Aim: To assess the effects of a resistant starch on post-prandial blood glucose and
           insulin concentrations.

        -  Hypothesis: A baked snack bar with a resistant starch will blunt and sustain the
           post-prandial rise in blood glucose and insulin concentrations compared to a baked snack
           bar with maltodextrin (an easily digested carbohydrate).

    <description>Each subject will complete 2 testing days (randomized and crossover design). On each of 2 test days, subjects will arrive at the Purdue Clinical Research Center after a 12-h fast and will consume a snack bar containing resistant starch. The test snack bar will be consumed along with a standard meal provided at the start of the test day. A second standard meal that does not contain the snack bar will be consumed four hours later.</description>
