      Indication : edentulous patients To evaluate and compare the marginal bone level change
      around tilted and straight NobelActive implants placed in healed sites with
      All-on-4-treatment concept after immediate function supporting NobelProcera Implant Bridge
      (fixed) in the mandible and maxilla.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        The subject is at least 18 years of age (or age of consent) and has passed secession of
        growth

        Obtained informed consent from the subject

        Edentulous mandible or maxilla providing sufficient bone whereas a fixed NobelProceraTM
        Implant bridge on four (4) implants is regarded as an appropriate treatment solution

        The subject has an osseous architecture enough to receive four implants and a sufficient
        amount of bone for placing in healed sites implants with a length of at least 8 mm

        The implant site is free from infection and extraction remnants Implants will be placed in
        healed sites.

        Good gingival / periodontal / peri-apical status of opposing teeth/implants

        The subject fulfills the prerequisite that a harmonic, stable occlusal relationship can be
        achieved with opposing natural teeth resp. fixed or removable opposing dentition (tooth or
        implant based

        The subjects as well as the implant site(s) fulfill the criteria for immediate loading.

        The subject is in such a physical and mental condition that a 5-year follow-up period can
        be carried out without foreseeable problems The subject is available for the 5-year term of
        the investigation

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The subject is not able to give her/his informed consent of participating

        Health conditions, which do not permit the surgical (including anesthesia) or restorative
        procedure

        Reason to believe that the treatment might have a negative effect on the subject's overall
        situation (psychiatric problems), as noted in subject records or in subject history Any
        disorders in the planned implant area such as previous tumors, chronic bone disease or
        previous irradiation in the head/neck area

        Alcohol or drug abuse as noted in subject records or in subject history Smoking of &gt;10
        cigarettes/day

        Uncontrolled diabetes, i.e. a subject with diagnosed diabetes that has a history of
        neglecting doctor's recommendations regarding treatment, food and alcohol intake

        Pathologic occlusion, e.g. severe bruxism or other destructive habits

        Lack of opposing dentition or unstable occlusion

        Ongoing infections, endodontic or periodontal problems in opposing teeth or implants

        Subject shows an unacceptable oral hygiene

        Subject has allergic or adverse reactions to the restorative material.

        Bone augmentation of more than 3mm vertical height performed less than 6 months prior to
        planned implant placement.

        Bis-phosphonate therapy

        Implant insertion torque is &lt;35 Ncm or &gt;70 Ncm
