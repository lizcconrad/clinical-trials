  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, open-label, placebo, crossover, multicentre study with a single visit.
      The study will comprise five sub-studies. Subjects will receive inactive treatment (placebo)
      via the ELLIPTA® inhaler and one of the other inhaler devices depending on the sub-study they
      are randomised to. Only subjects who are naïve to the ELLIPTA inhaler and to one of the other
      inhaler devices that will be used in this study will be included. Furthermore, subjects who
      are naïve to the BREEZEHALER® and HANDIHALER® inhalers must be naïve to all other inhaler
      devices that requires a capsule. The study will be conducted in the UK and the Netherlands,
      and comprises one visit only. A sufficient number of subjects (at least 600) with COPD will
      be screened and 570 will be randomised to one of five sub-studies. Eligible subjects will be
      allocated to one of the sub-studies depending on their experience of using the other inhaler
      (i.e., depending on which other inhaler they are naïve to).

      This study is designed to assess the proportion of COPD subjects making critical and overall
      (i.e., critical and non-critical errors) errors in using ELLIPTA inhaler and other
      commercially available inhaler devices such as the TURBUHALER®, HANDIHALER, BREEZHALER, MDI
      and DISKUS®/ACCUHALER® inhalers. This study will also assess the 'ease of use' and preference
      between the ELLIPTA inhaler and the other commercially available inhaler devices.

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>A critical error was defined as an error that was most likely to result in no or only minimal medication being inhaled. The errors considered as critical errors while handling the inhaler devices were failed to open cover, lever was not pushed back, shook the device after dose preparation, exhaled directly into mouthpiece, no seal by the lips round the mouthpiece during the inhalation. As per the crossover study design participants received placebo via the ELLIPTA inhaler first and then non-ELLIPTA inhaler or non-ELLIPTA inhaler first and then ELLIPTA on Day 1. The percentage of participants who made at least one critical error was reported for each inhaler regardless sequence.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>An overall error includes a critical and non-critical error. Any error made by the participants while demonstrating the use of the inhaler after reading the patient instruction leaflet was recorded by health care professional (HCP). The percentage of participants who made at least one overall error was reported. As per the crossover study design participants received placebo via the ELLIPTA inhaler first and then non-ELLIPTA inhaler or non-ELLIPTA inhaler first and then ELLIPTA on Day 1.</description>

If the participant made any error while demonstrating the use of the inhaler after reading the patient instruction leaflet, the HCP demonstrated the correct usage of the inhaler to the participant. The participants were then asked to demonstrate inhaler use again. If any further critical error were made by the participant, the error were recorded by HCP.</description>

    <description>If the participant made any error while demonstrating the use of the first inhaler after reading the patient instruction leaflet, the HCP demonstrated the correct usage of the inhaler to the participant. The participant was then asked to demonstrate inhaler use again. Any errors made by the participant were recorded by the HCP. The same procedure was repeated if the participant continues to make errors in the use of the inhaler. In total, the HCP demonstrated the use of the inhaler up to three times. Same procedure was followed for second inhaler. The number of participants who demonstrated the adequate inhalation technique after third time instructions from HCP was reported.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Overall Preferred the ELLIPTA Device Compared to Non-ELLIPTA Inhalers as Assessed by the Preference Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>After completing the demonstration procedures of the inhalers, the HCP asked the participant a number of questions from preference questionnaire. Preference questionnaire consisted of eight questions related to both inhalers used during the study. Each question had one response to choose from 3 preference options (Other inhaler device, ELLIPTA inhaler device and No preference). The number of participants who overall preferred the ELLIPTA device compared to non-ELLIPTA inhalers (First question in the preference questionnaire) were reported.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Overall Found the ELLIPTA Device Easy to Use Compared With Non-ELLIPTA Inhalers as Assessed by the Ease of Use Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>After completing the demonstration procedures of the inhalers, the HCP asked the participant a number of questions from ease of use questionnaire. Ease of use questionnaire consisted of six questions each for ELLIPTA inhaler and the other inhaler under study. Each question had one response to choose from 5 options of ease of use (Very easy, easy, neutral, difficult and very difficult). Based upon the response given by the participants the number of participants who rated ease of use higher for ELLIPTA, higher for non- ELLIPTA, or rated the same were reported</description>

        <description>A critical error was defined as an error that was most likely to result in no or only minimal medication being inhaled. The errors considered as critical errors while handling the inhaler devices were failed to open cover, lever was not pushed back, shook the device after dose preparation, exhaled directly into mouthpiece, no seal by the lips round the mouthpiece during the inhalation. As per the crossover study design participants received placebo via the ELLIPTA inhaler first and then non-ELLIPTA inhaler or non-ELLIPTA inhaler first and then ELLIPTA on Day 1. The percentage of participants who made at least one critical error was reported for each inhaler regardless sequence.</description>

        <description>A critical error was defined as an error that was most likely to result in no or only minimal medication being inhaled. The errors considered as critical errors while handling the inhaler devices were failed to open cover, lever was not pushed back, shook the device after dose preparation, exhaled directly into mouthpiece, no seal by the lips round the mouthpiece during the inhalation. As per the crossover study design participants received placebo via the ELLIPTA inhaler first and then non-ELLIPTA inhaler or non-ELLIPTA inhaler first and then ELLIPTA on Day 1. If the participant made any error while demonstrating the use of the inhaler after reading the patient instruction leaflet, the HCP demonstrated the correct usage of the inhaler to the participant. The participants were then asked to demonstrate inhaler use again. If any further critical error were made by the participant, the error were recorded by HCP.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Overall Preferred the ELLIPTA Device Compared to Non-ELLIPTA Inhalers as Assessed by the Preference Questionnaire</title>
        <description>After completing the demonstration procedures of the inhalers, the HCP asked the participant a number of questions from preference questionnaire. Preference questionnaire consisted of eight questions related to both inhalers used during the study. Each question had one response to choose from 3 preference options (Other inhaler device, ELLIPTA inhaler device and No preference). The number of participants who overall preferred the ELLIPTA device compared to non-ELLIPTA inhalers (First question in the preference questionnaire) were reported.</description>

        <description>After completing the demonstration procedures of the inhalers, the HCP asked the participant a number of questions from ease of use questionnaire. Ease of use questionnaire consisted of six questions each for ELLIPTA inhaler and the other inhaler under study. Each question had one response to choose from 5 options of ease of use (Very easy, easy, neutral, difficult and very difficult). Based upon the response given by the participants the number of participants who rated ease of use higher for ELLIPTA, higher for non- ELLIPTA, or rated the same were reported</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Overall Found the ELLIPTA Device Easy to Use Compared With Non-ELLIPTA Inhalers as Assessed by the Ease of Use Questionnaire</title>
          <description>After completing the demonstration procedures of the inhalers, the HCP asked the participant a number of questions from ease of use questionnaire. Ease of use questionnaire consisted of six questions each for ELLIPTA inhaler and the other inhaler under study. Each question had one response to choose from 5 options of ease of use (Very easy, easy, neutral, difficult and very difficult). Based upon the response given by the participants the number of participants who rated ease of use higher for ELLIPTA, higher for non- ELLIPTA, or rated the same were reported</description>
