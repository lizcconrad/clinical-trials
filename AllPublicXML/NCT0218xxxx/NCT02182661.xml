        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have taken an long acting corticosteroids(i.m.) within 1 month before the
             screening test

          2. Patients using corticosteroid medication( p.o./ i.h.) at a dose in excess of the
             equivalent 10 mg/day of prednisolone
