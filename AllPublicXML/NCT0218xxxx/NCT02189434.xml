  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serum procalcitonin levels will be considerably higher, for a longer period of time, in
      patients who develop sepsis compared to patients with SIRS or those who have an uncomplicated
      post-surgical recovery. Monitoring of serum procalcitonin trends will allow for an earlier
      diagnosis of, and initiation of treatment for, sepsis compared to current standard ICU
      methods.

    <intervention_name>Serum procalcitonin lab draws</intervention_name>
    <description>Blood will be collected in a 4mL capacity, green top lithium heparin tube. Samples can be drawn from a port with other labs. The samples will be centrifuged and then the plasma/serum will be removed and placed into a screw-capped round bottom plastic vial. Samples will be stored at -20○C until processing. Serum samples will be batch processed for each participant at the conclusion of their study period.
These draws will be conducted for the sole purpose of this study, and whenever possible, they will be performed at the same time as routine blood draws conducted for medical monitoring to reduce the burden to the patients.</description>
