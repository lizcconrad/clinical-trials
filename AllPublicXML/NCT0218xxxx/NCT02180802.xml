    <textblock>
      Motivational interviewing (MI) has been shown to be an effective strategy in targeting
      obesity in adolescents and parental involvement has been associated with increased
      effectiveness. The aim of the study is to evaluate and compare the role of parental
      involvement in MI interventions for obese adolescents

    <description>The behavioral intervention targets were improved eating and physical activity behavior in order to reduce obesity levels. Each adolescent was encouraged to eat a variety of foods from each of the four major food groups and low-fat alternatives . Moreover, each adolescent was encouraged to achieve at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity daily as recommended by the World Health Organization</description>
