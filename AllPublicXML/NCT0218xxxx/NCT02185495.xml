  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imaging procedures including chest X-ray and low-dose computed tomography may be effective in
      lung cancer early detection. Yet it is unknown whether low-dose computed tomography combined
      with computer aided detection （CAD) is more effective than LDCT in screening of early lung
      cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The randomized clinical trial is to investigate and compare the effectiveness of CAD-guided
      low-dose computed tomography and low-dose computed tomography in lung cancer screening for
      community individuals in Shanghai, China. Thus, an imaging protocol which can detect early
      lung cancer in asymptomatic high risk patients will be proposed.

    <description>A questionaire will be recorded for each subject, including demographics, smoking history and disease history, etc. If a pulmonary nodule was found, the location, shape, size, margin and density will be recorded.
A subject with a suspected malignant nodule, which was detected either by a radiologist or computed-aiding detection software, will refer to a physician for further management.
Finally, the sensitivities of radiologist or software detection will be calculated.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age of 55 to 74 years; smoking history of at least 30 pack-years; and if former
             smoker, have quit within 15 years

          -  Age 50 or older ,20 or more pack-year history of smoking, and one additional risk
             factor (occupational exposure, residential radon exposure, cancer history, family
             history of lung cancer, history of lung disease)

          -  Age 35 and one additional risk factor

          -  Ability to accept LDCT examination and sign informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with any symptoms suggestive of lung cancer （e.g., vigorous coughing,
             chest pain, weight loss, blood-stained sputum）

          -  Individuals with acute pulmonary abnormalities or those in poor health conditions or
             those have metallic implants or devices in the chest or back will be excluded due to
             the potential impact on the results as well as difficulty of acquiring the images.
