  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were asked to come to the Purdue facilities after an overnight fast on 2 different
      testing days for 2.5 hours each day. On one day the subjects participated in blood pressure
      and body weight measurements as well as a muscle biopsy from the thigh. On the second day the
      subjects underwent an MRI and MRS scan of the thigh and calf.
