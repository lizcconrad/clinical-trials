  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, randomized, single dose, three way crossover study in
      healthy male subjects. The aim of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of
      two formulations of a fixed dose combination (FDC) capsule of dutasteride and tamsulosin
      hydrochloride (HCl) (0.5 milligram [mg]/0.2 mg) relative to co-administration of dutasteride
      0.5 mg capsules and tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.2 mg tablets in both the fed and fasted
      states. Approximately 84 healthy adult male subjects will be enrolled into the study and
      split into two cohorts (fed and fasted), allowing for approximately 36 subjects to complete
      each cohort. Subjects from both cohorts will receive single oral doses in 3 treatment periods
      and be randomized to one of six different treatment sequences (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA)
      wherein A= FDC1: Dutasteride and tamsulosin HCl (0.5 mg/0.2 mg), B= FDC2: Dutasteride and
      tamsulosin HCl (0.5 mg/0.2 mg), C= Co-administration of commercial formulations of
      dutasteride(0.5mg) and tamsulosin HCl (0.2mg). Each treatment period will be separated by a
      minimum 28 day washout period. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be taken at
      regular intervals after dosing. Safety will be assessed by measurement of blood pressure,
      heart rate and review of adverse events.

             which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside
             the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator, in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor if required, agree and

             condom. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until 50 days post-last dose.

             Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &lt;450 milliseconds (msec)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Criteria Based Upon Medical Histories

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or
             GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  History of postural hypotension, dizziness, poor hydration, vertigo, vaso-vagal
             reactions or any other signs and symptoms of orthostasis, which in the opinion of the
             investigator could be exacerbated by tamsulosin and result in putting the subject at
             risk of injury.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined for US
             sites as: an average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females.
             One drink is equivalent to 12 gram (g) of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 millilitre [mL]) of
             beer, 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  History of diabetes or peptic ulcer disease which is uncontrolled by medical
             management.

          -  History of breast cancer or clinical breast examination finding suggestive of
             malignancy. History of malignancy within the past five years, except for basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin. Subjects with a prior malignancy who have had no evidence of
             disease for at least the past 5 years are eligible.

          -  Prior medical history or evidence of prostate cancer (e.g., positive biopsy, or
             suspicious ultrasound, or suspicious digital rectal examination [DRE]). Patients with
             suspicious ultrasound or DRE who have had a negative biopsy within the preceding 6
             months and stable prostate specific antigen (PSA) are eligible for the study. Note:
             The investigator should make every appropriate effort to exclude the possibility of
             prostate cancer, including consideration of prostate biopsy in any subject with a
             known abnormal PSA.

        Criteria Based Upon Diagnostic Assessments

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening;

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          -  A positive test for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody. Other Criteria

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including
             vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or
             14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study
             procedures or compromise subject safety.
