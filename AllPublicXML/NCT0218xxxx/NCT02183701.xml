    <textblock>
      The general aim and clinical objective of this trial is to determine the effect of
      telmisartan 80 mg compared to losartan 50 mg + HCTZ (Hydrochlorothiazide) 12.5 mg on
      reduction of blood pressure (BP) in patients with mild to moderate hypertension as assessed
      by 24 hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) and trough sitting BP cuff
      measurements at the end of the treatment.
