  <brief_title>Closed-loop Control of Overnight Glucose Levels (Artificial Pancreas) in Children With Type 1 Diabetes in a Diabetes Camp</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open-label, Randomized, Three-way, Cross-over Study to Assess the Efficacy of Single-hormone Closed-loop Strategy, Dual-hormone Closed-loop Strategy and Conventional Pump Therapy in Regulating Overnight Glucose Levels in Children With Type 1 Diabetes in a Diabetes Camp</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels,
      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop system would
      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormone: insulin and glucagon.

      The main objective of this project is to compare the efficacy of single-hormone closed-loop
      strategy, dual-hormone closed-loop strategy and pump therapy to regulate overnight glucose
      levels in children with type 1 diabetes in a diabetes camp.

      The investigators hypothesized that dual-hormone closed-loop strategy reduces the time spent
      in hypoglycemia in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) compared to single-hormone closed-loop
      strategy, which in turn is more effective than the conventional pump therapy to reduce time
      spent in hypoglycemia

      Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels,
      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop system would
      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormone: insulin and glucagon.

      The investigators aim to conduct a randomized three-way cross-over trial comparing single
      hormone closed-loop strategy, dual-hormone closed-loop strategy and the conventional pump
      therapy. The investigators aim to compare the three interventions for 3 consecutive nights in
      children with type 1 diabetes in a diabetes camp.

    <description>Glucose levels will be controlled by single-hormone closed-loop strategy for 3 consecutive nights. A member of the research team will be present at the diabetic camp to ensure protocol implementation and patient's safety. Glucose levels will be controlled by single-hormone closed-loop strategy between 22:00 until 7:00 next morning. Glucose sensor reading will be entered manually into the computer every 10 minutes. The computer will generate a recommendation for the basal rates of insulin delivery. Pump's parameters will then be changed manually to implement the computer generated recommendations.</description>
