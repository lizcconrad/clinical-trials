  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is concern in the literature regarding egg consumption in diabetic people. The
      investigators hypothesis is that compared to an oatmeal-based breakfast, an egg-based
      breakfast will not increase the risk for heart disease in diabetic people but it may reduce
      inflammation, in this population characterized by chronic low grade inflammation.

      This is a cross-over study in which subjects will be randomly allocated to consume 1 egg per
      day for breakfast or a bowl of oatmeal with lactose-free milk for 5 weeks. After a 3 wk
      washout period, subjects will be allocated to the alternate treatment for additional 5 weeks.

      Blood will be collected at baseline and at the end of each dietary period to measure plasma
      lipids, glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin and inflammatory markers.

      This study is conducted in diabetic patients who are given two distinct breakfasts: eggs and
      oatmeal in a crossover design. The investigators hypothesis is that eggs will not increase
      the risk for heart disease in this population when compared to oatmeal but they will more
      likely reduce inflammation due to the presence of the carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin that
      are highly available in eggs.

      In this study, the investigators are evaluating three main things

        -  Atherogenic dyslipidemia by measuring plasma lipids and lipoprotein mean size and
           subfractions by nuclear magnetic resonance.

        -  Glucose metabolism by measuring plasma glucose, insulin, insulin resistance and
           glycosylated hemoglobin.

        -  Inflammation by measuring liver enzymes, C reactive protein, tumor necrosis
           factor-alpha, interleukin-6.

      All these measurements were done 24 weeks after completion of the study All data will be
      presented 1 year after completion of the study

    <description>Glycosylated hemoglobin had to be &lt; 9% as one of the inclusion criteria. This parameter was assessed after 5 weeks that the subjects consumed the egg and after 5 weeks after the subjects were consuming the oatmeal.</description>

    <measure>plasma LDL cholesterol</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and 5 weeks after the consuming the eggs and 5 weeks after consuming the oatmeal</time_frame>
    <description>This parameter was assessed to ensure that no significant changes in LDL cholesterol occurred by egg intake or oatmeal intake. LDL cholesterol was assessed after 5 weeks of consuming the eggs and 5 weeks of consuming the oatmeal.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>tumor necrosis factor alpha</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed after 5 weeks of consuming the eggs and after 5 weeks of consuming the oatmeal</time_frame>
    <description>This parameter was measured to determine whether egg intake favorably would affect inflammation in diabetic subjects. Tumor necrosis factor alpha was measured after 5 weeks of consuming the eggs and 5 weeks after consuming the oatmeal.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The intervention consists in feeding the subjects egg, one a day for breakfast during 5 weeks. At the end of the intervention, blood will be obtained to measure plasma lipids, glucose, insulin and inflammatory markers. All measurements will be finished 24 weeks after the intervention is finished. All data will be reported 1 year after completion of the study.</description>

    <description>In this arm, subjects will consume oatmeal for a period of 5 weeks. Blood samples will be taken and different parameters will be measured including plasma lipids, glucose, insulin and inflammatory markers. All these measurements will be finished 24 weeks after completion of the study. All data will be reported 1 year after completion of the study.</description>

    <description>One egg per day as breakfast for 5 weeks followed by a 3 week washout period and 5 additional weeks on oatmeal. This is a randomized crossover design. Half of subjects started with the eggs and the other half with oatmeal. Blood lipids, glucose and inflammatory measurements will be finished 24. weeks after completion of the study. Data will be reported 1 year after the completion of the study.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be fed oatmeal for a period of 5 weeks. After 3 weeks they will be switched to the alternate diet. This is a randomized control trail in which plasma glucose, plasma lipids and inflammatory markers will be measured. All these measurements will be finished 24 weeks after completion of the study. Data will be reported after 1 year of the completion of the study.</description>
