      The aim of the study is to investigate

        -  the indication for MOBEC in a dose of 15 mg per day

        -  the treatments patients were receiving before switching to 15 mg MOBEC

        -  how treatment with 15 mg is assessed compared with previous treatment

        -  how effective and safe treatment with 15 mg MOBEC is considered
