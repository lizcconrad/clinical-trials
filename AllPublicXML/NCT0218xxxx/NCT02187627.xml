  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to obtain basic information on three PET imaging tracers developed to
      detect tau pathology in the brain. In this study, healthy control participants and
      participants with AD will be studied. Information collected will include brain and plasma
      kinetics, tissue distribution (in the brain), radiation dosimetry, and test-retest
      variability of the signal in the brain. The study will consist of Part 1, Part 2A, and Part
      2B. During Part 1, imaging data will be assessed on an ongoing basis and based on data, one
      tracer will be prioritized over the other two tracers. The tracer selected will be further
      investigated in Part 2A and Part 2B.
