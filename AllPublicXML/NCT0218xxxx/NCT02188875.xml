  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies suggest self-regulatory techniques including self-monitoring, and SMS
      text-messaging as an intervention modality, can modify health behaviors including physical
      activity (PA). The primary purpose of this study was to examine change in objectively
      measured PA in a randomized controlled pilot trial that tested a wearable sensor/device
      (Fitbit One) for self-monitoring and SMS text-messaging prompts to promote PA in
      overweight/obese adults. In a 2-group design, 67 participants were provided the Fitbit One
      and half were randomized to receive 3 daily SMS-based PA prompts. A Fitbit One was provided
      to facilitate self-monitoring with a wearable tracker for instant feedback and website of
      daily PA summaries. Outcome measures were number of steps and minutes of PA by
      intensity-level using two accelerometers: Actigraph GT3X+ (primary) at baseline and 6-week
      follow-up and Fitbit One (secondary) at baseline and weeks 1-6. The main hypothesis was that
      text messaging plus the Fitbit One would show a greater increase in steps and minutes of PA
      compared to only the Fitbit One at 6-week follow-up.
