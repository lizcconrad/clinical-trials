  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between 6 and 16% of patients presenting to hospital emergency departments have infections,
      with half of these having signs of systemic inflammation (known as 'sepsis'). A second issue
      is that, at time of presentation, it can be difficult to determine who has inflammation as a
      result of infection and who does not.

      Some of the patients with infections will deteriorate to organ failure ('severe sepsis')
      including failure of the heart and blood vessels to maintain normal blood pressure ('septic
      shock'). Septic shock as arguably the most dangerous form of severe sepsis is associated with
      a significant mortality, which can be reduced by early intervention. However identifying
      those patients who are at high risk of deteriorating to septic shock can be difficult on
      initial presentation to hospital, and thus these patients risk being 'triaged' to an
      inappropriate level of care and/or missing the crucial early interventions which can modify
      mortality. Equally failure to identify which patients have underlying infections can lead to
      potential inappropriate targeting of antibiotics. Existing clinical and laboratory tests are
      often unable to accurately identify those patients with infection, and those who are likely
      to deteriorate to severe sepsis and septic shock.

      Investigators in this group have recently identified several signatures of immune system
      activation which predict those patients who are likely to deteriorate, and which patients
      with suspected infection subsequently have this confirmed. Such tests would have major
      benefits for the management of patients with early suspected infection and sepsis if they can
      be translated into a test usable in everyday clinical practice. This study aims to determine
      the prevalence of these markers in a cohort of patients admitted with suspected sepsis, and
      their predictive ability for developing established septic shock. From this investigators aim
      to derive an optimal test, to be tested in a validation cohort (ExPRES-Sepsis II) which will
      be suitable for everyday clinical practice, and thus take the next step towards developing a
      market-ready test.

      Study hypothesis is:

      Measurement of markers of immune activation will allow i) Risk stratification for
      deterioration into severe sepsis ii) Risk stratification for death amongst patients
      presenting with sepsis iii) Identification of patients with confirmed sepsis
