  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to confirm that the new generation state of the art breath analyzer
      gives equivalent results to the previous model of the Exalenz breath analyzer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy and chronic liver disease subjects of all grades will be tested to see that the two
      devices give equivalent results in both devices. Subjects will be connected to both devices
      at the same time and will be tested for one hour.

      The breath test includes automatic baseline breath collection, 13C-Methacetin ingestion in
      solution and breath collection post ingestion.
