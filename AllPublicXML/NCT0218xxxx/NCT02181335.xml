  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish that at least one of the two doses of Budesonide, as an ethanolic solution
      inhaled from the Respimat ® inhaler (100 and 200 mcg, 2 puffs bid) for a 12-week study period
      in symptomatic moderate to severe asthmatic patients, gives a therapeutic response, which is
      not inferior to that obtained from the dose of Budesonide inhaled from the Turbohaler ® (200
      mcg, 2 puffs bid) and that the safety profile is at least as good
