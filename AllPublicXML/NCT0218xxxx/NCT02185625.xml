  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether use of the Safe Delivery smartphone
      application by midwives can reduce excess blood loss from bleeding, and infant death during
      childbirth in Ghanaian women. Moreover, it will be investigated whether the Safe Delivery
      application can increase midwives' knowledge and skills in managing childbirth.

      Fifteen hospitals in Greater Accra, Ghana, will be cluster randomized to either use the Safe
      Delivery application (intervention), or to no intervention (control). In the intervention
      hospitals, midwives will be educated in the use of Safe Delivery. Pregnant women will be
      enrolled at delivery and followed until 7 days postpartum. Data collection will begin July
      2014 and is expected to be finished by October 2014.

    <description>The intervention is the use of a smartphone application called Safe Delivery, designed by University of Copenhagen, Denmark and Maternity Foundation Denmark. The application contains animated videos aimed to train midwives in the prevention and management of postpartum hemorrhage and the treatment of neonatal resuscitation. The instructions in the videos are based on WHO recommendations, and the application is designed to be an on-going tool for midwives, so that they can drill themselves in the emergencies of postpartum hemorrhage and neonatal resuscitation.</description>
