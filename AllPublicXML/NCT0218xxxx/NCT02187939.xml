  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Get in the GROOVE! will address health disparities impacting underserved youth. Given the
      alarming rate of overweight and obesity among high school minority youth, the project will
      focus on middle school with the primary aim of reaching middle school girls before unhealthy
      habits become firmly ingrained.

      The primary aim of the research project is to investigate the impact of two types of summer
      science enrichment programs (that focus on health and wellness) on middle school girls'
      self-efficacy, health knowledge, health behaviors, and interest in science. One program will
      present the curriculum by conventional means (GROOVE condition) while the second program will
      include the addition of a closed 3-D virtual world environment to reinforce concepts (GROOVE+
      condition).

      The following hypotheses will be tested in the randomized controlled trial:

        1. Upon completion of the summer program, the enhanced summer program GROOVE+ relative to
           the conventional summer program will result in a) increased self-efficacy for adopting
           healthy behavior change; b) increased health knowledge; c) enhanced science
           self-concept; and e) more positive behavior change (e.g., improved nutrition, increased
           physical activity).

        2. At follow-up, the enhanced summer program relative to the conventional summer program
           will result in further and/or sustained improvements in positive behavior health
           behaviors and attitudes.

    <time_frame>Up to 4 assessments will occur over the 3 week program.</time_frame>
    <description>The Eating Behavior Scale consists of 28 items; all 20 items from Fahlman et al. (2013, American Journal of Health Education, vol. 43, 165-171) and 8 additional items from the 2009-2010 School Physical Activity and Nutrition Project (https://sph.uth.edu/content/uploads/2011/12/SPAN_2009-10_8th-11thStudentSurveyEnglish_FINAL.pdf). The measure asks participants to indicate how many times they consumed an item on the day before (e.g., fruits, vegetables, candy, etc). A subsample of students will complete up to three 24-hour dietary recalls to examine the validity of the self-report items in the study's participants.</description>
