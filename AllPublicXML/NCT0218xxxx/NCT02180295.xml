    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the consistency of 3 lots of inactivated VZV vaccine for safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity in healthy adults. The primary hypothesis of the study is
      that the 3 lots of inactivated vaccine will demonstrate similar immunogenicity at 28 days
      after the fourth dose.
