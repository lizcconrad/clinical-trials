  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and anti-tumor effect of rociletinib with
      erlotinib in patients whose tumors have specific EGFR mutations and who have not previously
      received any treatment for advanced/metastatic EGFR mutated NSCLC. This study is a
      'Randomized' Study. This means that upon entering the study, patients will be randomly
      assigned to be dosed with either rociletinib twice a day or erlotinib once a day. Patients
      will continue to take either rociletinib or erlotinib until it is no longer beneficial.

      This is a randomized, Phase 2/3 study of rociletinib versus erlotinib as a first-line
      treatment for patients with EGFR-mutant advanced/metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have
      EGFR-activating mutations. The study will consist of Phase 2 and Phase 3 parts which will use
      the same enrollment criteria and treatment assignment principles. Patients will be randomized
      1:1 to erlotinib or rociletinib. The Phase 2 part is an open-label study. In the Phase 3
      part, the sponsor will be blinded to the efficacy and safety results. The study will consist
      of a screening phase to establish study eligibility (including tumor genotype) and document
      baseline measurements, a treatment phase, in which patients will receive either rociletinib
      BID or erlotinib QD to ascertain safety and efficacy until protocol-defined disease
      progression, and a follow-up phase, to monitor survival status and subsequent NCSLC cancer
      therapy. In the Phase 2 part only, patients initially randomized to erlotinib may be eligible
      to participate in an optional crossover phase to receive rociletinib if they demonstrate the
      T790M resistance mutation after radiographic progression on erlotinib treatment among other
      eligibility requirements. Patients eligible for this study must have EGFR-mutated NSCLC who
      have not been treated with an EGFR-directed therapy.Treatment with rociletinib or erlotinib
      is continuous. Each 28 day period of treatment will represent one cycle, with dosing
      initiated on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1 D1).
