  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that 5-HTP stimulates cortisol levels in plasma and saliva. Similarly, it
      has been shown that intense exercise stimulates an increase in plasma and salivary cortisol
      levels. The purpose of this study is to examine the combined effects of 5-HTP + intense
      exercise on plasma and salivary cortisol levels.

    <description>Plasma cortisol will be assessed at baseline and 20 min post exercise and compared to baseline, and compared between treatments: 5-HTP vs placebo visit. The interventions are acute ( 1 dose, 1 day), for 5-HTP and for placebo, there is no follow up. The interventions are at least 1 week apart. For a given subject, the estimated time for study completion for the 2 treatments is 10 to 30 days</description>
