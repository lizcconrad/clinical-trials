    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the impact of perinatal exposure to anaesthesia and analgesia on
      neurocognitive outcomes in early childhood by analyzing neurocognitive data already obtained
      from the local prospective observational cohort study: Growing up in Singapore Towards
      Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO).

      We hypothesize that:

        1. Perinatal exposure to anaesthesia and analgesia is associated with poorer neurocognitive
           outcomes at 6, 18, 24 and 36 months.

        2. Maternal anxiety and depression during the antenatal and post-partum period is
           associated with poorer neurocognitive outcomes at 6, 18 24 and 36 months.

      Early exposure to general anesthesia is associated long-term neurocognitive and behavioral
      abnormalities. However the impact of obstetric and perinatal exposure to anaesthesia and
      analgesia on long term neurocognitive outcomes in the absence of concurrent events (e.g.
      fetal hypoxia) is unknown. We aim to determine the impact of perinatal exposure to
      anaesthesia and analgesia on neurocognitive outcomes in early childhood by analyzing
      information already obtained from the local prospective observational cohort study: Growing
      up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO). GUSTO is a large prospective cohort trial
      currently conducted in Singapore examining maternal and neonatal outcomes including
      metabolic, psychological and developmental outcomes.

      Information on infants' neurocognitive outcomes up to 24 months old are already available and
      we will correlate these outcomes to

        1. The infants' perinatal exposure to anaesthesia and analgesia, as obtained from hospital
           records, and

        2. Maternal anxiety and depression, as observed from analysis of questionnaires already
           available from GUSTO.

      We hypothesize that:

        1. Perinatal exposure to anaesthesia and analgesia is associated with poorer neurocognitive
           outcomes at 6, 18, 24 and 36 months.

        2. Maternal anxiety and depression during the antenatal and post-partum period is
           associated with poorer neurocognitive outcomes at 6, 18 24 and 36 months.

    <description>This study involves retrospective analysis of data from an existing cohort of 600 infants who were enrolled in the neurocognitve arm of the GUSTO study (Growing up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes). GUSTO is a prospective observational cohort study done in Singapore, where subjects were followed up from in-utero up to 36 months of age and beyond. The infants have already undergone a rigorous battery of neurocognitive tests at 6, 18, 24 and 36 months of age and their detailed demographic and medical information are available.</description>
