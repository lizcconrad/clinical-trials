    <textblock>
      The treatment of high grade Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) 2, 3 is defined
      according to the colposcopic evaluation of the patient. In case colposcopy findings are
      satisfactory (visible squamocolumnar junction), both ablative and excisional methods are
      adequate. In the middle of the 20th century, lateral hemostatic sutures were added to the
      cold knife conization surgical technique to reduce blood loss. Some authors recommend that
      these branches should be ligated, but it remains unclear whether these sutures are actually
      effective in reducing bleeding.This study compared blood loss during cold knife conization of
      the cervix with and without lateral hemostatic sutures.

      This is a study that will evaluate two groups of patients undergoing cold-knife conization
      for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia high grade where 50% will undergo hemostatic sutures
      in the lateral cervical and 50% of patients will not be subjected to these sutures. The main
      objective of the study is to evaluate the amount of intraoperative bleeding.
