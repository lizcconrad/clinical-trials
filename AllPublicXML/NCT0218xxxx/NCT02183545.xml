        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Any finding in the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate or
             ECG(electrocardiogram)) deviating from normal and judged clinically relevant by the
             investigator. Pulse rate outside the range of 50-90 beat per minute or blood pressure
             outside the ranges of 90-140 for systolic and 50-90 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure
             if confirmed by repeat measurement.

          2. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          3. Serum creatinine laboratory value outside the normal range

          4. Glomerular Filtration Rate according to CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
             Collaboration) Formula &lt; 60 ml/ min

             medication or its excipients)

         12. Intake of drugs with a long half-life (greater than 24 hours) within 30 days or less
             than 10 half-lives of the respective drug prior to study drug administration

         14. Use of drugs that might reasonably influence the results of the trial (including renal
             function measurements) or that might prolong the QT/QTc interval within 14 days prior
             to study drug administration

         15. Participation in another trial with investigational drug administration within 60 days
             prior to administration of trial medication

         16. Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes/day)

         17. Inability to refrain from smoking on specified trial days
