  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current literature in social epidemiology and public health suggests that low financial
      savings has an unsurprising negative relationship with subjective well-being, and increases
      the odds of making visits to a healthcare provider, receiving a chronic disease diagnosis,
      and experiencing medical disability. Earn.org is a community-based non-profit based in San
      Francisco with a mission to help low-income workers build lifelong savings habits and
      financial capability. The organization is one of the largest providers of &quot;goal-based savings
      accounts&quot; or &quot;matched savings accounts&quot; in the US. The investigators propose to conduct a
      randomized controlled trial to determine the health effects of Earn's savings program.
      Through this trial, the investigators will test three principal hypotheses: (1) Participants
      in the Earn account, as compared to a control group, are hypothesized to demonstrate improved
      scores on mental health scales assessing depression and anxiety.

      (2) Participants in the Earn account, as compared to a control group, are hypothesized to
      experience lower odds of harmful behaviors associated with stress, specifically tobacco and
      alcohol abuse. The investigators hypothesize that the effect on behaviors will be of smaller
      effect size, and more delayed, than the effect on mental health outcomes, judging from
      similar effects observed in the micro-credit literature.

      (3) The mediating variables between Earn account participation and beneficial health outcomes
      will include increased optimism and internal locus of control.

      The investigators plan to conduct an RCT comparing participants in the new EARN program
      against wait-listed control subjects. The program provides low-wage workers with incentives
      and rewards for savings. The program involves a web-based platform that permits eligible
      savers to create a centralized savings account, which is a secure online account without
      fees. The account offers eligible savers small monetary rewards for dollars saved each month.
      The investigators plan to conduct a baseline online month 0 survey and a follow-up 6 month
      and 12 month online survey among participants and wait-listed nonparticipants, with telephone
      follow-up to maximize 6- and 12-month survey completion. The surveys consist of
      previously-validated instruments to assess key health behaviors self-reported well-being, and
      require approximately 20 minutes each. The surveys includes the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor
      Surveillance System scales for assessing demographics and income, overall self-rated health,
      tobacco and alcohol use, depression and anxiety symptoms, and optimism and locus of control.
      Participants will receive prorated a gift card for each survey, to compensate participants
      for their time while avoiding a direct income effect of a cash incentive for participation.
