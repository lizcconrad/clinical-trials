      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR408701 administered as monotherapy,
           once every 2 weeks (with and without a loading dose at Cycle 1) to patients with
           advanced solid tumors (Escalation Phase).

        -  To assess efficacy according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST
           1.1) (Expansion Phase) when SAR408701 is administered once every 2 weeks with or without
           a loading dose at Cycle 1.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To characterize the overall safety profile of SAR408701.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR408701 and of its potential
           circulating derivatives.

        -  To identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SAR408701.

        -  To assess the potential immunogenicity of SAR408701.

      The study duration for an individual patient will start from the signature of the informed
      consent, will include a period to assess eligibility (screening period) of up to
      approximately 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment period and an end-of-treatment visit around 30
      days following the last administration of study drug, and at least one follow-up visit after
      the end-of-treatment visit. Additional follow-up visits may be required until resolution or
      stabilization of adverse events (at least 30 days). Treatment may continue until precluded by
      toxicity, progression, or upon patient's request. If the patient stops study treatment for
      reason other than disease progression, follow-up visit will be performed every 3 months until
      disease progression or initiation of another anti-tumor treatment or death, whichever comes
      first.
