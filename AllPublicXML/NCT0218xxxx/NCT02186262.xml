  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Grading of gliomas is of significant clinical importance since the prognosis as well as the
      treatment of choice are distinct in low-grade and high-grade gliomas. With standard MRI
      modalities, however, a reliable distinction is often impossible. Moreover, the gold standard
      for glioma grading by histopathology may also have limitations due to unrepresentative tumor
      samples. Therefore, more advanced MRI techniques are urgently needed that would have higher
      sensitivity and specificity in the definition of tumor type, grade and extent.

      Assessment of radiologic response for high-grade gliomas utilizes the updated RANO criteria
      12 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy. However, there is an urgent need to identify
      nonresponding patients earlier, preferentially midtreatment in order to consider alternative
      treatment strategies. Imaging biomarkers, such as diffusion weighted MR imaging (DWI), have
      provided promising results in assessing early treatment response. Furthermore, a serum
      biomarker with diagnostic value could improve tumor follow-up and clinical management of
      gliomas.

      The aim of our study is to develop novel imaging protocols suitable for the magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) of glioma using advanced MRI techniques such as rotating frame
      imaging, novel DWI acquisition and post-processing methods We also study the correlation
      between advanced MRI parameters and histopathology of the tumor specimen. In addition, early
      treatment response is assessed with advanced MRI parameters at 3 week and 10 week after
      initiation of radiotherapy. Finally, our objective is to study the association between serum
      biomarkers and corresponding MRI with potential tumor progression.
