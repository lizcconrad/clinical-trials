  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our aim was to assess the effects of a hypocaloric diet, including diet fruit jelly with
      microencapsulated fish oil or conjugated linoleic acid or placebo, on anthropometry, body
      composition, insulin resistance and lipid profile in women with metabolic syndrome and
      genotype Pro12Pro in the PPAR gamma 2 gene.
