  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase I/Phase II clinical trial, 7 eligible patients with OA of the knee will receive
      Ampion™ 4 mL administered as three IA injections, 2 weeks apart. In the absence of serious
      drug-related AEs of unanticipated drug-related AEs, enrollment will be initiated in Phase II
      of the study.

      In Phase II, a total of 30 eligible patients with OA knee pain will be randomized 1:1 to
      receive either the active drug (Ampion™ 4 mL) or placebo as three IA injections, 2 weeks
      apart.

    <textblock>
      In Phase I of this study, 7 eligible patients with OA knee pain will be enrolled and treated
      with 3 IA injections of active drug (Ampion™ 4 mL) at Baseline (Day 0) and Weeks 2 and 4 to
      the knee. The Medical Monitor will conduct a safety evaluation after all 7 treated patients
      complete the Week 4 follow-up evaluation. Enrollment will be initiated in Phase II if no
      serious drug-related adverse events or unanticipated drug-related adverse events are
      observed. Pending safety review, these patients will continue to Week 52.

      In Phase II, 30 eligible patients with OA knee pain will be enrolled in the randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind phase of the study. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to
      receive three (3) IA injections of either the active drug (Ampion™ 4 mL) or placebo at
      Baseline (Day 0) and Weeks 2 and 4 to the knee.

      The clinical effects of treatment on OA pain will be evaluated for all patients during
      in-clinic visits at Screening, Baseline (Day 0) and Weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, 20, 24 and 52
      using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC®) osteoarthritis
      Index 3.1, and the Patient's Global Assessment of disease severity (PGA).
