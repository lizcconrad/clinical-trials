  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LY2944876 is an investigative drug for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Part A of
      the study will assess the safety and tolerability of single doses of LY2944876 in Japanese
      participants. Participation is expected to last up to about 7 weeks, not including screening.

      Part B of the study will investigate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of
      LY2944876 in non Japanese participants. Participation is expected to last up to about 8
      weeks, not including screening.

      All doses will be administered as injections into the fatty layer just beneath the skin.

      Screening is required within 28 days prior to the start of the study. All participants will
      attend a post study safety assessment approximately 6 weeks after their final dose.

             or an alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels greater
             than (&gt;) 2.5 times the ULN at screening and/or baseline

          -  Have used or intend to use medications that promote weight loss, within 3 months prior
