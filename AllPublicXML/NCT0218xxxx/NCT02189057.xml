  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this investigator-initiated trial is to evaluate the treatment outcome of
      depression utilizing platform algorithm products that can allow rapid identification of
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or pharmacodynamic (PD) genomic variation. This new technology may
      have the potential to optimize treatment selection by improving response, minimizing
      unfavorable adverse events / side effects and increasing treatment adherence.

      Treatment seeking depressed patients (SCID confirmed major depressive disorder or bipolar
      I/II disorder) to the Mayo Clinic Depression Center will be invited to participate in this
      study evaluating the Assurex GeneSight® platform; this new technology can rapidly assess PK
      and PD genetic variation that can potentially impact antidepressant, antipsychotic, and
      stimulant associated treatment outcomes for depression. This study will recruit treatment
      seeking patients with major depression with an index episode of moderate symptom severity
      that has been unresponsive or poorly tolerated to at least one prior antidepressant
      treatment. This will be an 8-week, double-blind trial where depressed patients are randomized
      to testing results of GeneSight® (tricolored clinical report) prior to treatment selection
      (n=138) vs. treatment as usual (tricolored dummy report) (n=138). All testing results will be
      made available after the 8-week trial.

    <measure>Change in depression as measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-C16)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-C16 is a 16-item scale that is clinician-rated; it is designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. The QIDS-C16 total score ranges from 0-27. Scores ranging from 0 to 10 correspond with no to mild depression, while scores &gt;/= 11 correspond to moderate to severe depression. A negative change indicates improvement in the subject's depression, and a positive change indicates a worsening of the subject's depression.</description>

    <measure>Number of subjects with improvement of depressive symptoms as shown by score of &quot;much&quot; or &quot;very much improved&quot; on Clinical Global Impression - Improvement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale (CGI-I) is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. and rated as: 1. Very much improved, 2. Much improved, 3. Minimally improved, 4. No change, 5. Minimally worse, 6. Much worse, 7. Very much worse</description>

    <measure>Improvement of depressive symptoms as shown by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HAMD-17 is a 17-item scale that evaluates depressed mood, vegetative and cognitive symptoms of depression, and co-morbid anxiety symptoms. The 17 items are rated on either a 5-point (0-4) or a 3-point (0-2) scale. In general, the 5 point scale items use a rating of 0=absent; 1=doubtful to mild; 2=mild to moderate; 3=moderate to severe; 4=very severe. The 3-point scale items use a rating of 0=absent; 1=probable or mild; 2=definite. The total HAMD-17 score ranges from 0 (not ill) to 52 (severely ill). A negative change indicates improvement in the subject's depression/anxiety symptoms, and a positive change indicates a worsening of the subject's depression/anxiety symptoms.</description>
