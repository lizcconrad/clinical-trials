  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intravenously (administration of a
      fluid into the vein) administered golimumab 2 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) in participants
      with active ankylosing spondylitis (chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that
      involves the sacroiliac joints, and often the axial skeleton, entheses, and peripheral
      joints).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is
      compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect) study of
      golimumab compared with placebo in participants with active ankylosing spondylitis. The study
      comprises of 4 phases: Screening phase (up to 6 weeks), Double-blind placebo-controlled phase
      (Week 0 to Week 16), Active treatment phase (Week 16 to Week 52), and Safety follow-up phase
      (8 weeks from last study drug administration). Total duration of the study will be 60 weeks
      per participant. Eligible Participants will be randomly assigned to either Treatment group 1:
      Placebo or Treatment group 2: Golimumab. Participants randomized to Placebo group, will
      receive intravenous infusions of placebo at Weeks 0, 4 and 12. At Week 16, all participants
      receiving placebo will begin receiving intravenous infusions of golimumab (2 mg/kg) at Weeks
      16, 20 and thereafter every 8 weeks up to Week 52. Participants randomized to Golimumab
      group, will receive intravenous infusions of golimumab 2 mg/kg at Weeks 0, 4 and thereafter
      every 8 weeks up to Week 52. At Week 16, participants randomized to golimumab group will
      receive a placebo infusion to maintain the blind. The efficacy will be assessed primarily by
      measuring percentage of participants who achieve a 20 percent improvement from baseline in
      the assessment in ankylosing spondylitis (ASAS) at Week 16. Participant's safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcome Study health measure SF-36 questionnaire is a well-validated and widely used quality-of-life instrument. It is a self-administered survey that consists of 8 multi-item scales: The 4 subscales of the SF-36 comprises the PCS score (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health) and the 4 subscales of the SF-36 comprises the MCS score (vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health). PCS and MCS are scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health (worst value is 0 and best value is 100), which are scored using a norm-based system where linear transformations are performed to transform scores to a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study health measure SF-36 questionnaire is a well-validated and widely used quality-of-life instrument. It is a self-administered survey that consists of 8 multi-item scales: The 4 subscales of the SF-36 comprises the PCS score (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health) and the 4 subscales of the SF-36 comprises the MCS score (vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health). PCS and MCS are scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health (worst value is 0 and best value is 100), which are scored using a norm-based system where linear transformations are performed to transform scores to a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10.</description>

PCS and MCS are scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health (worst value is 0 and best value is 100), which are scored using a norm-based system where linear transformations are performed to transform scores to a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI) at Week 16</title>
        <description>BASMI is an objective measure of spinal mobility. The BASMI score is composed of 5 measures: tragus to wall distance, lumbar flexion, cervical rotation, lumbar side flexion, and intermalleolar distance. Each measure was scored 0-2 (0=normal mobility/mild disease involvement, 1=moderate disease involvement, 2=severe disease involvement) to give a final total BASMI score ranging from 0 to 10. The higher the BASMI score, the more severe was the participant's limitation of movement due to their AS.</description>
