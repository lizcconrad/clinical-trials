  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project hypothesizes that the brain's opioid system determines rejection sensitivity, a
      personality trait that is a vulnerability factor and feature of several psychiatric
      disorders. This project will use positron emission tomography to measure the brain's opioid
      response to social rejection and acceptance in a nonclinical population with varying levels
      of rejection sensitivity. The results will provide the first major step towards understanding
      a neurotransmitter mechanism for rejection sensitivity, allowing for further investigation
      into predicting and treating its associated disorders.

    <measure>Mu-opioid binding potential</measure>
    <time_frame>within 30 days of informed consent</time_frame>
    <description>This study will measure levels of radiotracer (carbon-11-labeled carfentanil) binding to the mu-opioid receptor in the brain using positron-emission tomography (PET). Primary regions of interest include: the amygdala, anterior insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, nucleus accumbens, and thalamus. All structures will be examined bilaterally. Differences in binding potential (Bmax/Kd) for the radiotracer will be compared across different experimental conditions (e.g., neutral, positive, negative social feedback).</description>

    <measure>fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response</measure>
    <time_frame>within 30 days of informed consent</time_frame>
    <description>This study will measure brain activation in response to social feedback and monetary reward. Primary regions of interest include: the amygdala, anterior insular cortex, and the nucleus accumbens. All structures will be examined bilaterally. Arbitrary units for fMRI BOLD are used to compare activation during one condition (e.g., neutral, baseline) vs. another condition (e.g., positive social feedback, monetary reward).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma cortisol</measure>
    <time_frame>within 30 days of informed consent</time_frame>
    <description>This study will collect blood every 10 minutes during PET to measure changes in levels of plasma cortisol. Units are ug/dL.</description>
