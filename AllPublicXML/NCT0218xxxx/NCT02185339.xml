  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the current study is to compare intraoperative respiratory mechanics
      in patients receiving laparoscopic renal surgery under deep neuromuscular blockade (dNMB) and
      under moderate neuromuscular blockade (mNMB). In addition, we will compare intraoperative
      hemodynamics and postoperative pulmonary function between the two groups.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Thoracopulmonary Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Was measured with a patient spirometry monitor through a flow sensor.
Measurements were obtained at the following four time points: (1) 15 min after a patient positioning in lateral decubitus before inducing the pneumoperitoneum (T Lateral); (2) 1 h after pneumoperitoneum induction with the patient in the lateral decubitus position (T Lat+PP1h); (3) 2 h after pneumoperitoneum induction with the patient in the lateral decubitus position (T Lat+PP2h); and (4) at the end of surgery, 15 min after abdominal deflation in the lateral decubitus position (T EndPP).</description>

  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative pain was measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Participants were asked to report their level of pain by pointing to a horizontal line, 10 cm in length. The scale (0-10 scores) was anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; (score of 10).
Measurements were made at postoperative (PO) 1h, PO 2h, PO 6h, PO 24h, and PO 48h.</description>

    <description>For patients randomized to the dNMB group, intravenous infusion of 0.6 mg/kg/h rocuronium will be administered 10 minutes after the administration of intubation dose or after the return of post-tetanic count (PTC), whichever comes first. Then, the infusion rate will be titrated according to PTC (target to keep PTC between 1 to 2). Infusion rate will be increased or be reduced at a rate of 0.1 mg/kg/h if PTC is &gt; or &lt; than 1-2 to maintain deep muscle relaxation throughout the surgery. Neuromuscular monitoring will be carried out by monitoring the adductor pollicis muscle in response to ulnar nerve stimulation. A dose of sugammadex (4 mg/kg) will be administered at the end of the surgery. Patients will be extubated when the train of four ratio is ≥0.9.</description>

Measurements were obtained at the following four time points: (1) 15 min after a patient positioning in lateral decubitus before inducing the pneumoperitoneum (T Lateral); (2) 1 h after pneumoperitoneum induction with the patient in the lateral decubitus position (T Lat+PP1h); (3) 2 h after pneumoperitoneum induction with the patient in the lateral decubitus position (T Lat+PP2h); and (4) at the end of surgery, 15 min after abdominal deflation in the lateral decubitus position (T EndPP).</description>

            <description>For patients randomized to the dNMB group, intravenous infusion of 0.6 mg/kg/h rocuronium was administered 10 minutes after the administration of intubation dose or after the return of post-tetanic count (PTC), whichever came first. Then, the infusion rate was titrated according to PTC (target to keep PTC between 1 and 2). Infusion rate was increased or be reduced at a rate of 0.1 mg/kg/h if PTC is &gt; or &lt; than 1-2 to maintain deep muscle relaxation throughout the surgery. Neuromuscular monitoring was carried out by monitoring the adductor pollicis muscle in response to ulnar nerve stimulation. A dose of sugammadex (4 mg/kg) was administered at the end of the surgery. Patients were extubated when the train of four ratio was ≥0.9.</description>
