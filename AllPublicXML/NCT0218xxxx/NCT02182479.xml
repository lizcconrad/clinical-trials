  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to demonstrate that at least one of the two doses of Berodual® (50 µg fenoterol
      hydrobromide/20 µg ipratropium bromide and 25 µg fenoterol hydrobromide/10 µg ipratropium
      bromide, 1 puff q.i.d.) administered via Respimat® gives a bronchodilator response which is
      not inferior to that obtained from one dose of Berodual® (50 µg fenoterol hydrobromide/21 µg
      ipratropium bromide, 2 puffs q.i.d.) administered via MDI and that the safety profile is at
      least as good in asthma patients treated for 12 weeks.

          -  Screening FEV1: 40 - 80 % of predicted normal. Predicted normal values will be based
             on the guidelines for standardised function testing of the European Community for Coal
             and Steel

          -  Airway obstruction reversibility: increase in FEV1 12% from baseline and ≥ 200 ml from
             baseline at 30 minutes after 2 puffs of Berodual® MDI

          -  Current non-smoker or ex-smoker (with a smoking history of ≤ 10 pack-years) with
             cessation of smoking ≥ 1 year prior to the screening visit

          -  Male or female patients

          -  Ability to be trained in proper use of MDI and RESPIMAT® devices

             investigator may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study
             or which may influence the results of the study or the ability of the patient to
             participate in and complete the study

          -  History of myocardial infarction within the last year

          -  Tuberculosis with indication for treatment

          -  Beta-blocker medication

          -  Patients who have taken an investigational drug one month or six half-lives (whichever
             is greater) prior to the screening visit

          -  History of drug abuse and/or alcoholism

          -  Pregnant or nursing women and women of childbearing potential or less than 2 years
             postmenopausal, who are not using medically approved means of contraception (oral
             contraceptives, intra-uterine devices or surgical Sterilisation)

          -  Previous participation in this study

          -  Patients who need more than 8 puffs of salbutamol (100 µg per puff) rescue medication
             on 3 or more consecutive days during the run-in period

          -  Severe bronchial asthma with frequent nocturnal asthma attacks or acute exacerbations
             induced by recurrent bronchial infections several times per year

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs

          -  Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction

          -  Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma

          -  Patients who did not fill in at least 80% of the diary in the run-in period for both,
             medication taken and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) measurements are considered not
             compliant
