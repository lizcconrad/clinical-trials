  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of approximately 8 weeks of Vitamin D
      (VitD) and calcium supplementation, using daily versus weekly supplementation regimens, on
      female reproductive tract immunity.

    <textblock>
      This outpatient open label study will assess the impact of 8 weeks of daily versus weekly
      VitD and calcium supplementation on measures of cervicovaginal (CV) innate immune function,
      including antimicrobial and proinflammatory gene expression, Toll-like receptor
      (TLR)-mediated responses, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of immune cell markers, and
      microbiota in premenopausal women with insufficient serum VitD levels at baseline.

      Women will be seen in 3 study visits and will be contacted by one scheduled follow-up
      telephone call after their final study visit. Volunteers will be consented at Visit 1 and
      undergo procedures to confirm they are eligible to continue in the study.

      Once it has been confirmed that the participant meets all of the inclusion criteria and none
      of the exclusion criteria, baseline blood and genital samples will be taken in the luteal
      phase at Visit 2. The participant will then be given their first dose of VitD 4000 IU daily
      or 50,000 IU weekly in capsule form, which they will then administer for 8 weeks.
      Participants will also administer 1000 mg of calcium daily. Participants will return upon
      completion of supplementation for repeat of blood and genital samples (Visit 3).
