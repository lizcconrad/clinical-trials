  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is look at the safety of:

        -  Taking a specific combination of immunosuppressant drugs after liver transplantation

        -  Receiving one of three different doses of donor-alloantigen-reactive regulatory T cells
           (darTregs) while taking this specific combination of drugs
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After liver transplantation, immunosuppressants must be taken every day to prevent the body
      from injuring the transplanted liver by a process called rejection. People who take these
      drugs may experience side effects.

      Studies show that some of body's cells, called T regulatory cells (Tregs), may play a part in
      accepting the transplanted liver. The investigators are learning about whether scientists can
      take Tregs from the blood of a liver transplant recipient and teach them to protect the
      transplanted liver from rejection. In the laboratory, the recipient Tregs are exposed to
      cells from the liver donor. Research data suggests that giving these &quot;donor reactive&quot; Tregs
      back to the transplant recipient might allow a liver transplant recipient to take lower doses
      of immunosuppressants, or perhaps to stop them altogether, without rejecting the liver.
