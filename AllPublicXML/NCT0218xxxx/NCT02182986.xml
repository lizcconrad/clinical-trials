  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Solid organ transplantation is an important therapeutic option for children with a variety of
      end stage diseases. However, the same immunosuppressive medications that are required to
      prevent the child's immune system from attacking and rejecting the transplanted organ can
      predispose these individuals to developing a very serious cancer that is linked to
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is the most common
      malignancy in children after transplant. Diagnosis and effective treatment of the
      EBV-associated cancer is hampered by our inability to determine which children are at risk of
      developing these cancers and to detect the cancer at an early stage. In this study, we plan
      to test new &quot;biomarkers&quot; in the blood of children that will tell us very early on if the
      child is at risk of developing the EBV-associated cancer or if the cancer is present. These
      studies provide new opportunities for detection, diagnosis, and treatment of children with
      EBV-associated, post-transplant cancer.
