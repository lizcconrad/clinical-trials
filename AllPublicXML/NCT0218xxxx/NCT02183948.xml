      The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) has been shown to modulate several aspects of human social
      cognition. Although the exact mechanisms behind these effects remain unclear, recent research
      suggests that OXT modulates the perception of cues that are important for interpersonal
      processing, particularly emotional facial expressions. Using a backward masking procedure and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the modulatory effects of intranasal
      OXT on the processing of sub-liminally presented emotional faces. In a double-blind
      placebo-controlled between-subject pharmaco-fMRI experiment healthy volunteers received
      either 24IU of intranasal oxytocin or placebo 45mins before they were presented emotional
      (happy, angry, fearful, sad, disgusting) faces and mirror-reversed neutral faces masked by
      neutral faces of the same individual. To ensure attentional processing of the faces subjects
      were required to perform a simple gender decision task in the scanner and a recognition
      memory task afterwards. All subjects were additionally assessed for their state and trait
      anxiety and depression as well as empathy. For the analysis, we will use matlab, SPM and SPSS
      to conduct structural ROI analysis and two Sample t test.
