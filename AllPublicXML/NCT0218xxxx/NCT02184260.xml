        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age over 18 years

          -  Hemispherical cerebral infarction with moderate (SSS = 30-44 points) or severe (SSS &lt;
             30 points) deficit at the time of inclusion. However, only patients with a score
             between 15 and 44 points on the SSS scale will be included

          -  Tympanic temperature between 37 and 38 degrees Celsius. The relationship between
             tympanic and body temperature is as follows: tympanic temperature = body temperature +
             0.3 degrees Celsius

          -  Onset of cerebral infarction symptoms within the last 24 hours. When the time of onset
             of symptoms is unknown (e.g. ictus occurred while sleeping) the last time when the
             patient was asymptomatic will be considered as time of onset

          -  Normal cerebral CT scan or with signs of cerebral infarction

          -  Patient's written or orally witnessed informed consent in accordance with local
             legislation, guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and International Conference
             on Harmonization (ICH)-GCP

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia or aplastic blood
             diseases of any etiology. Known hypersensitivity to salicylates, pyrazolones and other
             nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAID-induced bronchial asthma

          -  Patients with a history indicating a life expectancy less than 30 days or patients
             whom the investigator thinks that it will not be possible to follow for entire 30 days

          -  Non-cooperative

          -  Patients with neurological sequelae of a previous stroke

          -  Cerebral hemorrhage

          -  Pregnancy, lactation

          -  Participation in another clinical trial

          -  Intake of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) &gt; 300 mg per day, paracetamol or NSAIDs during
             the 24 hours prior to administration of the study medication

          -  Seizures at the start of the stroke
