        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Condition: Either of the following criteria is satisfied in laboratory tests:

               -  Presence of a renal parenchymal disorder such as chronic glomerulonephritis is
                  confirmed (serum creatinine &lt; 3.0 mg/dL)

               -  Presence of a renal function disorder (serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL to &lt; 3.0
                  mg/dL)

          -  Age: ≥ 20 years

          -  Sex: Either male or female

          -  Patient status: Either outpatients or inpatients. However, the patient status should
             remain unchanged throughout the study period

          -  Blood pressure (BP):

               -  [Outpatients] The last 2 measurements of sitting BP out of at least 3 taken
                  during the observation period (2 - 4 weeks) should be stable and a mean of the
                  two measurements should be ≥160 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and ≥95 mmHg for
                  diastolic BP (DBP)

               -  [Inpatients] The last 2 measurements of supine BP taken during the observation
                  period (1 week) should be stable and a mean of the 2 measurements should be ≥ 150
                  mmHg for SBP and ≥ 90 mmHg for DBP

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Renovascular hypertension

          -  Undergoing haemodialysis

          -  Severe hypertension (Diastolic BP ≥ 120 mmHg)

          -  Severe heart failure, angina pectoris, or history of myocardial infarction

          -  Atrioventricular conduction disturbance (degree II to III), atrial fibrillation, or
             serious arrhythmia

          -  Symptoms of cerebrovascular disorder

          -  Serious hepatic dysfunction

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes

          -  Peptic ulcer

          -  History of hypersensitivity to drugs

          -  Hyperkalaemia

          -  Undergoing treatment with a digitalis preparation

          -  Pregnant, breast feeding, possibly pregnant or planning to become pregnant during this
             study

          -  Otherwise judged ineligible by the investigator
