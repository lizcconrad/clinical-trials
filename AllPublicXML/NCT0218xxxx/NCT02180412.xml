  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide high quality evidence for the effectiveness and safety of hemin
      (PanhematinTM , Recordati) for treatment of acute attacks of porphyria. These types of
      studies have not been done before with either PanhematinTM or the hemin preparation available
      in Europe (NormosangTM, Orphan Europe).

      There are two treatment groups in this study. One group will be treated with PanhematinTM
      plus glucose, and the other group will be treated with glucose plus an inactive salt solution
      (called a &quot;placebo&quot;). To avoid prejudice, the treatment given to each participant will be
      blinded (meaning the participants and most of the hospital staff will not know which
      treatment the participant will receive) and randomized (meaning participants will have an
      equal chance of receiving either treatment, like the flip of a coin). A placebo-controlled,
      randomized study is the standard method used to prove treatments are effective and safe.
      PanhematinTM and glucose will be given in the same manner as is usual for treating an attack
      of porphyria. For participants who are chosen to receive the placebo, their treatment will be
      switched to real PanhematinTM at any time if their symptoms do not improve. This is called
      &quot;rescue&quot; treatment, and assures that they study is safe and patients who need hemin will
      receive it. Treatment with hemin will be for 4 days, or longer if needed. Since the study
      treatment is started as soon as possible after symptoms appear, there will be very little
      delay in providing hemin to those who need it. Funding Source - Office of Orphan Products

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female aged 18 years

          -  Willing to provide written informed consent

          -  Acute symptoms (7 days duration or less to time of enrollment) such as abdominal, back
             and/or limb pain, diagnosed by the investigator as caused by porphyria after initial
             evaluation has excluded other causes.

          -  Diagnosis of acute porphyria documented by a substantial increase in urinary or serum
             porphobilinogen (PBG).

          -  Type of acute porphyria confirmed by additional testing (in addition to increased
             PBG), which may be completed before or after treatment begins using pretreatment
             samples:

          -  For acute intermittent porphyria (AIP): Normal or only slight increases in plasma and
             fecal porphyrins. Most (~90 percent) will have deficient activity of erythrocyte
             porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), and almost all (&gt;95 percent) will have a
             demonstrable disease-causing PBGD mutation.

          -  For hereditary coproporphyria (HCP): Substantial increases in fecal porphyrins (almost
             entirely coproporphyrin III). In the absence of skin photosensitivity, most will have
             normal or only slight increases in plasma porphyrins. Almost all (&gt;95 percent) will
             have a demonstrable disease-causing coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPO) mutation.

          -  For variegate porphyria (VP): Substantial increases in fecal porphyrins (mostly
             coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin), increased plasma total porphyrins and a
             fluorescence emission maximum of diluted plasma at neutral pH near 626 nm. Almost all
             (~95 percent) will have a demonstrable disease-causing protoporphyrinogen oxidase
             (PPO) mutation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptoms such as abdominal, back or limb pain are explained by another condition, as
             judged by the investigator

          -  Therapy with hemin within 7 days prior to enrollment in this study

          -  Known or suspected allergy to Panhematinâ„¢ or related products

          -  Preexisting coagulation defect or concurrent treatment with an anticoagulant

          -  Previously documented renal impairment defined as a serum creatinine above 1.7 mg/dL
             or 150 mmol/L.

          -  A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, which might increase the risk of glucose infusion.

          -  Heart failure, significant chronic anemia or any disease or condition that the
             investigator judges would lead to an unacceptable risk to the patient or interfere
             with the successful collection of date for the trial

          -  Previous randomization in this trial
