  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although smoking prevalence is decreasing in Hong Kong, there are still 645,000 daily smokers
      10.7% ( Thematic Household Survey 2012) and half will be killed by smoking (Lam ,2012) which
      accounts for over 7,000 deaths per year (Lam, Ho, Hedley, Mak, &amp; Peto, 2001). Smoking also
      accounts for a large amount of medical cost, long-term care and productivity loss of US$688
      million (0.6% Hong Kong GDP) (McGhee et al., 2006) (Census &amp; Statistics Department (Hong Kong
      Special Administrative Region government), 2001). Smoking is a highly addictive behavior and
      it is difficult for smokers with strong nicotine dependence to quit without assistance. On
      the other hand, reaching and helping the many smokers who have no intention to quit is a
      challenge, because they are unlikely to seek professional help from smoking cessation
      services. The Quit and Win programme provides an opportunity to reach and encourage a large
      group of smokers to make quit attempt and maintain abstinence. The Quit and Win model posits
      that smokers participating in the contest will have higher motivation to quit with incentives
      and better social support (Cahill &amp; Petera, 2011). Studies have found that such quitting
      contests or incentive programs appeared to reach a large number of smokers and demonstrated a
      significantly higher quit rate for the quit and win group than for the control group (Cahill
      &amp; Rafael, 2008).

      The Quit to Win Contest in 2014 and the study's interventions using cut down to quit approach
      are theoretically based on the Health Action Process Approach ( HAPA) for the intervention
      group (Schwarzer, 2008). The HAPA suggests that one's intention of behavior change can be
      fostered by knowing that the new behavior has positive outcomes as opposed to the negative
      outcomes that accompany the current behavior; and planning (action planning and coping
      planning) which serves as an operative mediator between intentions and behavior. Using
      gradual cut down approach on smoking cessation will probably increase smoker's self-efficacy
      on smoking cessation as the process could be achieved at the smoker's own perceived pace
      without placing too much pressure on themselves but with greater control of self in the
      cessation process. This was supported by the evidence that smoking reduction approach led to
      a greater self-efficacy to resist smoking and increased subsequent quitting (Broms, Korhonen,
      &amp; Kaprio, 2008). Most importantly, reducing cigarette consumption will lower the nicotine
      dependence which is associated with later abstinence (Hughes et al., 2004). On the other
      hand, quitting immediately will have a less sense of control and may be subjected to relapse
      thus lower the self-efficacy on quitting.

      Therefore, the present study will examine (1) effectiveness of the cut down to quit (CDTQ)
      and quit immediately (QI) approaches; (2) explore the use of Community-Based Participatory
      Research (CBPR) model to build capacity and to engage community partners in taking on this
      important public health issue for sustainability in the community. In addition, process
      evaluation will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the recruitment activity and how
      it is linked with the overall program outcomes.

    <description>For those subjects who claim that they cannot quit smoking ≤7 days, they will receive a leaflet (i.e. include a roadmap of smoking reduction strategy) plus a brief intervention using the AWARD model: (a) Ask about smoking history, (b) Warn about the high risk, (c) Advise to quit as quitting can greatly reduce risks, and participants will be advised to cut down cigarette consumption at their own pace, but the process should not exceed 3 months. (d) Refer smokers to a smoking cessation clinic, and (e) Do it again: repeat the intervention and encourage smokers who fail to quit or relapse to reduce again during each telephone follow-up.
For the subjects have intention to quit smoking ≤7 days, the investigator will follow-up them after a week. For those who report quitted, they will be followed up as other participants. However, if they report failed to quit, they will receive the same interventions and will be followed-up as other participants in the experimental group.</description>
