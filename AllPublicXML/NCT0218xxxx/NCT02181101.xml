      This is an open-label, multicenter, 2x2 factorial design, randomized controlled, Phase III
      study comparing the disease free survival after randomisation in patients treated with 3
      cycles of Epirubicin-Fluorouracil-Cyclophosphamide(FEC)-chemotherapy, followed by 3 cycles of
      Docetaxel(Doc)-chemotherapy versus 3 cycles of Epirubicin-Fluorouracil-Cyclophosphamide(FEC),
      followed by 3 cycles of Gemcitabine-Docetaxel(DocGemzar)-chemotherapy, and to compare the
      disease free survival after randomisation in patients treated with 2 years of Zoledronate
      versus 5 years of Zoledronate in patients with early primary breast cancer. Patients will be
      required to have histopathological proof of axillary lymph node metastases (pN1-3) or high
      risk node negative, defined as: 'pT≥2 or histopathological grade 3, or age ≤ 35 or negative
      hormone receptor', but are not allowed to have evidence of distant disease. Patients will
      have to be entered into the study no later than 6 weeks after complete resection of the
      primary tumor. No other antineoplastic treatment other than surgical treatment, the defined
      cytotoxic and endocrine treatment and radiotherapy will be allowed prior to study entry and
      during the course of the study.

      After surgery, leading to R0 resection of the invasive and intraductal components of the
      primary tumor, patients will be randomized to one of the following treatments:

      First randomization

      AA: 3 cycles of 5-Fluorouracil 500 mg/m² i.v. body surface area and Epirubicin 100 mg/m² i.v.
      and Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m² i.v., (FEC100), each administered on day 1, repeated on day
      22, subsequently followed by 3 cycles of Docetaxel 75 mg/m² body surface area i.v. (Doc), and
      Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m² i.v. (30 min infusion) (Gemzar), administered on day 1, followed by
      Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m² i.v. (30 min infusion) on day 8, repeated on day 22

      AB: 3 cycles of 5-Fluorouracil 500 mg/m² i.v. body surface area and Epirubicin 100 mg/m² i.v.
      and Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m² i.v., (FEC100), each administered on day 1, repeated on day
      22, subsequently followed by 3 cycles of Docetaxel 100 mg/m² body surface area i.v. (Doc),
      administered on day 1, repeated on day 22

      Second randomization B

      BA: Zoledronic acid 4 mg i.v., every 3 months for the duration of two years, subsequently
      followed by zoledronic acid 4 mg i.v., every 6 months for the duration of additional three
      years

      BB: Zoledronic acid 4 mg i.v., every 3 months for the duration of two years

      During the zoledronic acid treatment period, patients will receive 500 mg Calcium p.o. qid
      and 400 i.E. Vitamin D p.o. qid.

      Patients with positive hormone receptor status (≥ 10 % positively stained cells for estrogen
      and/or progesterone) of the primary tumor will receive Tamoxifen treatment 20 mg p.o. per day
      for 2 years, after the end of chemotherapy. Subsequent to chemotherapy, postmenopausal
      patients with positive hormone receptor status will be treated with Anastrozole (Arimidex®) 1
      mg p.o. for additional 3 years, premenopausal patients will continue Tamoxifen treatment for
      additional 3 years. In addition to tamoxifen, all patients with positive hormone receptor
      status of the primary tumor and under the age of 40 or restart of menstrual bleeding within 6
      months after the completion of cytostatic treatment or with premenopausal hormone levels as
      defined below will receive Goserelin (Zoladex®) 3.6 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks over a
      period of 2 years following chemotherapy. Premenopausal endocrine status will be assumed, if
      the following serum levels are met: Luteinizing hormone (LH) &lt; 20 mIE/ml, follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH) &lt; 20 mIE/ml and estradiol (E2) &gt; 20 pg/ml. Endocrine therapy will
      start after the end of chemotherapy.

      All patients with breast conserving therapy or more than 3 axillary lymph node metastases or
      in the following cases after mastectomy:

        -  T3/T4-carcinoma

        -  T2-carcinoma &gt; 3 cm

        -  multicentric tumor growth

        -  lymphangiosis carcinomatosa or vessel involvement

        -  involvement of the pectoralis fascia or a safety margin &lt; 5 mm.

      will receive adjuvant radiotherapy.
