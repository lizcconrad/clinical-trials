  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of combined administration of mosapride
      as modulator of gastrointestinal motility and DPP-4 inhibitor on secretion of gut hormone
      such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), and oral
      glucose tolerance. Additionally, change in lipid profile and insulin secretion will be also
      assessed.

      This is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. After screening and
      enrollment, participants will take 5 mg of linagliptin once a day for one week of run-in
      period (Day 1 to Day 7). Randomization will be done on Day 8 to assign the participants to
      either mosapride arm or placebo arm. If a subject is assigned to mosapride arm, mixed meal
      tolerance test (MMTT) will be performed after taking mosapride with linagliptin. If a subject
      is assigned to placebo arm, he/she will take placebo instead of mosapride before MMTT. On Day
      9, all subjects will be crossed over to the other arm and MMTT will proceed with medication
      depending on their arms. Gastric emptying time measurement with paracetamol will be done
      along with MMTT. Plasma incretin hormone levels in two arms will be compared.
