    <textblock>
      A phase 1 study of infusion of partially HLA matched unrelated donor blood or marrow cells
      (microtransplantation) following consolidation chemotherapy in patients with AML that are not
      suitable for allogenic stem cell transplantation.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and tolerability of co-administration of partially HLA antigen
      matched unrelated donor cryopreserved donor lymphocytes (microtransplantation) with
      chemotherapy for patients with high risk acute myeloid leukaemia ineligible or unsuitable for
      high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Newly diagnosed AML not considered suitable for allogenic stem cell transplant on the
             basis of age or co-morbidities

          2. Complete morphological remission following 1-2 cycles of induction chemotherapy
             consisting of an anthracycline/cytosine arabinoside combination

          3. Availability of cryopreserved donor stem cells or bone marrow with appropriate HLA
             matching

          4. Adequate hepatic and renal function

          5. Estimated life expectancy of at least 6 months

          6. Patient has given informed consent or in the event of a patient not able to give
             informed consent, consent has been given according to hospital procedures in force at
             the time of trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient not in morphological remission following 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy

          2. Use of fludarabine or other purine analogue during remission induction or use of any
             major immunosuppressive medication or any other immunomodulatory agent including
             thalidomide, lenalidomide, or azacitidine immediately prior to concurrent with
             administration of chemotherapy for AML or during or in the 3 months after
             administration of partially HLA matched 3rd party cells

          3. Absence of a cryopreserved donor stem cell or bone marrow product with appropriate
             matching

          4. Presence of significant hepatic, renal or other major organ dysfunction

          5. Uncontrolled infection or bleeding prior to commencement of consolidation chemotherapy

          6. Privately insured in or outpatient on the day the consent is signed and the days that
             cryopreserved partially HLA matched donor cells are infused
