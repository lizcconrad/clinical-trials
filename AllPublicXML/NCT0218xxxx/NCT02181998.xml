    <textblock>
      The primary objective of ASSENT 3 Plus (the same as for ASSENT 3) was to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of full dose tenecteplase combined with unfractionated heparin (UFH, group A)
      and full dose tenecteplase combined with enoxaparin (ENOX, group B). An additional objective
      in ASSENT 3 Plus was to describe the different time intervals in the prehospital phase.

             (SBP) 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt; 110 mmHg) on repeated
             measurements during current admission prior to randomisation

          -  Use of abciximab (ReoPro ®) or other glycoprotein-IIb/IIIa antagonists within the
             preceding seven days

          -  Major surgery, biopsy of a parenchymal organ, or significant trauma within two months

          -  Any minor head trauma and any other trauma occurring after onset of the current
             myocardial infarction (MI)
