      The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ACT-451840
      in healthy male subjects.Secondary objectives were : to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK)
      of ACT-451840; to investigate the effect of food on the PK of ACT-451840; to evaluate the
      urinary excretion of ACT-451840 and to investigate the antimalarial activity of ACT-451840.

    <measure>Dose proportionality of single doses of ACT-451840</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be taken immediately prior to dosing with ACT-451840 and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 hours after dosing.
Dose proportionality will be explored by the power model as described by Gough et al [1995]. The power model will be applied to the loge AUC0-∞ and Cmax data. A point estimate and 90% Confidence Interval (CI) will be produced for the population mean slope. Approximate dose proportionality will be concluded if the 90% CI for the slope is completely contained in the range (1+log(0.5))/log(r), 1+log(2)/log(r) where r = high dose/low dose.</description>
