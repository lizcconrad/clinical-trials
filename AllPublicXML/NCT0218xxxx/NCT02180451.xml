        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A confirmed clinical diagnosis of SMS with a prior positive genetic test result as
             indicated by a parent/guardian

          -  Informed consent from the patient or the legal guardian/assent provided by the
             individual with SMS, when possible

          -  Male or female between the ages of 6-50 years of age

          -  History of sleep disturbances

          -  Willing and able to comply with study requirements and restrictions

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Failure to confirm diagnosis of SMS by molecular cytogenetic methods and/or DNA-based
             mutation analysis of the RAI1 gene

          -  Totally blind with no light perception

          -  Institutionalized or living in an assisted living facility

          -  Unwilling or unable to follow medication restrictions (medications that affect sleep
             or melatonin secretion) or unwilling or unable to sufficiently wash-out from use of a
             restricted medication

          -  Any medical condition, as determined by the clinical investigator that would make it
             unsafe for blood draws (e.g., anemia, blood clotting disorders, anxiety, etc.)

          -  Any other sound medical reason as determined by the clinical investigator
