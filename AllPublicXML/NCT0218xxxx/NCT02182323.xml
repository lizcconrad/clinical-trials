  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics
      of BI 201335 NA following administration of single rising doses from 4 mg to 1200 mg. In
      addition, the food effect on the bioavailability of BI 201335 NA (480 mg) was investigated.
