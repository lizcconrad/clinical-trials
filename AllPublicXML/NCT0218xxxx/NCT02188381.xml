  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is the single most prevalent risk factor for heart diseases, heart failure,
      kidney failure and stroke. About 1 in 3 adults in the United States have hypertension.
      Approximately 28-30% of hypertensive patients suffer from resistant hypertension (RH).
      Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the hypertension. Additional data
      suggests the involvement of gut microbiota in host normal cardiovascular functions and
      pathophysiology. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that antibiotic treatment benefits
      patients with acute coronary syndromes and reduces the incidence of ischemic cardiovascular
      events. Even though these studies did not address effects of antibiotic treatment on the gut
      microbiota, it is possible that gut microbiota could affect neurologic inflammation. Finally,
      intestinal microbiota has recently been proposed to modulate blood pressure (BP) through
      production of short-chain fatty acids. In order to investigate this, the investigators
      hypothesize that gut microbiota is involved in the neuroinflammation-mediated initiation and
      establishment of RH, and targeting gut microbiota by minocycline would produce beneficial
      outcomes in RH.

      This is a prospective cohort design. The study will enroll 123 subjects: 25 normal controls,
      25 subjects with controlled hypertension, 25 subjects with resistent hypertension and 48
      subjects enrolled in NCT 02133872. Subjects will provide stool samples for analysis. Subjects
      will also provide a blood sample for inflammatory marker and stem cell analysis.

        This study will initially enroll 10 patients without hypertension as normal controls, and
        10 patients with controlled hypertension and 10 patients with resistant hypertension to
        characterize gut microbiota. In addition, all patients enrolled in IRB# 102-2013 will be
        approached for possible participation.
