  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in time for successful
      fiberoptic guided tracheal intubation through the i-gel or air-Q supraglottic airway.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized study is to evaluate the efficacy of the i-gel as a conduit for
      fiberoptic tracheal intubation when compared to the air-Q in children. Intubations will be
      performed by residents in training. The primary outcome is of time for successful tracheal
      intubation. The investigators hypothesize that residents will intubate the trachea faster
      when using the air-Q as compared to the i-gel. The ease of placement of the supraglottic
      airway device, fiberoptic grade of laryngeal view, time for device removal after intubation,
      and peri-operative complications will also be assessed.
