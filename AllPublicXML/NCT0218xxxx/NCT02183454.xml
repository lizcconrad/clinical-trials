      To collect post marketing surveillance data on patients receiving at least one Combo
      Bio-Engineered Sirolimus Eluting Stent when used according to the Instructions for Use. Data
      will be collected in order to assess the long term safety and performance of the Combo Stent
      in routine clinical practice.

      The multicenter, multinational, prospective registry population consists of patients who
      undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with (attempted) placement of at least one
      Combo Stent (according to the Instructions for use) as part of routine clinical care.
      Approximately 2,500 patients from 50 centers in Europe and Asia will be entered into the
      registry. Patients entered into the registry are followed for one year. The registry is
      considered finished when all patients have completed the 12 month follow-up.

      A follow-up is scheduled at 30 days, 6 months and 12 months post procedure. Follow-up is
      obtained at a planned regular visit to the outpatient clinic, or by telephone contact with
      the patient.

        Consecutive patients who undergo PCI with (attempted) placement of at least one Combo Stent
        as part of routine clinical care are entered into the registry. PCI with a Combo Stent is
        considered attempted when the operator has passed the Combo Stent across the guiding
        catheter.

        In general, consecutive patients are included in the registry. Patients are only excluded
        from registration if ANY of the following conditions apply:

          1. Undergoing PCI for treatment of stent thrombosis

          2. High probability of non-adherence to the follow-up requirements (due to social,
             psychological or medical reasons)

          3. Currently participating in another investigational drug or device study in which a
             routine angiographic follow-up is planned

          4. A life expectancy of &lt;12 months
