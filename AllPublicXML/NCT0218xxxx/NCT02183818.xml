  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to use an integrated network systems approach to analyze certain existing small airway
      epithelium (SAE) omic data sets at the genetic, epigenetic (methylation), gene expression,
      microRNA and metabolomic levels, to develop an initial model of network connectivities and
      key network pressure points relevant to SAE biology in health and disease.

      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the disordered differentiation of the SAE that characterizes
      COPD results from the complex interaction of cigarette smoke components with a hierarchy of
      genetic, epigenetic, gene expression and metabolomics network interactions as the BC
      differentiate into a mucociliary epithelium.

      Specific aim 1. Using an integrated network systems approach to analyze our extensive
      existing SAE omic data sets at the genetic, epigenetic (methylation), gene expression,
      microRNA and metabolomics levels, to develop an initial model of network connectivities and
      key network pressure points relevant to SAE biology in health and disease.

      Specific aim 2. To refine the model, a comprehensive omics data set will be collected at
      multiple time points as SAE BC of nonsmokers and COPD smokers differentiate to normal and
      disordered mucociliary epithelium (respectively) on air-liquid interface (ALI) culture, an in
      vitro model of SAE differentiation. The computational strategies from aim 1 will be used to
      improve the model with these data.

      Specific aim 3. To test and finalize the integrated network model, a parallel omics data set
      will be generated from BC from nonsmokers, and COPD smokers as they differentiate on ALI
      under conditions where key hubs will be up- or down-regulated and the differentiation process
      stressed under conditions mimicking the in vivo SAE environment. The end result will be an
      integrated systems model of SAE biology and how this is disordered in COPD.
