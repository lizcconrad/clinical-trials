  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug, alisertib, in
      combination with chemotherapy (paclitaxel), can shrink or slow tumor growth in women with
      hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative or HR-negative, HER2-negative (triple negative)
      locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. The safety of alisertib in combination with
      paclitaxel will also be studied. The physical state of the patient, symptoms, changes in the
      size of the tumor, and laboratory findings obtained while on-study will help the research
      team decide if alisertib plus paclitaxel is safe and effective in patients with this type of
      breast cancer.

      Alisertib belongs to a group of drugs called Aurora kinase inhibitors. Alisertib blocks the
      activity of Aurora A kinase, a protein that is involved in tumor cell multiplication and
      survival. Aurora A kinase is expressed at higher than normal levels in many types of cancer,
      including breast cancer, and preclinical studies suggest that blocking the activity of this
      protein can lead to the death of cancer cells.

      Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat many different kinds of cancer,
      including metastatic breast cancer. The reason to combine alisertib and paclitaxel is that in
      cancer therapy, combinations of drugs are often more effective as a treatment than either of
      the same drugs used alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale behind assessing the effectiveness of the addition of alisertib to weekly
      paclitaxel therapy in patients with Triple Negative Breast Cancer and highly proliferative
      ER+ and HER2- breast cancer is based on the unmet clinical need for effective strategies to
      prevent or delay resistance to taxane therapy in the metastatic setting. Synergistic or
      additive effects have been observed in breast cancer xenograft models which involved
      alisertib added to either paclitaxel or docetaxel. Alisertib inhibited the Pgp-mediated
      efflux of paclitaxel in a cell culture model. In addition, Aurora Kinase A is frequently
      overexpressed in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), and expression levels have been shown
      to be prognostic in both of these breast cancer subtypes. The combination of alisertib with
      paclitaxel has also been investigated in a Phase 1 study in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic ovarian and breast cancers, with preliminary evidence of activity in both tumor
      types including 6 PRs (partial response) and 3 SD (stable disease) in 11 patients with
      metastatic breast cancer.
