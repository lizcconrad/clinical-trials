  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MEK162 has shown significant inhibition of tumor growth as a single agent in NSCLC xenograft
      models in mice and human cancer cells in vitro, which have KRAS and/or other mutations. These
      data suggest that MEK162 may provide a potential benefit in cancer indications harboring
      these mutations. MEK162 is currently being investigated in phase I clinical testing and has
      been well tolerated up to an MTD of 45mg BID in cancer patients.

      There has been little change in survival benefit for patients with non-small cell lung cancer
      in recent years. Emerging new treatment options relying on molecular and genetic markers are
      being studied extensively. Thus, there has been a shift to manage non-small cell lung cancer
      with molecular targeted therapies in combination with standard chemotherapy. This study will
      be targeting patients with KRAS mutations.

      OBJECTIVES

      1.1 Primary Objectives

        -  To assess the safety of MEK162 administered in combination with carboplatin and
           pemetrexed as first line treatment in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

        -  To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MEK162 to be used when given in a
           continuous dosing schedule together with pemetrexed and carboplatin administered on a
           3-weekly schedule as first line treatment in advanced NSCLC.

        -  To explore the efficacy (as measured by tumor response in the Phase Ib portion) of the
           combination of MEK162 in addition to pemetrexed and carboplatin in treatment-naïve
           patients with EGFR wild-type, ALK-rearrangement negative NSCLC of the lung.

      1.2 Secondary Objectives

        -  To characterize the population pharmacokinetics of MEK162 administered in combination
           with carboplatin and pemetrexed (Phase I).

        -  To explore relationships between KRAS mutation (and sub-types) and additional genomic
           mutations and objective clinical response.

      1.3 Trial End-points Primary Phase I • Development of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), (defined
      in section 4.3) as measured with NCI CTC AE v4.

      Phase Ib

      • Objective response rate (ORR) as per RECIST v1.1.

      Secondary Phase I • Adverse events, serious adverse events, changes in hematology and
      chemistry values, vital signs, ECGs.

      Phase Ib

        -  Evaluation of response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and disease control
           rate (DCR) for patients with and without KRAS mutation in tumor tissue.

        -  Exploratory analysis of KRAS mutation sub-type.

      Exploratory end-points

      • A limited sampling strategy pharmacokinetic model will be used to ensure that the clearance
      of MEK162 is not influenced by the concurrent administration of pemetrexed-based
      chemotherapy.

    <description>This is a Phase I/Ib, open-label, dose-escalation, multi-center, non-randomized study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral Binimetinib in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed.
Phase I part A standard 3+3 dose-escalation will be used to determine the maximum administered dose (MAD) and the RP2D for the combination in subjects with advanced non-squamous lung carcinoma.
Phase Ib part Once RP2D has been identified, an expansion cohort will be accrued; these patients will be stratified by KRAS genotype.
The RP2D will be expanded by enrolling additional patients, stratified by KRAS genotype, to a total of 30 patients eligible for the safety set (including those treated at the same dose combination in the dose-escalation phase of the study who are eligible for the safety set) to be evaluated for safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and biologic activity of MEK162.</description>
