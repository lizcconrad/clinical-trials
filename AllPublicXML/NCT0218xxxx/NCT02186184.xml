  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthokeratology is becoming popular for the treatment of myopia children. Many studies have
      shown that orthokeratology is effective in temporarily reducing refractive error, and is also
      helpful for controlling myopia progression. However, the mechanism for its slowing myopia
      progression and rebound effect after the treatment have not been clearly studied. In
      addition, the effect of orthokeratology among Chinese children has not been evaluated with
      randomized controlled trial.This study is to assess the effect of orthokeratology versus
      spectacles on myopia progression in school-aged Chinese children during two years.
