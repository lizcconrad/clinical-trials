      To assess the bioequivalence of the investigational TEST product with the marketed REFERENCE
      products by measurement of Plasma concentrations of Erythromycylamine and calculation of the
      bioequivalence parameters from those measurements followed by ANOVA and 90% confidence
      interval statistical evaluation.
