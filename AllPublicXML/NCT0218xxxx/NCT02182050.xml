  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this phase II trial was to evaluate the efficacy of 250 mg BIBF 1120
      twice daily (BID) versus 150 mg BIBF 1120 BID in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) who had failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. In addition, safety
      data for the two different dosages were collected and analysed.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Male or female patients with histologically confirmed advanced NSCLC (i.e.

             or non-platinum based chemotherapy.

          3. Full recovery from all therapy related toxicities from previous chemotherapy/
             radiotherapy or recovery in as much as no further improvement may be expected by the
             investigator.

          4. Age ≥18 years.

          5. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          6. ECOG performance score 0, 1 or 2.

             X-ray.

          8. Adequate hepatic function: total bilirubin within normal limits; alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 1.5x upper limit of
             normal (ULN) in patients without liver metastasis; For patients with liver metastasis:
             total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN; ALT and/or AST &lt; 2.5x ULN.

          9. Coagulation parameters: international normalised ratio less than 1.3 or prothrombin
             time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) less than 1.5 times institutional ULN.

         10. Adequate renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper normal limit.

         11. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/mL, platelets ≥ 100000/mL, haemoglobin ≥ 9.0

         12. Written informed consent consistent with ICH-GCP guidelines and local law.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Active brain metastases stable for &lt; 4 weeks, symptomatic, or requiring treatment with
             anti-convulsants and/or steroids or leptomeningeal disease.

         18. Male or female patients who are sexually active and unwilling to use a medically
             acceptable method of contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study
