  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the proposed study is to determine whether behavioral feeding
      intervention impacts mother-child attachment in infants and toddlers with feeding problems.
      The investigators propose the following hypotheses:

        -  Behavioral feeding intervention will not significantly impact parent-child attachment.

        -  Behavioral feeding intervention will not significantly impact parent-child unstructured
           play interactions.

        -  Severity of feeding problems will decrease after behavioral feeding intervention is
           implemented.

        -  Behavioral feeding intervention will have either no significant effect or a significant
           positive effect on general child behavior.

    <description>Mother-child dyads will be given toys and asked to play as they normally would for 10 minutes. The purpose of this measure is to detect any changes in parent-child interaction patterns that may be more sensitive to short-term intervention than attachment status.</description>
