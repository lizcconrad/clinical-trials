    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the quality of outcomes in the Post Anesthesia Care
      Unit (PACU) at BCH and to identify preoperative demographic and behavioral data as well as
      intraoperative and anesthetic predictors of adverse PACU outcomes. The investigators
      hypothesize quality of PACU outcomes will correlate with preoperative demographic and
      behavioral characteristics as well as intraoperative and anesthetic procedures/techniques.
      This study will help the investigators improve post anesthetic care quality and create a
      higher level of satisfaction for patients, family, and health care providers.

    <description>Incidence of significant pain defined by pain behavior information from the Faces-Legs-Activity-Cry-Consolability (FLACC) scale, Wong-Baker Faces scale, visual analog scale/numerical scale or adapted numerical rating scale - equal to or more than 5 on a scale from 0 to 10 at any time during the PACU stay.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Agitation in PACU</measure>
    <time_frame>On day of surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of agitation using emergence agitation categorization with Pediatric Agitation Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale equal to or more than 10 on this scale for more than 30 seconds during the recovery period.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Post-Operative Nausea or Vomiting</measure>
    <time_frame>On day of surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Post-operative vomiting (POV) will be measured by episodes of vomiting or retching in PACU. This will be a binary outcome - either vomiting/retching occurred or it did not.</description>
