  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a stroke, there is an exaggerated inhibitory influence from the non-stroke hemisphere
      to the stroke hemisphere. Brain stimulation using repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) to the non-stroke hemisphere can decrease this inhibition. Paired
      Associative Stimulation (PAS) may be a more effective way to produce this same inhibition, as
      shown in healthy subjects. However, it is not known whether this will translate to people
      with stroke. PAS consists of a peripheral nerve stimulus paired a short time later with a
      cortical stimulus to change the excitability within the brain. Thus the investigators will
      apply PAS to people with stroke, but the investigators need to first determine the most
      effective interpulse interval (IPI) between the peripheral and cortical stimuli. Our research
      question is which of three different IPIs is most effective in changing the excitability of
      the brain.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal IPI between a peripheral nerve pulse
      and a cortical stimulus that will be most effective in changing excitability of the brain in
      people with chronic stroke. The investigators hypothesize that the cortical excitability of
      the nonstroke hemisphere will be most inhibited with the latency-5ms condition.

      Numerous PAS studies have been done in healthy subjects and all have been done safely. The
      proper interpulse interval in healthy individuals between the peripheral nerve stimulus and
      the cortical stimulus is known to be &quot;latency-5ms.&quot; However, this may be different in
      individuals with stroke.

      Specific Aim: what is the optimal interpulse interval to achieve the maximum inhibitory
      effect in the nonstroke hemisphere?

      We will recruit three subjects with chronic stroke. Electroencephalography (EEG) will be used
      to determine the latency between the peripheral nerve stimulus and the sensory evoked
      potential in each subject. We will then assess the following IPIs on each subject in a random
      order: &quot;latency&quot; - 3ms, -5ms and -7ms. There will be a fourth condition of &quot;latency&quot; + 100ms
      (known to have no effect) to be used as a control. The washout period will be at least one
      week between each of these conditions.

      The optimal IPI will be determined from these tests by comparing single pulse transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures for cortical excitability. Prior to each treatment, each
      subject will receive 20 single pulse cortical stimuli to serve as pretest data. The post
      tests for each condition will consist of 20 single pulse cortical stimuli at 0, 5, 10, 15,
      30, 45 and 60 minutes after the PAS condition. Data analysis will consist of a single-subject
      analysis with the two standard deviation bandwidth method of each post-test compared to
      pre-test.

      We hypothesize that there will be no adverse advents and that this optimal IPI will be
      &quot;latency&quot;-5ms.
