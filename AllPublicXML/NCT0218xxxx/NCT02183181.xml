      Primary Objective:

      To access the bioequivalence of meloxicam capsule 15 mg (Test, T) to meloxicam tablet 15mg
      (Reference, R) following oral administration.

      Secondary Objective:

      To investigate the safety and tolerability of meloxicam following a single dose of meloxicam
      capsule 15 mg vs. meloxicam tablet 15 mg under fasting conditions in healthy male Taiwanese
      subjects.
