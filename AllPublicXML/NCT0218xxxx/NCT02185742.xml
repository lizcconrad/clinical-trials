    <textblock>
      Planning for SUCCESS (Sustained, Unbroken Connections to Care, Entry Services, and
      Suppression) is a project to improve the connection to community care for HIV infected
      persons leaving Fulton County Jail or Atlanta City Detention Center in Atlanta.

      Hypothesis: Participants who receive the intervention will be more likely to link to medical
      care after jail release than similar participants who do not receive the intervention.

      Rationale and objective: This project aims to make sure HIV positive persons leaving jail
      maintain medical care. Case managers will use strength based case management and phone
      texting technology to improve release's connections to care in the community.

      This study will have extensive tracking of outcomes. The key outcome will be whether HIV
      infected participants receiving an intervention experience suppression of their viral load
      after release from jail . The investigators wish to demonstrate the ability to recruit
      participants into the SUCCESS intervention and repeatedly check community medical records to
      see how well their infection is being controlled after they linked to care. Investigators
      also want to conduct a survey at baseline, 3 months and 12 months.

      Investigators will compare the viral load of participants receiving the intervention to
      participants passing through the jail who do not receive the outcome.

    <description>HIV viral load can be drawn; obtaining it shows that the person is in care. Ideally, it should be suppressed 12 months out of jail.
One measurement of viral load within three months after release will demonstrate linkage; two clinical visits occurring within 12 months post release, with at least 2 clinical visits spaced a minimum of 3 months apart, will indicate retention.</description>
