      The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a combination of insulin resistance
      reducing agents pre and post coronary artery bypass grafting surgery on post-operative blood
      glucose and oxidative stress regulation. The sample size was estimated to be 92 (23 in each
      group). The participants of the study were selected from the non-diabetic patients scheduled
      for CABG. The patients were allocated to four groups using balanced block randomization
      method:

        1. Consumption of the supplement (a 20 gram pack of the supplement daily) 7 days before
           surgery and placebo (a pack of starch) 30 days post surgery

        2. Consumption of placebo 7 days before surgery and supplement 30 days post surgery

        3. Consumption of the supplement 7 days before and 30 days post surgery

        4. Consumption of placebo 7 days before and 30 days post surgery One week before, before
           the onset of the surgery, after the surgery, 1 week after and 4 weeks after the
           operation, blood samples were taken and the levels of hemoglobin A1C, glucose, insulin
           and malondialdehyde were measured. Also, body composition indices were assessed in four
           times: one week before the surgery, before the onset of the surgery, 1 week after and 4
           weeks after the surgery.
