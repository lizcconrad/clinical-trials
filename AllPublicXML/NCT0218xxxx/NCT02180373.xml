      The overall goal of this multicenter collaborative research study is to identify genetic,
      proteomic, and/or lipidic (lipidomic) biomarkers associated with the outcomes of lower
      extremity revascularization in patients with advanced peripheral artery disease (PAD).

    <textblock>
      Vascular surgeons at 10-15 centers will ultimately be involved. Patients who are already
      undergoing physician-specified intervention and follow up, and meet enrollment criteria, will
      participate in the study. The PREDICT study includes two independent arms to assess
      restenosis - peripheral vein graft (VG) bypass surgery and endovascular (angioplasty and
      superficial femoral artery (SFA) stenting). In broad outline, approximately 1,000 patients
      will be enrolled for each arm, with clinical follow-up out to two years. Demographic,
      clinical, and procedural data will be collected at baseline. Clinical and imaging data will
      be obtained over the follow up period in accordance with standard post-procedural
      surveillance practices (1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months). Blood samples will be obtained for
      genomic DNA and plasma biomarkers at 3 time points - baseline, 1 month and 6 months. The
      baseline samples will provide key information about patients with advanced PAD, often
      correlated with significant coronary disease.

      Data is entered by clinical coordinators into electronic case report forms in the Remedy
      Informatics database controlled by Vascular Cures. No PHI is included. Paper copies are
      maintained at the site. Registry data elements were developed with the study PI at University
      of California at San Francisco (UCSF). The Vascular Cures project manager reviews the
      database on a monthly basis to insure that case report forms (CRFs) are being completed
      appropriately and manage the data. Minor data omissions will be ignored; coordinators will be
      asked to re-submit for any major omissions. Site coordinators are responsible for managing
      all activities related to patients.

        Patients with advanced peripheral artery disease already undergoing treatment by
        participating vascular surgeons, who are either having vein graft (VG) bypass or
        superficial femoral artery (SFA) stenting. These procedures are unrelated to this study.
        Enrollment is at the discretion of the participating vascular surgeon in addition to
        meeting inclusion criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age of at least 18 years.

          2. Provision of written informed consent for biospecimen storage, broad genetic and
             proteomic analysis of tissues, without restrictions, and correlation with clinical
             outcome data.

          3. Willingness to undergo all study collection procedures and sample analyses

             . VG BYPASS COHORT

        1. Patient requires placement of an infrainguinal vein bypass graft for the treatment of
        chronic peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAD). Disabling claudication or critical limb
        ischemia are acceptable indications.

        2. Adequate vein conduit (saphenous vein or alternative vein/spliced vein grafts) for
        bypass available based on preoperative surgical and/or ultrasound assessment.

        SFA COHORT:

          1. Patient requires placement of a superficial femoral artery stent for the treatment of
             chronic peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAD). Disabling claudication or critical
             limb ischemia are acceptable indications.

          2. TransAtlantic Intersociety Consensus (TASC) A-C lesions (must be &gt;70% by visual
             estimate) amenable to bare metal or drug-eluting stent placement. Stent manufacturer

             available and, if drug-eluting, FDA-approved for SFA use .
