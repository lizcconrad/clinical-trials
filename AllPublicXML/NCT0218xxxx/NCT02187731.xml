  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FULIMA study is a two-center study at Odense University Hospital and Vejle Hospital,
      Denmark. The primary objective is to identify the optimal imaging technique for studies in
      multiple myeloma with focus on PET/CT and MRI.

      By combining early (1 hour) and late (3 hours) 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-
      fluorodeoxyglucose(18F-FDG)-PET/CT scans the investigators expect to see increased uptake of
      radioactive tracer and thus an improved ability to identify malignant tissue. A second tracer
      18F-natrium-fluoride is used to explore early signs of bone remodeling. By using new software
      (ROVER) for interpreting PET data the investigators expect to obtain a quantitative
      measurement of total disease burden with less risk of misinterpretation of data.

      Diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) is a new MRI technique which, like PET/CT, makes it possible
      quantitatively to calculate the overall disease activity and to give an early evaluation of
      response to chemotherapy. The study examines DWI for development and standardization.

      To validate imaging findings and to explore the pathogenetic heterogeneity of multiple
      myeloma, the investigators perform CT guided biopsies from PET/ DWI positive sites.
      Pathoanatomical and immunohistochemical findings and gene expression data from positive sites
      are compared to random bone marrow. The question is whether disease heterogeneity may explain
      the lack of FDG uptake in bone marrow in some patients? To the extent that the FULIMA study
      produces useful data, the defined and standardized imaging techniques will form the basis of
      a larger prospective study at national level in Denmark.

    <description>A 1st complete set of imaging procedures is completed at time of diagnosis &quot;baseline&quot; (week 1-2) for all patients included in the study. The primary hypothesis that 3-hour FDG-PET / CT finds more malignant lesions than the current gold standard procedure, whole body x-ray(WBXR), together with CT and MRI. Concordance analysis will be done by summarizing comparisons of 3-hours FDG-PET/CT versus the remaining modalities. We measure a 95% Wilson-Score Confidence Interval (CI) to demonstrate that 3hours FDG-PET / CT find more malignant lesions than gold standard. This will be concluded at a significance level of 5% if the lower boundary of the 95% CI is larger than 30%.</description>

    <description>18F-natrium-fluoride-PET/CT is performed at time of diagnosis (baseline) during week 1-2, after induction treatment and after end of treatment. We test if increased 18F-natrium-fluoride uptake is seen in bone sites where, according to CT and DWI, no abnormal bone remodeling is taking place and we observe the association between FDG-PET and fluoride-PET and markers of bone metabolism. We use descriptive statistics for number of bone sites with increased fluoride uptake, 95% Confidence interval</description>
