  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current program of research will be to test whether intranasal ketamine
      treatment is more effective than placebo in reducing suicidal ideation in suicidal patients
      presenting for acute treatment in emergency department settings. Secondary objectives will
      test the effect of genotypic differences in the mu opioid receptor on efficacy of ketamine
      and the correlation of speech patterns and facial movement patterns with subjective
      reductions in suicidal ideation after ketamine treatment.
