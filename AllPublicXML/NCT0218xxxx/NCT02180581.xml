  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the intervention is to examine the effect of a combination of the two bacterial
      strains BB-12 and LGG, provided for 6 month, on the prevalence of infections and allergic
      manifestations in small children, and how a combination of BB-12 and LGG affects the immune
      system, gastrointestinal tract and the microbiota. Children are enrolled during 2 winter
      seasons.
