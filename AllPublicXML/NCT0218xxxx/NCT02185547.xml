      This study targets women with moderate depression during pregnancy. We aim to investigate the
      direct effect of the newborn child and the long term consequences on the cognitive
      developement on children who´s mother has been treated with CBT alone or in combination with
      antidepressants.

      The primary objective is to study the direct neonatal effects and the long-term consequences
      on cognitive development in children prenatal exposed to maternal sertraline treatment
      compared to exposure to maternal depression treated with only ICBT.
