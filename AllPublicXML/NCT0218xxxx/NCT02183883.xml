    <textblock>
      To assess if targeting activating EGFR and HER2 mutations in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
      (NSCLC) is more effective when these mutations are truncal dominant mutations (≥50%), as
      opposed to non-dominant (≥5 to &lt;50%) or low frequency mutations (&lt;5%).

      This trial will only be available to patients registered to the TRACERx study (NCT01888601).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        This therapeutic trial is only relevant for patients involved in the TRACERx observational
        study.

          -  Subjects must be willing to have a biopsy of relapsed disease. Consent will be
             obtained through the TRACERx study. Procurement of the biopsy sample is not necessary
             at the time of trial registration. However, patients must undergo a biopsy prior to
             commencement of afatinib.

          -  Patients must have tumours harbouring a sensitising EGFR mutation or HER2 mutation in
             at least one biopsy at recurrence, or region of the primary sample.

          -  Written Informed consent for DARWIN1.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-3

          -  No previous exposure to an EGFR TKI.

          -  No previous chemotherapy or biological therapy in the advanced setting.

          -  Measurable disease by RECIST v1.1.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Anticipated life expectancy of at least three months.

          -  Adequate organ function as defined by the following baseline values:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5x109/L

               -  Platelets ≥100x109/L

               -  Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). In patients with known
                  Gilbert's syndrome, total bilirubin ≤3xULN with direct bilirubin ≤1.5xULN

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤3xULN or ≤5x
                  ULN if liver metastases are present

               -  Creatinine clearance must be ≥30mL/min

          -  Women with child-bearing potential, or men who are able to father a child, must be
             willing to practice acceptable methods of birth control during the trial and for 1
             month after the end of treatment.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days
             before the first dose of trial medication.

             etiology at baseline.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to afatinib or to any of the excipients.
