      Background: Several clinical trials are underway to investigate if variable forms of vitamin
      D (D2 vs. D3) prescribed at different doses (10,000-50,000 IUs/week) can improve the
      side-effects associated with treatment for estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer,
      specifically aromatase inhibitors (AIs.) Presumably for generalizability and potential safety
      purposes, these trials predominantly exclude women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC); a
      rapidly expanding sector of the cancer survivor population who experience significant
      treatment-related side-effects. Evaluation of the safety of vitamin D3 supplementation is
      crucial since supplementation can lead to high calcium and importantly, in lab studies have
      shown that vitamin D3 affects a gene that increases estrogen production. To assure that
      vitamin D3 does not affect the clinical effects of anti-estrogen therapies, the effect of
      vitamin D3 supplements on estrogen production requires an evaluation that further explores
      and defines its potential role in symptom management for this population.

      Objectives: This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of vitamin D3 supplementation in
      women with MBC, providing much needed data on the preliminary safety and efficacy of this
      treatment in this patient population. This study will determine: 1) if weekly supplementation
      of high dose vitamin D3 increases serum vitamin D levels without adverse effects related to
      such therapy (primary aim); 2) the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on symptom
      management (secondary aim); and 3) if vitamin D3 supplementation is associated with improved
      inflammation (exploratory aim.)

      Methods: This is an 8 week &quot;proof of concept&quot; study to monitor important laboratory
      parameters and to assess potential effects on short-term outcomes. Adult, female patients
      (&gt;=18 years) with ER+ MBC (Stage IV) of any race/ethnicity and a history of vitamin D &lt; 30
      mg/dl will be recruited from within and around LUMC. Following current clinical practice
      guidelines, eligible participants will receive 50,000 IUs of vitamin D3 weekly for 8 weeks.
      Laboratory values, muscle function and inflammation will be examined pre- and
      post-supplementation, while symptoms (e.g., pain, sleep, fatigue, mood, and overall quality
      of life) will be assessed at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks post-supplementation. We will assess if
      increases in vitamin D are associated with clinically significant changes in serum estradiol,
      improvements in symptoms and QOL, and decreased inflammation, controlling for sunlight
      exposure, diet, physical activity and body composition.

      Study Aims

      Several clinical trials are underway to investigate if vitamin D2 or D3 provided at various
      doses (10,000-50,000 IUs/week) can improve the side-effects associated with anti-estrogen
      therapies, specifically aromatase inhibitors (AIs). However, these current trials use
      variable forms of vitamin D and predominantly include women with Stage I-III disease,
      excluding women with metastatic breast cancer. Evaluation of the safety of vitamin D3
      supplementation is crucial since supplementation can lead to hypercalcemia and importantly,
      in vitro studies have shown that vitamin D3 influences the transcription of a gene that
      increases estrogen production.27,28 To assure that vitamin D3 does not abrogate the clinical
      effects of anti-estrogen therapies, the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on estrogen
      production requires evaluation. Therefore, the overarching goal of this pilot study is to
      evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation in women with
      MBC. We will address and test the following aims and hypotheses, respectively:

      Aim 1: To determine if weekly supplementation of 50,000 IUs of vitamin D3 raises serum levels
      of 25(OH)D to &gt;30 mg/dl without adverse effects.

      Hypothesis 1: Women who are compliant with vitamin D3 supplementation, as evidenced by
      normalization (&gt;30 mg/dl) or increases in their serum 25(OH)D levels, will not experience
      significant changes in serum calcium, parathyroid hormone or serum estradiol levels.

      Aim 2: To determine the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on symptom management.

      Hypothesis 2: Women who achieve serum concentrations of 25 (OH)D ≥30 mg/dl or experience
      significant increases in 25(OH)D will exhibit improvements in pain, fatigue, sleep, mood,
      muscle function and overall quality of life.

      Exploratory Aim: To explore the mechanistic effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on
      inflammatory markers and its potential association with symptom management.

      Summary: Evidence from studies involving early stage breast cancer participants confirms that
      musculoskeletal pain, endocrine related symptoms and mood disturbances are commonly
      associated with breast cancer treatment, particularly hormone deprivation therapies. The high
      prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency among breast cancer survivors is well
      accepted and further hypothesized to aggravate treatment-related side effects, particularly
      arthralgias. Women with MBC are excluded from the majority of on-going vitamin D
      supplementation trials for safety and generalizability purposes. However, novel therapies are
      continuing to improve and prolong the lives of these women, resulting in a rapidly expansive
      group of breast cancer survivors. While vitamin D supplementation is prescribed to correct an
      underlying nutrient deficiency in the clinical context of preserving bone health, emerging
      evidence suggests it may have more systemic effects. Thus, vitamin D
      repletion/supplementation has profound potential implications for women with MBC, whose
      primary goal of treatment is to minimize the side-effects of treatment in support of optimal
      quality of life. This study reflects a highly innovative, yet simple therapy that could
      ultimately provide these survivors with a much needed evidence-based supportive care
      strategies.
