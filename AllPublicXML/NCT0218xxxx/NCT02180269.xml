  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK,
      study of the way a drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) of
      single-ascending oral doses of JNJ-54861911 in healthy Japanese male participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance),
      double-blind (neither Investigator nor participant knows which treatment the participant
      receives), placebo controlled (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared with a drug
      to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial), study of a single-ascending
      dose of JNJ-54861911 in participants between 55 to 75 years of age. The duration of study
      will be approximately 2 to 6 weeks per participant. The study consists of 3 periods:
      Screening period (28 to 2 days prior to dose administration); Double-blind Treatment period
      (participants will receive either a single oral dose of JNJ-54861911 or placebo as tablets
      under fasted conditions); and a Follow-up visit period (7 to 14 days after dose
      administration). All the eligible participants will be assigned to any of following 3
      cohorts: Cohort A (single oral dose of JNJ-54861911, 25 milligram [mg] or placebo); Cohort B
      (single oral dose of JNJ-54861911, 50 mg or placebo); Cohort C (single oral dose of
      JNJ-54861911, 100 mg or placebo). Each cohort will include 8 participants. Participants in
      each cohort will be randomly assigned to receive either a single oral dose of JNJ-54861911 (n
      = 6) or placebo (n = 2). Blood samples will be collected pre-dose and over 96 hours (that is
      up to Day 5) after dosing for understanding the PK characteristics of JNJ-54861911.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 14 days after last dose administration, that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>
