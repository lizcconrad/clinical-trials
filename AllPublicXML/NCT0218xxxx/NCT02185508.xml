  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the relation among: (1) changes in voltage and
      amplitude of trans-operatory records obtained through the use of Intra-operative
      Neurophysiological Monitoring (IONM), and (2) clinical outcomes; of patients who underwent 1
      or 2 levels surgical decompression at lumbar spine.

      IONM is the use of real time neurophysiological techniques during spinal surgeries. The
      modalities included in this study are:

        -  Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs).

        -  Trans-cranial electric motor evoked potentials (tceMEPs).

        -  Spontaneous electromyography (EMG).

      Clinical outcome of the patients will be assessed through a careful evaluation of clinical
      data, as well as the application of three outcome scales:

        -  Oswestry Disability Index 2.1a

        -  Visual Analogue Scale for Pain

        -  Patient's Overall Impression of Change

    <textblock>
      Radiculopathy associated to lumbar disk disease is one of the most common reasons for a spine
      surgeon to be consulted. The pathophysiology of degenerative spine disease is acknowledged as
      complex, involving a wide array of risk factors ranging from genetic polymorphisms, to
      behavioural characteristics. While conflicting opinions exist with regard the direction of
      treatment for lumbar disk disease, de-compressive surgery is currently the gold standard for
      patients in which protocols of physiotherapy and analgesics have failed to comply.

      Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) is widely used in the practice of spine
      surgery as a mean of preventing and reducing severe complications inherent to surgical
      techniques like paraparesis, paraplegia and quadriplegia. Indeed, a great deal of funding and
      work have been devoted to research projects seeking to determine the impact of IONM in
      reducing these risks. The results of such projects have been notoriously interesting, and
      frequently opposing to each other. This has lead to an open debate on weather the use of IONM
      may or not be justified by better outcomes in patients who undergo such procedure. To our
      knowledge there is no study in the literature that has addressed the potential role of the
      IOM to predict the long-term outcome of the patient in therms of radicular symptoms
      improvement.

    <time_frame>Trans-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Standard register electrodes where placed from L1 to L5 myotomes and dermatomes. Through trans-operative real time modalities (trans-cranial electric motor evoked potentials, somatosensory evoked potentials, and spontaneous electromyography) measurements on amplitude and voltage were recorded at the beginning and at the end of the spinal decompression. This change will be studied to determine its predictive power in the clinical long-term outcome of the patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analogue scale for pain</measure>
    <time_frame>In the pre-operatory consult with the surgeon, and in the follow-up visits up to two years after the completion of the neurological surgery; the patient will be asked to complete the Visual Analogue Scale for Pain</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale is a written survey used to assess the pain a person endures. The patient will select a number from one to ten to express the relative amount of pain she is suffering. Data collected throughout the study will be used as a clinical follow-up measure to be compared with that obtained through intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. Approximate time of completion is &lt;5 minutes; and no physical examination, nor additional pain may be experienced by completing such survey</description>

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index 2.1a</measure>
    <time_frame>In the pre-operatory consult with the surgeon, and in the follow-up visits up to two years after the completion of the neurological surgery; the patient will be asked to complete the Oswestry Disability Index 2.1a</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index 2.1a is a written survey used to quantify the amount of disability a person endures due to low-back pain. The patient will answer a series of 10 questions enquiring about experiences of her life, and how the pain she suffers affects the quality of these experiences. Data collected throughout the study will be used as a clinical follow-up measure to be compared with that obtained through intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. Approximate time of completion is &lt;5 minutes; and no physical examination, nor additional pain may be experienced by completing such survey.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's Global Impression of Change Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>In the follow-up visits up to two years after the completion of the neurological surgery, the patient will be asked to complete the Patient's Global Impression of Change Survey</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient's Global Impression of Change Survey is a written survey used to quantify the amount of improvement a person perceives for herself after receiving a certain treatment. The patient will select from a list of previously defined statements, the one that best describes her impression of change after the surgery, and will select a number ranging from one to ten representing her perception of improvement. Data collected throughout the study will be used as a clinical follow-up measure to be compared with that obtained through intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. Approximate time of completion is &lt;5 minutes; and no physical examination, nor additional pain may be experienced by completing such survey.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>General demographic, personal and biometrical data</measure>
    <time_frame>In the pre-operatory consult with the surgeon, the patient will be asked to complete a survey enquiring about general demographic, personal and biometrical data</time_frame>
    <description>The survey used to capture general demographic, personal and biometrical data is designed according to the stipulations of the Official Mexican Norm for the Clinical Record (NOM-004-SSA3-2012). The data obtained through such survey will help the surgeon in assessing the case of the patient. Some or all of this data may be used for analysis in this study, to be compared with the rest of the outcome measures. A privacy policy statement may be provided to the patient according to the Federal Law for the Protection of Personal Data in Possession of Particulars (Ley Federal de Protección de Datos Personales en Posesión de los Particulares). Regardless of such formality, the privacy of the patient will be assured throughout the study.</description>
