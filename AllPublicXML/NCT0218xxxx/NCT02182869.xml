        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients 40 years of age or older

          2. A diagnosis of COPD as defined by American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. Patients
             must have relatively stable, moderate to severe airway obstruction with a baseline FEV
             1 &lt;=65% of predicted normal and FEV1/FVC &gt;=70%.

          3. A smoking history of more than ten pack-years. A pack-year is defined as the
             equivalent of smoking one pack of 20 cigarettes per day for a year

          4. Able to perform technical satisfactory pulmonary function test

          5. Able to be trained in the proper use of a MDI

          6. Having signed an informed consent from prior to participation in the trial

          7. Affiliation to the French social security system or beneficiary of such a system

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Significant disease other than COPD. A significant disease is defined as a disease
             which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at risk because of
             participation in the study or a disease which may influence the results of the study
             or the patient's ability to participate in the study

          2. Clinical relevant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or urinalysis. If the
             abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion, the patient is
             excluded

          3. Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) &gt;80 IU/L; serum glutamic pyruvic
             transaminase (SGPT) &gt;80IU/L, bilirubin &gt;2.0mg/dL or creatinine &gt;2.0mg/dL

          4. Serum potassium level above or below the normal range

          5. Total blood eosinophil count &gt;=600/mm³

          6. Recent history (i.e., one year or less) of myocardial infarction

          7. Recent history (i.e., three years or less) of heart failure or any cardiac arrhythmia
             requiring drug therapy

          8. History of cancer, other than treated basal cell carcinoma, within the last five years

          9. History of life-threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of cystic fibrosis or
             bronchiectasis

         10. History of thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. History or a thoracotomy for other
             reasons should be evaluated as per exclusion criteria no. 1

         11. History of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy

         12. History of or active alcohol or drug abuse

         13. Known active tuberculosis

         14. Upper respiratory tract infection or COPD exacerbation in the six weeks prior to
             screening visit or between the screening visit and visit 2

         15. Known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction

         16. Known narrow-angle glaucoma

         17. Current significant psychiatric disorders

         18. Regular use of daytime oxygen therapy

         19. Use of beta-blocker medications, mono-amine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic
             antidepressants

         20. Use of cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium

         21. Use of antihistamines.

         22. Use of oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than six weeks on
             a stable dose before screening visit or a change between the screening visit and
             visit2) or at a dose in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone per day or
             20mg every other day

         23. Use of oral beta-adrenergics or long-acting beta-adrenergics such as salmeterol
             (Serevent®) and formoterol in the two weeks prior to the screening visit or between
             the screening visit and visit 2

         24. Changes in the therapeutic plan within the last six weeks prior to the screening visit
             or between the screening visit and visit 2, excluding changes from long acting or oral
             beta-adrenergics to short acting inhaled beta-adrenergics for purposes of this trial

         25. Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically
             approved means of contraception

         26. Known hypersensitivity to anti-cholinergic or beta-agonist drugs or any other
             component of either Combivent® formulations

         27. Use of an investigational drug within one month or six half lives prior to the
             screening visit
