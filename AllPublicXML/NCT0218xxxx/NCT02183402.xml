  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of
      digoxin with and without co-administration of BI 1356. Additionally the steady state
      pharmacokinetics of BI 1356 when co-administered with digoxin will be determined.
