      Background: The increase in life expectancy and the rise in the ratio of older to younger
      people in the population has resulted in an increase in the number of those suffering from a
      decrease in cognitive ability, such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Methylphenidate can
      improve cognitive ability, mainly in memory and executive function.

      Working hypothesis and aims:

      This study examines the effect of Ritalin treatment in older people suffering from MCI. Our
      hypothesis is that treatment with Ritalin will improve cognitive function in those suffering
      from MCI, especially in the domains of attention and executive function.

      Methods A randomized, double-blind, case-control study. 120 patients older than 65 years of
      age diagnosed as suffering from MCI in the past year in geriatric assessment facilities in
      Beersheva. Patients will be randomized in equal groups to either the study group (Ritalin
      treatment) and control group (placebo). Each participant will attend the geriatric unit for
      four consecutive days: on the day prior to beginning the intervention participants will
      undergo cognitive assessment at 9:00 am. On the intervention days (days 2-4) participants
      will undergo cognitive assessment at 9:00 in the morning, followed by the administration (at
      10:30) of different doses of Ritalin (10, 20 and 30mg) every day of intervention.
      Participants in the control group will receive placebo. Two hours after taking the drug or
      placebo participants in both groups will be assessed cognitively by means of Mindstreams and
      MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment).

      Expected results: Ritalin treatment will improve the cognitive function of the subjects,
      mainly in the domains of concentration and executive function
