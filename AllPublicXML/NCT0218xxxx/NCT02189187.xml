  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to characterize changes in emotion regulation pathways associated
      with healthy behaviors in people who have recently lost weight and are seeking to maintain
      weight loss over a 1-year period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unhealthy behaviors such as overeating and a sedentary lifestyle are largely responsible for
      overweight and obesity which substantially increase risk for chronic conditions such as heart
      disease, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, arthritis and certain cancers. The rapid rise
      in obesity threatens to reverse recent gains in life expectancy and account for a large
      percentage of premature deaths in the U.S. Although there is evidence for the short-term
      efficacy of a number of methods for initiating health behavior change to lose weight, these
      interventions have shown only limited ability to affect significant, long-term behavioral
      changes in the majority of adults. In part this may be because they fail to adequately
      address how psychological factors that lead to relapse to unhealthy behaviors and failure to
      maintain long-term behavior change.

      The purpose of the study is to understand brain changes that accompany participation in
      programs that foster healthy behaviors in people seeking to maintain weight loss. We will use
      MRI scans to study brain function in men and women 25-60 years old who have lost weight in
      the last year without surgery. Participants will be assigned to one of two programs to help
      them maintain weight loss and will be compensated for their time. Our goal is to gain a
      better understanding of the brain changes that lead to long-term success in keeping weight
      off, in the hope that this knowledge will assist in the development of improved treatments.
