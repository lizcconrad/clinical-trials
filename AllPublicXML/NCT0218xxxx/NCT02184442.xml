      The purpose of this post approval study is to determine the safety, effectiveness and
      learning curve of the SAPIEN™ THV with the Retroflex delivery system for Inoperable Patients
      and with the SAPIEN™ THV with Retroflex and Ascendra delivery systems for high risk operable
      patients with Severe Symptomatic Native Aortic Stenosis via all access sites.

      The following concerns will be addressed in this trial: 1) long term (5 year) valve implant
      durability with echocardiography, 2) long-term (5 year) quality of life assessment with
      KCCQ-12 instrument, 3) assessment of learning curve in the post approval setting (utilizing
      the VARC composite for procedural success as a benchmark), 4) assessment of adherence to
      label indication in the post approval setting (using assessment of baseline characteristics)
      and 5) assessment of stroke in the post approval setting. Study patients will undergo
      clinical follow-up at discharge, 30 days, 1 year and then annually for a minimum of 5 years
      (TVT national registry-CMS Linkage).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must meet the fundamental enrollment criteria of severe, symptomatic,
             calcific aortic stenosis with quantifiable and documented source records

          -  Upon meeting these eligibility criteria, the heart team shall then determine the
             patient's risk for operative morbidity and mortality

          -  Details of eligibility including contraindications are provided in the product
             Instructions for Use which are included with each SAPIEN™ THV and delivery system.
