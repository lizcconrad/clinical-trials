  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the precise etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still unknown, over the
      last decade active research allowed to gain more precise insights in the pathophysiology of
      IBD indicating that the chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa is directed against the
      microbiota of the gut in particularly susceptible individuals. Genetic studies and more
      recently genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have allowed to identify over 70
      susceptibility genes which confer an increased risk of developing IBD. In the last years the
      attention of researchers has shifted to the identification of the early immunological changes
      that occur already at a preclinical stage of the disease, trying also at identifying the
      disease before it shows itself. Recently, the ability of a combination of serological markers
      in predicting the development of IBD has been demonstrated in adults. However, there are no
      studies evaluating a cohort of children at high risk for the disease, in whom the first
      immunological changes underlying the development of IBD could be studied, including a
      combination of genetic, serological, fecal and clinical markers.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate in a population genetically well-characterized, as
      siblings and twins of patients affected with IBD, early genetic, serologic, fecal and
      clinical markers of disease, which may be present even years before developing the disease.
      The identification of these markers in predisposed individuals could help to implement
      strategies for prevention or early treatment to modify the natural history of IBD.

      This is a multicenter, prospective, study evaluating the role of serological, genetic, fecal
      and clinical markers in predicting the development of IBD in a high risk population. The
      study will be divided in two phases. In the first phase the prevalence of genetic, serologic,
      fecal, clinical risk factors in 100 siblings of children affected with IBD compared to 100
      healthy children with no family history for IBD will be evaluated. The estimated duration of
      the first phase of the study is 12 months. In a second phase, a long-term follow-up (5 years)
      will be performed in order to evaluate the accidental cases of IBD in this population.
