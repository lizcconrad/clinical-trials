  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension has become a public health concern worldwide due to its significant contribution
      to the global health burden and its role as a prominent risk factor for the development of a
      number of chronic diseases such as Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), the leading cause of
      mortality in Pakistan and Worldwide. According to WHO, about 7.5 million deaths worldwide is
      attributable to hypertension i.e. about 12.8% of the total of all deaths. This accounts for
      57 million disability adjusted life years (DALYS) or 3.7% of total DALYS.

      Studies suggest that hypertension is among the top five most common presenting complaints to
      private general practice clinics. Therefore, primary care physicians/Family physicians are
      the first line service providers and; thus it is important to manage hypertensive patients
      early, through lifestyle and treatment interventions that may prevent the complications such
      as development of CVDs etc.

      To the best of authors' knowledge limited evidence is available from Pakistan on management
      of hypertension through an integrated approach. Therefore, the aim of the trial is to develop
      a health delivery system that effectively manages hypertension at primary care level.

      Hypothesis: The development of an integrated management approach will be effective in
      managing hypertension at all levels among hypertensive patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals aged 40 years or over visiting the selected IMS centre with known
             hypertension or with consistently elevated BP on two separate visits (mean of last two
             of three measurements of systolic pressure ≥140 mm Hg or mean diastolic pressure ≥90
             mm Hg) or already receiving treatment will be eligible for inclusion in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those patients who require intensive care unit or coronary care unit admissions, or
             are diagnosed to have cognitive impairment, are agitated due to severe pain,
             non-resident of Karachi, or having language barrier will be excluded from the study.

          -  A screening form will be designed for the collection of the above mentioned
             information. The rationale of excluding all the participants with above mentioned
             condition is that the participants having these health concerns will either not be
             able to respond to our questionnaire or their presence may confound our results.
