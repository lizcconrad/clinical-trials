  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD is often associated with the airflow limitation and the pulmonary hyperinflation. During
      the one-lung ventilation (OLV), COPD patients' physiologic dead space increases and
      hypercapnia may develop. In addition, an alveolar overdistention by the pulmonary
      hyperinflation would divert pulmonary blood flow and impair arterial oxygenation.
      Dexmedetomidine has both vasoconstricting and vasodilatatory effects on a peripheral
      vasculature and a smooth muscle but its effects on bronchial smooth muscle is unknown. The
      investigators will evaluate the effects of dexmedetomidine (bolus of 1.0 μg kg-1 over 10 min
      followed by a continuous infusion at 0.5 μg kg-1 h-1 infusion during one-lung ventilation) as
      bronchodilator in COPD patients when administered during surgery with the one lung
      ventilation. If result successfully shows the effect of dexmedetomidine as a predominantly a
      vasodilator on bronchial tree, the investigators study can support the dexmedetomidine as a
      vasodilator for pulmonary vessels and bronchial smooth muscle and as an excellent adjunct to
      anesthetic agents in COPD patients during the OLV.
