  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is widely considered to be the gold standard in the surgical
      management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) that has failed maximal medical therapy.
      Nevertheless, the postoperation medical therapy was considered as a crucial procedure for the
      success of ESS. Both glucocorticoids and macrolide antibiotics have been recommended for the
      treatment of CRS, but their effect as postoperation medical therapies of ESS need more
      clinical data to clarify.

      The purpose of this prospective, randomized,study is to determine the effect of
      glucocorticoids and macrolide antibiotics for the postoperation medical therapy of ESS in
      different subtypes of CRS.
