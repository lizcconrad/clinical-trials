      This study will use retrospective data to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OZURDEX®
      (dexamethasone intravitreal implant 0.7 mg) in the treatment of macular oedema due to retinal
      vein occlusion (RVO) in clinical practice. No intervention will be administered as part of
      this study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 to 12 weeks following the first OZURDEX® injection</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA is measured in the study eye following each injection of OZURDEX® using a special eye chart. The number of letters read correctly Snellen fraction are converted to a decimal scale. There are 11 lines on a standard Snellen chart ranging from 0.1 (20/200) at worst to 2.0 (20/10) at best. 20/20 on the decimal scale is equal to 1.0. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart (lower number on the decimal scale) the worse the vision (or visual acuity). The higher the number of letters read correctly (higher number on the decimal scale), the better the vision (or visual acuity). A positive number improvement in the number of letters read means that the vision has improved.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With an Increase of 2 Lines or More in BCVA in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 17 Months</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA following the injection of OZURDEX® is measured in the study eye using a special eye chart. BCVA measurements expressed in Snellen fractions were converted to logMAR units and approximate Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letter scores based on the formula: approximate ETDRS letters = 85 + 50 x log10 (Snellen fraction). The converted scores hereinafter are referred to as &quot;approxETDRS letters&quot; to distinguish the scores from visual acuity measurements obtained using the ETDRS chart. It was assumed that one line equals five ETDRS points. An increase of 2 lines or more indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>BCVA following the injection of OZURDEX® is measured in the study eye using a special eye chart. BCVA measurements expressed in Snellen fractions were converted to logMAR units and approximate ETDRS letter scores based on the formula: approximate ETDRS letters = 85 + 50 x log10 (Snellen fraction). The converted scores hereinafter are referred to as “approxETDRS letters” to distinguish the scores from visual acuity measurements obtained using the ETDRS chart. It was assumed that one line equals five ETDRS points. An increase of 3 lines or more indicates an improvement.</description>
