  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhalants substance misuse is an important public health problem whose prevalence is
      approximately 1% in the general population and 7% among high school students in Mexico.
      Furthermore Inhalants substance misuse has increased in the recent years (Villatoro et al.,
      2011). According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition
      (DSM-5) inhalant use disorder is a problematic pattern of use of a hydrocarbon-based inhalant
      substance leading to clinically significant impairment or distress. There are studies to
      suggest that long-term exposure to inhalants is associated with structural brain
      abnormalities, as well as neuropsychological impairments. However many of these studies have
      been limited to the gross anatomical report, therefore is necessary the use of complimentary
      techniques which provide a better understanding of brain. To the date there is no evidence of
      the use of positron emission tomography, and there are few studies have employed other
      magnetic resonance imaging methodologies such as diffusion tensor imaging that can be used to
      know the metabolic activity and white matter tract integrity respectively in inhalant use
      disorder participants. The purpose of this study is evaluates the effects of the inhalant use
      disorder in the brain. The investigators will be using positron emission tomography (PET),
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). As well as, this study
      will examine the impact of inhalants consumption on executive function performance and the
      transcriptomic changes associated with inhalants consumption. The investigators hope that the
      data gathered from this study will lead to the development of more effective treatments
