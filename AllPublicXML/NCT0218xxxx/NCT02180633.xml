  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A macular hole is a rupture in the macula. In terms of pathogenesis, as much as 80% are
      idiopathic (Idiopathic Macular Hole, IMH). The normal incidence of this condition is about
      0.17%; however, there is a 10-29% chance of development of a macular hole in the fellow eye
      of patients suffering from unilateral macular hole.

      Our hypothesis is that embedded in the topography of the retina is information that can allow
      for discrimination between healthy eyes and eyes with an increased risk of developing IMH. As
      such, our work aims to develop a system that allows the automatic identification of these
      eyes.

    <textblock>
      A macular hole is a rupture in the macula, the central portion of the retina, responsible for
      sharp, central vision and hence indispensable for most tasks. In terms of pathogenesis, even
      though some can be related to trauma, as much as 80% are idiopathic (Idiopathic Macular Hole,
      IMH). It is theorized that antero-posterior and tangential forces are behind this condition;
      however, no conclusions have been reached. While the normal incidence of this condition is
      about 0.17%, there is a 10-29% chance of developing a macular hole in the fellow eye of
      patients suffering from unilateral macular hole.

      Our working hypothesis is that embedded in the topography of the retina is information that
      can allow for discrimination between healthy eyes and eyes with an increased risk of
      developing IMH. As such, our study consists on the characterisation of the retinal topography
      of fellow eyes of patients with unilateral IMH but no other visible retinal pathologies, and
      of eyes from controls subjects in the same approximate age group. From these topographic maps
      we acquire a series of features (parameters), and using machine learning techniques create a
      system that separates eyes into one of the groups - healthy or at risk.
