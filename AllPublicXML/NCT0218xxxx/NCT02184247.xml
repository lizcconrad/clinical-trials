      Study to compare the bioavailability of 350 mg Bronchoretard速 - a sustained-release
      theophylline (anhydrous) product with respect to the reference product, Theo Dur速 300 mg
      theophylline anhydrous (sustained-release product) by comparing the rate and extent of
      absorption of theophylline based on both single and multiple-dose profiles.

          -  Healthy, non-smoking male subjects between 18 and 45 years of age

          -  Body weight within 10% of the ideal weight according to the Body Mass Index (BMI)

          -  Normal health based on medical history and findings within the range of clinical
             acceptability, in respect of the physical examination (including electrocardiogram and
             vital signs) and special investigations

          -  Ability to comprehend and willingness to sign both statements of informed consent (for
             screening and study-specific procedures)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of serious systemic or organ disease

          -  A major illness during the 3 months before commencement of the study-related
             procedures

          -  Significant physical or organ abnormality

          -  History of hypersensitivity to theophylline or other xanthine derivatives

             first administration of study medication

          -  Treatment within the previous 3 months with any drug with a well-defined potential for
             adversely affecting a major organ or system (for example chloramphenicol, which may
             cause bone marrow suppression)

          -  Donation of blood during the 8 weeks before the first administration of study
             medication

          -  History of, or current compulsive alcohol abuse (&gt; 10 drinks per week), of regular
