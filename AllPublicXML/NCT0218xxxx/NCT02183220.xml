  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a single
      peroral dose of 0.5 g and 1.0 g metamizol relative to placebo and 1.0 g acetylsalicylic acid
      in 2 episodes of moderate tension headache.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients between 18 and 65 years old

          -  Moderate episodic tension headache according to International Headache Society
             (I.H.S.) classification 2.1 (2.1.1 and 2.1.2) for at least one year

          -  At least two episodes of tension headache per month in the last three months prior to
             enrolment into this trial

          -  The episodes of tension headaches were usually treated by the patient successfully
             with a non-opioid-analgesic

          -  First episodic headache occurred at an age under 50 years

          -  Written informed consent according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local
             regulations

          -  The patient was able to fill in the Patient's Diary

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient usually needs for successful treatment of tension headache &quot;Over The
             Counter&quot; (OTC) analgesic in doses exceeding the doses tested here

          -  The patient takes an OTC-analgesic normally at the first signs of an episode of
             tension headache

          -  The patient has more than 15 episodes of tension headache per month

          -  Female patients whose episodic tension headache is strongly correlated with the start
             of hormonal contraception

          -  Concomitant treatment with (non-) prescriptional analgesics

          -  Pre- (less than 4 weeks prior to inclusion in this trial) and/or concomitant treatment
             with an antidepressive and/or antipsychotic drug

          -  Pre- (less than 2 weeks prior to inclusion in this trial) and/or concomitant treatment
             with any drug such as NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs), propanolol,
             metroprolol, flunarizin, cyclandelate, valproic-acid, serotonergic antagonists,
             ergotamine, dihydroergotamines and benzodiazepines that may influence the headache
             symptomatology

          -  Use of benzodiazepines in the previous 24 hours to the administration of the study
             drug. Occasional use of benzodiazepines - up to 3 per week - is allowed

          -  Use of any drug with analgesic properties in the previous 24 hours to the
             administration of the study drug

          -  Concomitant treatment with any drug containing ASA and/or metamizol

          -  Concomitant treatment with anticoagulants such as heparin or coumarin-derivatives

          -  Alcohol and drug abuse according to DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
             Mental Disorders )

          -  Female patients in child-bearing age not using adequate means of birth control

          -  Pregnancy and/or lactation

          -  Liver and/or renal disease

          -  Bronchial asthma

          -  Relevant allergy or known hypersensitivity to the investigational drugs, its
             excipients and/or to other NSAIDs

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within the last 4 weeks and concurrent
             participation in another clinical trial

          -  Patients with active gastroesophageal flux disease (Amendment number 1)

          -  Concomitant treatment with analgesics or any other drug that may have influenced the
             headache symptomatology - including metamizol or ASA -, was referred to its use during
             the headache episodes under evaluation. As long as appropriate wash-out periods were
             respected, analgesics were allowed in between the episodes of tension headache (TH)
             and their use as a rescue medication did not lead to the exclusion of the patient
             (Amendment number 2)
