    <textblock>
      1 out of 8 children, adolescents, and young adults suffer from an anxiety disorder. Studies
      over the past decade show that selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a class of
      medication that treats anxiety in adults, also works well in young adults, children, and
      adolescents with anxiety disorders, but only for about 50%. 50% will have undergone treatment
      for several months before it will be established that the medication is not working to treat
      the anxiety. The purpose of this study is to find a test that will predict treatment outcome
      from the beginning based on behavioral and biological measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current evidence based psychiatric treatment for child, adolescent, and young adult anxiety
      disorders involves a trial and error process. Pediatric psychiatrists start with the first
      line treatments (i.e. SSRI or psychotherapy), which requires from 4-8 weeks to work. There is
      a long interval between treatment initiation and response with only 50 to 60% likelihood that
      the treatment chosen will succeed in reducing anxiety symptoms. The science that will enable
      us to predict who will respond to medication treatment does not exist. Studies have
      demonstrated a correlation between cellular markers in white blood cells and psychiatric
      disorders suggesting that certain genes may also change their expression in peripheral cells
      in response to treatment of psychiatric disorders. Several studies report a significant
      decrease in expression of key genes that are involved in the pathophysiology of anxiety and
      depression in the brain, such as BDNF, CREB and HDAC5 levels in leukocytes of people with
      mood and anxiety disorders. The levels of BDNF, HDAC5 and CREB in white blood cells then
      respond to treatment and match that of controls after treatment with SSRIs. The increased
      accessibility to sequencing technology allows us to survey many more potential biomarkers
      than what was possible just several years ago. This may enable us to formulate a test that
      will predict, based on biocellular markers, treatment outcome in anxiety disorders for
      children, adolescents, and young adults before the onset of treatment. By finding molecular
      markers that can predict treatment success from the onset, the investigators can improve
      treatment outcomes considerably compared to current standard treatment practices. This kind
      of personalized medicine is the future of psychiatry.

    <description>Sertraline, Fluoxetine, or Escitalopram will be administered PO to treat anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. One of the following dosing schedules will be used:
Sertraline will be titrated from 25mg once a day orally up to 200mg once a day orally, for 12 weeks, or
Fluoxetine will be titrated from 10mg once a day orally up to 40mg once a day orally, for 12 weeks or
Escitalopram will be titrated from 10mg once a day orally up to 40mg once a day orally, for 12 weeks.
The titration will stop at the dose in which the participant shows a full response to the medication or experiences side effects that will inhibit titration.</description>
