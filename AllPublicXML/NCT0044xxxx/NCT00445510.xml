        Inclusion: (All must Apply)

          -  Males and females aged 18 to 55 years inclusive.

          -  Documented history of bronchial asthma, first diagnosed at least 6 months prior to the
             screening visit and currently being treated only with intermittent short-acting beta
             -agonist therapy by inhalation.

          -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 &gt;75% of predicted at screening.

          -  Documented sensitivity to AMP with a provocative concentration of AMP resulting in a
             20% fall in FEV1 (PC20 AMP) of &lt;80 mg/ml at the screening visit.

          -  Demonstrate stable bronchoconstriction in response to inhaled AMP at the run-in visit.
             'Stable bronchoconstriction' is a term to define a population of asthmatics who have a
             repeatable and reproducible response to a challenge agent that induces
             bronchoconstriction. The run-in PC20 needs to be within 1.25DD of the screening PC20.

          -  Non-smoking status as verified by urinary cotinine levels below 300 ng/mL cotinine at
             the screening visit. This can include ex-smokers who have given up smoking for &gt;6
             months and have less than a 5 pack-year smoking history.

          -  Able and willing to give written informed consent to take part in the study.

          -  Available to complete all study measurements.

        Exclusion:

          -  Pregnant or nursing females.

          -  Past or present disease, which as judged by the investigator, may affect the outcome
             of this study.

          -  Subject has known history of hypertension or is hypertensive at screening.

          -  Respiratory tract infection and/or exacerbation of asthma within 4 weeks prior to the
             first dose of study medication.

          -  History of life-threatening asthma, defined as an asthma episode that required
             intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnoea, respiratory arrest and/or hypoxic
             seizures.

          -  Unable to abstain from prescription medication, other than short acting inhaled
             beta-agonists and paracetamol for the treatment of minor ailments eg headache from 48h
             before the first dose until the follow-up visit.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial during the previous 3 months.

          -  History of blood donation (450 mL) within 2 months of starting the clinical study.

          -  The subject regularly drinks more than 28 units of alcohol in a week if male, or 21
             units per week if female.

          -  The subject has tested positive for hepatitis C antibody or hepatitis B surface
             antigen or HIV antibodies.

          -  The subject has positive drugs of abuse test.

          -  Subjects weighing less than 50kg are to be excluded from participating in the study.
