  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fish from the aquaculture sector constitutes an increasing part of the fish consumption in
      Denmark. The most important farmed fish in Denmark is the rainbow trout. Due to limited
      access of wild fish for the feed production, alternative feeding regimes of vegetable origin
      such as vegetable proteins and rapeseed oil are used instead of marine feed. This change in
      feeding regime may affect flesh quality and health and nutritional properties as the content
      of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) will presumably decrease in the
      meat. The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of vegetable based feed versus
      marine feed of farmed trout and its effect in healthy men on cardiovascular risk markers
      associated with the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a two month parallel study including 60 healthy men aged 40-70 years, the cardiovascular
      effect of one daily meal of trout fed with a vegetable based feed are compared with that of
      trout fed with marine feed (estimated intake of n-3 LCPUFA 2.6 g/day) and a standard Danish
      diet with poultry. Men are randomised to one of the three groups. Red blood cell fatty acid
      composition, classical cardiovascular disease (CVD)-risk markers (blood pressure and plasma
      lipid profile), newer CVD-markers (arterial compliance and plasma markers of endothelial
      function and inflammation) and plasma proteome analysis are measured at the beginning and end
      of the intervention period.
