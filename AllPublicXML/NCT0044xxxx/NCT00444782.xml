    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of GV1001 in locally advanced or
      metastatic HCC. Also the safety of GV1001 and immunogenicity will be evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis fulfilling one of the following criteria (as per
             the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [AASLD] guidelines, see
             Appendix 5):

               1. Nodule in a cirrhotic or non-cirrhotic liver with a biopsy showing HCC;

               2. Nodule in cirrhotic liver where no biopsy is performed:

                    -  Nodules between 1-2 cm in a cirrhotic liver with a typical coincidal
                       vascular pattern of HCC (i.e. hypervascular with washout in the
                       portal/venous phase) in two dynamic studies: either CT scan, contrast
                       ultrasound or MRI with contrast.

                    -  Nodule larger than 2 cm in a cirrhotic liver with a typical vascular pattern
                       of HCC on a dynamic imaging technique.

        Please note: HCC in a non-cirrhotic liver can only be diagnosed with a biopsy showing HCC.

          -  Measurable disease according to modified RECIST (see Appendix 7).

          -  At least one treatment-naïve target lesion (treatment-naïve being defined as not
             having been treated with local therapy, such as surgery, radiation therapy, hepatic
             arterial embolisation, chemoembolisation, radio-frequency ablation or cryo-ablation).

          -  Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A, B or C (see Appendix 6) (Stage D is
             excluded).

          -  Child-Pugh stage A (see Appendix 8).

          -  Male or female aged 18 years or older.

          -  Adequate haematological parameters, as demonstrated by:

               -  Haemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL (SI units: 5.6 mmol/L);

               -  WBC greater than or equal to 3.0 x 109/L;

               -  Platelets greater than or equal to 75 x 109/L.

          -  ALT and AST ≤ 5 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dL.

          -  Serum creatinine smaller than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL (SI units: 132 µmol/L).

          -  Performance status ECOG 0 or 1.

          -  Minimum life expectancy of 3 months at screening.

          -  Written informed consent given prior to any study specific procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  HCC amenable to curative treatment or transplantation.

          -  History of other malignancies in the last 5 years (10 years in the case of breast
             cancer), except for adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancers (Basal Cell
             Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma) and carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Known history of or co-existing autoimmune disease.

          -  Known Central Nervous System (CNS) metastases.

          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may compromise the
             compliance of the patient to receive study treatment and follow study procedures.

          -  Treatment with any other IMP within 4 weeks prior to cyclophosphamide administration
             at Day -3.

          -  Known sensitivity to any components of cyclophosphamide, GV1001 or GM-CSF.

          -  Concomitant treatment with the following within 4 weeks of pre-treatment with
             cyclophosphamide:

               -  Anti-tumour treatment (including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
                  endocrine therapy, cytokines, interferons, protease inhibitors, and gene therapy)
                  and vaccines.

               -  Chronic corticosteroids (inhaled and topical steroids are permitted including low
                  dose steroids at non-immunosuppressive doses e.g. 15 mg prednisolone daily for up
                  to 7 days).

               -  Herbal medicine either containing hypericum perforacum (e.g., St Johns Wort) or
                  claiming to have anti-tumour effects (e.g., Iscador).

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Women of childbearing potential not using reliable and adequate contraceptive methods,
             defined as the use of oral, implanted, injectable, mechanical or barrier products for
             the prevention of pregnancy; or women who are practising abstinence; or where the
             partner is sterile, for example a vasectomy.

          -  Unable for any other reason to comply with the protocol (treatment or assessments).
