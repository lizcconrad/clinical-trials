  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current knowledge of the pathophysiology of allergic contact dermatitis is based on the
      murine model. In this model, CD8+ T cells are effector cells, and CD4+ T cells regulate the
      response by limiting the expansion of CD8+ T cells. The goal of this study is to characterize
      the pathophysiology of contact dermatitis, with patients allergic to para-phenylenediamine
      (PPD).

      We suppose that the CD8+ T cells are the effectors of the allergic contact dermatitis,
      although the regulator cells belong to the LT CD4+ population. We will test our hypothesis on
      blood samples, and cutaneous biopsies of patients allergic to PPD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For both groups:

          -  Patients aged from 18 to 65 years old.

          -  Both genders eligible for study.

          -  Female participants must use a contraceptive method.

          -  Feasibility of patch testing.

          -  Participants must be able to understand and sign the Informed Consent, and comply with
             all aspects of the protocol.

          -  Patients must be registered in a social security system or with a health insurance
             coverage

              First group: allergic patients

          -  Patients with allergic contact dermatitis to para-phenylenediamine (PPD) based on a
             history of PPD contact dermatitis and positive PPD patch tests.

              Second group : healthy volunteers

          -  No history of PPD allergic contact dermatitis, with a negative PPD patch test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Evolutive skin disease on the testing zone (lower back).

          -  Patients with a clinically significant disease (chronic, recurrent or active).

          -  Systemic corticotherapy or immunosuppressive treatment during the previous month, or
             local corticoid treatment the week before the patch testing.

          -  Local or systemic drug use which interacts with the outcome measures.

          -  Exposure to sun or UV radiations, 15 days before the patch testing.

          -  Patients deprived of their civic rights, in custody, or subject to a tutorial,
             judiciary or administrative decision.

          -  Patients subject to a protection measure.

          -  Patients in a critical medical situation.

          -  Patients with a personal situation judged by the investigator as unlikely to be
             compatible with optimal participation in the study, or which could constitute a risk
             for the patient.

          -  Linguistic barrier or psychological profile preventing the patient from signing the
             consent form.

          -  Patient still in an exclusion period following the participation in another clinical
             trial.

          -  Patients having earned more than 4500€ in indemnities for participation in clinical
             trials during the previous 12 months, including this study.
