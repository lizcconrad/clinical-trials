  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      3054 diabetic patients were screened for Haptoglobin Phenotype as part of the ICARE study
      (NCT00220831) and composite the I CARE Registry, 1434 Hp 2-2 patients were treated as part of
      the I CARE study with vitamin E vs. Placebo, this study was recently terminated due to
      significant differences between the groups and data was sent to publication. All other
      patients were passively followed since April 2005 for cardiovascular events. We have decided
      to continue and follow these patients till end of December 2007 to determine the incidence of
      CVD in theses patients which are pre stratified by Haptoglobin Phenotype.

      3054 diabetic patients from Clalit Medical Services were screened for Haptoglobin Phenotype
      as part of the ICARE study (NCT00220831) and composite the I CARE registry, 1434 Hp 2-2
      patients were treated as part of the I CARE study with vitamin E vs. Placebo, this study was
      recently terminated due to significant differences between the groups and data was sent to
      publication.

      During the follow up period of the I CARE study all 3054 registry patients were followed in a
      passive way, which means that the patients were not called for follow up visits but the
      reports for CVD events were centrally collected from patient's Hospital admission summaries.
      Admission summaries were collected using the computerized systems of the Clalit Health
      Services assuring that when ever a patient in the registry is hospitalized for what ever
      reason the study coordination them would be aware of that and receive the admission summary.
      An events adjudication committee adjudicated each event in a blinded fashion to determine the
      nature of the events.

      1434 patients who were treated by vitamin E or placebo in the I CARE study were also followed
      by follow-up telephone calls.

      once I CARE study was officially terminated we have decided to continue and follow the whole
      3054 registry patients in the same manner to complete a nearly 3 year follow up to determine
      in a prospective manner the incidence of CVD events in Diabetic patients which were
      pre-stratified by Haptoglobin type.
