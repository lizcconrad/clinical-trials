  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multisystem, autoimmune disease in which the
      body's immune system attacks its own normal tissues. This abnormal autoimmune response can
      result in damage to many parts of the body, including the skin, joints, lungs, heart, brain,
      intestines, and kidneys. Kidney problems occur in 60-75 % of lupus patients. The development
      of lupus-related kidney disease (called lupus nephritis) is associated with an overall worse
      prognosis.

      SLE is usually treated with drugs that try to block inflammation caused by the immune system.
      These treatments can create their own problems and they do not cure lupus. The drugs that are
      often used to treat lupus nephritis include prednisone (steroids), cyclophosphamide
      (Cytoxan), azathioprine (AZA or Imuran), and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF or Cellcept). The
      main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of etanercept compared
      to placebo in combination with standard of care to treat individuals with active lupus
      nephritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kidney problems associated with lupus nephritis range from asymptomatic protein in the urine
      to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, leading to end-stage renal disease. The goal of
      therapies is to control kidney manifestations in order to avoid kidney failure, the
      occurrence of other medical problems and death.

      The treatment of lupus nephritis remains problematic. Despite the use of currently available
      therapies, patients experience disease relapse. Over time, patients develop significant
      morbidity from the disease as well as from medications used for treatment.

      Etanercept, a TNF inhibitor, is proposed as a potential treatment for lupus nephritis. TNF
      increases the number of reactive B and T cells. TNF levels can be elevated in lupus.
      Etanercept is believed to work by blocking inflammation, and it is hoped that it will lessen
      the signs and symptoms of lupus-related kidney disease.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of etanercept compared
      to placebo in combination with standard therapy to treat individuals with mild or moderately
      active lupus nephritis.

      This study will last 1 year. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either
      etanercept or placebo in addition to their regular medications. Participants will
      self-administer 50 mg etanercept or placebo injections once a week. They will continue
      receiving their usual treatment with corticosteroids and either MMF, Mycophenolic Acid, or
      AZA. Treatment with study medication will occur for 24 weeks.

      There will be a screening visit followed by a randomization visit, where subjects will
      receive and learn how to administer the study drug. Subjects will come to the clinic for 9
      study visits. A physical exam and blood and urine collection will occur at most study visits.
      Participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire on their health at most study
      visits. Subjects will be contacted by phone 5 times during the 24-week period to assess for
      adverse events and worsening disease status.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 39 (Early Study Withdrawal Visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Reported here is the baseline and week 39 Systematic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores. The SLEDAI is a concise measure of lupus disease activity with excellent test-retest reliability and high responsiveness to clinically important changes in the disease. The total score is derived from ratings on 24 conditions plus the Physician's Global Assessment; 0 indicates inactive disease and the maximum theoretical score is 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity.</description>

    <description>Reported here is the number of participants with a change in their BILAG Mucocutaneous Score from C (at baseline) to B (at week 24). A single alphabetic score (A through E) is used to denote disease severity. The BILAG score is a converted numerical score (A=9, B=3, C=1, D=0, E=0). A maximum mucocutaneous score of 9 signifies higher disease activity and a score of 0 is indicative of inactive systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the specified organ system.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Reported here is the participant baseline and week 24 SF-36 Physical Component scores. The SF-36 measures 8 domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, body pain, social functioning, mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, and general health perceptions[1]. The Physical Component scores of the SF-36 range from 0 to 100; 0 equals worst health state. Higher numbers reported here indicate more improvement in condition from baseline.

The first site (UCSF) was activated on 1 Feb 2008. The remaining 5 sites (Feinstein, Rochester, Colorado, Duke, and UAB) were activated over the next year.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The participant signed an informed consent before study screening procedures commenced to assess eligibility criteria (lupus diagnosis with active nephritis, positive ANA, presence of dsDNA antibodies, and stable medication regimens of either mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, CellCept®, Myfortic®) or azathioprine at the screening visit.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Participant Systematic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) Score at Baseline and at Early Study Withdrawal Visit</title>
        <description>Reported here is the baseline and week 39 Systematic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores. The SLEDAI is a concise measure of lupus disease activity with excellent test-retest reliability and high responsiveness to clinically important changes in the disease. The total score is derived from ratings on 24 conditions plus the Physician's Global Assessment; 0 indicates inactive disease and the maximum theoretical score is 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity.</description>

        <description>Reported here is the number of participants with a change in their BILAG Mucocutaneous Score from C (at baseline) to B (at week 24). A single alphabetic score (A through E) is used to denote disease severity. The BILAG score is a converted numerical score (A=9, B=3, C=1, D=0, E=0). A maximum mucocutaneous score of 9 signifies higher disease activity and a score of 0 is indicative of inactive systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the specified organ system.</description>

        <description>Reported here is the participant baseline and week 24 SF-36 Physical Component scores. The SF-36 measures 8 domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, body pain, social functioning, mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, and general health perceptions[1]. The Physical Component scores of the SF-36 range from 0 to 100; 0 equals worst health state. Higher numbers reported here indicate more improvement in condition from baseline.
