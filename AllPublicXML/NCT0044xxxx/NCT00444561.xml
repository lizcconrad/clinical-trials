    <textblock>
      This exploratory study is designed to evaluate various pharmacodynamic effects of
      subcutaneously (SC) infused or injected pramlintide in obese, nondiabetic male and
      postmenopausal female (not on hormone replacement therapy) subjects. The study will also
      assess the safety and tolerability of pramlintide administered by SC infusion or injection.

    <description>Pramlintide acetate (AC137) injection is a clear, colorless, sterile solution for SC administration. It consists of pramlintide in sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 43 mg/mL mannitol as an osmolality modifier and 2.25 mg/mL metacresol as a preservative. The concentration of pramlintide injection to be used in this study is 0.6 mg/mL.</description>
