    <textblock>
      This study is a cross sectional observational study to evaluate the prevalence of HLA-B*5701
      in the major French ethnotypes.

      Any HIV-1 infected subject will be eligible for this study including antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) na√É-ve and experienced subjects irrespective of abacavir use, as well as subjects
      previously tested for HLA-B*5701. Subjects will be approached during a standard clinic visit,
      and all subjects will be consented prior to any study specific procedure. Subjects will be
      asked to provide a tissue sample (cheek cells and blood sample) which will be used to assess
      HLA-B*5701 status by central and local methodologies.

    <description>Tissue sample (cheek cells and blood sample) were collected from the participants to assess HLA-B*5701 status using centralized screening assay in the centralized laboratory.The prevalence was calculated as the ratio of the number of participants with HLA-B*5701 positive divided by the total number of participants with available HLAB*5701 result multiplied by 100.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants attended a single visit where an assessment of the participant's demographic background (age, sex , mode of HIV transmission, ethnicity, country of origin and parental country of origin) was conducted, and tissue samples (buccal cells and blood sample) were collected to determine the presence of HLA-B*5701 genotype by both central and local laboratories using centralized screening assay. The prevalence was calculated as the ratio of the number of participants with HLA-B*5701 positive divided by the total number of subjects with available HLAB*5701 result multiplied by 100. Data is presented for the prevalence of HLA-B*5701 in all the ethnotypes.</description>

    <description>Tissue sample (cheek cells and blood sample) were collected from the participants to assess HLA-B*5701 status using centralized screening assay in the local laboratory. The prevalence was calculated as the ratio of the number of participants with HLA-B*5701 positive divided by the total number of subjects with available HLAB*5701 result. According to local laboratory, participants with positive results have been summarized here.</description>
