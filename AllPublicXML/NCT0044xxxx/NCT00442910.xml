  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need for HIV prevention methods that women can initiate and control
      themselves. Topical microbicides, substances that kill microbes, represent one such method.
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and to evaluate the acceptability of 3% w/w
      SPL7013 gel, a topical microbicide, when administered intravaginally for 14 consecutive days
      in healthy, sexually active HIV uninfected women.

    <textblock>
      Women continue to comprise a growing proportion of the new HIV infections around the world. A
      growing body of data suggests that a safe and effective topical microbicide will be a real
      option of prevention for women in the future. The purpose of this study is to assess the
      safety and acceptability of 3% SPL7013 Gel when administered intravaginally, twice daily for
      14 consecutive days in healthy, sexually-active, HIV-uninfected women.

      The expected duration of this study for each participant is 21 days. Study participants will
      be randomly assigned to one of two arms. Participants in Arm 1 will apply 3.5 g of SPL7013
      gel intravaginally twice daily for 14 consecutive days. Participants in Arm 2 will apply a
      placebo gel intravaginally twice daily for 14 consecutive days. Starpharma produces SPL7013
      gel (VivaGel) and will provide it for this study.

      After enrollment, participants will attend three study visits. These visits will occur on
      Days 7, 14, and 21. A follow-up safety visit will occur if necessary. Medical and menstrual
      history, targeted physical exam, urine and blood collection, cervical swabs, and vaginal
      smears will occur at all visits. A colposcopy will occur at least once. On Day 2,
      participants will take part in a phone assessment.
