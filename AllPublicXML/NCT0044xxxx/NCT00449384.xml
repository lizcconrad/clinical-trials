      version of Severe Impairment Battery (SIB).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 60 persons with mild to severe dementia. To test the validation of
      SIB, we will interview the included persons with Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) and compare
      the results with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDV)reported by their nurses. To test interrater
      reliability 30 of the included persons will be interviewed with SIB by two different raters,
      and the two raters results will be compared.
