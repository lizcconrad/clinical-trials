      This study is a cross-sectional pilot study investigating the prevalence of psychiatric
      illness at various time points in the course of treatment of AIS. Three independent sets of
      questionnaires will be administered during a single scheduled clinical visit. There will be
      no clinical visits for the exclusive purpose of completing questionnaires. The first
      questionnaire will be the SRS outcome instrument. The second questionnaire will be the
      Achenbach YSR, completed by the adolescents, and the parents will be asked to complete the
      CBCL. Finally, a generic outcome measure specific to children and adolescents, the Pediatric
      Outcome Data Collection Instrument, will be administered. The time requirement to complete
      these questionnaires is anticipated to be approximately 45 minutes. The Achenbach
      questionnaires will be scored promptly after each is completed using the provided scoring
      templates. This data will be used to identify those at risk and make appropriate resources
      available. This would provide appropriate care for adolescents at high risk of mental health
      disorder by identifying those at risk via a non-invasive screening tool.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients diagnosed with AIS, between the ages of eleven and sixteen, who are
             scheduled to undergo surgical intervention, will be eligible to participate in the
             study. The patient and one parent will be required to complete the questionnaires in
             their entirety at the predetermined time points. There are several different methods
             of surgical intervention for AIS, however there will be no selection on the basis of
             the type of intervention. Curve pattern and severity will, similarly, not be used as
             inclusion criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All types of scoliosis besides AIS will be excluded. This includes neuromuscular,
             congenital, infantile idiopathic, and childhood idiopathic scoliosis.

          -  Children younger than eleven years or older than sixteen years will be excluded.

          -  Those with additional chronic disease will be excluded, due to the possibility of
             confounding.

          -  Those unable to complete the entire questionnaire, for any reason, or those unable to
             complete the questionnaires at each time point will be excluded.

          -  Existence of psychiatric disorder prior to treatment will not be cause for exclusion
             from the study.
