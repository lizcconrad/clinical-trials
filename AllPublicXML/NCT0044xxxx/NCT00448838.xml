      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may also stop the growth
      of pancreatic cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving cetuximab together with
      combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving cetuximab together with gemcitabine
      and oxaliplatin works in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients with locally advanced or metastatic
           pancreatic cancer treated with cetuximab, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the complete response and partial response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, pilot study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 8, gemcitabine hydrochloride IV
      over 100 minutes on day 1, and oxaliplatin IV over 2-4 hours on day 2. Treatment repeats
      every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
