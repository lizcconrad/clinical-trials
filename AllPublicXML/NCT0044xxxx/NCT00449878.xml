  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial which will evaluate the efficacy of Liprotamase treatment in cystic
      fibrosis (CF) patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (PI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is divided into four distinct periods:

        1. Baseline Period during which each patient is taken off pancreatic enzyme medications.

        2. An Open-Label Treatment Period during which all patients will receive ALTU-135
           (liprotamase).

        3. Inpatient, Double Blind Treatment Period during which half of patients will be withdrawn
           from treatment and will receive Placebo.

        4. Second Open-Label Treatment Period during which all patients will resume treatment with
           ALTU-135 (liprotamase).
