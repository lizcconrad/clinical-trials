  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption are at increased risk for adverse
      health consequences and have frequent visits to the Emergency Department(ED). Despite
      research that has demonstrated the prevalence of alcohol problems in ED patients, there are
      limited data on the effectiveness of brief intervention (BI) strategies for patients in this
      setting. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief
      intervention, termed Brief Negotiation Interview (BNI), provided by emergency practitioners
      (EPs-emergency physicians and physician assistants), in reducing alcohol consumption in ED
      patients with hazardous and harmful drinking. In a controlled randomized clinical trial of
      500 patients with hazardous and harmful drinking, BNI will be compared to scripted discharge
      instructions (DI). Three hypotheses will be tested: BNI is superior to DI in: 1) reducing
      alcohol consumption; 2) reducing the number of binge drinking episodes; and 3) increasing
      utilization of primary care or alcohol-related services. Alcohol consumption and utilization
      of primary care or alcohol-related services will be measured by self-report at 1,6 and 12
      months. An additional benefit to changing patterns of consumption and utilization of health
      services may be decreased ED visits and alcohol-related hospitalizations. These will be
      assessed utilizing a statewide database. In order to facilitate real-world application of BNI
      in the ED, the project will result in a BNI manual for EPs and an adherence and competence
      scale. Unique features of the current project as compared to earlier studies include: 1)use
      of a credible control condition; 2) enrollment of a heterogeneous population; 3)use of a
      manual-guided intervention by existing ED staff; 4)systematic assessment of adherence and
      competence to ensure quality administration and discriminability of interventions;
      5)monitoring of use of ancillary treatments; and 6)monitoring of repeat ED visits and
      alcohol-related hospitalizations.
