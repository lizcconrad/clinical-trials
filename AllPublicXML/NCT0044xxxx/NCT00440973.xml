  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of therapy to strengthen the
      immune system (Interleukin - 2) plus a specific tumor target therapy (Bevacizumab) can
      prolong the time between the start of treatment and disease progression, decrease tumor size,
      as well as determine if the combination therapy is safer and less toxic than the standard
      treatment for renal cell carcinoma.

      The standard first-line treatment for patients with metastatic RCC is IL-2 at higher doses,
      but associated with higher frequency of toxicities. IL-2 given at lower doses have
      demonstrated similar results than higher doses but it requires further study. RCC is highly
      vascular and expresses high levels of VEGF. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed
      against the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) responsible for angiogenesis.

      The study is designed to evaluate a response defined as time to progression, safety and
      toxicity in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Tissue correlation to evaluate the
      impact of vascular VEGF on clinical outcome will be retrospectively performed

             component)

          -  Evidence of measurable metastatic disease, no progression diseases or the patient's
             condition will not need radiotherapy in the next 4 weeks.

          -  Previous definitive radiotherapy to 1 metastatic site is acceptable

          -  At least 4 weeks have elapsed since radiation therapy

          -  Patients must be free of serious co-morbidity and have a life expectancy of ≥24 weeks
