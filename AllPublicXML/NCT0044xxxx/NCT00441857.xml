  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to measure the effect of three different doses of plant stanols in margarine
      on the cholesterol absorption efficiency in subjects with mildly to moderately increased
      serum LDL cholesterol concentrations

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Serum cholesterol lowering effect of plant sterols is well established and it is also known
      that plant stanols inhibit the absorption of cholesterol. However, there is lack of
      dose-response studies directly measuring the cholesterol absorption efficiency during
      prolonged consumption of plant stanols. Therefore this study aims to measure the cholesterol
      absorption efficiency at different plant stanol consumption levels using a stable isotope
      tracer method.

      Subjects will be randomized in their study groups that consume 20 g of margarine with
      different doses of plants stanols (0.8, 1.6 and 2.0g) based on cholesterol absorption
      efficiency at screening (high and low absorbers randomised separately). Cholesterol
      absorption test with cholesterol tracer will be conducted twice: at baseline and after 2-3
      weeks margarine consumption period.

      Cholesterol absorption efficiency will also be examined by indirect method i.e. by following
      the concentrations of serum cholesterol precursors and plant sterols in blood. In addition
      serum total, LDL and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides are followed.
