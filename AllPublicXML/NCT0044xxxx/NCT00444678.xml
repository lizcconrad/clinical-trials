      This trial will examine the addition of Cetuximab in combination with Oxaliplatin and
      Capecitabine for treatment of patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current treatment options for metastatic colon cancer are in need of further improvement.
      The three-drug combination of oxaliplatin with 5-FU/LV in the second-line treatment of
      metastatic colorectal cancer have shown a significant increase in response rate compared to
      5-FU/LV alone. Oxaliplatin has recently been FDA-approved for this indication and is now a
      standard first-line agent in combination with a fluoropyrimidine. Cetuximab, a chimeric
      monoclonal antibody against the growth factor receptor, has shown activity with and without
      irinotecan in subjects with colorectal cancer refractory to irinotecan alone. Cetuximab has
      also been shown to be safe and effective when administered with infusional 5-FU/folinic acid
      plus irinotecan. These results suggest that the addition of cetuximab to
      fluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin-based regimen in the 1st line setting should be explored. The
      use of the oral fluoropyrimidine, capecitabine, to replace infusional 5FU has been widely
      used for improved convenience and possible safety. We have chosen a modified biweekly CapeOx
      regimen due to its improved tolerance and response rate with a fixed dose of capecitabine
      given its widespread practice and ease of use.
