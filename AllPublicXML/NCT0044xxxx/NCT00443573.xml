  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, two-stage trial with the goal of evaluating up to 100 subjects. This
      trial will be performed to initiate identification of a safe and effective dose of
      twice-weekly, subcutaneous rNAPc2 for the second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal
      carcinoma in combination with contemporary 5-FU-based chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytotoxic chemotherapy combining 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin with irinotecan (FOLFIRI) or
      oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or, more recently, treatment with XELOX (Roche) (capecitabine +
      oxaliplatin) has been the main approach for the treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma
      (mCRC), but with the advent of targeted therapies, biologic treatments are becoming an area
      of intense interest. Tissue factor (TF) is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed by upwards
      of 85% of mCRCs.
