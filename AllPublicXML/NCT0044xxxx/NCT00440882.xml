  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transforming Growth Factor-b1 (TGF-b1) is involved in the development of acute lung injury
      and in the fibroproliferation during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Procollagen
      III Peptide (PIIINP) is a validated marker of fibroproliferation. PIIINP is associated with
      death in ARDS patients. The simultaneous changes of TGF-b1 and PIIINP were never studied in
      patients with ARDS. The relationships between TGF-b1 and the outcome of ARDS are unknown.

      The aim of the study is to analyse the changes of TGF-b1 and PIIINP during ARDS and to show
      the relationships between TGF-b1 - PIIINP and the outcomes of ARDS.
