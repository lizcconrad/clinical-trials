      The purpose of this study is:

        1. To assess the effect of BOTOX injection to the scalene muscles on the severity of pain
           from TOS.

        2. To assess the effect of BOTOX injection on numbness and tingling and quality of life.

      Background:

      Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS) is a symptom complex consisting of pain, paresthesias and
      often functional impairment caused by compression of the neurovascular supply to the upper
      limb. Impingement may occur at the interscalene triangle, and both anesthetic blockade and
      chemodenervation of the scalene muscles have been shown to temporarily improve symptoms of
      TOS in non-randomized controlled trials.

      Objective:

      To assess the effect of Botulinum Toxin Type A (BTX-A) injections into the scalene muscles on
      pain, paresthesias and function in subjects with TOS.

      Hypothesis:

      BTX-A injected into the anterior and middle scalene muscles will reduce the irritation on the
      neurovascular structures at the interscalene triangle in subjects with TOS. This will lead to
      reductions in pain and paresthesias, and improvements in function when compared with
      injection of placebo.

      Intervention:

      Each subject will receive an injection under EMG guidance into the anterior and middle
      scalene muscles of either 75 units of BTX-A (experimental group), or normal saline (control
      group). Both groups will be provided with a stretching and strengthening exercise program.
