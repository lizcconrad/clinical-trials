      This multi-center, prospective, cohort study of 394 subjects that are indicated for standard
      colonoscopy due to suspected or known colonic disease examines the Given Diagnostic System
      and the PillCam Colon Capsule in comparison to standard colonoscopy. This study aims a. To
      evaluate and compare the accuracy of PillCam ™ Colon capsule endoscopy (PCCE) with standard
      colonoscopy. This study will evaluate the safety of PillCam ™ Colon capsule endoscopy (PCCE)

      The Given® Diagnostic System offers an alternative approach for endoscopic visualization of
      the colon using capsule endoscopy, a swallowable device which contains imagers, light
      sources, a power source and a RF transmitter. Advantages of the Given® Diagnostic System
      include the elimination of the need for conscious sedation, the minimally invasive, painless
      nature of the exam, and the ability to pursue normal daily activities immediately following
      the procedure . This multi-center prospective, cohort study will evaluate the performance of
      PCCE in visualizing the colon. Up to 394 subjects will participate in this study. All
      subjects to be enrolled will be appropriate candidates for standard colonoscopy based on
      their clinical indication.

      Each subject will undergo PCCE. All generated PCCE RAPID videos will be reviewed by blinded
      PCCE reading physicians. All readers, experienced in PillCam SB, will have undergone
      standardized training and passed a qualification test specific to reading and interpreting
      PCCE videos. Training will be done by reading at least 5 cases to demonstrate proficiency in
      interpretation of PCCE. PCCE results will be compared with that of a colonoscopy procedure.

      Following PCCE procedure, standard colonoscopy will be performed by a colonoscopist blinded
      to the results of the PCCE. The colonoscopist will be &quot;unblinded&quot; during the standard
      colonoscopy procedure at three locations on withdrawal of the colonoscope.

      Primary Endpoint - Accuracy parameters (sensitivity, specificity, NPV, PPV) of PCCE compared
      to standard colonoscopy.

      • Number, type and severity of adverse events with both PCCE and standard colonoscopy

        Inclusion criteria:

        Subjects must meet one the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into
        this proposed study:

        Subject was referred for standard colonoscopy for one of the following reasons:

        Subjects over 50 years of age with one or more of the following clinical symptoms:

        rectal bleeding, hematochezia, melena, positive FOBT, recent change of bowel habits

        • Any subject over 18 years of age with:

          -  Positive findings in the colon on a GI radiographic study (e.g., CT colonography,
             air-contrast barium enema, abdominal/pelvic CT scan)

          -  Personal history of colorectal cancer (CRC) or adenomatous colonic polyps and at least
             5 years since last colonoscopy or no sooner than 3 years prior to enrollment date as
             long as their prior colonoscopy revealed at least one of the following high risk
             conditions: multiple (greater than 3)adenomas, large adenoma (greater than 1 cm) ,
             adenomas with a villous component, adenoma with high grade dysplasia.

          -  Suspected or known ulcerative colitis

        Exclusion criteria

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from study enrollment:

          -  Subject has dysphagia

          -  Subject has congestive heart failure

          -  Subject has renal insufficiency

             capsule.

          -  Subject has had prior abdominal surgery of the gastrointestinal tract other than
             uncomplicated procedures that would be unlikely to lead to bowel obstruction based on
             the clinical judgment of the investigator.

          -  Subject has any condition, which precludes compliance with study and/or device
