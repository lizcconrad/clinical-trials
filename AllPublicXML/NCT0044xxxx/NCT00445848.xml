      RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in
      different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor
      cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab also may stop
      the growth of non-small cell lung cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving
      erlotinib together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving erlotinib together with bevacizumab
      works in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV primary non-small cell lung cancer who
      have never smoked.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess overall survival of patients with stage IIIB or IV primary non-small cell lung
           adenocarcinoma who have never smoked and are treated with erlotinib hydrochloride and
           bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  Assess progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial) in a subset
           of patients with measurable disease treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily on days 1-21 and bevacizumab IV over
      30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease assessment is performed every 6 weeks for 18 weeks, then every 9-12 weeks until progression up to 2 years. After disease progression, patients must be followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for a maximum of 3 years.</time_frame>
    <description>From date of registration to date of death due to any cause. Patients last known to be alive are censored at date of last contact.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease assessment is performed every 6 weeks for 18 weeks, then every 9-12 weeks until progression up to 2 years. After disease progression, patients must be followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for a maximum of 3 years.</time_frame>
    <description>From date of registration to date of first documentation of progression or symptomatic deterioration, or death due to any cause. Patients last known to be alive and progression-free are censored at date of last contact. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v 1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameters of target measurable lesions over smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease during therapy) using the same techniques as baseline, or unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease in the opinion of the treating physician (an explanation must be provided) or appearance of any new lesion/site, or death due to disease without prior documentation of progression and without symptomatic deterioration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Rate (Complete and Partial)</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease assessment is performed every 6 weeks for 18 weeks, then every 9-12 weeks until progression up to 2 years. After disease progression, patients must be followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for a maximum of 3 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable disease; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.
All target measurable lesions must be assessed using the same techniques as baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Gr 3 Through 5 Adverse Events That Are Related to Study Drugs</measure>
    <time_frame>Toxicity assessment was evaluated after each cycle (21 days) while on protocol therapy.</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse Events (AEs) are reported by CTCAE Version 3.0. Only adverse events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to study drug are reported. Any CTCAE 3.0 event of Grade 3 (serious), Grade 4 (life threatening) or Grade 5 (fatal) which were deemed to be related to protocol treatment are included.</description>

Patients last known to be alive and progression-free are censored at date of last contact. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v 1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameters of target measurable lesions over smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease during therapy) using the same techniques as baseline, or unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease in the opinion of the treating physician (an explanation must be provided) or appearance of any new lesion/site, or death due to disease without prior documentation of progression and without symptomatic deterioration.</description>
        <time_frame>Disease assessment is performed every 6 weeks for 18 weeks, then every 9-12 weeks until progression up to 2 years. After disease progression, patients must be followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for a maximum of 3 years.</time_frame>
