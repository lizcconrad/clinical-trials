  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Combigan ophthalmic solution in
      combination with Latanoprost when the therapy is swiched from Latanoprost monotherapy in
      patient with Glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Combigan Ophthalmic Solution provides addition IOP loweringwhen combined with
           Latanoprost.

        2. The treatment with Combigan Ophthalmic Solution has an acceptable safety profile, as
           measured by ocular and systemic safety parameters.

      The purpose of this study is to comparethe efficacy and safety Ophthalmic Solution in
      combination with Latanoprost when the therapy is swiched from Latanoprost monotherapy in
      patient with Glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

      The study will be open label, prospective, multi-centered where patients will be swiched from
      Latanoprostmonotherapy to a combination therapy of Latanoprost with Combigan Ophthalmic
      Solution.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, of legal age of consent.

          2. Diagnosis of ocular hypertension (OHT) or glaucoma (incl. open angle glaucoma, chronic
             angle closure glaucoma, exfoliative glaucoma, pigmentary glaucoma or pseudophakic
             glaucoma) and requiring administration of IOP lowering eye drops.

          3. Written informed consent has been obtained.

          4. The patient can understand all study instructions, and is willing and able to comply
             with the schedule of visits and treatment.

          5. Patient has been administering latanoprost eye drops as monotherapy in affected eye(s)
             for at least 12 weeks according to the approved product labeling.

          6. Patient’s Day 0 IOP &gt; 18 mm Hg in the proposed study eye/s on established latanoprost
             therapy.

          7. Patients who have used COMBIGAN® Ophthalmic Solution in the past must not have been
             discontinued from using this medication due to adverse events or due to lack of
             efficacy.

          8. Day 0: negative urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. .Uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g., hypertension, diabetes).

          2. .Females who are pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy, or females of
             childbearing potential who are not using a reliable means of contraception. A female
             is considered of child-bearing potential unless she is post-menopausal, without a
             uterus and/or both ovaries, or has a tubal-ligation.

          3. .Known allergy or hypersensitivity to the study medication or components.

          4. .Anticipated alteration of existing chronic therapy with agents which could have a
             substantial effect on IOP (including, but not necessarily limited to systemic
             adrenergic agents including beta-adrenergic blocking agents [e.g., propanolol,
             metoprolol, nadolol, timolol and atenolol]), substantial interaction with study
             medications, or interaction with study outcomes.

          5. .Corneal abnormalities that would preclude accurate IOP readings with an applanation
             tonometer.

          6. .Any other active ocular disease other than glaucoma or ocular hypertension (e.g.,
             uveitis, ocular infections, or severe dry eye). However, patients with chronic mild
             blepharitis, cataract, age-related macular degeneration, or a background diabetic
             retinopathy can be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.

          7. .Required chronic use of other ocular medications during the study other than the
             study medications. Occasional use of artificial tears or topical decongestants and/or
             antihistamine is acceptable. Use of these within 24 hours of a scheduled study visit
             is prohibited.

          8. .Ocular surgery within the past 3 months.

          9. .Current enrolment in an investigational drug or device study or participation in such
             a study within 30 days of entry into this study.

         10. .Patient has a condition or is in a situation which in the investigator's opinion may
             put the patient at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere
             significantly with the patient's participation in the study,

         11. .Day 0 - Significant ocular irritation.
