    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether 8 weekly monitoring of hemoglobin and iron parameters in
      the correction phase of NeoRecormon therapy in patients with renal anemia is as safe and
      effective as 4 weekly monitoring. Patients with chronic kidney disease will receive
      NeoRecormon at a dose aimed at achieving and maintaining a Hb level of 110-130g/L. They will
      be randomized into one of two schedules for monitoring hemoglobin levels and iron parameters,
      either 4 weekly or 8 weekly. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the
      target sample size is 100-500 inidividuals.
