      The purpose of the study is to establish the clinical disease outcomes and features of CDAD
      associated with variant tcdC genotypes. Two hypotheses are to be tested in this study:

        1. Severe CDAD and tcdC truncation:

           Severe CDAD (defined by death and/or colectomy or secondary endpoints) is associated
           with severe truncations (&gt; 6 amino acid residues) in TcdC, a negative regulator of toxin
           A/B production.

        2. Disease in low risk populations (patients never exposed to health care facilities and/or
           patients who never received antibiotics) of any severity is attributable to strains of
           C. difficile with severe tcdC truncation.

      The following information will be collected: age, sex, occupation, hospital location at the
      time of positive culture (ER, medical ward, ICU etc), prior hospitalization, receipt of
      outpatient dialysis, home care or other regular medical care (eg, outpatient chemotherapy),
      date of specimen collection, presence of invasive devices, receipt of antibiotics, including
      their type and whether they were adequate for the resistance profile of the organism, prior
      positive microbiologic cultures, time and location of positive cultures, underlying diseases
      and severity of illness, presence of urinary or intravascular devices, recent
      immunomodulative therapies or radiation therapy, physical exam findings, laboratory and
      radiographical data, antimicrobial usage within 6 months of onset of the infection,
      microbiological data and resistance patterns, choice of antibiotics once organism identified,
      bacteriological outcomes, laboratory results, demographic information, medications, clinical
      outcome,gender, height, weight, ethnicity, past medical history and outcomes. We will collect
      information retrospectively.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients who have confirmed CDAD, confirmed by testing at UPMC's clinical
             microbiology lab in March 1, 2001- December 31, 2005 for C. difficile by stool toxin
             test with subsequent positive culture for the organism from inpatients/outpatients at
             UPMC Presbyterian-Montefiore, from WPIC inpatient units, from ER visits at the
             Presbyterian University Hospital emergency department, and from clinics closely
             affiliated with UPMC Presbyterian (medical and surgical clinics in Falk Clinic, the 9
             South Montefiore internal medicine clinic, the geriatrics clinic in Montefiore, and
             the digestive disorders center (GI clinic on 3rd floor of PUH).
