      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of long term dosing of AMG 531
      in thrombocytopenic Japanese subjects with ITP.

      It is anticipated that AMG 531 will be a safe and well tolerated in long term treatment and
      that AMG 531 will effectively raise and maintain platelet counts to a desired therapeutic
      range, when individual dose adjustments based on platelet counts are permitted.

      This study is available to subjects who have completed any previous AMG 531 ITP study in
      Japan and meet the eligibility criteria of this study.

    <description>AMG 531 will be administered by SC injection once per week from Week 1 (Day 1). The maximum permitted dose of AMG 531 is 10 Î¼g/kg. AMG 531 will be supplied as a sterile, white, preservative-free, lyophilized powder in 5 mL glass vials containing 0.6 mg of protein per vial, and a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/mL when reconstituted with 1.2 mL of sterile water for injection.</description>
