      This study is being undertaken to:

        -  evaluate the degree of correction attainable with DL6049 (injectable poly-L-lactic
           acid)compared to a commercially available CosmoPlast™ Collagen Implant in the treatment
           of dermal nasolabial fold wrinkles at 13 months following the last application of study
           treatment.

        -  Document the types and incidence of adverse events reported with DL6049 (injectable
           poly-L-lactic acid)compared with CosmoPlast™ Collagen Implant. Long term adverse events
           will be assessed for an additional 12 months following discharge from the main study in
           subjects treated with DL6049.

             contraceptives, IUD, or spermicide in combination with barrier method of
             contraception).

          -  Subjects seeking augmentation therapy for bilateral correction of nasolabial folds.
             Subjects must have a score of greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 4
             on the photo-numeric wrinkle assessment scale (assessed by a blinded evaluator) of
             both the left and right nasolabial fold at Visit 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a personal history of allergic/anaphylactic reactions including
             hypersensitivity to local anesthetics (e.g.,lidocaine, etc.), bovine collagen, latex,
             silicone, carmellose, or mannitol.

          -  Subjects with a known history of keloids or bleeding disorders.

          -  Subjects with an active inflammatory process in the area to be treated (skin eruptions
             such as cysts, pimples, rashes, cancerous/pre-cancerous lesions, or any other active
             skin disease).

          -  Subjects with active hepatitis within the past year.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant (confirmation by pregnancy testing),or plan to become
             pregnant within the study timeframe, or who are nursing.

          -  Subjects who plan to undergo major facial surgery (e.g., rhinoplasty with or without
             implant, facelift, congenital defect repair, etc. during the course of the study.

          -  Subjects with clinically important disease as judged by the investigator within 3
             months of the study (e.g., significant lab abnormalities, myocardial infarct, stroke,
             cancer, connective tissue diseases, etc.) including subjects with medical conditions
             that might require the use of immunosuppressive medications during the trial (e.g.,
             severe asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.).

          -  Subjects who have used exclusionary medications/treatments.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
