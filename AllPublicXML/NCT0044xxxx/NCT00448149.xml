    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether the combination for RAD001 and Nexavar® works
      better when given together than they do alone. The purpose of the first phase of this study
      is to determine the best dose of RAD001 given with Nexavar®, and to see what effects, good
      and/or bad, the study drug has on the subject and the subject's tumor. This study will also
      observe side effects experienced by the subject.

    <textblock>
      Despite significant progress in understanding the biology of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), it
      is estimated that over 35, 000 people in the United States will be diagnosed and
      approximately 12, 000 have died from this disease in 2005. Renal cell carcinoma presently
      ranks tenth as the leading cause of cancer death and constitutes 3% of all solid neoplasms.

      In contrast to many other malignancies, treatment for RCC is limited. Treatment remains a
      highly difficult and perplexing challenge due to its resistance to both chemotherapy and
      hormone therapy and limited response to cytokines. Despite recent advances in our fundamental
      knowledge of RCC biology and development of molecular therapeutics, more clinical research
      will be required to best guide our use of these exciting new agents in combination regimens.

      The combination of RAD001 and Nexavar®, in current clinical trials with minimal toxicity,
      represents a treatment regimen which should be investigated for tolerance and toxicity as
      well as initial phase II efficacy. The study is designed to evaluate the MTD. Following the
      completion of the phase I, utilizing the MTD, Phase II study is designed to evaluate the
      anti-tumor activity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic confirmed predominant clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

          -  Patients must have progressive metastatic disease.

          -  Paraffin RCC tissue blocks or unstained slides must be available.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70% .

          -  Not pregnant

          -  Age &gt; 18

          -  Initial laboratory values must meet requirements

          -  Phase I: No more than three prior systemic and/or investigative therapy for MRCC.
             Previous therapy may include prior single agent exposure to RAD001 or Nexavar®. Four
             weeks must have elapsed from previous therapy.

          -  Phase II: No more than one prior systemic and/or investigative therapy of any kind for
             MRCC. Four weeks must have elapsed from previous therapy.

          -  Phase II: Previous therapy may not include RAD001 or Nexavar®.

          -  Phase II: Patients with primary tumor in place are strongly encouraged to undergo
             nephrectomy prior to initiation of study agent.

          -  Phase II: Prior palliative radiotherapy to metastatic lesion(s) is permitted. Patient
             must have adequately recovered from the acute toxicities of this treatment.

          -  Phase II: All major surgery of any type and/or radiotherapy must be completed at least
             4 weeks prior to registration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No ongoing hemoptysis or cerebrovascular accident within 12 months, or peripheral
             vascular disease with claudication on less than 1 block, or history of clinically
             significant bleeding.

          -  No deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus within one year and no ongoing need for
             full-dose oral or parenteral anticoagulation.

          -  No significant cardiovascular disease

          -  No patients with uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Any ongoing requirement for systemic corticosteroid therapy (except replacement
             therapy for adrenal insufficiency) or other immunosuppressants are not permitted.

             cancers are not eligible. Patients are not considered to have a 'currently active'
             malignancy if they have completed anti-cancer therapy and are considered by their
             physician to be a less than 30% risk of relapse.

          -  All fertile patients must use adequate contraception (barrier method) while on study
             and for three months thereafter. Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may
             be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered
             effective for this study.

          -  Prior treatment with any investigational drug within the preceding 4 weeks.

          -  Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease which could compromise
             participation in the study (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, severe infection, severe
             malnutrition, ventricular arrhythmias, chronic liver or renal disease, active upper GI
             tract ulceration).
