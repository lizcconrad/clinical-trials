  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose that acid reflux affects respiratory dynamics (breathing) in patients who are
      exercising and that athletes improve their exercise capacity with acid suppression therapy.
      It is our intent to determine whether treatment of GER with strong acid suppression may
      alleviate symptoms, improve exercise capacity, and improve quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, blinded, cross-over trial. We plan to take athletes with classical GER,
      cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness during exercise and subject them to complete
      pulmonary function testing in conjunction with exercise and pH testing. We will assess
      whether such athletes experience an increase in reflux duration and episodes during exercise.
      The athletes will be randomized (in a cross over fashion) to acid suppression (BID Nexium 40
      mg) or placebo for 10-12 weeks. Both the athletes and investigators will be blinded. After
      10-12 weeks, exercise testing (ramp protocol with VO2 and anaerobic threshold) with
      concurrent respiratory function testing will be repeated along with symptom assessment. After
      a brief washout period of 1-2 weeks, the athletes will then cross-over to the other study
      medication for 10-12 weeks. Again, at the end of the study period, symptomatic relief as well
      as respiratory function improvement will be assessed by repeating the initial exercise
      regimen. The exercise regimens during these medication regimens will not be held stable as
      indirectly, as a results of &quot;feeling better or worse&quot; from the medication/placebo, these
      patients may increase/ decrease their exercise routine, resulting in changes in their overall
      endurance, anaerobic threshold, etc (our endpoints). By keeping the regimen stable, we do not
      allow for the changes to occur which are large enough to detect.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We plan to take athletes (cyclists) with GER (heartburn symptoms on a daily-weekly
             basis which are either improved by a trial of acid suppression or objectively
             documented via pH/endoscopic testing- this may include during exercise) who experience
             one or more of the following symptoms during exercise, limiting their perceived
             ability to exercise to full capacity:

               -  choking

               -  cough

               -  wheezing

               -  shortness of breath

               -  chest tightness during exercise

          -  Athletes will be defined as persons who exercise on a routine basis (at least 3 times
             a week on average) for at least the past 6 months.

          -  Subjects must be at least 18 years old.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Age less than 18 years or greater than 65 years

          -  Abnormal methacholine challenge tests will not exclude one from enrollment as (has
             been documented in a prior study) often patients with GER will have heightened
             bronchial reactivity.
