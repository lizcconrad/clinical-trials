  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It involves delivering a train of magnetic pulses, 5 at each time, to the brain. In the
      present study, we are using the same method to treat severe pain due to nerve conditions. You
      will be given up to 1000 pulses in total over the spine in the lower back (Spinal Magnetic
      Stimulation or SMS). Each train will be given in 10-second intervals. You will have SMS on a
      single day. You will be given SMS pulses at 1 or 10 per second. No stimulation will be given
      over the head.

      You will be assessed before and after the study for up to 1 week. Your usual medical
      treatment will be continued

      You must be aware of that this is a placebo-controlled trial. This means that you may either
      receive real SMS or sham SMS. The latter involves a harmless process of ineffective
      stimulation, designed for comparison with real SMS. Whether you receive either form of
      treatment will be assigned randomly, and there will be a 50% chance of being assigned to
      either.

    <description>SMS was delivered with a repetitive magnetic stimulator connected to a figure of eight coil capable of delivering a maximum output of 2 Tesla per pulse. The coil measured 90 mm in each wing and was centered over the surface landmark corresponding to the cauda equina region. SMS was performed with the patient lying comfortably in the prone position and a soft pillow supported the lower abdomen. The coil was placed flat over the back with the handle pointing cranially. Each patient on active treatment received 200 trains of 5 pulses delivered at 10 Hz, at an interval of 5 s between each train. As this was a pilot study, each only received 1000 pulses in a single session.</description>

    <description>The placebo arm consisted of 'sham' SMS delivered with the coil angled vertically and one of the wing edges in contact with the stimulation point. As this coil type allows maximum magnetic flux at the center of the intersection, we believe minimum or no stimulation was effected at the edge of the coil in contact with the patient. Stimulation parameters and duration were unchanged in this arm.</description>
