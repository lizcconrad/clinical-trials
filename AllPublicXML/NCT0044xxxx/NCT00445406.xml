      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab also may stop the
      growth of breast cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bevacizumab
      together with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving bevacizumab
      together with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome works in treating women with locally
      recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab and doxorubicin hydrochloride
           liposome in women with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Identify surrogate markers of angiogenesis, including vascular endothelial growth factor
           (VEGF), VEGF receptor 1, and matrix metalloproteinase 9, in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes and doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome IV
      over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses*.
      Patients then receive bevacizumab alone IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses with
      bevacizumab repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients may receive additional courses of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome at the
      discretion of the primary investigator.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline, on day 1 of course 3 and then once every 3 months
      during study treatment, and after completion of study treatment. Samples are analyzed by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine the level of circulating angiogenesis-related
      molecules, including serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor 1, and
      matrix metalloproteinase 9.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study.
