  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a descriptive comparison of the effects of live attenuated influenza virus
      (FluMist) on nasal inflammation and oxidative stress in healthy young adults who are not
      exposed to smoke vs smokers. It is hypothesized that passive exposure to second-hand smoke
      (SHS) results in increased susceptibility to the effects of influenza virus in nasal
      epithelium in humans and that these effects are mediated by SHS-induced oxidative stress
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiologic evidence supports a significant relationship between passive cigarette smoke
      exposure and increased risk for viral respiratory illnesses. Published and preliminary data
      suggest that airborne pollutants including tobacco smoke increase susceptibility of
      respiratory epithelium to infection with influenza A and that this effect is at least
      partially mediated by oxidative stress. However, no studies have specifically looked at the
      interaction between smoking and the effects of influenza virus in human volunteers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  age 18-35 years

          -  healthy nonsmoking who are rarely exposed to SHS OR smokers

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  pregnancy or nursing;

          -  history of egg allergy;

          -  aspirin therapy;

          -  asthma;

          -  immunodeficiency (HIV or other);

          -  on immunosuppressive drugs including corticosteroids;

          -  history of Guillain-Barre Syndrome;

          -  any chronic medical condition;

          -  febrile and/or respiratory illness within past 3 weeks prior to entry into study;

          -  prospective subjects with high baseline antibody titers against influenza will be
             excluded because they may be less likely to develop viral replication with LAIV.
