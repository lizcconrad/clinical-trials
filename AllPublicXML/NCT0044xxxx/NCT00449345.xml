    <textblock>
      The ministry of health in Israel requires all health-care workers to undergo screening for
      latent Tuberculosis infection (LTBI) prior to starting work. This is based on the Mantoux
      skin test, which is notoriously unreliable.

      In recent years, more specific and sensitive tests based on interferon-gamma secretion to TB
      antigens have come to market, and most current evidence shows that many mantoux positive
      persons do not have LTBI. Quantiferon-GOLD is one of these assays.

      In this prospective study, we will draw blood for the Quantiferon-GOLD assay in parallel to
      conventional testing, and perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the cost of the
      investigation and treatment of LTBI in health-care workers.

      We hypothesize that in spite of the cost of screening healthcare workers with
      Quantiferon-GOLD tests, the reduction in need for LTBI treatment and associated costs will
      render the test cost-effective.
