    <measure>Clinical Recurrence of UC During the Maintenance Phase Associated With Subject Compliance at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical recurrence is defined as 4 or more bowel movements per day above the subject's normal frequency and associated with any of the following: urgency, abdominal pain, or rectal bleeding. Compliance is a subject's adherence to a recommended course of treatment and for this study is calculated: [(Sum of days' supplies dispensed) divided by (Sum of days in all refill intervals)] x 100.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical recurrence is defined as 4 or more bowel movements per day above the subject's normal frequency and associated with any of the following: urgency, abdominal pain, or rectal bleeding.

    <measure>Quiescent UC During the Maintenance Phase at 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Quiescent UC is defined as scores of 0 for both rectal bleeding and bowel movements. Rectal bleeding is assessed on a scale from 0-3 (0 = no rectal bleeding, 1 = streaks of blood, 2 = obvious blood, 3 = mostly blood). Bowel movements are assessed on a scale of 0-2 (0 = 0-1 more than normal per day, 1 = 2-3 more than normal per day, 2 = 4 or more than normal per day).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Endoscopic Remission of UC During the Maintenance Phase at 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic remission is defined as an endoscopy score of less than or equal to 1. Endoscopy score (mucosal appearance) ranges from 0-3 (0 = normal [intact vascular pattern; no friability or granulation], 1 = mild [erythema; decreased vascular pattern; minimal granularity], 2 = moderate [marked erythema; granularity; friability; absent vascular pattern; bleeding with minimal trauma; no ulcerations], 3 = severe [ulceration; spontaneous bleeding].</description>

             radiology.

          3. Males or non-pregnant, non-lactating FOCP who have a negative serum pregnancy test
             prior to entering the study and who are using adequate forms of contraception for the

          4. General medical assessment must be satisfactory and there must not be clinically
             significant and relevant abnormalities.

          5. Subject must have had &gt;2 acute episodes of UC (a documented episode of increased bowel
             frequency with rectal blood loss for which UC therapy was intensified) in their
             medical history.

          6. Subjects who have relapsed on maintenance therapy after 2 weeks with doses of
             mesalamine at: a. &lt;2.0g/day, will be allowed into the Acute Phase at 2.4g/day QD, or

          <title>Clinical Recurrence of UC During the Maintenance Phase Associated With Subject Compliance at 12 Months</title>
          <description>Clinical recurrence is defined as 4 or more bowel movements per day above the subject's normal frequency and associated with any of the following: urgency, abdominal pain, or rectal bleeding. Compliance is a subject's adherence to a recommended course of treatment and for this study is calculated: (Sum of days' supplies dispensed) divided by (Sum of days in all refill intervals) x 100.</description>

        <title>Quiescent UC During the Maintenance Phase at 12 Months</title>
        <description>Quiescent UC is defined as scores of 0 for both rectal bleeding and bowel movements. Rectal bleeding is assessed on a scale from 0-3 (0 = no rectal bleeding, 1 = streaks of blood, 2 = obvious blood, 3 = mostly blood). Bowel movements are assessed on a scale of 0-2 (0 = 0-1 more than normal per day, 1 = 2-3 more than normal per day, 2 = 4 or more than normal per day).</description>
