      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of the study drug (GW679769) on a commonly
      used chemotherapy drug (docetaxel) which will be given I.V. Blood samples will be taken to
      see if the GW679769 alters the blood levels of the chemotherapy. The study will last about 2
      weeks with a final follow-up visit 6 weeks later.

          -  Active systemic infection or any poorly controlled medical condition (other than
             malignancy) which, in the opinion of the investigator, may confound the results of the
             study or pose an unwarranted risk to the subject. Subjects with a previous, but not
             current, history of alcoholism may be permitted provided that, in the investigator's
             opinion, the subject's disease state will not confound the results of the study.

          -  Receiving regular treatment with high dose systemic corticosteroid therapy or steroid
             dose within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. Topical
             steroids and inhaled corticosteroids with a steroid dose of less than or equal to 10
             mg prednisone daily (or its equivalent) are permitted if the subject has been on this
             dose for at least 14 days prior to dosing.

          -  Hypersensitivity or contraindication to ondansetron or other 5-HT3 receptor
             antagonist, dexamethasone, docetaxel, casopitant, or any component of the above
             mentioned medications.

          -  Received an investigational drug within the 28 days or five half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to receiving the first dose of study medication, or is scheduled to
             receive any investigational drug during the study.

          -  Use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 prior to the first dose of study
             medication

          -  Use of inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 (other than steroids described in Exclusion
             Criteria 5) within 14 days prior to the first dose of study medication

          -  Use of drugs with a narrow therapeutic index that interact with the P-glycoprotein
             pathway within 14 days prior to the first dose of study medication until 14 days after
             the last dose of docetaxel including digoxin.

          -  Use of drugs with a narrow therapeutic index that are metabolized by CYP2C8 within 14
             days prior to the first dose of study medication including repaglinide and torsemide.

          -  Disease that will significantly affect absorption of oral medications.

          -  Inadequate venous access for pharmacokinetic sampling.

          -  Unresolved Grade 2 or worse toxicity from prior therapy.

          -  Active peptic ulcer disease (PUD) or a history of PUD of unknown etiology. NOTE:
             Subject is eligible to enter and participate in this study if they have a history of
             PUD of known etiology with documentation from a gastroenterologist or other qualified
             physician of the etiology of the PUD and that effective treatment was provided with
             full eradication of ulcers and symptoms. Subjects who present with symptoms of
             gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are eligible. However, if the investigator
             suspects PUD in such a subject, the subject must have a GI assessment to rule out PUD.
             If assessment is negative, subject may enter the study. For these subjects,
             appropriate steps must also have been taken to minimize the risk of reoccurrence. If
             PUD was non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) induced, the subject should no
             longer be taking NSAID medication(s). If PUD was induced by H. pylori, the subject
             should have been appropriately treated.

          -  Stool positive for occult blood. Test may be repeated once if subject did not abstain
             from red meat for the previous three days.

          -  Pepsinogen level below the lower limit of laboratory reference range (LLRR).

          -  Troponin level above 10% of the coefficient of variation of the assay as determined by
             the laboratory performing the test.

          -  Calculated QT interval (QTc) &gt; 480 msecs.

          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease that would interfere with participation in the
             study as determined by the investigator.

          -  Known or suspected iron deficiency.

          -  Use of NSAIDS, including aspirin at any dose, and including COX2 inhibitors. These
             medications are prohibited 7 days prior to administration of study drug and for the
             duration of the study until 72 hours after the last dose of study drug.
