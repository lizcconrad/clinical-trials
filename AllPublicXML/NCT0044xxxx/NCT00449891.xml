      This study is being conducted to see if Type 1 diabetes mellitus has any affect on learning,
      behavior and development in young children and whether there are associated changes on their
      MRI scan.

      In this pilot study approximately 10-20 children between the ages of 3 to 10 years with Type
      1 diabetes mellitus will have neuropsychological testing and a nonsedated MRI scan of the
      head performed every three years for three years. We will compare this to a control group of
      10 children between the ages of 3 adn 10 years without Type 1 diabetes mellitus. The control
      subjects will neuropsychological testing and a nonsedated MRI scan of the head once. The
      children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus will not have any changes made to their current
      diabetes regimen.
