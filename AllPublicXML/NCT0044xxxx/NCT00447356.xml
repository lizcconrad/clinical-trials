  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial is studying high dose interferon alfa to see how well it
      works compared to observation only in treating patients with stage II or stage III melanoma
      that has been completely removed by surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interferon alfa may interfere with growth of cancer cells. It is not yet known whether
      treatment with interferon alfa is more effective than observation alone for stage II or stage
      III melanoma that has been completely removed surgically.
