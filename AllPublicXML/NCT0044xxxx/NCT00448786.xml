  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study involves the use of three different dosing regimens of AMG 706 in patients with
      advanced solid tumors to see how the drug affects the gallbladder size and function. The
      study will be conducted in 11 sites in the US and Australia. A total of 48 patients will be
      enrolled in the study with the possibility of enrolling 8 more in each treatment arm.
