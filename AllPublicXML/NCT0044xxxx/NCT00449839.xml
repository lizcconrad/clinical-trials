  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pharmacokinetic study of insulin pump treatment using Insulin Aspart. The study consist of
      three different periods A, B and C where a constant the insulin infusion rate is given during
      the periods. In period B and C will the infusion start with a bolus.

      It will be investigated if a steady state of insulin will be obtained faster in period B and
      C then A.

      A pharmacokinetic study of insulin pump treatment using Insulin Aspart. The study consist of
      three different periods A, B and C where a constant the insulin infusion rate is given during
      the periods. Each period will last 12 hours and blood will be drawn to measure absorbed
      Insulin Aspart. During period A will a constant the infusion rate of insulin be given. In
      period B and C will there at the start of the constant infusion rate be given a bolus. The
      bolus in period C is calculated on the basis of the results in period B, therefore will all
      participants experience period C last where as period A and B is randomized cross-over.
      Period C is written in the protocol as optional and it is evaluated after period A and B if
      period C will be performed.

      The hypothesis is that steady state of insulin will be obtained faster in period B and C than
      A.
