  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute cholecystitis is frequent in the elderly, or in patients with gall stones. Most cases
      of severe or recurrent cholecystitis need surgery as final therapy. Today, the performed
      procedure in most cases for cholecystectomy in the western world is laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy. Only in some cases an open surgery has to be performed. Unclear is, what
      time point is best, concerning outcome and morbidity of the patient, immediate surgery or
      initial conservative therapy using antibiotics and symptomatic therapy with cholecystectomy
      later on. Today the performed procedure is mainly chosen by the fact, what doctor sees the
      patient first, surgeon or gastroenterologist. This study is performed to evaluate if one
      therapy is superior.
