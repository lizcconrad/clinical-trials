        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  - Male or female β-thalassemia outpatients on chronic transfusion therapy (defined as
             &gt; 8 transfusions per year)

          -  Lifetime minimum of 100 previous packed red blood cell transfusions

          -  Patients currently on chelation therapy will require a one day wash out prior to the
             first dose of study drug

          -  Age ≥ 10 years

          -  Sexually active females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test and use an effective method of contraception, or must have undergone
             clinically documented total hysterectomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ejection Fraction &lt; 56 % measured using steady-state free precession imaging by MRI

          -  Contraindication to MRI, including cardiac pacemaker, brain aneurysm clip, implanted
             neurostimulator, insulin pump, cochlear implant, metal slivers in the eyes,
             intrauterine device or any other MRI incompatible metal implants or intractable
             claustrophobia

          -  Life-threatening arrhythmias, including sustained ventricular tachycardia and aborted
             sudden death, within the last year

          -  History of cardiac conditions or unstable cardiac disease not controlled by standard
             medical therapy

          -  History of clinically relevant ocular toxicity related to iron chelation

          -  Systemic diseases (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) which would prevent study
             treatment

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding (documented negative pregnancy test required for study
             entry)

          -  Patients enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial of deferasirox (ICL670) cannot be
             withdrawn in order to participate in this study

          -  Treatment with systemic investigational drug within the past 4 weeks or topical
             investigational drug within the past 7 days

          -  Other surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of any drug

          -  History of non-compliance to medical regimens or patients who are considered
             potentially unreliable and/or not cooperative

          -  Other inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
