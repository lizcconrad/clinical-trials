  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported recently that the detection of synovitis by ultrasonography was more
      sensitive than clinical examination (Wakefield et al. Ann Rheum Dis).

      An OMERACT and EULAR working party recently produced guidelines on the best way to record and
      score quantitatively synovitis of the small joints of the hands and feet (Wakefield R,
      D'Agostino MA).

      It has also been presumed recently that ultrasonography was more sensitive to changes than
      clinical examination after anti-TNF treatment (Ref. Taylor et al). If this better sensitivity
      to change were to be confirmed, ultrasonography would be preferred to clinical examination in
      studies evaluating new treatments.

      In everyday practice, better intrinsic validity of the evaluation of synovitis by
      ultrasonography would lead to widespread use of this technique in the diagnosis and treatment
      of rheumatoid arthritis patients.

      Objective of this study is to compare the sensitivity to change in synovitis score according
      to the monitoring method used (clinical examination versus ultrasonography).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, (10 French centers and 1 Belgian center), prospective (4-month
      patients' follow-up) interventional study in 120 patients with rheumatoid arthritis
      justifying anti-TNF treatment.

      The overall duration of the study will be 8 months composed of a 4-month inclusion period and
      a 4-month follow-up period for each patient. Moreover, X-ray evaluations of hands and feet
      will be performed 2 years from the beginning of the study in order to assess the changes in
      structural damage.

      During the patients' participation, 6 visits are planned: an inclusion visit then, a
      follow-up visit at 1, 2 and 3 months from the inclusion visit, and a final evaluation visit
      at 4 months from the inclusion visit. At each visit, synovitis will be evaluated using both
      methods: clinical examination and ultrasonography. For a same patient, clinical evaluation of
      synovitis will have to be performed - during the entire study - by the same rheumatologist
      and the ultrasonographic evaluation will have to be performed by the same ultrasonographist
      (different from the rheumatologist) and always using the same ultrasonograph.

      Finally, patients will be performed anterior X-rays of hands and feet two years from the
      beginning of the study whatever the ongoing RA treatment.

    <description>o The ultrasonographic evaluation was performed on 38 joints: the 28 joints included in DAS28 (e.g. shoulderx2, elbowx2, wristx2, metacarpo-phalangeal (MCP)x10, proximal inter phalangeal (PIP)x10, kneex2) and also the metatarso-phalangeal (MTPx10). Systematic multiplanar gray-scale (mode B) and Power Doppler examination was carried out with commercially available real-time scanners using multi-frequency linear transducers (7-12 MHz).
The ultrasonographic evaluation was performed at baseline and 1, 2, 3, and 4 months after baseline.</description>
