  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, health systems and practitioners are facing obesity epidemics. High blood
      pressure, dyslipidemia and diabetes prevalence will explode during the 21st century.

      The two main objectives of this 2-year controlled prospective study are:

        1. to demonstrate that, for patients with high blood pressure, diabetes and dyslipidemia,
           dietician conducted survey and management in combination with annual endocrinologist
           follow-up enable both attainment and maintenance of recommended blood pressure, glycemic
           and lipid goals, as well as smoking cessation;

        2. to demonstrate that dietician management is more cost effective than conventional care
           provided by general practitioners and endocrinologists.

      Results are expected to show significantly different cardiovascular risk profiles (BMI and
      waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, LDL-C, triglycerides and Total
      cholesterol/HDL ratio, HbA1c, smoking) between baseline and after 2 years follow-up. Sample
      size was determined in order to show statistically significant differences between the two
      groups.

      Results will document for the benefit of care givers, health economists and policy makers
      alike an innovative and integrated model of care which is expected to be effective at the
      patient level as well as cost effective with respect to the increasing financial burden of
      diabetes on the health system.
