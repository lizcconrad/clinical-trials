  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial will compare the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of Irinotecan
      and Oxaliplatin versus 5-FU/LV and Oxaliplatin as first line treatment in patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no regimen considered standard in advanced gastric cancer. The reported response
      rates of 5-FU-based combination chemotherapy are higher than single agents (10-50%) but more
      toxic. The combination of 5-FU/LV and LOHP has demonstrated an ORR of 43%, median TTP of
      approximately 6,5 months and OS of 8,6 months in phase II trials, with an acceptable
      toxicity.

      Irinotecan (CPT-11) is effective as salvage treatment in metastatic gastric cancer and has a
      synergistic activity with LOHP in preclinical trials

          -  Histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease.

          -  Measurable disease is defined as at least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion ≥ 20 mm
             by conventional techniques or 1 bidimensionally measurable lesion ≥ 20 X 10 mm.
             Lesions that are smaller or uni- or bidimensionally unmeasurable are considered as
             evaluable disease.
