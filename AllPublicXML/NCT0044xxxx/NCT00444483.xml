      The improvement of the quality of life (QoL) is one of the key treatment goals in patients
      with diabetes mellitus. Objective: Prospective study to evaluate the impact of structured
      diabetes education on the QoL in insulin-treated, elderly patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. Inpatients with insulin treated type 2 diabetes or failure of oral antidiabetic
      therapy were successively recruited and participated in the structured inpatient diabetes
      treatment and teaching program (DTTP) for insulin therapy QoL was assessed before and six
      months after participation in the DTTP with the standardised questionnaire of Lohr analysing
      the subscales: social relations, physical complaints, worries about the future, diet
      restrictions, fear of hypoglycemia, and daily struggles.

      All patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who were older than 54 years and admitted by
      general practitioner to the inpatient unit of the university hospital of Jena, Germany, for
      participation in a structured DTTP for insulin therapy because of hyperglycemia, were
      candidates for successive inclusion in the study. All patients participated in a five day
      inpatient structured DTTP for single or split dose administration of intermediate-acting
      insulin which included instruction in insulin injection, self- monitoring, hypoglycemia,
      acute/late complications, nutrition and foot care. Quality of life was assessed by using a
      validated instrument, the standardised QoL- questionnaire of Lohr et al. (21) both before and
      six months after participation in the DTTP. This questionnaire consists of 58 Likert- scaled
      items comprising the subscales: social relations, physical complaints, worries about the
      future, diet restrictions, fear of hypoglycemia, and daily struggles. Higher scores reflect
      higher quality of life with 100% as an optimum quality of life. The primary outcome measure
      regarding patients metabolic control was the improvement of quality of life six months after
      DTTP.
