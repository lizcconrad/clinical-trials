    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, open-label, non-comparative study to evaluate the long-term safety
      and efficacy profile of Adapalene/Benzoyl Peroxide Gel.

      Subjects are evaluated at Baseline, Weeks 1 and 2, and Months 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.

      Safety is evaluated by spontaneous reports of Adverse Events (AEs), the Local Tolerability
      Assessment (Erythema, Scaling, Dryness, and Stinging/Burning), routine laboratory testing
      (haematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis), and monitoring of suspected sensitizations.
      Efficacy is evaluated by analysis of Percent Change from Baseline in Inflammatory,
      Noninflammatory, and Total Lesion Counts, and by the Subjectâ€™s Assessment of Acne.
