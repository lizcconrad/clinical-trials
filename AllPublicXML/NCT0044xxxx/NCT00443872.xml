  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if reducing or eliminating a dopamine agonist (DA)
      causing one of the side effects of daytime sleepiness, swelling of the lower legs or feet,
      hallucinations or impulsive behaviors while adding orally disintegrating selegiline can
      eliminate the adverse effect and maintain control of Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Symptomatic therapy is
      primarily aimed at restoring dopamine function in the brain. Levodopa is the most effective
      symptomatic treatment; however, long term use is associated with motor fluctuations (periods
      of return of PD symptoms when medication effect wears off) and dyskinesia (drug induced
      involuntary movements including chorea and dystonia). Once patients develop motor
      fluctuations treatment options include increasing the frequency of levodopa dosing, switching
      to sustained-release levodopa, adding other therapies including monoamine oxidase type B
      (MAO-B) inhibitors, dopamine agonists, catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors and in
      patients with severe motor fluctuations deep brain stimulation surgery. There are no good
      evidence based studies indicating whether the use of one of these class of drugs is superior
      to the other nor are there treatment algorithms that recommend which class of drug should be
      initiated when the patients initially develop motor fluctuations. It is believed that the
      efficacy of the different drug classes is similar. However, the frequency of adverse effects
      may differ between drug classes, but such studies are lacking. In clinical practice when
      patients develop adverse effects to a drug from one class, a drug from another class is
      substituted in an attempt to maintain efficacy with reduced adverse effects.

      Dopamine agonists often have a higher risk of adverse effects compared to MAO B inhibitors.
      Therefore, the rationale for this study is that the addition of orally disintegrating
      selegiline after the reduction or discontinuation of the offending dopamine agonist will
      result in comparable efficacy with reduced adverse events. This study will assess the safety
      and efficacy of the addition of orally disintegrating selegiline in PD patients who are
      having adverse effects to dopamine agonists for which a dose reduction of the dopamine
      agonist is being considered. All patients in the study will receive orally disintegrating
      selegiline 1.25 mg once a day and the dose will be increased to 2.5 mg once a day if
      tolerated.

      Comparisons: The status of the adverse event at the end of the study while on orally
      disintegrating selegiline will be compared to the adverse event at the start of the study. In
      addition, efficacy will be compared at the start of the study while on the dopamine agonist
      to the end of the study with orally disintegrating selegiline.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale Score for Those With Daytime Sleepiness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of daytime sleepiness. The test is a list of eight situations in which one rates their tendency to become sleepy on a scale of 0, no change of dozing to 3, high chance of dozing. The total score ranges fro 0-24, with higher values representing excessive sleepiness. A score of greater than 10 represents clinically significant sleepiness.</description>

    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Hallucinations Scale Score for Those With Hallucinations</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Report of hallucinations with insight maintained based on the hallucinations questions of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The participant and their caregiver are asked a series of questions to determine if hallucinations are present. If present they rate the frequency of hallucinations on a scale of 1 (rarely, less than once a week) to 4, very often (once or more daily). They also rate the severity of the hallucinations, as mild (1 - present but harmless and cause little distress), moderate (2 - distressing and disruptive) or severe (3 - very disruptive, major source of behavioral disturbance, may need meds). The frequency and severity scores are multiplied (maximum score 12, with higher scores representing more distress/disability) for the total score.</description>

    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS activities of daily living sub scale has 14 questions regarding the ability to perform daily activities like dressing, eating, etc. These questions are completed by the patient and each question has 5 responses ranging from 0 (no problems) to 4 (severe disability/cannot do). The total score for this sub scale is the sum of the scores for the 14 questions (higher scores represent greater disability), maximum score is 56.
The motor assessment is completed by the investigator. There are 14 questions evaluating motor function in various body parts, representing 27 individual items (i.e., some questions, such as rigidity, are rated for 5 different body parts, other questions, such as finger tapping, are rated on both the right and left sides, and other questions are rated individually). Each item has 5 responses, 0 being none/no disability and 4 being the most severe disability. The 27 items are summed (higher scores represent greater disability); maximum score is 108.</description>

    <measure>PDQ-39 Quality of Life Assessment Total Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-39 is a measure of quality of life, it has 8 sub scales and a total score. For this study only the total score was examined. There are a total of 39 questions related to the following 8 sub scales: ability/difficulty to perform motor activities, ability to perform daily activities, cognition, emotional well being, stigma, social support, communication, bodily discomfort; each question with 5 responses (0, no/never, 4 always). The total score is calculated by adding the scores for each of the 39 items, dividing by 39 x 4 (maximum score for all 39 items) and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage score ranging from 0-100 with 100 representing the most disability and greatest impact on quality of life.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with levodopa-induced motor fluctuations were enrolled at 12 sites in the United States. The first subject was enrolled in March 2007, and the last subject completed in September 2008.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Excessive daytime sleepiness was defined by an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score greater than 10; pedal edema was bothersome to the subject; hallucinations were bothersome, but insight was maintained; and impulse control disorders (ICDs) included behaviors not requiring immediate medical attention and not harmful to the patient or to others.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Report of hallucinations with insight maintained based on the hallucinations questions of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The participant and their caregiver are asked a series of questions to determine if hallucinations are present. If present they rate the frequency of hallucinations on a scale of 1 (rarely, less than once a week) to 4, very often (once or more daily). They also rate the severity of the hallucinations, as mild (1 - present but harmless and cause little distress), moderate (2 - distressing and disruptive) or severe (3 - very disruptive, major source of behavioral disturbance, may need meds). The frequency and severity scores are multiplied (maximum score 12, with higher scores representing more distress/disability) for the total score.</description>

The total score for this sub scale is the sum of the scores for the 14 questions (higher scores represent greater disability), maximum score is 56.
The motor assessment is completed by the investigator. There are 14 questions evaluating motor function in various body parts, representing 27 individual items (i.e., some questions, such as rigidity, are rated for 5 different body parts, other questions, such as finger tapping, are rated on both the right and left sides, and other questions are rated individually). Each item has 5 responses, 0 being none/no disability and 4 being the most severe disability. The 27 items are summed (higher scores represent greater disability); maximum score is 108.</description>

        <title>PDQ-39 Quality of Life Assessment Total Scores</title>
        <description>The PDQ-39 is a measure of quality of life, it has 8 sub scales and a total score. For this study only the total score was examined. There are a total of 39 questions related to the following 8 sub scales: ability/difficulty to perform motor activities, ability to perform daily activities, cognition, emotional well being, stigma, social support, communication, bodily discomfort; each question with 5 responses (0, no/never, 4 always). The total score is calculated by adding the scores for each of the 39 items, dividing by 39 x 4 (maximum score for all 39 items) and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage score ranging from 0-100 with 100 representing the most disability and greatest impact on quality of life.</description>
