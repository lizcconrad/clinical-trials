  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine (BPN) is an approved treatment for opioid dependence, however, in taking oral
      tablets, patients experience withdrawal and cravings when the variable BPN levels in the
      blood are low. Probuphine is an implant placed just beneath the skin that contains BPN. It is
      designed to provide 6 months of stable BPN blood levels. This study will test the safety and
      efficacy of Probuphine in the treatment of patients with opioid dependence.
