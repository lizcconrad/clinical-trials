    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Tumor Response at 12 Weeks From First Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST): Complete response (CR), disappearance of all lesions; partial response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the measurements of the largest lesions; stable disease (SD), insufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or insufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD); PD, &gt;=20% increase in measurements of lesions or appearance of new lesions. Data were not fully analyzed due to early study termination.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Remained Progression-free 12 Weeks After Randomization</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 after randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who did not show signs of progressive disease 12 weeks after receiving lapatinib or placebo in Stage 2 of the study (participants who maintained SD in Stage 1 were randomized to either lapatinib or placebo) was measured. Formal statistics for treatment comparison were not performed, due to early study termination. The percentage of participants displayed below includes those with CR + PR + SD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>(assessments every 12 weeks until death for withdrawn participants and every 3 weeks for participants continuing on lapatinib)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was calculated as the time from first documented partial response (PR; &gt;=30% decrease in the measurements of the largest lesions) or complete response (CR; disappearance of all lesions) until disease progression, the time when the participant began a new anti-cancer therapy, or death. Data were not analyzed due to early study termination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment to disease progression/death (assessments every 12 weeks until death for withdrawn participants and every 3 weeks for participants continuing on lapatinib)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival was calculated as the time from the start of treatment until disease progression or death. For participants who did not have disease progression or did not die, the date on which alternative anti-cancer therapy began was used, or the date of last contact (if sooner). The word used for such participants was &quot;censored&quot;. Data were not analyzed due to early study termination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Disease Progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment to disease progression/death (up to 83.3 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to disease progression was calculated as the time from the start of treatment to disease progression or death due to disease progression. For participants who did not progress, the date of last contact was used and for those who died due to other causes, the date of death was used. The word used for such participants was &quot;censored&quot;. As the median value in the placebo arm was not reached (2 participants were censored and 2 were ongoing), results for the placebo arm are not displayed in the table below.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Change in Cancer Antigen-125 (CA-125) Levels From Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose and every 6 weeks until withdrawal (up to 84.1 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>CA-125 is a &quot;tumor marker&quot;, found in greater concentration in tumor cells than other cells of the body. In particular, CA-125 is present in greater concentration in ovarian cancer cells than in other cells. A decreasing level generally indicates that therapy has been effective, whereas an increasing level indicates tumor recurrence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of MET Amplification in Gastric Cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>Performed on archived tissue collected at screening.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of gastric cancer participants with MET amplification (determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] assay) compared to the total number of gastric cancer participants screened was to be recorded. Amplification of the MET gene has been reported to be related to carcinogenesis, progression of gastric cancer, and poor prognosis. Data were not analyzed due to early study termination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of ErbB2-positive Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening</time_frame>
    <description>The number of ErbB2-positive participants (determined by FISH assay) compared to the total number of participants screened was to be recorded. Over-expression of ErbB2 has been correlated with an overall poor prognosis. Data were not analyzed, due to early study termination.</description>

    <description>Subjects administered open label lapatinib, 1500 mg to be taken orally once a day, for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, subjects with a partial or complete response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) will continue to receive open label lapatinib (1500 mg/day orally) until disease progression. Subjects who maintain stable disease will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to enter stage 2 of the study and receive double blind therapy of either lapatinib 1500 mg/day orally or placebo. Subjects who progress on placebo will have the option to receive lapatinib 1500 mg/day orally until further progression. Those who progress on lapatinib will be withdrawn from the study.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Participants maintaining stable disease (SD) in Stage 1 (open label) were randomized to double-blind lapatinib 1500 milligrams (mg)/day or placebo (Stage 2). Of 32 participants in Stage 1, 7 maintained SD and were randomized into Stage 2.
