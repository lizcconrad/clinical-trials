      To adjust our forearm model for ischemia reperfusion injury, in order to used it for
      assessment of ischemia reperfusion damage in elderly and patients.

      To test the effect of ischemic postconditioning on ischemia reperfusion injury in healthy
      volunteers, using Annexin binding after repetitive handgripping.

    <textblock>
      Recently, ischemic postconditioning has been identified as a protective intervention against
      ischemia-reperfusion injury. In animal studies, the signalling pathway of this (impressive)
      protective phenomenon is very similar to ischemic preconditioning. It opens a new avenue of
      post-reperfusion interventions with drugs that have been shown to mimic ischemic
      preconditioning. Before we can study this phenomenon in our forearm ischemia-reperfusion
      model, we need additional validating experiments. The purpose of this study proposal is to
      provide these data.
