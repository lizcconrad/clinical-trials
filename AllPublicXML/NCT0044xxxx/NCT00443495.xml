  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chitin microparticles (CMP) has been demonstrated in animal studies that have modelled
      allergic rhinitis to be effective against a wide range of common respiratory allergens. It is
      an immuneenhancer.

      The primary purpose of the study is to demonstrate safety in a first into man study on 24
      human volunteers. The secondary objective is to demonstrate efficacy by chosing subjects that
      demonstrate a response to a nasal allergen challenge using grass pollen.

      The subjects are being given increasing doses of CMP, supplied as a nasal spray, for 7 days
      followed by a nasal allergen challenge with Timothy Grass Pollen extract. Over this period
      nasal symptom scores, eosinophil counts and cytokine measurements will be performed.

    <textblock>
      Chitin microparticles are a special preparation of chitin. This a long chain polysaccaride
      derived from shells of the North Atlantic shrimp. CMP acts a an immunenhancer which improve
      immune function by stimulating macrophages and other cells such as T-helper lymphocytes, (Th
      cells). In allergies there is an imbalance between Th1 and Th2 cells. Imuneenhancers shift
      the balance in favour of Th1 cells. The immunomodulatory properties of CMP have been
      demonstrated in animal models against a wide range of respiratory allergens. There have been
      no indications of toxic side effects in animal models.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males aged 18 to 50 years of age inclusive with a history of symptoms of allergic
             rhinitis within the previous two years.

          2. Subjects must be free from clinically significant cardiac, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, haematological, neurological and psychiatric disease
             as determined by history, physical examination and screening investigations.

          3. Forced expiratory volume over one second (FEV1) within normal limits (≥ 90% of
             predicted, ECCS 1993).

          4. Asymptomatic at screening as characterized by:

               1. Normal appearing nasal mucosa with no active allergic rhinitis.

               2. A pre-nasal allergen challenge total nasal symptom score sheet on study entry so
                  that subjects produce a score of &lt;2 at screening.

          5. Non smokers for at least the past 12 months with a pack history ≤ 1 pack years (Pack
             years = (n of cigarettes smoked/day/20) x n of years smoked).

          6. An increase in nasal symptom score of between 4 and 10 following screening nasal
             allergen challenge.

          7. Capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements
             and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          8. Available to complete the study.

          9. Negative urinary drugs of abuse screen, determined at screening and in the 24 hours
             before the first dose of study medication.

         10. Negative carbon monoxide test (smokerlyzer) determined at screening and in the 24
             hours before the first dose of study medication.

         11. Clinically normal vital signs and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), determined at
             screening.

         12. A body mass index (Quetlet index) in the range of 18.00 to 30.9.

          1. Perennial rhinitis.
