  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer will be enrolled to receive RAD001 to determine
      whether the use of RAD001 will result in an improvement in the time to tumor progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer will be enrolled in the study if all eligibility
      criteria are met and they agree to participate. The participant will take RAD001 (Everolimus)
      10mg by mouth once a day. During the first cycle, they will have blood work done once a week
      (4 weeks). On cycles thereafter they will have blood work on days 7 and 21. Once a month, the
      patient will have a chest x-ray. Every 8 weeks the patient will have a CT scan of the chest,
      abdomen and pelvis. If clinically indicated, additional tests will be done.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have predominantly clear cell renal cancer (75%)

          -  Patients must have evidence of metastatic disease. Metastatic disease should not be
             progressing so as to require palliative treatment (e.g., radiation, surgery, etc),
             within 4 weeks of enrollment.

          -  Patients may have received no more than two prior regimens such as immunotherapy,
             chemotherapy or molecular targeted agents for renal cell carcinoma with at least 1
             regimen consisting of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (sorafenib or sunitinib). Four weeks
             must have elapsed from previous therapy.

          -  Patients must have adequate physiologic reserves as evidenced by lab values

          -  Effective birth control must be practiced by both male and female patients

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with central nervous system metastases are excluded, except those patients
             who have had complete excision or radiotherapy and remain asymptomatic, off steroids
             for 21 days, with no evidence of new disease as shown by MRI

          -  Patients known to be HIV positive are not eligible, although testing specifically for
             participation in this protocol is not required.

          -  Patients with a recent history of TIA (within 6 months), or are requiring regular
             antianginal therapy or are having claudication sufficient to limit activity are not
             eligible. Patients with a previous history of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary
             embolism are not eligible.

          -  Patients with active autoimmune disease.

          -  Patients who have had steroid therapy within the past three weeks.

          -  Patients involving concurrent anticancer drug therapy. Any immunosuppressive drugs or
             any other experimental therapy.

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  The patient has an unstable medical condition, such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus
             or hypertension; active infections requiring systemic antibiotics, antivirals, or
             antifungals; clinical evidence of cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction including, but not
             limited to: unstable CHF; uncontrolled arrhythmias; unstable coagulation disorders; or
             recent myocardial infarction (within 6 months).

          -  The patient has received any investigational agent(s) within 4 weeks of study entry.

          -  Patients with evidence of mucosal or internal bleeding and/or platelet refractory
             (i.e., unable to maintain a platelet count &gt; 50,000 cells/mm3).

          -  Patients unable to maintain an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of &lt; 1,500 cells/mm3.

          -  Any condition, including laboratory abnormalities, that in the opinion of the
             Investigator places the patient at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in
             the study.

          -  Prior malignancy (within the last 3 years) except for adequately treated basal cell or
             squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the
             patient has been disease-free for at least 3 years.
