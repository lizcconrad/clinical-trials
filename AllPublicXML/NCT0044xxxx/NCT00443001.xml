    <textblock>
      This protocol focuses on the evaluation of the GE noninvasive blood pressure parameter in
      subjects with dysrhythmias and normal sinus rhythm. The study follows the recommendations of
      the ANSI/AAMI SP10 Standard.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  signed informed consent

          -  a patient who is undergoing a specialized procedure such as a surgical procedure or
             cardiac catheterization, or during critical care monitoring in which a central
             arterial catheter is in place to determine systolic, diastolic, and/or mean arterial
             blood pressure values.

          -  ability to monitor ECG, NIBP and/or pulse oximetry

          -  presence of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or normal sinus rhythm

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  any subject deemed too unstable, at the clinician's discretion, to participate in the
             study

          -  any subject with a cardiac or vascular malformation that results in an abnormal
             waveform inappropriate to be considered a reference standard

          -  any subject with a cardiac anomaly that would cause a disparity between aortic
             pressures and the periphery.

          -  presence of peripheral vascular disease in arms

          -  inability to perform a minimum of 4 fast flushes (two at the study beginning and two
             at the study end) on an arterial catheter or line in order to determine a frequency
             response. The volume of fluid will not exceed a total pre-specified by the Principal
             Investigator or designee.

          -  if the baseline arm to arm mean difference is &gt; 10 mmHg, then the differences will be
             recorded and evaluated by the Principal Investigator for possible subject exclusion
             from the data analysis.

          -  subjects who, at the clinician's discretion, could not tolerate approximately 5 to 12,
             but possibly up to 25 repeated blood pressures on each arm
