  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type I diabetes (T1DM) is associated with an increased risk of vascular complications. While
      the precise mechanism(s) by which diabetes accelerates atherosclerosis has not been
      elucidated, several lines of evidence point to the role of increased inflammation in the
      pathogenesis of these vasculopathies. The monocyte-macrophage is a pivotal cell in
      atherogenesis and is readily accessible for study. However, there is scanty data on monocyte
      function and inflammation in T1DM. Simvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has recently
      been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in diabetic patients (T1DM and T2DM in the Heart
      Protection Study). Recent studies demonstrate that simvastatin decreased C-reactive protein
      and decreased pro-atherogenic activity of monocytes in non-diabetic subjects. However, there
      is a paucity of data on the effect of simvastatin on inflammation and monocyte function in
      Type 1 diabetes.

      Thus, the purpose of this study is Aim 1) to assess biomarkers of inflammation in T1DM
      compared to matched controls (n=50/group). Aim 2) Also, we will assess the effect of
      simvastatin (20mg/day) therapy on inflammation and monocyte function in T1DM in a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double blind trial.

      At baseline and post-therapy, fasting blood will be obtained for routine laboratories
      (including lipid profile, glucose, glycated hemoglobin), free fatty acid levels, biomarkers
      of inflammation [high sensitive C-reactive protein, plasma soluble cell adhesion molecules
      (sVCAM,sICAM, sE-selectin and sP-selectin) , CD40 ligand, monocyte pro-atherogenic activity
      (superoxide anion, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6 and tumor
      necrosis factor-a release, adhesion to human aortic endothelium, CD40 expression)] etc., and
      24-hour urine for microalbumin

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Type I diabetic patients (onset &lt; 20years and on insulin therapy since diagnosis)
             without clinical macrovascular complications, present age &gt; 20 years with duration of
             diabetes &gt; 1yr.
