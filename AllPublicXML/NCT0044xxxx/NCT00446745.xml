  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have demonstrated that excess perivisceral adipose tissue is associated with
      metabolic diseases such as insulin resistance.

      In skeletal muscle, insulin resistance has been correlated with reduced mitochondrial
      oxidative functions. According to the actual theory, mitochondrial dysfunctions are proposed
      to play a causal role in the aetiology of insulin resistance. Mechanisms involve increased
      intramyocellular lipids storage. Yet, the causes responsible for the decline in muscle
      mitochondrial functions remain to be elucidated.

      The investigators hypothesize that these alterations are induced by combined changes in
      plasma profiles of lipids and adipokines, which originate from perivisceral adipose tissue.
      The study aims at answering the following questions :

        -  Are muscle mitochondrial functions altered in association with increased perivisceral
           adipose tissue storage?

        -  Do changes in the pattern of plasma lipids and adipokines explain this correlation?

      Sixty 35 to 50-years old sedentary men will be included based on their abdominal
      circumference (from 75 to over 102 cm).

      Body composition will be evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and perivisceral,
      intramuscular and intrahepatic adiposity will be assess by MRI and proton-NMR spectroscopy.
      Subjects will be also characterized by their glucose tolerance (OGTT), basal metabolism
      (indirect calorimetry) and maximal oxygen consumption (maximal aerobic power test on exercise
      bike).

      Blood samples will be collected in the fasted state to assess lipids and adipokines
      concentrations.

      Biopsies will be obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle to examine mitochondrial functions
      (respiration rates, ATP and superoxide anion production rates, maximal activity of oxidative
      enzyme). Gene expression of key enzymes, protein and transcription factors involved in lipid
      and energy metabolism will be assessed using real-time quantitative PCR.

      Finally, whole body and muscle protein metabolism will be investigated in half of the
      subjects using tracer infusion (incorporation of L-[1-13C]leucine) and biopsies from vastus
      lateralis, both in the post-absorptive and post-prandial states (test meal)
