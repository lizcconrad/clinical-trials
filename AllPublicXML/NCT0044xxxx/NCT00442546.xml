  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregabalin added to the standard of care with dosing starting preoperatively and continuing
      for up to 6 weeks post surgery will decrease the intensity of post-operative pain following
      total knee replacement.

    <measure>Subject Reported Worst Pain Score in Daily Diaries Using the Worst Pain Item of the Modified Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (m-BPI-sf)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The mBPI-SF is a self administered questionnaire developed to assess pain severity and pain interference with functional activities during a 24-hour period prior to evaluation. For the Worst Pain item of the m-BPI-sf scale (11 point Likert scale; range: 0 [no pain] to 10 [pain as bad as you can imagine]), subjects were asked to rate their pain by marking an &quot;X&quot; in one of the ten boxes that best described their pain at its worst in the last 24 hours post surgery and at least 12 hours after discontinuation of the peripheral nerve block or neuroaxial block.</description>

    <time_frame>24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 120 hours, 144 hours, 168 hours, 192 hours, 216 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Total cumulative dose calculated as mg of oral morphine equivalent and included opioids given by any route (patient controlled analgesia [PCA] pump, parenteral bolus or oral). Results for daily total not including pregabalin (not an opioid). Statistical model included main effect of treatment group and center. 1 subject at 144 h, 300 mg=non-missing data. Due to small sample size (N=1, 300 mg; N=5, other groups) and large opioid consumption for another subject in same center, least squares mean (300 mg, 144 h) is negative.</description>

Includes 10 descriptors ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (worst symptoms imaginable) and 2 temporal items assessing duration of spontaneous ongoing and paroxysmal pain. Questionnaire generates a score in each relevant dimension. Total score is calculated as the sum of scores of the 10 descriptors, range: 0-100. Higher score indicates greater intensity of pain.</description>

        <description>The mBPI-SF is a self administered questionnaire developed to assess pain severity and pain interference with functional activities during a 24-hour period prior to evaluation. For the Worst Pain item of the m-BPI-sf scale (11 point Likert scale; range: 0 [no pain] to 10 [pain as bad as you can imagine]), subjects were asked to rate their pain by marking an &quot;X&quot; in one of the ten boxes that best described their pain at its worst in the last 24 hours post surgery and at least 12 hours after discontinuation of the peripheral nerve block or neuroaxial block.</description>

        <description>The amount of opioid use was calculated as mg of oral morphine equivalent and included opioids administered by any route (PCA pump, parenteral bolus, or oral). Weeks 2, 4, and 6 total daily doses were calculated by adding the cumulative doses during the 2 week period prior to the visit and dividing them by the number of days in the period. This outcome measure does not include pregabalin as it is not an opioid.</description>

        <title>The Effect of Pregabalin Compared to Placebo on the Occurrence of Opioid-Related Symptoms as Assessed Using the Opioid-Related Symptom Distress Scale (OR-SDS) - Frequency Composite Score</title>
        <description>The OR-SDS was used to assess subject-reported levels of frequency concerning 10 symptoms known to be associated with opioid medication usage: fatigue, drowsiness, inability to concentrate, nausea, dizziness, constipation, itching, difficulty with urination, confusion, and retching/vomiting. Symptom frequency was rated as: 1=rarely, 2=occasionally, 3=frequently, or 4=almost constantly. The average score for each symptom was calculated by taking the mean of patient-reported score. Total possible frequency score: 0 (less frequent) to 4 (more frequent).</description>

        <title>The Effect of Pregabalin Compared to Placebo on the Occurrence of Opioid-Related Symptoms as Assessed Using the OR-SDS - Severity Composite Score</title>
        <description>The OR-SDS was used to assess subject-reported levels of severity concerning 10 symptoms known to be associated with opioid medication usage: fatigue, drowsiness, inability to concentrate, nausea, dizziness, constipation, itching, difficulty with urination, confusion, and retching/vomiting. Symptom severity was rated as: 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=severe, or 4=very severe. The average score for each symptom was calculated by taking the mean of patient-reported score. Total possible severity score: 0 (less severe) to 4 (more severe).</description>

        <title>The Effect of Pregabalin Compared to Placebo on the Occurrence of Opioid-Related Symptoms as Assessed Using the OR-SDS - Degree of Bother Composite Score</title>
        <description>The OR-SDS was used to assess subject-reported level of degree of bother concerning 10 symptoms known to be associated with opioid medication usage: fatigue, drowsiness, inability to concentrate, nausea, dizziness, constipation, itching, difficulty with urination, confusion, and retching/vomiting. Symptom degree of bother was rated as: 1=not at all, 2=a little bit, 3=somewhat, 4=quite a bit, or 5=very much. Average score for each symptom was calculated by taking the mean of patient-reported score. Total possible degree of bother score: 0 (less degree of bother) to 5 (greater degree of bother).</description>

        <description>The OR-SDS assessed subject-reported levels of frequency, severity and degree of bother for 10 symptoms known to be associated with opioid medication usage: fatigue, drowsiness, inability to concentrate, nausea, dizziness, constipation, itching, difficulty with urination, confusion, retching and vomiting. The overall composite score was the average across frequency, severity, and degree of bother scores. Total possible score: 0 (better) to 4.34 (worse).</description>

        <description>CMEs were defined using OR-SDS (assesses subject-reported levels of severity concerning 10 symptoms associated with opioid medication usage: fatigue, drowsiness, inability to concentrate, nausea, dizziness, constipation, itching, difficulty with urination, confusion and retching/vomiting). CME = any symptom rated as severe or very severe, with the exception of confusion. Confusion was defined as a CME if the severity score was at least moderate. Total score = the sum of CMEs across symptoms. Each CME = 1 point. Total CME score ranges from 0 to 9.</description>

        <title>Pain Interference Index Score as Measured by the m-BPI-sf</title>
        <description>m-BPI-sf questionnaire (7-items) assessed pain interference with functional activities during the past 24 hours. Pain interference index = average of pain interference question (Q) 5A to 5G. Questions were asked as follows: how, during the past 24 hours, has pain interfered with general activity (Q5A), mood (Q5B), walking ability (Q5C), normal work (outside home and housework) (Q5D), relations with other people (Q5E), sleep (Q5F), enjoyment of life (Q5G). Scale: 0=does not interfere to 10=completely interferes.</description>

        <description>m-BPI-sf questionnaire (7-items) assessed pain interference with functional activities during the past 24 hours. Q5D: Subject response to ‘how, during the past 24 hours, pain has interfered with your normal work (work outside the home and housework)’. Scale: 0 = does not interfere to 10 = completely interferes.</description>

Includes 10 descriptors ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (worst symptoms imaginable) and 2 temporal items assessing duration of spontaneous ongoing and paroxysmal pain. Questionnaire generates a score in each relevant dimension. Total score is calculated as the sum of scores of the 10 descriptors, range: 0-100. Higher score indicates greater intensity of pain.</description>
