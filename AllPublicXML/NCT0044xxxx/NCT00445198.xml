  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1 portion of the study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of
      ABT-263 with the objective of defining the dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose.
      (This portion of the study is complete). The Phase 2a portion of the study will evaluate
      ABT-263 at the defined recommended Phase 2 dose to obtain additional safety information and a
      preliminary assessment of efficacy.
