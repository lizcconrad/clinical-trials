  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether Carvedilol, an FDA approved beta
      blocker, when administered for an 8-week period to veterans currently undergoing treatment
      for methamphetamine dependence (1) improves their ability to stay in treatment longer,
      (2)eases the aversive symptoms that accompany stimulant withdrawal, and (3) increases the
      time they remain abstinent from methamphetamine.
