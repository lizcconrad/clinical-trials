      The objective of this study is to compare in Chinese subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
      the efficacy and safety in this subject population of 50 mg once-weekly injections of
      etanercept versus placebo in subjects receiving methotrexate. This is a multi-center,
      double-blind, randomized, parallel and placebo-controlled outpatient study. Approximately 150
      subjects will participate in this study for about 18 weeks including a screening period up to
      4 weeks, 12-week treatment period, and a 2-week follow-up period at approximately 25 sites.
