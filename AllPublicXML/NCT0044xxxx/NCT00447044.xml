  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a combination of resistance exercises and amino acid
      capsules can reduce muscle loss and maintain muscle function during bedrest. This experiment
      will imitate many of the physical conditions experienced by astronauts during space flight by
      examining the effects of resistance exercise or nutrition on muscle during 2 days of bedrest.
      The diet of astronauts will also be imitated by providing diets in the General Clinic
      Research Center.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18-50 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with limiting or unstable angina or a cardiology confirmed ECG which
             demonstrates cardiac abnormalities such as &gt; 0.2 mV horizontal or downsloping ST
             segment depression, frequent arrhythmia's (&gt;10 PVC/min), or valvular disease.

          -  Subjects with vascular disease as determined by a combination of risk factors of
             peripheral atherosclerosis, namely hypertension, obesity, diabetes,

          -  Pregnancy/lactation.

          -  Any other condition or event considered exclusionary by the PI and covering faculty
