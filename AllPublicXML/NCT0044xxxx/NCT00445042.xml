  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and toxicity levels of Dose Escalated
      Sorafenib in the treatment of patients with renal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because tumors may have multiple mechanisms to induce angiogenesis, blockade with sorafenib
      may demonstrate efficacy. Doses of sorafenib (400 mg b.i.d.) as a single agent is with
      minimal toxicity, presents an opportunity to explore a more intensive drug administration.
      This study will allow individual patient titration (e,g,, intrapatient dose escalation) as
      per protocol.

      This provides the basis for the dose escalation development of sorafenib. The study is
      designed to evaluate the ability for patients to dose escalate. Secondary endpoints include;
      response, time to progression, and overall survival in patients with MRCC. Tissue correlation
      to evaluate the impact of expression of receptor on clinical outcome will be retrospectively
      performed. Laboratory correlation of plasma VEGF levels will be correlated and evaluated to
      clinical outcome.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytological confirmed metastatic or unresectable clear cell renal
             cell carcinoma.

          -  No more than one prior systemic therapy. No prior vascular endothelial growth factor
             receptor agents.

          -  Patients with primary tumor in place are strongly encouraged to undergo nephrectomy
             prior to initiation of study agent.

          -  Prior palliative radiotherapy to metastatic lesion(s) is permitted.

          -  All major surgery of any type and/or radiotherapy must be completed at least 4 weeks
             prior to registration.

          -  Patients must have metastatic or unresectable disease.

          -  Paraffin RCC tissue blocks or unstained slides must be available.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 % .

          -  Not pregnant

          -  Age &gt; 18

          -  Must meet required initial laboratory values

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No ongoing hemoptysis, or cerebrovascular accident within 12 months, or peripheral
             vascular disease with claudication on less than 1 block, or history of clinically
             significant bleeding.

          -  No deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus within one year of study enrollment and
             no ongoing need for full-dose oral or parenteral anticoagulation. Low dose coumadin (1
             mg) for maintenance of catheter patency or daily prophylactic aspirin is allowed.

          -  No evidence of current central nervous system (CNS) metastasis. All patients must
             undergo an MRI or CT scan of the brain (with contrast, if possible) within 42 days
             prior to registration. Any imaging abnormality indicative of CNS metastases will
             exclude the patient from the study.

          -  No significant cardiovascular disease defined as congestive heart failure (New York
             Heart Association Class II, II or IV) angina pectoris requiring nitrate therapy, or

             systolic and/or &gt; 90 mmHg diastolic on medication).

          -  Any ongoing requirement for systemic corticosteroid therapy is not permitted. Topical
             and/or inhaled steroids are allowed.

             normal range by medication are ineligible.

          -  No uncontrolled psychiatric disorder.

          -  Patients with a 'currently active' second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin
             cancers are not eligible. Patients are not considered to have a 'currently active'
             malignancy if they have completed anti-cancer therapy and are considered by their
             physician to be a less than 30% risk of relapse.
