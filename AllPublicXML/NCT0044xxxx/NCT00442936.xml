  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of telcagepant (MK-0974)
      compared to an approved medication for acute migraine. This study was conducted as a
      &quot;triple-dummy&quot; design; for each dose of study drug, participants each received 3 forms of
      study drug (2 capsules of active and/or placebo and 1 tablet of active and/or placebo) and
      were instructed to take one of each form of study drug at dosing time.

      The primary hypotheses of this study are that telcagepant is superior to placebo in Pain
      Freedom at 2 Hours Post-Dose, Pain Relief at 2 Hours Post-Dose, Absence of Photophobia at 2
      Hours Post-Dose, Absence of Phonophobia at 2 Hours Post-Dose and Absence of Nausea at 2 Hours
      Post-Dose.

    <time_frame>2 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to rate their migraine headache severity with ratings of 0=No pain, 1=Mild pain, 2=Moderate pain, and 3=Severe pain. PF at 2 hours post-dose is defined as a decrease from a moderate or severe migraine headache (Grade 2 or 3) at baseline to no pain (Grade 0) at 2 hours post-dose.</description>
