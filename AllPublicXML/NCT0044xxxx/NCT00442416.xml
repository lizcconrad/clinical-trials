  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm study will compare the efficacy of monthly Mircera and epoetin alfa in peritoneal
      dialysis patients who self-inject at home or receive in-centre injections. The safety of
      subcutaneous (sc) Mircera and injection site reactions and patient satisfaction will also be
      assessed. Eligible patients will be randomized either to receive monthly sc injections of
      Mircera (and will be switched from sc epoetin alfa) at a starting dose of 120-360 micrograms,
      or to remain on standard of care sc epoetin alfa. Dose adjustments will be permitted to
      reach/maintain a hemoglobin level of 10-12g/dL. The anticipated time on study treatment is
      3-12 months, and the target sample size is 380 individuals.

    <time_frame>Up to Month 9</time_frame>
    <description>Erythropoietin is human protein which helps to make more RBCs and is used for the treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease. However, during treatment with erythropoietin, anti-erythropoietin antibody (Anti-EPO) may develop in human serum. These antibodies have been shown to cross-react with all ESAs and leads to failure to respond to treatment. Number of participants with anti-EPO antibody that are quantifiable and those that were &quot;below the limit of quantification (BLQ)&quot; at Baseline (Day 0) and Visit 17 (Month 9 [M 9]) or final visit/early termination in human serum samples are reported.</description>

The first dose of Mircera (120, 200, or 360 mcg) will be based upon the dose of epoetin alfa received 1 to 2 weeks prior to administration of study drug, while subsequent doses will be adjusted to maintain haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations within target of &gt;=10.0 gram per decilitre (g/dL) and &lt;=12.0 g/dL. Participants who self-administered/visited to clinics for erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) dosing prior to randomization will continue to do so.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted in the United States from 27 February 2007 to 01 January 2008. The study was prematurely terminated during enrolment due to legal reasons.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 80 participants were randomized, of which 78 participants received the study drug and 2 participants did not receive the study drug nor had post baseline safety assessments.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Eligible participants were administered RO0503821 (methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta [Mircera]) subcutaneously (SC) every month for eight months (6 months of titration period [TP] and two months of evaluation period [EP] and 15-days following the final study visit (9 months post randomization). The first dose of Mircera (120, 200, or 360 mcg) was based upon the dose of epoetin alfa received 1 to 2 weeks prior to administration of study drug, while subsequent doses were adjusted to maintain haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations within target of &gt;=10.0 gram per decilitre (g/dL) and &lt;=12.0 g/dL. Participants who self-administered/visited to clinics for erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) dosing prior to randomization continued to do so.</description>

          <description>RO0503821 is a chemically modified erythropoietin which helps to make more RBCs and is used for the treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease. However, during treatment with RO0503821, anti-RO0503821 antibody may develop in human serum. These antibodies have been shown to cross-react with all ESAs and leads to failure to respond. Number of participants with anti- RO0503821 antibody that are quantifiable and those that were “BLQ” at Baseline (Day 0) and Visit 17 (M 9) or final visit/early termination in human serum samples are reported.</description>
