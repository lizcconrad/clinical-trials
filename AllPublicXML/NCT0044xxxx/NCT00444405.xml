      The purpose of this study is to compare patients who underwent decompression/discectomy with
      pedicle screw fusion to patients who received decompression/discectomy without fusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar disc herniations are quite common and typically improve after surgical correction.
      However, some patients develop recurrent herniations at the same level. Controversy exists as
      to why reherniated discs occur. Moreover, existing research does not settle the issue of
      whether a second decompression/discectomy or a repeat decompression/discectomy with pedicle
      screw fusion is the more successful treatment. This study is designed to compare differences
      in patient-reported pain, physical function, and satisfaction between the two types of
      surgery patients.

          -  History of lumbar spine fractures (new or old)
