  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The isolate samples will be collected over a period of one year once IRB approval has been
      obtained. These isolates were collected as part of the patient's clinical care and once all
      clinical testing is complete, all isolates will be discarded. The honest broker of our area
      will collect the isolates and deidentify all information once all clinical testing is
      complete. The isolates will be obtained from the microbiology lab.

      The study will collect two hundred pseudomonas and 20 acinetobacter baumanti consecutive
      bacterial isolates from microbiology. These isolates are collected as part of the patient's
      clinical care and are discarded once all clinical testing is complete. The honest broker will
      obtain these samples after all clinical testing is complete. All isolates will be
      deidentified. These isolates will be tested using standardized susceptibility methods for
      meropenem and imipenem. The activity of doripenem, a carbapenem currently being studied, and
      arbekacin an aminoglycoside, will also be tested. The honest broker will also collect limited
      patient data including underlying condition, presence of a solid organ transplant, ward
      location, and antibiotic history over the three months prior to organism isolation. For
      resistant isolates found, analytical and molecular techniques will be performed to determine
      the mechanisms of resistance and whether resistant isolates are coming from a single
      source/being transmitted from person to person.
