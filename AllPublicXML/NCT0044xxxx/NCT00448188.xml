    <textblock>
      Since many of the patients in an intensive care unit suffer from disorders of hemostasis,
      bleeding is a main concern applying central venous catheters. Even if there are some data
      indicating elevated international normalized ratio may not increase the risk of bleeding no
      clear cut-off has been defined so far. An INR &gt; 1.5 is generally considered to increase the
      risk of bleeding. Furthermore, many authors consider platelets below 50 x 109 /l as a
      contra-indication to CVC cannulation, since there are some data this may increase the risk of
      bleeding. Therefore platelet transfusion before venous puncture is suggested. In our clinical
      experience INR &gt; 1.5 and platelets &lt; 50 x 109 /l do not correlate with increased risk of
      bleeding. The aim of this study is to demonstrate, that coagulopathy, defined by INR and
      platelet count, is not decisive for bleeding.
