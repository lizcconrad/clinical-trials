    <textblock>
      According to the Israeli Ministry of Health requirement, this study was designed to evaluate
      the efficacy of the UroShield system is patients that require urinary catheterization. This
      was designed to compare standard treatment (urinary catheter alone) with the UroShield
      treatment in occurrence of catheter associated Urinary Tract infection, pain, discomfort,
      Biofilm prevention and trauma.

      This study is aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the NanoVibronix™ UroShield™ System in
      comparison to Urinary catheter alone in patients requiring urinary catheterization.

        1. Primary objectives

             -  To observe the effect of UroShield in reduction of patient's complaints relating to
                indwelling Urinary Catheters

                  -  Pain

                  -  Discomfort

             -  To observe the effect of UroShield in the reduction/prevention of Biofilm

             -  To observe the effect of UroShield on the occurrence of bacteriuria and/or UTI's on
                patients with Indwelling Urinary Catheters

        2. Safety Objective To assess the safety parameters of the UroShield system

        3. Secondary Objectives

             -  To observe the effect of UroShield in reduction of Foley Catheter related pain
                medication in patients with Indwelling Urinary Catheters

             -  To observe the effect of UroShield in reduction of antibiotic medication in
                patients with Indwelling Urinary Catheter

             -  To observe the effect of UroShield on the clogging of Urinary Catheter when used
                chronically and the need to replace the catheter

             -  To observe the effect of UroShield on the decrease of Tissue damage of patients
                with Indwelling Urinary Catheters by measuring cell count before and after removal
                of catheter
