  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate UT-15C sustained release tablets in subjects experiencing ischemic
      lower limb rest pain related to advanced peripheral arterial disease. Rest pain is one of the
      primary management issues of severe arterial occlusive disease and may lead to amputation
      when the pain becomes intolerable and unresponsive to narcotic analgesia. Rest pain also
      impacts the quality of sleep and mobility with frequent interruptions in sleep and decreased
      mobility. Treprostinil sodium (Remodulin®) has been studies in several small open-label
      studies and has been shown to be safe as well as an effective agent for ischemic rest pain
      when given by subcutaneous or intravenous delivery. However, these forms of administration
      have patient convenience limitations, including the need for an infusion device and
      associated pain at the site of infusion with subcutaneous delivery. UT-15C may allow patients
      suffering from CLI to benefit from the simplicity of an oral dosage form

      This study is an eight week, two center, open-label study assessing the tolerability, safety,
      and efficacy of oral UT-15C sustained release tablets in subjects with CLI and ischemic lower
      limb rest pain, with or without an ischemic wound present. Conventional therapy should be
      continued without changes over the course of the study for all subjects.

      Group 1: The first ten subjects to enroll in the study will be assigned to receive an initial
      dose of 1mg. The dose will be titrated upward every seven days, depending on tolerability, to
      a maximum dose of 4mg/day .

      Group 2: The last ten subjects to enroll in the study will be assigned to receive an initial
      dose of 1mg. The dose will be titrated upward every seven days, depending on tolerability to
      a maximum dose of 8 mg/day .
