        the following criterion.

        1. Has been able, in the investigator's/subinvestigator's judgment, to make entries in the
        asthma diary and measure PEF, as directed, during the run-in period.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Exclusion Criteria for Entry in Run-in Period

        A patient who applies any of the following criteria is not eligible for the study:

          -  Used systemic steroid within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.

          -  Received antibacterials or antivirals for treatment of upper or lower respiratory
             tract infection within 2 weeks prior to Visit 1.

          -  Has a safety problem in participation in the study because of a serious, uncontrolled
             systemic disease including nervous system disorder.

          -  Has or is suspected to have deep-seated mycosis or infection to which no effective
             antibacterial agent is available.

          -  Has or is suspected to have hypersensitivity to the investigational product, rescue
             medication or any ingredients of them.

          -  Is pregnant or lactating, may be pregnant, or plans for pregnancy during the study
             period.

          -  Has received the last dose in another clinical study within 2 months prior to this
             study.

          -  Is not eligible for the study in the investigator's/subinvestigator's judgment.

        Exclusion Criteria for Entry in Treatment Period

        A subject who applies to any of the following criteria is not eligible for the study:

          1. Admitted to the hospital due to asthma exacerbation during the run-in period.

          2. Had upper or lower respiratory tract infection during the 2 weeks just before Visit 2.

          3. Used prohibited drugs during the 2 weeks just before Visit 2.

          4. Is not eligible for the study in the investigator's/subinvestigator's judgment.
