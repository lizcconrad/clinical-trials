  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a pivotal trial to determine whether LX201 reduces the likelihood of a graft
      rejection episode following corneal transplantation in patients at high immunological risk
      for rejection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LX201 was a novel sustained-release silicone implant containing 30% cyclosporine A by weight.
      LX201 was intended for surgical episcleral placement in the eye.

      The study was a Phase 2/3, multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group,
      dose-ranging study of LX201 for prevention of corneal allograft rejection or graft failure
      following penetrating keratoplasty with LX201 implantation. Subjects were to be followed in
      an outpatient setting for safety and efficacy at 4-6 week intervals for 52 weeks following
      transplantation surgery.

      After Visit 12 (Week 52), subjects in the USA and India with the implant in the study eye
      were to be followed for safety at least once per year for a 2-year period or until time of
      implant removal. For subjects in the USA and India, if the implant was removed at any time
      prior to the 3 year safety follow-up, the subject was to have a final safety follow up visit
      at 3 months post removal. In Germany, the implant was to be removed at Week 52 with a 3-month
      safety follow-up period after removal.

    <description>LX201 is a novel sustained-release silicone implant containing 30% cyclosporine A by weight.
LX201 was available in two different lengths, 0.50 and 0.75 inch. Each implant was 0.08 inch wide and 0.04 inch in height. The implants were flat on one side (the posterior surface, which is applied to the episclera) and the anterior surface and ends were rounded.</description>
