      The study is to collect information from patient charts and patient questionnaires to
      evaluate the effects of nerve stimulation therapy on urinary dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men and women with urinary incontinence (leakage of urine), frequency, and bladder pain
      experience embarrassment, inconvenience, and a significant negative impact on their quality
      of life. Although traditional treatments such as medications, diet modification, and bladder
      training provide relief for some people, others do not experience improvement with these
      treatments. Recently, mechanical devices much like a heart pacemaker have been developed to
      stimulate the nerves (sacral and pudendal) responsible for controlling bladder function.
      During a two stage operation, a permanent electrical wire is implanted in the lower back and
      connected to a mechanical box (stimulator) implanted under the patients skin in the hip area.

      Participants will be asked to complete a set of questionnaires (Intake Form, Urinary
      Incontinence Treatment Network (UITN) Sexual Activity Questionnaire, Interstitial Cystitis
      Symptom Index and Problem Index, voiding diary) within 60 days prior to the procedure.
      Preoperative clinical information such as primary diagnosis, history of failed therapies, and
      medical history will be collected from the physician office record, and operative information
      will be collected from the inpatient hospital record. After the two stage operation (3, 6,
      and 12 months, then yearly thereafter as long as the device is in place) participants will be
      sent questionnaires. Upon completion and return to the study site
