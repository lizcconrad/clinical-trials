  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study that will investigate the effects of proton pump inhibitors (often
      used to treat stomach upset) on Gleevec® (a drug that is FDA-approved to treat some types of
      cancer) in healthy volunteers. Twelve healthy volunteers (six men and six women) will be
      recruited to complete the study. This research study will compare Gleevec® in the body when
      taken with and without proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Each volunteer will receive a 400 mg
      pill of Gleevec® on two occasions. On one occasion they will take the dose of Gleevec® alone
      (without PPI). On another occasion, they will take the Gleevec® after taking 40 mg of PPI
      daily by mouth for six days. Several blood samples will be drawn to measure the
      concentrations of Gleevec® and its breakdown products in the blood, with and without the
      influence of PPI.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-institution, randomized cross-over, fixed schedule study of the
      effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) on Imatinib Mesylate (Gleevec®) pharmacokinetics.
      Healthy volunteers will be recruited to participate in this study such that twelve subjects
      (6 men / 6 women) will complete the study. Gleevec® pharmacokinetics will be assessed after
      oral administration of Gleevec® and after oral administration of Gleevec® with concomitant
      administration of PPI (Prilosec® Delayed-Release Capsules). Gleevec® will be administered at
      a dose of 400 mg, and the PPI (Prilosec®) at a dose level of 40 mg daily for 6 consecutive
      days. Half of the subjects will receive Prilosec® starting 5 days before Day 1 through Day 1
      along with Gleevec® on Day 1, and Gleevec® alone on Day 15. The other half will receive
      Prilosec® on Days 10-15, along with Gleevec® on Day 15, and Gleevec® alone on Day 1. On days
      that both drugs are administered, the Prilosec® will be administered 15 minutes before the
      Gleevec® dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy men or women 18 years of age or older. Healthy subjects are defined as
             individuals who are free from clinically significant illness or disease (such as
             coronary arterial disease, chronic heart failure, bleeding disorder, hypertension,
             chronic renal failure etc.) as determined by their medical history, physical
             examination, and laboratory studies.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt; 31 kg/m^2 (weight/height^2).

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test within 7
             days before initiation of study drug dosing. Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic
             for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential. Male and female
             subjects of reproductive potential must agree to employ an effective barrier method of
             birth control throughout the study and for up to 7 days following discontinuation of
             study drug.

          -  Subjects participating in the protocol entitled &quot;IRB: 0701014: Effect of Antacids
             (Mg-Al-based) on Imatinib Mesylate (Gleevec®) Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Volunteers
             (CSTI571BUS257) (UPCI #06-088)&quot; will be eligible for participation in this study
             provided they meet all other eligibility criteria for this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Abnormal marrow function as defined by leucocyte, neutrophil, or platelet counts
             outside of normal limits.

          -  Any evidence of renal dysfunction (proteinuria; serum creatinine &gt; upper limit of
             normal; or if serum creatinine &gt; upper limit of normal, a calculated creatinine

          -  Taking any medications (including over the counter products), herbal products, mineral
             supplements or vitamins (other than a daily multivitamin preparation), other than
             contraceptives (for women), within 2 weeks of start of the study. All forms of
             contraceptive medication are permissible for this study and would not result in a
             female's exclusion from participation. Patients who take medications on a chronic
             basis, such as antihypertensive medications or thyroid replacement therapy, etc. are
             not eligible for the study.

          -  Subjects that have received any other investigational agents within 28 days of first
