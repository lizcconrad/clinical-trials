          -  Active hepatitis within the past year;

          -  Subjects with clinically important disease as judged by the investigator within 3
             months of the start of the study (e.g., history of significant lab abnormalities,
             myocardial infarct, stroke, cancer, connective tissue disease, etc.), including
             subjects with medical conditions that might require the use of immunosuppressive
