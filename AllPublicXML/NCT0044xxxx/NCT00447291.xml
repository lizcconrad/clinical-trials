  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with an excess in body weight, increase the risk of obesity-related co-morbidities
      and cardiovascular diseases. Childhood obesity may be due to diets laden with fat and lack of
      physical activity. Omega-3 fish oil is a supplementation that may promote a greater reduction
      of pro-inflammatory mediators; combined with exercise and nutritional regimens it may also
      help improve glycemic, lipid markers, and body composition in overweight children and
      adolescents.
