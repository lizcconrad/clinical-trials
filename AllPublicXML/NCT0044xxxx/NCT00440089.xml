  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial examines the efficacy of hands-on-healing for fatigue and
      immune function in breast cancer survivors. Participants may be randomized to one of three
      groups: hands-on-healing, touch alone, or a control group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Premenopausal and postmenopausal women between the ages of 18 to 70 years.

          -  Ability to give informed consent.

          -  Breast cancer survivors who have undergone surgery, including lumpectomy and simple or
             total mastectomy, followed by chemotherapy or a combination of chemo- and
             radio-therapy. We have elected to study survivors instead of patients actively
             undergoing treatment to alleviate subject burden and risk during this protocol.

          -  Stage I to III breast cancer survivors.

          -  Breast cancer survivors who have finished their chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy at
             least one month prior to 60 months prior.

          -  Breast cancer survivors with above-normative levels of fatigue.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Breast cancer patients who are currently receiving or who are scheduled to receive
             radiation or chemotherapy during the course of this intervention study.

          -  Patients with current major depression, current or history of prior bipolar illness,
             currently on psychotropic medications.

          -  Patients with other diseases that are known to induce fatigue (e.g., thyroid disorder;
             sleep disorders).

          -  Patients with other inflammatory diseases that affect cytokine levels.

          -  Patients with a history of other cancers, and stage IV breast cancer.

          -  Patients undergoing current chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

          -  Men with breast cancer.

          -  Substance abuse/dependence.

          -  Continued use of another biofield-based intervention (e.g., Reiki, Qi-Gong, Healing
             Touch, Therapeutic Touch, Johrei).
