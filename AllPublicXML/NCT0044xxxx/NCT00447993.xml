  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the safety and effectiveness of CNTF implants on
      vision in persons with retinitis pigmentosa, Usher type II &amp; III, and Choroideremia. This
      research is being done because there are no effective therapies for people with these retinal
      degenerations. They are genetic disorders that affect our ability to see at night, and later
      cause tunnel vision and loss of central vision. Retinal degenerations affect the retina, a
      light sensitive layer of cells in the back of the eye. Slowly over time, these cells die and
      cause permanent loss of vision.

      The implant is a small capsule that contains human retinal pigment epithelium cells. These
      cells have been given the ability to make CNTF and release it through the capsule membrane
      into the surrounding fluid. This study will look at the effect of the implant on vision loss
      by retinitis pigmentosa, Usher type II &amp; III, and Choroideremia. In this study, two different
      CNTF dose levels will be used: a high dose and a low dose in one eye, as well as a sham (or
      placebo) surgery in the other eye.

      This study will involve about 16 visits over 1Â½ years for specific tests of the participant's
      vision and health. These visits may include visual exams, blood draw for laboratory testing,
      brief medical history and exam, and occasionally a questionnaire (survey), in addition to the
      visit for the surgical procedures. The primary effectiveness outcome for this study will be a
      visual acuity score one year after the implant surgery. There will be about 13 centers
      participating in this study, and up to 60 people enrolled across the US. Each participant
      joining the study who has completed initial screening will then be scheduled to have a brief
      surgical procedure performed on each eye, one of which will include a very small cell-filled
      implant. Follow-up visits for repeat assessments will be required regularly to determine if
      the implant being tested is safe and effective for use to treat RP.
