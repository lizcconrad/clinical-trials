  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to characterize the difference in prepubescent growth
      velocity in children 3 to 9 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) treated with
      triamcinolone acetonide (TAA) nasal spray (NASACORT® AQ 110 μg treatment group) or placebo
      (NASACORT® AQ placebo group) for 12-months.

      The secondary objectives were to compare the following in prepubertal participants treated
      with TAA nasal spray versus placebo:

        -  the 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels and the cortisol/creatinine ratio (to measure
           the Hypothalamic-Pituitary Adrenal [HPA] axis function)

        -  the rate of treatment-emergent-adverse-events (TEAE)

        -  global efficacy rated by the investigator and the participant separately

        -  the rate of use of rescue medication during the study
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consisted of:

        -  a 4- to 6-month screening/baseline period

        -  a 12-month (up to Day 360+/-5 days) double-blind treatment period starting on Day 1

        -  a 2-month follow-up period (up to Day 420+/-5 days)

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>For 7 days prior to randomization (Baseline) and everyday for 7 days prior to Day 360 (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>PAR symptoms - nasal stuffiness, nasal discharge, sneezing, and nasal itching were scored upon arising in the morning according to the following 4-point scale:
0 = symptom absent
1 = mild (present but not annoying to self)
2 = moderate (annoying to self but not interfering with sleep or daily living)
3 = severe (interfered with daily living and/or sleep)
TNSS was the sum of the individual symptom scores (ranging 0-3), and TNSS ranged from 0 (best outcome) to 12 (worst outcome). A negative value for change represents an improvement in symptoms.</description>

             years + 120 days] at Visit 3; and, female participants [3 years to &lt;= 8 years + 0 days
             old] at Visit 1 and no older than [8 years + 120 days] at Visit 3: all sexually
             prepubertal (ie, Stage 1 of Tanner Classification of sexual maturity) at Visit 1 and

             (histamine) or was at least 3 mm (prick test) or 7 mm (intradermal test) greater than
             the wheal of negative control (saline). If a skin test could not be performed, the
             radioallergosorbent test (RAST) would be used as an alternative. Documented historical
             skin testing or RAST performed during the past year were acceptable

             randomization (Visit 3)

          5. Symptomatic (daily AM instantaneous total nasal symptom score was &gt;= 4 out of 12) on
             any 4 out of the last 7 consecutive days immediately prior to and including the
             morning of Visit 3. Symptom ratings were to be completed with the help of a
             parent/guardian/caregiver

          6. Written informed consent and ability of parent or legal guardian of the participant to
             give a written informed consent before any study related procedures. Participants 7

             pharmacist, study coordinator, other staff or relative thereof directly involved in
             the conduct of the protocol

          5. Height, weight, or body mass index (BMI)-for-age below the 3rd or above the 97th

             Visit 1 was exclusionary. Up to 2 courses of systemic corticosteroids each course not
             exceeding 14 days up to 1 year before Visit 1 was allowed.

          8. Treatment with inhaled, intranasal, or high potency topical corticosteroid exposure
             within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1. Mild asthma that was well-controlled and without the

             of the investigational product at Visit 1.

         15. Concomitant disease other than PAR which could have interfered with the study
             procedures or outcomes as determined by the investigator.

         16. History of hospitalization due to asthma within 1 year before screening (Visit 1).

          <title>Tanner classification at randomization</title>
          <description>Tanner classification distinguishes stages of puberty. Each stage differentiates the extent of breast, genitalia and pubic hair growth. Tanner Stage I represents the preadolescent stage where breast, genitalia and pubic hair growth are of the same size and shape as in early childhood; and in Tanner Stage 5 breasts and genitalia are of adult shape and size, and pubic hair is adult in quantity (mature stage). Stages 2, 3 and 4 are intermediate stages.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS)</title>
        <description>PAR symptoms - nasal stuffiness, nasal discharge, sneezing, and nasal itching were scored upon arising in the morning according to the following 4-point scale:
0 = symptom absent
1 = mild (present but not annoying to self)
2 = moderate (annoying to self but not interfering with sleep or daily living)
3 = severe (interfered with daily living and/or sleep)
TNSS was the sum of the individual symptom scores (ranging 0-3), and TNSS ranged from 0 (best outcome) to 12 (worst outcome). A negative value for change represents an improvement in symptoms.</description>

2 = moderate relief (symptoms were present and could have been troublesome but were noticeably improved)
3 = marked relief (symptoms were greatly improved and although present were scarcely troublesome)
