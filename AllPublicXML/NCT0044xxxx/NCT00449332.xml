  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to discover the different patterns of cytokine production in
      patients who may develop Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome-0p (BOS-0p) which means ongoing
      rejection. This is an early indicator of chronic rejection in lung transplant recipients.
      These cytokines can be detected in the bronchoalveolar (lung) and tissue samples of lung
      transplant recipients.

    <textblock>
      Lung transplant recipients are routinely followed in clinic every three months after the
      first year post-transplant. Spirometry with measurement of FEV1, FVC and FEF25-75 are
      obtained at each visit. In addition, lung transplant recipients undergo surveillance
      bronchoscopy at one, three, six, nine and twelve months. All bronchoscopy specimens that are
      obtained for this study will be obtained during bronchoscopies that were scheduled per the
      physician caring for the patient. An extra 90 cc of sterile solution will be instilled into
      bronchus and two extra transbronchial biopsies will be performed in addition to the routine
      bronchoscopic procedure. Routinely, 4-8 transbronchial biopsy samples are obtained from the
      transplanted lung. Two specimens will be randomly selected for study and the rest will
      undergo routine histopathologic study. The study biopsies will be set aside and processed.
      The study visits for this research will occur at the same time as standard of care post
      transplant visits. We will collect subject's history,demographic of subject's transplant
      data,donor procurement information, physical exam information, pregnancy tests,blood test and
      spirometry results from the visits mentioned above.
