    <textblock>
      Investigational drug AMG 714 will be given to 66 subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis
      to study safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. Dose levels include 150mg and 300mg and will
      be given to each subject for a total of 6 doses. Each dose for each subject will be given

             units); white blood cell count greater than or equal to 3,500 cells/mm3 (greater than

          -  Evidence of skin conditions (eg, eczema) at the time of the screening visit or between

          -  Clinically significant adverse event, infection, or laboratory toxicity, at the time
             of the screening visit or between the screening visit and study drug initiation that
             in the opinion of Amgen or the Investigator would preclude participation in the study.

          -  Clinically significant infection less than or equal to 30 days before the screening
             visit that in the opinion of Amgen or the Investigator would preclude participation in
