  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide bortezomib to patients with multiple myeloma who have
      received at least 2 previous lines of therapy and are refractory or have relapse after their
      last treatment. Additional objectives of this study are assess the safety and tolerability of
      bortezomib and follow the levels of paraprotein in patients receiving bortezomib as a way to
      followup disease burden

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is uniformly fatal. Responses achieved after multiple lines of therapy are
      normally of short duration. Therefore, all patients with multiple myeloma will eventually
      relapse, having become refractory to therapy and subsequently will die of their cancer. The
      rationale of this study is that bortezomib as a novel agent may allow additional periods of
      response due to its different mechanisms of action. This is an open-label, single-arm,
      multicenter, non-comparative study to provide expanded access to bortezomib to patients with
      multiple myeloma that have received at least two previous lines of therapy and are refractory
      to or have relapsed after their last treatment. Patients will receive treatment with
      bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on day 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 3-week cycle. No treatment will be
      administered on the last 10 days of each cycle. Treatment may be repeated for up to 8 cycles
      with possible extension if patient is still responding at the end of the 8 cycle period.
      Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 will be administered as an IV bolus
