  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skill acquisition refers to the process of improvement of performance following practice
      experience. This process is the basis for generation of a long-lasting memory. Individuals
      with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have been shown to be impaired on some
      performance aspects of previously learned skills, an impairment that is often ameliorated, at
      least temporarily, by psychostimulant medication (the standard therapy in ADHD). The proposed
      study aims to define the course of learning and of generation of long-term memory
      consolidation in individuals with ADHD, and to essay the effectiveness of psychostimulant
      medication on both the learning and retention of the skills.
