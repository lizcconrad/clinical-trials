    <textblock>
      The exposure of human beings to markedly altered environments (ambient pressure and inhaled
      gas mixtures) has profound effects on their innate immune capacity to effectively combat
      viral illnesses. This Phase IIA clinical trial examines the effects of an exposure to a 4
      atmospheric environment has on HIV-infected humans whose clinical condition has progressed to
      formal AIDS status.
