  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study that will investigate the effects of antacids (often used to treat
      stomach upset) on Gleevec® (a drug that is FDA-approved to treat some types of cancer) in
      healthy volunteers. Twelve healthy volunteers (six men and six women) will be recruited to
      complete the study. This research study will compare Gleevec® in the body when taken with and
      without antacids. Each volunteer will receive a 400 mg pill of Gleevec® on two occasions. One
      one occasion they will take the dose of Gleevec® alone. On another occasion, they will take
      the Gleevec® 15 minutes after taking a 20 mL dose of antacids. Several blood samples will be
      drawn to measure the concentrations of Gleevec® and its breakdown products in the blood, with
      and without the influence of antacids.

      This is an open-label, single-institution, randomized cross-over, fixed schedule study of the
      effects of Mg-Al-based antacids on Imatinib Mesylate (Gleevec®) pharmacokinetics. Healthy
      volunteers will be recruited to participate in this study such that twelve subjects (6 men /
      6 women) will complete the study. Gleevec® pharmacokinetics will be assessed after oral
      administration of Gleevec® and after oral administration of Gleevec® with concomitant
      administration of magnesium-aluminum hydroxide-based antacid (Maalox). Gleevec® will be
      administered at a dose of 400 mg, and the antacid (Maximum Strength Maalox®Max®
      Antacid/Anti-gas) at a dose level of 20 mL (equivalent to 1600 mg aluminum hydroxide and 1600
      mg magnesium hydroxide). Half of the subjects will receive Gleevec® and antacid on day 15 and
      Gleevec® alone on day 1. The other half will be treated in reverse order, i.e., they will
      receive the combination of Gleevec® and antacid on day 1, and Gleevec® alone on day 15. The
      antacids will be administered 15 minutes before the Gleevec® dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy men or women 18 years of age or older. Healthy subjects are defined as
             individuals who are free from clinically significant illness or disease (such as
             coronary arterial disease, chronic heart failure, bleeding disorder, hypertension,
             chronic renal failure etc.) as determined by their medical history, physical
             examination, and laboratory studies.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test within 7
             days before initiation of study drug dosing. Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic
             for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential. Male and female
             subjects of reproductive potential must agree to employ an effective barrier method of
             birth control throughout the study and for up to 7 days following discontinuation of
             study drug.

          -  Written, voluntary informed consent.

          -  Subjects participating in the protocol entitled &quot;IRB: 0701014: Effect of Antacids
             (Mg-Al-based) on Imatinib Mesylate (Gleevec®) Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Volunteers
             (CSTI571BUS257) (UPCI #06-088)&quot; will be eligible for participation in this study
             provided they meet all other eligibility criteria for this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Abnormal marrow function as defined by leucocyte, neutrophil, or platelet counts
             outside of normal limits.

          -  Any evidence of renal dysfunction (proteinuria; serum creatinine &gt; upper limit of
             normal; or if serum creatinine &gt; upper limit of normal, a calculated creatinine

             bilirubin outside the normal range).

          -  Taking any medications (including over the counter products), herbal products, mineral
             supplements or vitamins (other than a daily multivitamin preparation), other than
             contraceptives (for women), within 2 weeks of start of the study. All forms of
             contraceptive medication are permissible for this study and would not result in a
             female's exclusion from participation. Patients who take medications on a chronic
             basis, such as antihypertensive medications or thyroid replacement therapy, etc. are
             not eligible for the study.

          -  Subjects that have received any other investigational agents within 28 days of first
