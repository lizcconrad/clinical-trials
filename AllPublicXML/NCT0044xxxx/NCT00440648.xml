  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study conducted at centers within the United
      States. The study consists of five periods: an up to two-week Screening Period, a 5-week
      Run-In Period, two eight-week study treatment periods and a two-week Washout Period. Patients
      are assigned randomly (1:1) to one of two treatment sequences: sevelamer carbonate for eight
      weeks followed by sevelamer hydrochloride for eight weeks or sevelamer hydrochloride for
      eight weeks followed by sevelamer carbonate for eight weeks

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted at 15 centers (2 of which did not enroll any patients). A total of 79
      hemodialysis patients were assigned randomly to one of two treatment sequences.
