      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and effects of AT2101 in patients with
      type I Gaucher disease who are not receiving ERT or SRT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from a deficiency in the key enzyme
      beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). The enzyme deficiency is caused by genetic mutations, which
      can result in the production of misfolded GCase. AT2101 is designed to act as a
      pharmacological chaperone by selectively binding to the misfolded GCase and helping it fold
      correctly, which may restore GCase activity.

      This study is being conducted to test the safety of AT2101 in patients with type I Gaucher
      disease who have not already received enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction
      therapy (SRT), or who have not received ERT or SRT in the 12 months before screening. This
      study will also evaluate the effects of AT2101 on parameters that are commonly abnormal in
      Gaucher disease. The study will involve 9 visits over 29 weeks.
