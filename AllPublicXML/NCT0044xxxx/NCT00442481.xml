      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of escitalopram on sleep architecture
      utilizing a prospective design.

      Hypothesis: Escitalopram will improve REM latency in patients with MDD that have responded
      clinically to treatment.

      Disturbance of sleep is a prominent symptom in depressive disorders. Alterations of sleep
      patterns in depressed patients include insomnia, frequent awakenings, early wake-up and
      non-refreshing sleep. Polysomnographic recordings have confirmed these reports, reporting
      reduced latency of the first REM episode of the night, with decreased density of rapid eye
      movements, and enhancement of total percentage of REM sleep, a reduction of deep slow wave
      sleep (SWS) and increase in night awakenings (Benca et al., Classification of sleep
      disorders).

      The effects of antidepressant drugs on depression and sleep disorders, specifically SSRIs,
      have been thoroughly researched. The effects of escitalopram on sleep in depressed patients
      have been reported using a retrospective design, and in this proposed protocol, we suggest to
      assess the effect of escitalopram on sleep architecture utilizing a prospective design.

      Hypothesis:

      Escitalopram will improve REM latency in patients with MDD that have responded clinically to
      treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients suffering from MDD, excluding a depressive episode of Bipolar Disorder.

          -  The depressive episode is not secondary to a general medical condition or substance
             abuse.

          -  Ages between 18-65 years old.

          -  Patients receiving other medications must be on a stable dosage for one month before
             entering the trial, including hypnotics.

          -  Able to understand and sign an informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients suffering from sleep disturbances due to a physical condition (COPD, sleep
             apnea or essential insomnia preceding the diagnosis of depression).

          -  Patients suffering from an unstable clinically significant medical condition
             (cardiovascular, endocrine, nutritional, hepatic, urinary).

          -  Patients suffering from a malignancy or neuro-degenerative such as Parkinsonsâ€™ disease

          -  Patients suffering from a clinically significant psychiatric psychotic disease, as
             judged by DSM-IV criteria, such as schizophrenia or acute psychosis.

          -  Patients experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms following a discontinuation of
             hypnotic drugs, upon entry into the baseline phase.

          -  History of drug or alcohol dependence within the last year.
