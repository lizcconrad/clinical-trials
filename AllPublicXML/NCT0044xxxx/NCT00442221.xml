        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is a male or a female who is not pregnant or is not lactating. A female is
             eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming
                  pregnant); or,

               -  Child-bearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) at
                  screen, and employs one of the following acceptable measures of contraception:

                    -  Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of
                       the investigational product, throughout the study, and for a time interval
                       after completion or premature discontinuation from the study to account for
                       elimination of the investigational drug (a minimum of 24 hrs); subjects
                       utilizing this method must agree to use an alternate method of contraception
                       if they should become sexually active and will be queried on whether they
                       have been abstinent in the preceding 2 weeks when they present to the clinic
                       for randomized treatment; or,

                    -  Female sterilization; or,

                    -  Sterilization of male partner; or,

                    -  Implants of levonorgestrel; or,

                    -  Injectable progestogen; or,

                    -  Oral contraceptive (combined or progestogen only); or,

                    -  Any intrauterine device (IUD) with published data showing that the lowest
                       expected failure rate is less than 1% per year (not all IUDs meet this
                       criterion); or,

                    -  Any other method with published data showing that the lowest expected
                       failure rate for that method is less than 1% per year.

                    -  Barrier method only if used in combination with any of the above acceptable
                       methods

             Appendix I).

          5. Subject experienced an average migraine headache frequency of 2-6 moderate or severe
             attacks per month in the previous 6 months.

             study.

             study, or subject was enrolled in this study previously.

          2. Subject has any concurrent medical or psychiatric condition that may affect the

             not limited to, chronic unstable debilitating diseases such as HIV infection, multiple
             sclerosis, cancer, etc.

          3. Subject has a clinically significant disorder that, in the opinion of the

          5. Subject has a history of cardiac arrhythmias requiring medication or a history of a
             clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality that, in the investigator’s
