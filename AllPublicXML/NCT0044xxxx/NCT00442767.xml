      The primary objective of this study is to examine the effect of pramlintide given pre-meal
      and insulin given just after a meal has been taken vs. standard therapy of pre-meal insulin
      on post-prandial glucose excursions.

      The secondary objective is to examine the effect of pramlintide and insulin on glucagon
      suppression in type 1 diabetes.
