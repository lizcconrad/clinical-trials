  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare how one 50 mg tablet of SB-497115 is broken down
      in the body by healthy subjects versus subjects with mild, moderate or severe kidney
      problems. The study is also being done to 1) check on how well the study drug is tolerated by
      healthy subjects versus those with liver problems and 2) to check if liver impairment affects
      how the study drug binds to protein in the blood.
