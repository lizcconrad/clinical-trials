  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 1st phase of the study will assess the acute biochemical response of PTH, calcium and
      phosphorus to orally administered doses of cinacalcet once (60mg) or twice (30mg x 2) per
      day.

      The 2nd phase of the study designed to evaluate the long term effects of cinacalcet on BMD
      (bone mineral density)and the levels of PTH, calcium, phosphorus as well as its ability to
      control secondary hyperparathyroidism without simultaneous administration of other vitamin D
      compounds.
