    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of once daily
      administration of the combination of Valsartan and Amlodipine 80/5 mg for 52 weeks in
      patients with essential hypertension.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>No new unexpected AE's were observed in long-term treatment with VAA 80/5 mg. There were no deaths during the study. The SAEs were rare, with 9 patients (2.5%) reporting 10 events (1 patient experienced 2 SAEs). These events were not clustered to any particular primary system organ class and only 2 events the investigators could not excluded a relationship to study drug. The events that occurred were expected in this study population and/or were known to be associated with either valsartan or amlodipine. AEs leading to discontinuation occurred in 14 patients (3.8%).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy assessed by the changes-from baseline measurements in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure, mean sitting systolic blood pressure, standing diastolic blood pressure, and standing systolic blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinically meaningful reductions in MSDBP and MSSBP were observed after 2 weeks of VAA 80/5 mg treatment and were maintained until the end of the 52-week VAA treatment period. The MSDBP and MSSBP were controlled below 85 mmHg and 130 mmHg, respectively for the entire 52-week VAA treatment period. At endpoint the MSDBP was controlled below 80 mmHg.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Laboratory tests</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Laboratory changes observed with the long-term administration of VAA 80/5 mg were consistent with the known effects of each monotherapy agent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vital signs</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mean changes from baseline at endpoint were small and clinically unremarkable in extension population for weight, sitting/standing pulse values.
AEs related to abnormal vital signs were rare during the VAA treatment period. No patient reported orthostatic hypotension as an AE. Only one patient (PID 0045/00007) was discontinued from the study due to blood pressure decreased and dizziness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Electrocardiogram (ECG)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>None of the patients reported shifting from clinically non-significant to clinically significant ECG abnormality. However, three patients experienced clinically significant ECG abnormalities and were reported as AEs during the VAA treatment period.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who successfully complete the core study (Study CVAA489A1301.

          -  Patients whose blood pressure at Visit 7 of the Study CVAA489A1301 had to be well

             sub-investigator's discretion, those patients who were not well controlled (MSDBP ≥ 90
             mmHg or MSSBP ≥ 140 mmHg), and whose MSDBP was &lt; 100 mmHg and MSSBP was &lt; 160 mmHg
             might participate in the extension if this was considered an acceptable level of blood
             pressure control for the patient.

          -  Male or female outpatients.

          -  Patients who have written informed consent to participate in this study.

             Study CVAA489A1301.

          -  Patients who experienced any adverse events considered serious and drug related in
             Study CVAA489A1301.

          -  Patients who are considered unlikely to comply with the requirements specified in the
             protocol by the investigator or sub-investigator.
