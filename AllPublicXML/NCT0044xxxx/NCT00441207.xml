  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of vitamin C
      (ascorbic acid) given by injection into the vein.

      The second and third purpose of conducting this study is to observe any evidence of tumor
      response to the vitamin C and compare the level of fatigue (weakness), pain control, ability
      to do things, and quality of life, before and after vitamin C is given.

      Preclinical studies of pharmacologic doses of vitamin C (ascorbic acid, ascorbate) have shown
      significant anticancer effects in animal models and tissue culture investigations including
      cytotoxic effects in certain cancer cell lines at micromolar to millimolar concentrations.

      Early clinical studies have shown that intravenous and oral doses of vitamin C may improve
      symptoms and prolong survival in terminal cancer patients. More recent double-blind
      placebo-controlled studies have shown that oral adminstration of vitamin C provides no
      benefit to cancer patients. Conversely, intravenous vitamin C administration raises plasma
      concentrations as high as 14 mM/L, and concentrations of 1-5 mM/L have been found to be
      selectively cytoxic to tumor cells in vitro.

      The proposed Phase I trial with vitamin C should achieve millimolar concentrations of vitamin
      C that have been shown to kill tumor cells in vitro. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD), PK,
      possible drug accumulation with repeated dosing, quality of life, pain response, fatigue
      status, and hints of efficacy in patients with advanced cancer will be examined.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary histological diagnosis of advanced solid tumors (stage 3 and 4) and measurable
             disease.

          -  Disease must have progressed for which no available treatment provides clinical
             benefit.

          -  18 years of age or older.

          -  No scheduled cancer therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immune therapy, or
             radiation therapy) for three months after study entry, and the subject must have had
             their last therapy at least four (4) weeks prior to entry to this study.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.

          -  Informed Consent - The patient must be willing and able to sign the informed consent
             prior to the start of the trial.

          -  Willingness to comply with the weekly phone calls between office visits.

          -  Willingness to undergo central line placement (e.g., port-a-catheter, central venous
             catheter, percutaneously inserted central catheter [PICC] line placement) and able to
             manage care of the entry site safely.

          -  Patients must be able to take food orally or have peg tube for feeding.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) (a relative contraindication)

          -  Renal insufficiency as evidenced by serum creatinine of â‰¥ 1.3 mg/dl or evidence of
             oxalosis by urinalysis.

          -  Chronic hemodialysis.

          -  Iron overload (a ferritin &gt; 500 ng/ml).

             serum bilirubin of 2.0 or liver function tests (AST &gt; 63, ALT &gt; 95) exceeding 1.5 x
             the upper limit of normal.

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.

          -  Acetaminophen use exceeding 2 g per day.
