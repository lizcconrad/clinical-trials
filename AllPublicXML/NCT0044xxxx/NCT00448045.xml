  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that individuals with spinal cord injury are at increased risk for respiratory
      tract infections like pneumonia. Part of this risk is due to weakened chest and abdominal
      muscles that are vital to deep breathing and the ability to cough. The purpose of this study
      is to look at the effectiveness of two different treatments in preventing pneumonia and other
      respiratory problems in persons with SCI.

      This is a randomized controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of two different
      treatments. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups. They
      will not be told the details of the other intervention since this could influence or change
      their activities during the study.

    <description>Individuals will be given a pulse oximeter and taught both manually assisted and mechanically assisted coughing techniques to maximize their cough peak flow. Manually assisted coughing consists of air stacking to deep insufflations. An abdominal thrust is then applied upon glottic opening to augment the cough peak flow. Subjects will also have rapid access to a mechanical in-exsufflator (CoughAssistTM) and will be trained on how to access and use this device. Mechanically assisted coughing (MAC) involves the use of the CoughAssistTM to expand the lungs and then quickly reverse the pressure to rapidly empty the lungs with expiratory (cough) flows of 600 L/m. An abdominal (manual) thrust is applied in conjunction with the negative pressure (exsufflation) to further increase cough.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic spinal cord injury that occurred more than 6 months ago

          -  An impaired ability to cough (cough peak flow less than 300 L/min)

          -  Oxygen saturation greater than or equal to 95% when awake and not receiving
             supplemental oxygen

          -  End-tidal carbon dioxide level less than 43 mm Hg

          -  Without a fever or other signs of an acute illness for the previous 2 weeks

          -  Able to learn the treatment protocol and have someone available at home to assist if
             needed to help set-up and use the equipment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Under 18 years of age

          -  Currently have a tracheotomy tube

          -  Have a history of an acute illness in the last 2 weeks

          -  Have lung disease as seen on chest x-ray that results in a baseline oxygen saturation
             decreasing below 95% during daytime hours and cannot be normalized by usual way of
             coughing

          -  Already utilizing an oximetry protocol

          -  Have a significant medical complication and psychiatric condition that would interfere
