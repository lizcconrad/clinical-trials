  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled trial of Positive Choice, an interactive multimedia computer
      program, to determine whether it can detect and reduce risky behaviors among HIV-positive
      adults. The behaviors of interest are: unprotected anal or vaginal intercourse, illicit drug
      use, risky alcohol drinking, and failure to disclose HIV status to sex partners. The Positive
      Choice program is integrated into the routine operations of outpatient HIV clinics, where
      participating patients complete an in-depth risk assessment (computerized health
      questionnaire) before a regularly scheduled medical appointment. Participants assigned to the
      intervention arm receive brief, interactive risk-reduction counseling by an actor-portrayed
      Video Doctor and an educational worksheet. Their health care provider receives as summary
      cueing sheet, alerting them to the patient's risky behavior and readiness to change. Control
      participants complete the computerized risk assessment and receive the clinic's usual care.
      Three months after a baseline visit, intervention and control group patients are invited back
      to complete an additional risk assessment. The intervention group also receives a &quot;booster&quot;
      intervention. Six months after baseline, both groups complete a final risk assessment.

      A preliminary analysis of baseline data was conducted in January 2006, which indicated that
      the Positive Choice intervention achieved significant reductions in drug use. These findings
      were reported in a poster presentation at the XVI International AIDS Conference in Toronto,
      Canada, in August 2006. A final analysis of outcomes data was conducted in fall 2006
      (September - December). Aggregate results from all five study sites are summarized below.

      We found a high prevalence of risky behaviors in our sample (497/918, or 54%) and achieved
      high retention for follow-up in both groups (&gt;80%). We found significant elimination of any
      drug use in the intervention group at both follow-ups. Among all participants who reported
      drug use at baseline, 66% of intervention participants continued their drug use at 3-month
      follow-up compared to 85% of control participants (OR 0.356, p&lt;0.01). At 6-month follow-up,
      59% of intervention participants continued their drug use compared to 88% of the control
      group (&lt;0.001). Among participants who reported methamphetamine use at baseline, 58%
      continued their methamphetamine use at 3-month follow-up compared to 83% of control
      participants (OR 0.285, p=0.02). At 6-month follow-up, 53% of intervention participants
      continued their methamphetamine use compared to 73% of the control group (OR 0.344, p=0.03).
      We also found significantly less unprotected sex with casual partners by intervention
      participants at 3-month follow up (69% vs. 87%, OR 0.313, p=0.04), and fewer intervention
      participants who exceeded the recommended number of drinks per week at 3-months (53% vs. 78%,
      OR 0.310, p=0.02) Our findings indicate that the Positive Choice program was effective at
      reducing important behavioral risks among HIV-positive adults in care. Positive Choice is an
      appropriate and effective adjunct to routine medical care for HIV-positive adults.
