      Context. Increased blood glucose levels frequently occur in critically ill patients and its
      normalization by intensive insulin treatment markedly improves clinical outcome.

      Objective and Design: Randomized controlled trial to compare blood glucose control by the
      model predictive control algorithm with variable sampling rate (eMPC) with routine glucose
      management protocol (RMP) in peri- and postoperative period in cardiac surgery patients.

      Setting: Department of Cardiac Surgery, University Hospital. Patients. 60 cardiac surgery
      patients. Interventions. Elective cardiac surgery and treatment with continuous insulin
      infusion to maintain euglycemia (target range 4.4 – 6.1 mmol/l). 30 patients were randomized
      for eMPC and 30 for RMP treatment. Blood glucose was measured in 1-4 hour intervals depending
      on request of each algorithm during surgery and post-operation period for 24 hours.

      Main Outcome Measures. Mean blood glucose, percentage of time in target range. Results. Mean
      blood glucose was 6.15 ± 1.11 mmol/l in eMPC vs. 7.21 ± 1.08 mmol/l in RMP group (p&lt;0.05);
      percentage of time in target range was 60.4 ± 22.8% for eMPC vs. 27.5 ± 16.2% for RMP group
      (p&lt;0.05). No severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose bellow 2.9 mmol/l) was observed during the
      study. Average insulin infusion rate was 4.67 ± 3.34 in eMPC vs. 2.57 ± 1.66 IU/h in RMP
      (p&lt;0.05), average sampling interval was 1.46 ± 0.31 vs. 2.10 ± 0.22 hours (p&lt;0.05).

      Conclusions. eMPC algorithm was more effective and comparably safe as compared to RMP in
      maintaining euglycemia in cardiac surgery patients.
