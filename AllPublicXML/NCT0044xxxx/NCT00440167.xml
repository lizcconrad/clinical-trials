  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This crossover trial is performed in advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer not previously
      exposed to chemotherapy. The study compares a standard arm with gemcitabine plus erlotinib to
      an experimental arm with capecitabine plus erlotinib. It is the first trial of its kind to
      incorporate second-line treatment into the study design. Patient who fail on first-line
      therapy are switched to the comparator chemotherapy without erlotinib. The trial therefore
      not only compares two different regimens of first-line treatment, it also compares two
      sequential treatment strategies.
