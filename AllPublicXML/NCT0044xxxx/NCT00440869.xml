  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of the study are to determine whether oxidative stress causes the muscle of
      dialysis patients to tire more quickly than muscle of people without kidney disease and to
      determine whether treatment with N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant, can improve muscle
      endurance.

    <textblock>
      Muscle dysfunction is a major problem for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
      Specifically, these patients experience approximately three-fold greater muscle fatigue of
      the lower extremities during intermittent submaximal contractions than healthy control
      subjects. Thus, a treatment that could ameliorate muscle fatigue in this population has the
      potential to increase endurance during activities of daily living and improve quality of
      life. Dialysis patients have been shown to have high levels of various markers of oxidative
      stress, and oxidative stress has been associated with excessive muscle fatigue in other
      patient populations, but this link has not been established in the ESRD population.

      Comparisons: The amount of muscle fatigue during intermittent submaximal quadriceps exercise
      between dialysis patients and controls will be compared. In addition, the degree of
      exercise-induced increase in markers of oxidative stress in muscle and in plasma will be
      compared between dialysis patients and controls and between dialysis patients who have
      received N-acetylcysteine for 6 days and those who have received placebo capsules.
