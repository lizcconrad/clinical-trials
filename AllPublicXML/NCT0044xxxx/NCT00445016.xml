  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the incidence of neurologic complications as a consequence of peripheral regional
      anesthesia, all patients receiving peripheral nerve blocks will be evaluated according to a
      standardized protocol screening pain, motoric and sensory function recovering to defined
      periods, and according to a study protocol defining the items.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurologic complications as an adverse effect occur in all types of regional anesthesia.
      Reviewing the literature, the incidence spreads from 0.02 up to 3 percent. The incidence
      remains unclear because of different types of definitions, too. In this study, we evaluate
      all patients receiving peripheral regional anesthesia 24 hours after block performance
      according to a standardized study protocol. In case of any conspicuousness concerning motoric
      or sensory function or pain, the patient will be evaluated again after 48 hours. Further on,
      in case of neurologic dysfunction, periods of investigation will be after 3 days, 1 week, 2
      weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. This study includes the definition for nerve
      damage concerning motoric and sensory neural function and pain.

      The patients will be recruited among all patients from our hospital receiving continuous
      peripheral regional anesthesia.
