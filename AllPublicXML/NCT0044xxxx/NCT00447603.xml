    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of Losartan as compared to
      Losartan/HCTZ in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) with high blood pressure.

      Participants who meet eligibility requirements will enter the single-blind Filter Period.
      Participants with either sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) or sitting diastolic blood
      pressure (SiDBP) &gt;=95th percentile for gender/age/height will be administered either losartan
      25 mg or losartan 50 mg depending on body weight (&lt;50 kg and &gt;=50 kg, respectively). After 3
      weeks, if SiSBP or SiDBP is &gt;=95th percentile, participants will titrate to either losartan
      50 mg or 100 mg according to weight. Participants with both SiSBP and SiDBP &lt;95th percentile
      will be excluded from the study. After an additional 3 weeks, participants whose blood
      pressure (either SiSBP or SiDBP) remains &gt;=95th percentile will then enter the double-blind
      phase. Participants who meet all entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either
      losartan or losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for 4 weeks and will be stratified according
      to body weight (&lt;50 kg and &gt;=50 kg). Participants whose weight is &lt;50 kg will be randomized
      to losartan 50 mg or losartan50 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg. Participants weighing &gt;=50 kg will be
      randomized to losartan 100 mg or losartan/HCTZ 100 mg/12.5 mg. At the end of double-blind
      treatment, participants may enter a 20-week double-blind extension and will continue on their
      randomized therapy with losartan or losartan/HCTZ.

      40 participants were enrolled and screened; the trial was terminated before any participants
      were randomized into the double-blind treatment period.

      <recruitment_details>The study was discontinued early due to limited availability of sites and readiness of sites to enroll participants within the predefined time. Although some participants were screened and entered Filter Period, none were randomly assigned to a treatment arm and none entered double-blind treatment period.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Enrolled participants entered screening. If initial criteria were met, eligible participants were separated into 2 strata based on weight and administered either 25-50mg or 50-100mg Losartan during Filter Period. Participant’s whose blood pressure did not respond were eligible to be randomly assigned to the Treatment period of the study.</pre_assignment_details>
