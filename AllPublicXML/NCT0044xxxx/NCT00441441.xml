  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the safety of an investigational drug in children 4 to 11 years of
      age who have asthma. The subjects will attend 7 clinic visits, of which up to 3 will be in
      the morning, and have lung function tests performed.

    <description>Adverse Events reported by the Investigator and judged by the Investigator to be possibly related to study drug, categorized by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MeDRA), were reported.

    <measure>Investigator Evaluations of Electrocardiogram (ECG) Results</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>ECGs were transmitted to an independent cardiologist who was responsible for providing interpretation of the ECG as either normal or abnormal (based on personal assessment). The investigator was then responsible for determining the clinical significance of the abnormal ECG in the context of the participants' history and clinical presentation. An abnormal, clinically significant ECG included, but was not limited to: prolonged QT interval, ischemic changes, ventricular hypertrophy, intraventricular conduction abnormalities, and clinically significant arrhythmias. PD, premature discontinuation.</description>

    <time_frame>12-Week Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiovascular Adverse Events, as categorized by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MeDRA), reported during Treatment Period.

    <description>Cardiovascular Adverse Events, as categorized by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MeDRA), reported during Post-treatment period, defined as 1 day after last dose of study drug. The Adverse Events were identified in any ECG interpretation by a central reader (Cardiologist) for any ECG obtained after the first treatment dose and were then reported by the Primary Investigator as an Adverse Event.</description>

    <measure>Asthma Exacerbations: Worsening of Asthma Requiring Emergency Intervention, Hospitalization, or Treatment With Asthma Medications Prohibited by the Protocols</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment period (weeks 1-12)</time_frame>
    <description>The Primary Investigator determined the severity of the exacerbation based on the participant's clinical presentation and the investigator's understanding of the disease, the participant, and his or her clinical experiences. The severity of the exacerbation was not defined in the protocol. Mild: Usually treated at home. Prompt relief with inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist. Possible short course of oral systemic corticosteroids. Moderate: Usually requires office or emergency department visit. Relief with frequent inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist. Oral systemic corticosteroids; some symptoms last for 1-2 days after treatment begins. Severe: Usually requires emergency department visit and likely hospitalization. Partial relief with frequent inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist. Oral systemic corticosteroids; some symptoms last for more than 3 days after treatment begins. Adjunctive therapies are helpful.</description>

        <title>Asthma Exacerbations: Worsening of Asthma Requiring Emergency Intervention, Hospitalization, or Treatment With Asthma Medications Prohibited by the Protocols</title>
        <description>The Primary Investigator determined the severity of the exacerbation based on the participant’s clinical presentation and the investigator’s understanding of the disease, the participant, and his or her clinical experiences. The severity of the exacerbation was not defined in the protocol. Mild: Usually treated at home. Prompt relief with inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist. Possible short course of oral systemic corticosteroids. Moderate: Usually requires office or emergency department visit. Relief with frequent inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist. Oral systemic corticosteroids; some symptoms last for 1-2 days after treatment begins. Severe: Usually requires emergency department visit and likely hospitalization. Partial relief with frequent inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist. Oral systemic corticosteroids; some symptoms last for more than 3 days after treatment begins. Adjunctive therapies are helpful.</description>

          <description>AeroChamber Plus spacers were provided for participants who demonstrated the inability to coordinate the use of an Meter Dose Inhaler at Visit 1. AeroChamber Plus spacer delivers 22% more medication than the original AeroChamber and is available in three mask sizes and without a mask. &quot;Abnormal high cortisol excretion&quot; and &quot;Abnormal low cortisol excretion&quot; are defined as above the upper limit of normal and below the lower limit of normal, respectively. An abnormality is defined as a value of 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion that is outside the normal range. The normal range for 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion was provided by the central laboratory.</description>

        <description>The peak expiratory flow (PEF) rate measures how fast a person can exhale air. It is used to compare to normal flow rates to predict obstruction and disease. The average PEF for a child or adolescent whose height is 43 inches is 147 Liters/minute (L/min), whose height is 66 inches is 454 L/min. Triplicate measurements taken for the best effort recorded.</description>

        <title>Geometric Mean Ratio for Baseline: Week 12 24-hour Urinary Cortisol Excretion by Spacer Use Excluding Participants With Abnormal Urinary Cortisol Excretion Values at Baseline From the Cortisol Population</title>
        <description>AeroChamber Plus spacers were provided for participants who demonstrated the inability to coordinate the use of an Meter Dose Inhaler at Visit 1. AeroChamber Plus spacer delivers 22% more medication than the original AeroChamber and is available in three mask sizes and without a mask. The data provided are a direct calculation of the Week 12 geometric mean divided by the baseline value,nanomoles per 24 hours (nmol/24 hrs) .</description>
