  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on muscle atrophy in sedated patients on
      intensive care was studied. The aim of this study was to explore if electrical stimulation
      could prevent muscle atrophy.

      Patients were included in the study one day after administration when prolonged sedation and
      ventilation were expected. They were divided into intervention (n=7) and control (n=14)
      groups. For the intervention group, an intermittent neuromuscular electrical stimulation was
      applied daily for 30 minutes on the right thigh whereas the left thigh was used as a control.
      Heart rate, respiration rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and oxygen saturation
      were monitored before, during and after the electrostimulation. Perimeter of the right and
      left thighs was measured in both groups every 3 days at 5 cm above the upper edge of the
      kneecap.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  . Prior to inclusion in the study, an informed consent was given by the family of the
             patients which was approved by the local Ethics Committee of the Virga Jesse Hospital
             and was performed in accordance with the standards of the 1964 Declaration of
             Helsinki.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded from the study if they were still able to move their limb
             actively in spite of the sedation. Patients were also excluded if they had signs of
             recent ischemia or infarction for less then seven days. Patients with severe
             orthopaedic or vascular damage, i.e., fractures or oedema in the lower limbs were also
             excluded. Patients with an augmented risk for neuro electrical stimulation such as
             open wounds, hemodialysis or an arterial catheter at the stimulation area were also
             excluded.
