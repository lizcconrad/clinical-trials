  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 10-15% of all couples attempting to conceive will not become pregnant within one year.
      Among those, the majority will have ovulatory dysfunction, mild male infertility or
      unexplained infertility. The traditional first line therapy for those couples is ovulation
      induction or superovulation using clomiphene citrate. Probably due to anti-estrogenic effects
      of this agent will, some patients will have a thin endometrium as measured by sonography at
      the time of ovulation. This phenomenon may be associated with a lower chance to conceive.
      Tamoxifen is a similar molecule that has been used to clomiphene citrate that has been shown
      to be equally effective to clomiphene in ovulation induction. Preliminary observations showed
      that tamoxifen does not cause a negative effect on the endometrium as compared with
      clomiphene, and may increase the chance to conceive in those patients who have a thin
      endometrium under clomiphene.
