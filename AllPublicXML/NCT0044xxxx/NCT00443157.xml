  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the third in a series using the MenB vaccine from the National Institute of
      Public Health in Norway (NIPH). The vaccine was first made in response to a high incidence of
      disease using the 44/76 strain which was resopnsible for most of the disease there. The VEC
      did the first study, MNB1, using this vaccine. Since then the NIPH has formed a commercial
      partnership with Chiron Vaccines and has reformulated the vaccine using the NZ98/254 MenB
      strain for use in New Zealand.

      The vaccine was first produced at NIPH facilties and it was this vaccine that was used in our
      second study, MNB2. The current study, MNB3, will use the NZ98/254 MenB vaccine but from
      Chiron facilities where production has been scaled up in order to provide enough doses for
      the national immunisation campaign that is ongoing in New Zealand.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed written consent given for four immunisations (group 2 will receive 3 doses
             only) with MeNZB TM vaccine, as well as for eight blood draws to be taken as described
             in the patient information leaflet in appendix 2

          -  Healthy adults (university students) aged 18 up to 40 years on inclusion in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

        On enrolment:

          -  Previous history of bacteriologically confirmed disease caused by N. meningitidis

          -  Prior receipt of any group B meningococcal vaccine

          -  have had household contact with and/or intimate exposure to an individual with culture
             or PCR proven N. meningitidis serogroup B within the previous 60 days

          -  have either received, or for whom there is intent to immunize with, any vaccines or
             investigational agents within 50 days prior to enrolment, through to 50 days following
             the last study vaccine administration, with the exception of influenza vaccines or
             post-exposure tetanus vaccination

          -  have a history of any anaphylactic shock, urticaria or other allergic reaction after
             previous vaccinations or hypersensitivity to any vaccine component

          -  have experienced significant acute or chronic infections requiring systemic antibiotic
             treatment within the past 14 days

          -  have any present or suspected serious acute or chronic disease such as: cardiac or
             autoimmune disease, insulin dependent diabetes or progressive neurological disease or
             severe malnutrition, acute or progressive hepatic disease, acute or progressive renal
             disease; leukaemia, lymphomas, neoplasm;

          -  have a known or suspected impairment of the immune function, or those receiving
             immunosuppressive therapy, or having received immunosuppressive therapy, including
             systemic steroids, or ACTH or inhaled steroids in dosages which are associated with
             hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression;

          -  have received blood, blood products or a parenteral immunoglobulin preparation in the
             past 12 weeks;

          -  have a known bleeding diathesis, or any condition that may be associated with a
             prolonged bleeding time;

          -  have a history of seizure disorder;

          -  have an inherited genetic anomaly (known cytogenic disorders) e.g., Down's syndrome;

          -  Language difficulty sufficient to preclude adequate comprehension of the information
             sheet, consent form or study nurse's explanation of the study;

          -  The possibility of pregnancy - a pregnancy test (urine) on the scheduled day of
             vaccination will be offered to any female wishing to participate in the study. A
             positive test will result in exclusion from the study. (Agreement from each female
             participants will be sought prior to vaccination that they will take adequate
             precautions to avoid pregnancy for the duration of the vaccination phase of the study
             until the final blood sample appointment following their final vaccination, i.e. until
             the week 63 - visit 8 - blood appointment);

          -  Current regimen of chronic prescription medications other than oral contraceptives, or
             current regular use of any over-the-counter concomitant medications including
             antipyretics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents;

          -  Current participation in any other clinical trial (an undertaking will be sought from
             participants not to enrol in any other clinical trial for the duration of this study);

          -  They have any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere
             with the evaluation of the study objectives

          -  Generalised acute systemic illness on the day of immunisation

          -  Sublingual temperature &gt;38,5oC on the day of immunisation

          -  Development of any condition specified in the initial exclusion criteria cited above
             will constitute a criterion for exclusion from receiving subsequent vaccine doses.

          -  Any serious reaction related to the study vaccines, which in the opinion of the
             investigator should alter the course of subsequent study.
