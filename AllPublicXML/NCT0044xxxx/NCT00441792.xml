  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to determine the difference in hospital length of stay between septic
      patients given etomidate and those given midazolam for induction during rapid sequence
      intubation (RSI) in the emergency department. To achieve this aim we plan to perform a
      prospective randomized trial measuring the length of stay of patients meeting sepsis criteria
      and requiring intubation. The investigators will compare in-hospital mortality rates between
      patients given etomidate and patients given midazolam for induction. In addition to hospital
      length of stay, secondary endpoints between the two groups will include length of stay in the
      intensive care unit, death within 48 hours of admission, and total number of days intubated.

      Research Hypothesis:

      In adult patients presenting to the emergency department with sepsis and requiring rapid
      sequence intubation, the length of stay of patients given etomidate will be greater than that
      of patients given the alternative agent midazolam for induction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Although the use of the drug etomidate for continuous sedation in mechanically
      ventilated patients was found to have detrimental effects on patient mortality shortly after
      its introduction into clinical practice, etomidate continues to be widely used as an
      induction agent for endotracheal intubation. Recent data have called into question the safety
      of using etomidate for even a single bolus in patients at risk of adrenal insufficiency,
      emphasizing the fact that single bolus doses of etomidate cause measurable adrenal
      suppression, and consequently may cause an increase in vasopressor requirements and hospital
      length of stay. Alternative FDA-approved induction agents, such as midazolam, are claimed by
      many authors to be safer than etomidate; however, no studies have formally compared these
      agents.

      Research Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that in critically ill adult patients
      presenting to the emergency department with sepsis and requiring rapid sequence intubation,
      the hospital length of stay of patients given etomidate will be increased compared to
      patients given midazolam for induction.

      Specific Aims: The specific aim is to determine the difference in hospital length of stay
      between septic patients given etomidate and those given midazolam for induction during rapid
      sequence intubation in the emergency department. The investigators plan to compare the two
      groups in terms of length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, and duration of intubation by
      performing a prospective, randomized, trial of critically ill patients presenting to the
      emergency department with sepsis requiring intubation. The investigators will also compare
      the mortality rates in these two groups while controlling for severity of illness and the use
      of steroids while hospitalized. Significance: If the use of etomidate to induce anesthesia
      prior to intubation is found to adversely affect the length of stay of septic patients, a
      reduction in the length of stay in such patients might be achieved by using alternative
      agents for induction. The current widespread use of an induction agent that may adversely
      affect the length of stay of septic patients has significant implications for patient
      management.

            <description>Patients received midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) intravenously before rapid sequence intubation in a double-blind fashion. The dose of each medication was chosen according to current physician practice and previous study findings. Identical study vials containing either etomidate or midazolam, in volume-equivalent concentrations, were prepared by our pharmacy department and stored in kits that also contained a variety of commonly used paralytic agents. Kits were labeled with numbers that reflected the assignment generated by a randomization sequence generator and placed in our automated medication dispensing cabinet (Omnicell, Inc., Mountain View, CA). The remainder of the patients' care, both in the emergency department and in the intensive care unit, was directed according to the treating physician.</description>
