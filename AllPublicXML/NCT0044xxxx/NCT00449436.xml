      The current goal of antiretroviral therapy is to use a potent regimen that will suppress
      plasma viral load and maintain this suppression as long as possible. However, for most
      patients treated with such potent regimen, several problems can limit their long term
      effectiveness and contribute to incomplete viral suppression. These problems include poor
      tolerability, metabolic toxic effects. In order to avoid common problems as toxicity it might
      be interested to simplify treatment with fewer toxicity, lower pill burden. In this study we
      will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a simplification treatment with TRIZIVIR in long
      term after a Boosted PI or NNRTI containing regimen as first line therapy.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Subject is ≥18 years of age and has documented evidence of HIV-1 infection.

          -  Patient received first-line therapy including a boosted Protease Inhibitor or NNRTI
             for at least 6 months. Note: Only the patients whose first line antiretroviral
             treatment was modified for intolerance (and not for virological failure) could be
             included provided this treatment has been stable for at least 6 months.

          -  Patient having a viral load &lt; 50 copies/ml at screening and at least 3 months prior to
             enrollment,

          -  Subject is willing and able to understand and provide written informed consent prior
             to participation in this study.

          -  For women of childbearing potential: has a negative pregnancy test result (-human
             chorionic gonadotropin; -HCG) within 35 days prior to administration of
             investigational product (Day 1) and agrees to use a proven double barrier method of
             contraception or abstinence from 2 weeks before the first day of treatment.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patient has received Trizivir®.

          -  Patient has a viral load &gt; 50 copies/mL at the screening and within 3 months of
             enrollment.

             of infection HIV.

             times normal higher limit) for the during screening and before the first day of
             treatment (1-28 days);

          -  Presence clinically-relevant of pancreatitis or hepatitis within 6 months of
             screening;

          -  Patient has a severe hepatic insufficiency or a renal insufficiency in final stage.

             opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the observance and the evaluations
             required by the protocol and which could compromise the safety of the patient during
             his participation in the study;

          -  Pregnancy, nursing, or pre-menopausal woman likely to be pregnant and not receiving
             reliable contraception (oral contraception, progesterone injectable associated a
             mechanical method of protection, intra-uterine device...) for the duration of study

          -  Any biological anomaly for the period of the study and before the first day of
             treatment which, of the opinion of the investigator, could contra-indicate the
             participation of the patient in the study. Any biological anomaly of Grade 4 for the
             period of study and before the first day of treatment , except contrary opinion of the
             investigator and after agreement of the sponsor;

          -  Any pathological state (diabetes, hyperthyroidism, syndrome of malabsorption, renal
             insufficiency...) which, of the opinion of the investigator, could interfere on
             absorption, the distribution, the metabolism and the excretion of the drugs;

          -  Onset of allergy to the drugs of the study or other allergies which, of the opinion of
             the investigator, contra-indicates the participation of the patient in the study;

          -  Patient is taking part in a clinical trial at the time of entry in the study except
             for observational trials.

          -  Treatment by an experimental drug in the 30 days or five half-lives of the treatment
             (the longest period will be taken) which precede the first treatment of the test.
