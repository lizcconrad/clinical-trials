      This research study evaluates an experimental device for the treatment of the depressed phase
      of Bipolar Disorder Type II. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is an
      experimental procedure where a device delivers an alternating magnetic field to a focal area
      of the brain. When the coil is placed against the scalp on the left frontal area of the head,
      the magnetic field is focused to a region of the brain that is thought to be involved in
      depression. This study is intended to test if rTMS can affect this region of the brain in a
      way that improves the symptoms of depression related to Bipolar Disorder Type II. The purpose
      of this study is to obtain safety and efficacy information regarding the use of
      rTMS(Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) for patients in the depressed phase of
      Bipolar Disorder Type II.

    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial of rTMS for outpatients in the depressive
      phase of BD-II. Participants will be evaluated at UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.
      Forty eligible subjects will be randomized to either active treatment (n=20) or sham (no
      stimulation, n=20). Each subject will receive treatment 5 days per week for a total of 6
      weeks. At the end of the 6 weeks, those who remain depressed will have the option of
      receiving 6 additional weeks of open rTMS treatment. We require these participants to meet
      the same eligibility criteria in the open phase (i.e. MADRS ≥15, YMRS &lt;12) as in the initial
      double blind phase. At the completion of treatment, a follow-up appointment will be scheduled
      with a study physician to ensure that the participant is properly transitioning to clinical
      care and is not having a significant change in clinical status. Those who do not already have
      a treating physician will be referred to a new provider.
