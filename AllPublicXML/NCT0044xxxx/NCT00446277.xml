    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate changes in the morphology and function of the
      corneal endothelium before and after cataract surgery in patients with diabetes type II. Also
      to explain if determination of HgbA1c in diabetics is a predictor for the changes in
      morphology and function.

    <textblock>
      Thirty patients with Diabetes type II and thirty non-diabetes patients scheduled to cataract
      surgery (phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation) were invited to participate
      in the study. Preoperatively, all patients had a full eye examination and 3 endothelial cell
      photos were taken.

      Three months postoperatively the patients were called for a re-examination including 3
      endothelial cell photos. The function of the cornea is dependent of the number and morphology
      of the endothelial cells, and even small traumas like cataract surgery may disrupt the cornea
      integrity leading to corneal haze and blur. Diabetics may be more vulnerable to corneal
      stress.
