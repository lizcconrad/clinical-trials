    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the association with EBV infection, monitor the
      occurrence of lymphoma and assess lymphoma risk in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and/or
      Crohns disease and you have taken infliximab.

      This is an observational (review of records), retrospective (research activity that is
      performed after the events under the study have occurred), registry study where data was
      collected from 3 different registries sponsored or supported by Centocor. Registries are
      Centocor-sponsored Therapy Resource Evaluation and Assessment Tool (TREATâ„¢) Registry of
      Crohn's Disease, and in the following two Centocor-supported registries the Consortium of
      Rheumatology Researchers of North America, Inc. (CORRONA) registry and the Infliximab RA
      Registry, a subset of the National Database Registry of Rheumatoid Arthritis (NDBRRA) and of
      the National Databank for Rheumatic Diseases (NDB). A registry is data collection in a real
      life physician-patient setting. Physicians prescribe medications for rheumatoid arthritis
      and/or Crohns disease in accordance with their usual clinical practice and then record this
      information and provide it to Centocor. For this registry study, Centocor collected data from
      3 registries to evaluate the risk of getting lymphoma if you have rheumatoid arthritis and/or
      Crohns disease and you have taken infliximab. Patients who were in one of the 3 registries
      and had rheumatoid arthritis and/or Crohns disease and did not take infliximab were also
      evaluated. This registry study does not involve the use of any investigational drugs.
