      The purpose of establishing the database is to evaluate the effects of surgical removal of
      the prostate (prostatectomy) and cryosurgery on prostate cancer, quality of life, and overall
      health. Participation in the study will allow collection of medical information related to
      prostate cancer treatment from hospital and doctor's office records. Questionnaires will be
      completed reflecting bladder, bowel, and sexual function, and quality of life at three, six,
      twelve, eighteen, and twenty-four months after surgery, and yearly thereafter.
