      Determine the time to progression for the combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab in
      patients with previously treated metastatic cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal
      junction
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We postulate that the addition of bevacizumab may increase the efficacy of erlotinib in
      patients with metastatic esophageal cancer, without adding significant toxicity. The
      non-overlapping toxicity profiles may allow the administration of the maximum tolerated doses
      for both agents without additive toxicities with the goal of demonstrating synergistic
      clinical activity. This combination has been previously tested in two studies for other
      malignancies with good tolerance and encouraging results.
