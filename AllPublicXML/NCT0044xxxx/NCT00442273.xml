      To compare the therapeutic effect between autologous serum and umbilical cord serum eyedrops
      in the treatment of severe dry eye syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ninety-two eyes of 48 patients with severe dry eye syndrome (34 eyes of 17 patients with
      Sjögren’s syndrome and 58 eyes of 31 patients with non-Sjögren’s syndrome) were treated with
      either 20% autologous serum (41 eyes of 21 patients) or umbilical cord serum eyedrops (51
      eyes of 27 patients). Symptom scoring, corneal sensitivity test, tear film break-up time
      (BUT), Schirmer test, tear clearance rate (TCR), corneal fluorescein staining, and
      conjunctival impression cytology were performed before and 1 month and 2 months after
      treatment.
