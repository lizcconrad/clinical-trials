  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer will be enrolled to receive either Trovax® alone
      or Trovax® plus Interferon Alfa. The study will try to determine whether the use of Trovax®
      will delay tumor progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer will be enrolled in the study if all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. Once the patient is enrolled, and baseline tests have
      been completed, the patient will start treatment.

      Trovax® alone arm:

      Trovax will be given as an intramuscular injection every two weeks for the first two months,
      then once a month for the next 2 months, and then once every 2 months for up to a year.

      Trovax® plus IFN-α:

      Trovax® schedule will be the same as the Trovax® alone arm. IFN will be given on the first,
      third and fifth day of the week for a total of twelve weeks.

      At every office visit vital signs will be taken. Every eight weeks a medical history,
      physical exam, performance status evaluation, chest x-ray or CT scan, abdomen/pelvis CT scan
      or MRI will be done. A blood sample (about 8-10 tablespoons) will be taken to test the
      immunological response to TroVax® on the same days that the patient receives TroVax®
      injections.
