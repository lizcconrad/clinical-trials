      This Phase 2a, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study is designed to assess the
      safety and biologic activity of daily oral administration of 4 escalating doses of 6R-BH4
      over 16 weeks in subjects with sickle cell disease. During an optional extension phase, the
      study will assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of extended treatment with 6R-BH4,
      for a total of up to 2 years.

          -  Previous treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or VEGF inhibitors.

          -  Has known hypersensitivity to 6R-BH4 or its excipients.
