      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and leucovorin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Arsenic trioxide may help fluorouracil and leucovorin work better by making tumor
      cells more sensitive to the drugs. Giving arsenic trioxide together with fluorouracil and
      leucovorin may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of arsenic trioxide
      and fluorouracil when given together with leucovorin in treating patients with stage IV
      colorectal cancer that has relapsed or not responded to treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and best dose combination of fluorouracil and
           arsenic trioxide when given together with leucovorin calcium in patients with relapsed
           or refractory stage IV colorectal cancer.

        -  Determine if arsenic trioxide down regulates the expression of thymidylate synthase in
           tumor and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fluorouracil and arsenic trioxide.

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-5, 8, 11, 15, 18, and 22 and
      fluorouracil IV over 24 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 24 hours on days 8, 15, and 22.
      Treatment repeats every 5 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of fluorouracil and arsenic trioxide until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are
      treated at the MTD.

      Patients undergo peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) collection and fine-needle tumor
      aspiration periodically to determine the effects of arsenic trioxide on thymidylate synthase
      expression in the tumor and in PBMCs.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>The objective of this phase I study is to determine a phase II dose of combination of 5-FU and ATO that can be safely used for the treatment of 5-FU resistant colon cancer. Following the dose escalation/de-escalation procedure described in section 4.2, the recommended phase II dose of the combination 5-FU with ATO will be established as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), defined as the highest dose level combination at which &lt;=1 out of 6 patients experiencing DLT.</description>

Intra-venous (IV) infusion of ATO (mg/kg body weight) over 1-4 hours will be administered for 5 consecutive days (day 1 to day 5) during the first week, twice a week on weeks 2 and 3 (days 8, 11, 15, and 18), and only one day (day 22) of week 4. Treatment will continue for a maximum of 8 cycles, provided that the patient tolerates treatment and there is evidence of clinical benefit.</description>
