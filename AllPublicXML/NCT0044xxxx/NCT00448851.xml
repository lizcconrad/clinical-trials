    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the effect of inhaled dust mite
      allergen extract on airway responses in allergic individuals with mild asthma. Information
      learned from this study will be used to identify a safe dose range of D Farinae extract for
      use in inhalation challenge studies. This study will also help determine how inhalation of
      the allergen affects mucociliary clearance (MCC) which is a measure of how quickly mucus
      clears from the airway.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a non-blinded study of the effect of inhaled house dust mite (D Farinae)
      allergen extract on airway responses, with the principal endpoint being a decrease in FEV1 of
      15% within 10 minutes after inhalation of one of a sequence of doses of allergen compared
      with measurements obtained immediately prior to challenge. These doses will be delivered as 5
      inhalations of allergen at concentrations of 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16, 32, 64, 125,
      250, 500, 1000, and 2000 AU/mL. Allergen challenge often induces an immediate and late phase
      decrease in lung function. The immediate phase that occurs within 10 minutes, often self
      resolves and is associated with release of histamine from airway mast cells, while the late
      phase response often occurs 2 to 8 hours later and is associated with increased airway
      inflammation.

      During the subject's baseline visit occurring at least 2 days prior to allergen challenge, we
      will measure mucociliary clearance (MCC) of inhaled, radiolabeled particles by gamma
      scintigraphy. The subject will return 24 hours later for a follow-up scan and a sputum sample
      will also be collected. At 4 hours post allergen challenge, we will again measure MCC as an
      exploratory endpoint. It is expected that mucociliary clearance will be depressed as part of
      a late phase reaction to allergen challenge. Twenty-four hours after allergen challenge,
      induced sputum will be obtained and compared with the sputum sample obtained at the baseline
      visit. Exploratory endpoints of interest from examination of induced sputum will also be
      collected after inhaled allergen challenge.
