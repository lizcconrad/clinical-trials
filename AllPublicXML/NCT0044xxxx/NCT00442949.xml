    <textblock>
      Release of troponin evaluated by the peak of troponin during the hospital phase.Because of
      its sensitivity and specificity as well as its widespread use in routine practice, rise in
      troponin levels is the main assessment criteria of this study. We plan to demonstrate a
      significantly altered distribution of the troponin release as evaluated by the peak of
      troponin for each patient during the hospitalization period (from randomization to
      cardiologic unit discharge), in the two arms of the trial.

      We propose to evaluate the optimal moment for catheterization in patients presenting with
      acute coronary syndromes by comparing rapid catheterization on the day of admission (within 8
      hours of admission, with an average time close to 3 hours, as in the rapid strategy arm of
      the ISAR-COOL trial) with a slower approach where the examination is scheduled for the next
      working day (8 to 60 hours post admission, with an average close to 24 hours). Patients
      included will present with severe unstable angina defined as a TIMI score &gt; 3 All patients
      must present with an indication for catheterization and they will receive the same optimal
      pharmacological treatment including abciximab (ReoPro*) when undergoing PCI and started just
      before the procedure as indicated in the label of the drug (substitution by another drug of
      the class, eptifibatide or tirofiban, is not possible in the catheterization laboratory
      according to the labels of these two other drugs). Randomization will evaluate only time to
      catheterization: rapidly, as soon as possible following admission (within 8 hours of
      admission) versus a delayed approach (8 to 60 hours following admission). The goal of
      randomization is to determine the ideal time to catheterization while indications for
      catheterization, pharmacological treatment, and patient care remain constant. This is a
      pragmatic study aiming to compare 2 different strategies in the management of ACS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Man over 18 or non-pregnant woman over 18.

          2. Patient hospitalized for severe acute coronary syndrome. To be selected patients will
             need to have at least 2 criteria for acute coronary syndrome AND a TIMI score &gt; 3 for
             severity of ACS.

             ACS is defined by at least two of the following diagnostic criteria :

               -  ischemic symptom

               -  electrocardiographic abnormalities in the ST segment (depression or transitory
                  elevation of at least 0.1 mV), or in the T waves, at least in two contiguous
                  leads positive troponin (as defined locally).

             Severity of ACS is defined by a TIMI score &gt; 3

          3. indication for catheterization agreed and possible within the following 8 hours.

          4. signed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients that would require immediate catheterization for ongoing refractory ischemia,
             major arrhythmias, or hemodynamic instability are not eligible for the study.

          2. Anticoagulant therapy with antivitamin K within 5 days preceding randomization

          3. Thrombolytic therapy during the preceding 24 hours

          4. Upstream treatment by a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor

          5. ReoPro should not be administered to patients with known sensitivity to abciximab, to
             any component of the product or to murine monoclonal antibodies. Because inhibition of
             platelet aggregation increases the risk of bleeding, ReoPro is contra-indicated in the
             following clinical situations: active internal bleeding; history of cerebrovascular
             accident within two years; recent (within two months) intracranial or intraspinal
             surgery or trauma; recent (within two months) major surgery; intracranial neoplasm,
             arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm; known bleeding diathesis or severe
             uncontrolled hypertension; pre-existing thrombocytopenia; vasculitis; hypertensive or
             diabetic retinopathy; severe hepatic or severe renal failure.

          6. Woman nursing
