  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness (level of pain control) and safety
      of orally administrated tapentadol (CG5503) Extended Release (ER) (base) at doses of 100-250
      mg twice daily in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain of the lower back, in
      comparison with placebo and Oxycodone Controlled Release (CR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomized (study medication assigned to patients by chance),
      double-blind (neither patient nor investigator knows the study medication), phase III,
      placebo and active controlled trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of orally
      administered tapentadol (CG5503) Extended Release (ER) (base) at doses 100-250 mg twice daily
      in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain of the lower back. The study is being
      conducted for registration and approval of tapentadol (CG5503) in the US and outside US. The
      trial will consist of five periods: screening (to assess eligibility), washout (3-7 days with
      determination of baseline pain intensity), titration (of dose over 3 weeks to the optimal
      individual level), maintenance (investigational drug intake for 12 weeks with adjustments
      allowed), and follow-up (2 weeks post treatment discontinuation). The study hypothesis is
      that the study drug will be more effective than placebo in reducing patients' pain intensity.
      The Secondary objectives include the collection of pharmacokinetic (related to how the body
      uses the drug) information for dose verification. The trial objectives will be assessed by
      comparing the baseline pain level to the level of week 12 of the maintenance phase. This will
      be done by looking at the patient's pain diary information. Titrate tapentadol (CG5503) ER
      (extended release) in 50 mg steps to patient's optimal dose ranging between 100mg and 250mg
      twice a day; Oxycodone CR (controlled release) 20mg to 50mg twice a day; Placebo (no active
      ingredients). All doses of trial treatment will be taken orally with or without food, for a
      maximum timeframe of 15 weeks.

    <description>For this twice daily pain assessment, the subjects were to indicate the level of pain experienced over the previous 12 hours on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) where a score of 0 indicated &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicated &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 week endpoint</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to end point in EuroQol-5 Dimension Questionnaire. A higher score indicates an improvement in health in the Health Status Index. The EuroQol-5 is a five dimensional health state classification. Each dimension is assessed on a 3-point ordinal scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems, 3=extreme problems). The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 to 1, with 1.00 indicating &quot;full health&quot; and 0 representing dead.</description>

The subjects were to indicate the level of pain experienced over the previous 12 hours on an 11-point NRS where a score of 0 indicated &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicated &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;.</description>

            <groups_desc>The primary null hypothesis to be tested for the study was that the tapentadol ER group was not different from the placebo group for the primary endpoint. Assuming the mean treatment group difference of 0.7 with an SD of 2.7, 314 subjects per treatment group were estimated to provide 90% power to show that the tapentadol ER group was statistically different from placebo at an alpha level of 0.05. The total number of subjects to be randomly assigned to a treatment group for the study was 942.</groups_desc>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EuroQol-5® (EQ-5D) Health Status Index to Week 12</title>
        <description>Change from baseline to end point in EuroQol-5 Dimension Questionnaire. A higher score indicates an improvement in health in the Health Status Index. The EuroQol-5 is a five dimensional health state classification. Each dimension is assessed on a 3-point ordinal scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems, 3=extreme problems). The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 to 1, with 1.00 indicating &quot;full health&quot; and 0 representing dead.</description>
