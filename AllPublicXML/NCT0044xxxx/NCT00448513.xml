      The purpose of this study is to clarify the effects of tea catechin extracts on the frequency
      changes of micronuclei in peripheral lymphocytes compared with other oxidative stress markers
      in late middle aged healthy volunteers

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Experimental studies have revealed that tea catechin extracts induce preventive effects on
      oxidative stress, but there have been few clinical trials conducted to verify the effects.
      Also, there have been few clinical markers indicating oxidative damage, and therefore, more
      accurate and reliable markers have been expected. The study is designed for evaluating the
      effects of tea catechin extracts on the frequency changes of micronuclei in peripheral
      lymphocytes as the indicator of oxidative damage, compared with other oxidative stress
      markers in late middle aged healthy volunteers.
