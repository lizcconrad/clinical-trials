  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this observational study is to collect safety and effectiveness data for
      bortezomib used at first relapse in a group of multiple myeloma patients who received
      specific and well defined first line treatments within previous clinical studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a need by physicians to evaluate the results of bortezomib treatment in a homogenous
      patient population with regard to the multiple myeloma treatments in first line. For that
      reason the current study, ADVANCE, is designed to structurally collect data on the daily
      practice use of bortezomib as treatment after first relapse in patients with specific and
      well defined first line treatments (i.e. patients who participated in the HOVON-49 or
      HOVON-50 study). In both HOVON studies patients were randomized to either receiving
      thalidomide or not, as a part of the first line treatment. Therefore, the effect of
      pre-treatment with thalidomide on duration, effectiveness and safety of the bortezomib
      treatment after first relapse can be studied specifically. The analysis of this particular
      type of data will, however, be descriptive. All adverse events, regardless of seriousness,
      severity, or presumed relationship to bortezomib therapy will be recorded on the case report
      form, i.e., a form for each patient in the study on which all needed data are recorded, and
      reported to the sponsor within current timelines. The sponsor assumes responsibility for
      appropriate reporting of adverse events to the regulatory authorities. This project is a
      'post authorization study (PAS)'. This means that only routinely available medical data are
      collected, with the patients' permission, and no additional interventions or diagnostic
      procedures should be done specifically for this study. Because the study is observational,
      dosage, administration and duration of treatment is at discretion of the treating physician
