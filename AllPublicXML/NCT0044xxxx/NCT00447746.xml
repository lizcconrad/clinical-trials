  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer remains the second most common cancer worldwide.Although the prognosis is poor
      for majority of patients , long term survival is achievable in patients in whom surgical
      resection is possible.

      However the results of surgery are generally disapointing in most large series.The exception
      to this appears to be Japan and far east where a standardized approach to surgery is
      undertaken with low morbidity and mortality.The extent of surgery and particularly the
      development of systematic lymphadenectomy(D2)has been credited in Japan for the improved
      outcome in patients with gastric cancer.

      Hence for comparing the difference between D1 and D2 lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer in
      terms of overall survival,disease free survival and loco regional recurrence and also post
      operative morbidity and mortality following both these procedures,this study has been
      undertaken.

      In D1 lymphadenectomy, only those lymph nodes which are adjacent to the part of stomach being
      resected will be removed.In D2 lymphadenectomy other lymph nodes draining the stomach will
      also be removed according to internationally accepted guidelines and also include resection
      of greater omentum along with anterior layer of transverse mesocolon and lesser omentum upto
      its attachment to hepatoduodenal ligament.

      Currently both these procedures are widely practised worldwide and there is no definite
      evidence showing the superiority of one procedure over the other.Neither is any of these
      procedures experimental.

      We are doing this trial to see whether one of these procedures is superior to the other.
