  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at several genes that might determine how the body
      processes the drugs used to treat lung, colorectal and head and neck cancers. The goal of
      this examination is to help investigators determine the proper dosage to give future cancer
      patients or to better predict which future patients will respond to particular drug
      therapies.

      This study is to establish a pilot pharmacogenomic program in identifying genetic variation
      to predict the safety, toxicity and/or efficacy of drugs. DNA will be extracted from
      patients' peripheral blood to study SNPs in DPD, TS, MTHFR, UGT1A1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, GSTM1,
      GSTT1, GSTP1, HO-1, ERCC1, XPD, XRCC1 and EGFR genes. The results of genetic study will be
      compared to treatment efficacy and toxicity. The ultimate goal is to use genotype profiles to
      provide individualized cancer treatment to improve outcome and decrease toxicity.
