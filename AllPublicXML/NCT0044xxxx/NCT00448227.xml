    <measure>Pharmacokinetics of Single Dose - Tmax</measure>
    <time_frame>Plasma samples were collected at 0.5, 1, 4 and 6 hours after dosing.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Tmax - The time after administration of a drug when the maximum plasma concentration is reached.</description>

    <measure>Safety Assessed by AEs, SAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>38 days</time_frame>
    <description>AEs and SAEs were collected during patient's stay in the clinic for PK sampling up to Hour 8, then at day 2 visit, 8 days(safety follow-up call) and 38 days (safety follow-up call) post dose.</description>

    <measure>Tolerability of of the Famciclovir Pediatric Formulation as Assessed by Study Personnel.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes after dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability was assessed by the study personnel 30 minutes after dosing using the following scale:
Significant emesis occurred,
Infant spit out most of the dose ingesting less than half of what was administered,
Infant spit out some of the dose, but ingested at least 50% of what was administered,
Infant was able to ingest and retain the dose administered</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of the Famciclovir Pediatric Formulation as Assessed by the Patient's Caregiver</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the caregiver using a 5-point scale immediately after dosing:
Very badly accepted/unacceptable: infant showed great displeasure, compromising use of formulation
Badly but accepted: infant showed displeasure with dosing but could be coaxed to take complete dose
Neither good nor bad: infant showed no apparent displeasure and with little effort was coaxed to take complete dose
Well accepted: infant appeared to enjoy the formulation and with little coaxing ingested most of dose
Very well accepted: infant appeared eager and ingested most of dose without special coaxing</description>
