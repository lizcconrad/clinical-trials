      This is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled, dose optimization study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      MTS (12.5, 18.75, 25, and 37.5 cm2) compared to placebo with reference to CONCERTA® in
      pediatric subjects diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
