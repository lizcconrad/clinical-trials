    <textblock>
      2/3 of patients discharged from an emergency department after treatment for an acute headache
      will still be bothered by headache within 24 hours of emergency department (ED) treatment.
      The goal of this study is to compare two medications, naproxen and sumatriptan, to determine
      which is better for the treatment of recurrent headache within 24 hours of emergency
      department discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two-thirds of the five million headache patients who present to US emergency departments (ED)
      annually are suffering an acute exacerbation of a primary headache disorder. Of these acute
      primary headaches, migraine is the most frequently encountered disease entity in the ED,
      accounting for 60% of primary headaches, followed by tension-type headaches, which represent
      10% of all primary headaches seen in the ED. About Â¼ of all acute primary headaches seen in
      the ED cannot readily be given a specific diagnosis3. Multiple parenteral treatments are used
      to treat acute primary headaches1, but to date, regardless of specific headache diagnosis, no
      medication eliminates the frequent recurrence of headache after ED discharge. To date, it is
      unknown which medication patients should be given when discharged from an ED after treatment
      for a primary headache. This study will compare two oral headache treatments to determine
      which one relives pain more effectively.

      Specific aims:

      1) To determine which of two oral medications is more efficacious for all acute primary
      headache patients who are discharged from an ED.

      Primary hypotheses:

      In the 48 hour period following ED treatment for a primary headache, sumatriptan 100mg will
      relieve pain better than naproxen 500mg, as measured by an 11-point numerical rating scale
      for pain.

    <description>Within 48 hours of ED discharge, participants were allowed to take the investigational medication. At the moment they took the investigational medication, they were asked to record a number from 0 to 10, which represented their headache. 0 signified no pain and 10 signified the worse pain imaginable.
Two hours later, participants were asked again to record their pain on a scale from 0 to 10. The outcome is the change in pain between baseline and two hours and will be a number between 0 and 10. Greater numbes signify greater relief</description>

    <description>This is a recommend outcome in headache research. At the time of the assessment (48 hours after ER discharge), patients are asked to report their current level of functional impairment: severe (unable to do any activities); moderate (able to do a few activities); mild (able to do many but not all activities) or none (able to do all activities).

          <title>Headache-related Functional Disability</title>
          <description>This is a recommend outcome in headache research. At the time of the assessment (48 hours after ER discharge), patients are asked to report their current level of functional impairment: severe (unable to do any activities); moderate (able to do a few activities); mild (able to do many but not all activities) or none (able to do all activities). For this analysis, patient's answers were dichotomized into some impairment or no impairment.</description>
          <population>Patients who reported any level of functional impairment (mild, moderate, or severe) are tabulated here.</population>
