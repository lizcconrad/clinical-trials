    <textblock>
      This is a 4 month open trial with TNF-blockade using infliximab (an antibody that blocks TNF)
      in adult patients with chronic myositis (polymyositis, dermatomyositis, inclusion body
      myositis) who have persisting muscle weakness and inflammatory active disease despite
      adequate treatment with immunosuppressives either currently or previously.

      Infliximab is given as infusions, 5 mg/kg body weight, these infusions are repeated after 2,
      6 and 14 weeks. The study involves 15 adult patients.

      Primary outcome measure is muscle function assessed by muscle function index score.

      Other outcome measures are Myositis Disease Activity core set: Patient’s global assessment
      and physicians global assessment on visual analogue scales (VAS). Manual muscle test, Health
      assessment questionnaire (HAQ), serum levels of CPK, LD and extra muscular disease activity
      score. Muscle biopsy, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of thigh muscles and Health related
      Quality of life, measured by SF-36.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients.

          -  Persisting muscle weakness defined as ≤ 80% of muscle strength as measured by
             functional index of myositis

          -  Signs of disease activity defined as muscle edema observed by magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI) or creatine kinase (CK) elevation, or inflammatory cell infiltrates on
             muscle biopsy, and failure to respond to treatment with glucocorticoids for a minimum
             of six months in combination with azathioprine or methotrexate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women, nursing mothers or a planned pregnancy within one and a half years of
             enrolment.

          -  Prior administration of infliximab or any other therapeutic agent targeted at reducing
             TNF (e.g., Etanercept, pentoxifylline, thalidomide or anti-CD4+ antibody) within the
             previous six months.

          -  A history of known allergies to murine proteins.

          -  Serious infections, such as hepatitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis in the previous 3
             months. Less serious infections in the previous 3 months, such as acute upper
             respiratory tract infection (colds) or uncomplicated urinary tract infection (colds)
             or uncomplicated urinary tract infection need not to considered exclusions at the
             discretion of the treating physician.

          -  History of opportunistic infections such as herpes zoster within 2 months of
             screening. Evidence of active CMV, active pneumocystis carinii, drug resistant
             atypical mycobacterium, etc.

          -  Documented HIV infection.

          -  Current signs or symptoms of severe, progressive or uncontrolled renal, hepatic,
             hematologic, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic or cerebral disease.

          -  Any currently known malignancy or pre-malignant lesions or any history of malignancy
             within the past five years.

          -  Patients with alcoholism, alcoholic liver disease, or other chronic liver disease.

          -  Patients with a positive PPD and chest X-Ray suggestive of active TB or a previous
             exposure to TB.
