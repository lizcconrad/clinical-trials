  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of
      SNS-032, given in 3 weekly administrations per cycle and to identify a recommended Phase 2
      dose.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Other objectives of this study include measuring pharmacokinetics (how long the drug can be
      measured in the body) and identifying potential biomarkers.

    <description>Patients escalated to MTD starting in Cohort 1 of 15 mg/m2 of SNS-032 injection, with 1.5-fold increase each cohort and a maximum loading dose increase of 10 mg/m2. Each dose cohort will have a minimum of 3 patients each with advanced CLL or MM. Dose escalation continues in the absence of Cycle 1 DLT criteria until an MTD is achieved for each disease type to a maximum of 7 cohorts at a high dose of 70 mg/m2. Stage 2 tests at MTD in larger group.</description>
