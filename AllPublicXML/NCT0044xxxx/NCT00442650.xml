      Multicentre, open label, phase III study. Subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis were
      given efalizumab subcutaneously once per week for the 12-week treatment period. Assessments
      involved physical examination, disease activity assessments, clinical laboratory tests
      (haematology, blood chemistry and standard urinalysis), evaluation of the Psoriasis Area and
      Severity Index (PASI), the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA), the Patient's Global
      Psoriasis Assessment (PGPA), the SF-36 Health Survey and psoriatic body surface area (BSA).
      The 12-week treatment period was followed by a 12-week follow-up (FU) period, during which
      other antipsoriatic medications were allowed. The same assessments were also performed in the
      12-week FU period.
