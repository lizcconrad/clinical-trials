  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being performed under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act,
      signed into law in 2002 in order to improve pediatric labeling for off-patent drugs. The
      purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of lithium in the treatment of
      pediatric patients with bipolar I disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiphase, multicenter, trial that will comprehensively examine lithium in the
      treatment of pediatric patients with bipolar I disorder. In order to examine the treatment of
      bipolar disorder with lithium, this study will include four phases of treatment. The first
      phase, the Pharmacokinetic Phase, will include 8 weeks of Open Label treatment to determine
      empirically based dosing strategies for children and adolescents with bipolar disorder.
      Patients completing the Pharmacokinetic Phase, may be eligible to continue in the Long-Term
      Effectiveness Phase for a maximum of 16 weeks of lithium treatment. Subsequently, patients
      meeting response criteria during the Long-Term Effectiveness Phase will be eligible to
      continue in the Discontinuation Phase. During the Discontinuation Phase, patients will be
      randomized to either placebo or lithium treatment for up to 28 weeks. Finally, those subjects
      who experience a mood relapse during the Discontinuation Phase will be enrolled in an Open
      Label Restabilization Phase and treated with lithium for up to 8 weeks.

             for at least 1 month prior to study entry and agreed to continue to use one of them
             for the duration of the study. If sexually abstinent and capable of pregnancy, the
             patient agreed to continue abstinence or to use of an acceptable method of birth
             control (either intrauterine device or spermicide and barrier) should sexual activity
             commence.

          7. If female, the patient had a negative quantitative serum ß-human chorionic
             gonadotrophin hormone pregnancy test at screening and a negative qualitative urine
             pregnancy test at baseline, if female.

             screening or prior to baseline.

          9. The patient was willing and clinically able to washout (approximately 5 half-lives) of
             exclusion medications during the screening period and prior to the administration of
             lithium. (No stable patients were asked to discontinue medications.)

         10. The patient‟s ECG and blood work (including complete blood count [CBC], electrolytes,
             etc.) showed no clinically significant abnormalities.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient was clinically stable on current medication regiment for bipolar disorder.

          2. The patient had a current or lifetime diagnosis of Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective
             Disorder, a Pervasive Developmental Disorder (Austin Screening Questionnaire score &gt;
             15), Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.

          3. The patient had a current DSM-IV diagnosis of Substance Dependence.

          4. The patient had a positive drug screen at screening and on retest 1-3 weeks later.

          5. The patient had symptoms of mania that may have been attributable to a general medical
             condition, or secondary to use of medications (eg, corticosteroids)

          6. The patient had evidence of any serious and/or unstable neurological illness for which
             treatment under the auspices of this study would have been contra-indicated.

          7. The patient had any serious, unstable medical illness or clinically significant
             abnormal laboratory assessments that would adversely impact the scientific
             interpretability or unduly increase the risks of the protocol.

          8. The patient had a current general medical condition including neurological disease,
             diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, or renal dysfunction that might have been
             affected adversely by lithium, could have influenced the efficacy or safety of
             lithium, or would have complicated interpretation of study results.

          9. The patient had evidence of current serious homicidal/suicidal ideation such that in
             the treating physician's opinion it was appropriately safe for the patient to

             antipsychotics within the past month.

         13. The patient had current psychotherapy treatments provided outside the study initiated
             within 4 weeks prior to screening.

         14. The patient had a previous adequate trial with lithium (at least 4 weeks with lithium
             serum levels between 0.8-1.2 mEq/L).

         15. The patient had a history of allergy to lithium.

         16. The patient had psychiatric hospitalization within 1 month of screening for psychosis
             or serious homicidal/serious suicidal ideation.

         17. Clinician‟s judgment was that the patient was not likely to be able to complete the
             study as an outpatient due to psychiatric reasons.

         18. The patient had a history of lithium intolerance.

         19. Females who were currently pregnant or lactating.

         20. Sexually active females who, in the investigators‟ opinion, were not using an adequate

         21. Patients who were unable to swallow the study medication.

         22. Patients for whom a baseline YMRS score of &lt; 20 was anticipated.
