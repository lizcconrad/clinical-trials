  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laboratory clopidogrel resistance is associated with adverse atherothrombotic events in
      patients with coronary artery disease. In the proposed study we wish to prospectively assess
      the effect of reloading with 600 mg clopidogrel, and administer maintenance treatment with
      clopidogrel 150 mg/day for one month in a group of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients
      who demonstrate non-responsiveness to clopidogrel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior studies have demonstrated significant variability in platelet response to clopidogrel
      in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Up to 25% of patients have been shown to be
      non-responders to a conventional dose of clopidogrel. This phenomenon has been associated
      with higher incidence of recurrent cardiovascular (CVS) adverse events in patients with acute
      coronary syndrome (ACS), and higher incidence of peri-procedural myocardial damage,
      thrombotic complications, and ischemic events in patients undergoing elective percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI). Both the ex-vivo anti-platelet effect and the clinical benefit
      of clopidogrel are dose related. Moreover, in patients sustaining ACS while on maintenance
      clopidogrel treatment, reloading with 600 mg clopidogrel, resulted in further reduction in
      platelet aggregation, although the patients were not non-responders. Despite this, the effect
      of dose escalation has never been examined in patients resistant to clopidogrel. In the
      present study we wish to assess prospectively the effect of reloading with 600 mg
      clopidogrel, and double dose maintenance treatment (150 mg/day) for one month in acute
      myocardial infarction (AMI) patients who demonstrate non-respondese to clopidogrel.
