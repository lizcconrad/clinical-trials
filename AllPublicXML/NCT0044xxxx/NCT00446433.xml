             will be considered an acceptable method of birth control for adolescent females aged
             12-17 years who are not sexually active and who the investigator feels will be
             compliant with this requirement for the 12-week treatment period. Female subjects who
             are post-menopausal must have had 24 continuous months of amenorrhea.

          3. Negative pregnancy test for females of child bearing potential.

          4. A history of Crohn's Disease (CD) of greater than 1-year duration diagnosed and
