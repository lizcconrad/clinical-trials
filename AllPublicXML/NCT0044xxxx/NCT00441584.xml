    <textblock>
      This is an uncontrolled, non-randomized, open-label, multinational study designed to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of PegIntron plus Rebetol in subjects with chronic hepatitis C. The
      study is designed to determine the proportion of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 subjects who
      did not respond to previous treatment with Pegasys 180µg QW plus ribavirin, that will achieve
      sustained virological response (SVR) when treated with PegIntron plus Rebetol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must demonstrate their willingness to participate in the study and comply with
             its procedures by signing a written informed consent.

          -  Subject must be 18-70 years of age of either sex and of any race.

          -  Subject must be diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 (confirmation by biopsy
             not required). (Liver function tests (LFTs) can be normal or elevated.)

          -  Female subjects cannot be pregnant or breastfeeding and must be either postmenopausal,
             surgically sterile or using 2 methods of birth control. While abstinence from sexual
             activity is the only certain method to prevent pregnancy, female patients of
             childbearing potential who are or who anticipate the possibility of becoming sexually
             active with a male partner must use a combination of the following 2 methods:

               -  Contraceptive pill or intrauterine device (IUD) or depot hormonal preparation
                  (ring, injection, implant), and

               -  A barrier method of contraception such as diaphragm, sponge with spermicide,
                  condom, or a method of birth control considered acceptable by the study
                  physician.

          -  Contraceptive measures will be reviewed with female subjects at each visit. Dual
             methods of contraception must be used for 6 months after treatment discontinuation.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screen phase and during the study.

          -  Confirmation by the principal investigator or a sub-investigator that sexually active
             male subjects are practicing a method of contraception considered acceptable
             (vasectomy, condom plus spermicide, plus relationship with a female partner who
             practices an acceptable method of contraception). Contraception must be used during
             the treatment period and for seven months after the completion of therapy, including
             condom use by male subjects with pregnant partners.

          -  Subject must be free of any clinically significant disease that would interfere with
             study evaluations.

               -  Direct bilirubin within normal limits

               -  Indirect bilirubin within normal limits (unless non-hepatitis related factors
                  such as Gilbert's disease explain an indirect bilirubin rise). In such cases
                  indirect bilirubin should be less than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL (less than or equal
                  to 51.3 µmol/L)

               -  Albumin within normal limits
