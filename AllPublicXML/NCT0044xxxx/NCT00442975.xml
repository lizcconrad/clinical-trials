    <textblock>
      The study is being undertaken to evaluate responses to seasonal influenza vaccine in older
      adults with respect to their CMV status. CMV is cytomegalovirus and is an organism that
      infects many people, but does not usually cause disease in the individual unless they are
      immunocompromised i.e. their immune system is not working well such as in the case of HIV
      infection. CMV is believed to have infected up to 80% of individuals in the age group we will
      be looking at in our study and we are interested in whether this infection affects their
      responses to vaccination.

    <textblock>
      Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an important pathogen or diseaseâˆ’causing virus, which can
      result in disease in the unborn child as well as in individuals whose immune systems are not
      working properly such as those with HIV or who are receiving some treatments for cancer,
      where the body's ability to fight infection is not as good as in healthy people. HCMV infects
      the majority of the population, yet rarely causes overt disease which would limit the
      capacity of the host to transmit HCMV to others. This virus is thought to be millions of
      years old and because of this we think that it has evolved over time to become very efficient
      at evading the immune system. This means it has become very efficient at moving through the
      human population and resulting in humans devoting more immunological resources to controlling
      this virus than to any other. Recent studies have reported that the immune system does work
      less efficiently in older people, especially in elderly patients with CMV antibodies compared
      to age matched controls who did not have CMV antibodies.

      It is well recognized that responses to vaccination are generally lower in older populations
      compared to children, so they may be thought to be immunologically in a suboptimal position.
      It is proposed that this may be as a result of diversion of key factors in the immune system
      to address CMV infection, the incidence of which increases with age. This study will allow
      assessment of responses to licensed seasonal influenza vaccine with respect to age and CMV
      status and will provide baseline information as a proof of principle on which a larger study
      will be designed.
