  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;blue light hazard&quot; has been reported to cause retinal damage (oxidative stress),
      particularly to the central fovea due to its energetic, shorter wavelength visible photons,
      which is why blue-light filtering intraocular lenses have been developed for cataract
      surgery. The hormone melatonin has been reported to possess an efficient antioxidant
      capacity. Light information from the eye reaches the suprachiasmatic nuclei and inhibits
      melatonin secretion. Since melatonin is suppressed by light, we have a day-night rhythmicity,
      with increased levels at night. Melatonin suppression is wavelength-dependent with a peak
      sensitivity in the 446-477 nm (blue light) portion of the visible spectrum. The crystalline
      lens blocks most UV between 300 and 400 nm. The density of the lens increases with aging
      causing an alteration in the spectral absorption. The greatest increase in absorption occurs
      at the short wavelength end of the spectrum (around 400-470 nm). Age-related pupillary miosis
      and crystalline lens yellowing limit the blue light reaching the retina. This reduces the
      older adults' effective retinal light exposure to one tenth that of younger people. It has
      been shown that insomnia and depression decrease after cataract surgery and patients returned
      to youthful levels of melatonin. Since melatonin acts as an antioxidant, and more blue light
      filtering intra ocular lenses are implanted and thought to reduce photochemical damage in the
      macula, it would be interesting to show the positive influence of those blue light filtering
      intraocular lenses on daytime levels of melatonin in age-related macular degeneration
      patients.

      Patients with non-exudative age-related macular degeneration, which are planned for cataract
      surgery, will be randomized into one of four groups. Group I and II are blue light filtering
      intraocular lenses and group III and IV are white lenses. Group I and III are lenses form
      Alcon, group II and IV are lenses form Hoya. The following examinations will be performed
      before, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after surgery: vein puncture for melatonin
      analysis, visual acuity, complete slit lamp analysis including intraocular pressure, pupil
      size measurement, and questionnaire about sleeping time and sleeping quality. At the
      follow-up visits the following examinations will also be performed: autofluorescein imaging,
      infrared imaging, and optical coherence tomography imaging. Vein puncture will be performed
      between 8 and 10 a.m. and has to be performed at the same time for the same patient. Pupils
      are not allowed to be dilated by the time of vein puncture and pupil size measurement.
