      Aim of this study is to evaluate whether the length of coronary segments, assessed by an
      experienced operator, using the &quot;optimal view&quot; of standard 2-dimensional coronary
      angiography, is over/underestimated with respect to the one evaluated automatically with the
      help of a 3-dimensional coronary reconstruction model. Moreover, both techniques are compared
      with an &quot;in-vivo&quot; surrogate of the real length of the coronary segment under evaluation, i.e.
      an intra-coronary marker guide-wire, which is a wire with markers placed at fixed and known
      distance along its length in its distal (intra-coronary) part. Two hypotheses are tested: (1)
      the length of a coronary segment evaluated with a standard 2-dimensional &quot;optimal view&quot;
      over/underestimates the length assessed by a 3-dimensional coronary model that automatically
      detects the least foreshortened length of the segment under evaluation, and (2) the
      3-dimensional model approximates more closely than standard 2-dimensional angiography, the
      real length of the segment detected by the marker guide-wire.

    <textblock>
      The potential to improve the accuracy of the assessment of the coronary tree by means of 3-D
      modeling reconstruction may lead to an evaluation of the coronary artery anatomy that
      approximates more correctly the real anatomy, thus subsequently leading to a more tailored
      diagnosis and therapy for the patients with ischemic heart disease.

      Aim of the current study is to assess whether a 3-D model of the coronary tree offers a less
      foreshortened and less operator-dependent evaluation of the length of the coronary arteries
      with respect to standard coronary angiography. Furthermore, for the first time &quot;in-vivo&quot;, a
      comparison with the &quot;real&quot; length of the vessel will be performed using as &quot;gold standard&quot; an
      intra-coronary guide-wire with radiopaque markers at fixed and known distance one from the
      other along its distal part.
