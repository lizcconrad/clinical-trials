      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as floxuridine, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and
      docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy)
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy works as
      first-line therapy in treating patients with stage IV gastric cancer that cannot be removed
      by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the overall response rate in patients with unresectable stage IV gastric
           adenocarcinoma treated with floxuridine, leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel
           as first-line treatment.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the feasibility of this regimen in managing patients with unresectable stage
           IV gastric adenocarcinoma who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic
           disease.

        -  Determine disease-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15 and docetaxel IV over
      30 minutes, floxuridine IV over 24 hours, and leucovorin calcium IV over 24 hours on days 1,
      8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Chemotherapy will be administered weekly, 3 out of 4 weeks, on days 1, 8 and 15:
Day 1 and Day 15 Chemotherapy Administration: Patients will be administered oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2) and docetaxel (25 mg/m2) followed by FUdR/Leucovorin (110 mg/kg//500 mg/m2) on Day 1 and Day 15 of each cycle.
Day 8 Chemotherapy Administration On Day 8, treatment will consist of docetaxel (25 mg/m2) followed by FUdR/Leucovorin (110mg/kg//500mg/m2).
There will be no treatment delivered week 4 (Day 22). For the purpose of this study, one cycle equals four weeks. There will be a maximum of 6 cycles.</description>

            <description>Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Chemotherapy will be administered weekly, 3 out of 4 weeks, on days 1, 8 and 15:
Day 1 and Day 15 Chemotherapy Administration: Patients will be administered oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2) and docetaxel (25 mg/m2) followed by FUdR/Leucovorin (110 mg/kg//500 mg/m2) on Day 1 and Day 15 of each cycle.
Day 8 Chemotherapy Administration On Day 8, treatment will consist of docetaxel (25 mg/m2) followed by FUdR/Leucovorin (110mg/kg//500mg/m2).
There will be no treatment delivered week 4 (Day 22). For the purpose of this study, one cycle equals four weeks. There will be a maximum of 6 cycles.</description>
