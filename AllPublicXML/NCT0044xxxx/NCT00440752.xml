  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The newly introduced antimalarial drug artemether-lumefantrine is currently recommended as
      second line antimalarial in Sudan. Recurrent infection after treatment with this drug has
      been associated with selection of certain genes in the malaria parasite. However there is no
      information on this association in Sudan.This study is going to look into the genetics of
      resistance to artemether-lumefantrine.

      In Sudan the current treatment protocol includes two artemisinin combinations (ACT);
      artesunate + sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (AS/SP) as first line and artemether-lumefantrine
      (AL) as second line. This protocol has been implemented in 2004, since then various studies
      have reported the high efficacy of both combinations (e.g. Adam et al., 2005; Elamin et al.,
      2005; Mohamed et al., 2006).

      However, there has been no report of the impact of these combinations on drug resistance
      markers in Sudan. Data from other African countries has shown that AL selects for certain
      alleles in the pfmdr-1 gene (Sisowath et al., 2005, Dokomajilar et al., 2006; Humphreys et
      al., 2007), but the impact on the prevalence of different pfcrt and pfmdr-1alleles remains
      unclear. It is essential to monitor ACT efficacy in addition to identify molecular markers
      that are associated with response to different drugs to facilitate epidemiological surveys
      for evidence based decision making. Recent work in The Gambia suggests that
      transmission-related endpoints, such as emergence of gametocytes after treatment, may be
      better indicators of emerging drug resistance (Hallett et al., 2006).

      The aim of the proposed study is to examine the impact of treatment with
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) on alleles of pfcrt and pfmdr-1 in P. falciparum isolates in an
      area of marked seasonal transmission in eastern Sudan. Most studies of resistance markers
      measure marker prevalence by DNA amplification, but we will also investigate gene expression
      using quantitative amplification of mRNA encoding pfcrt and pfmdr-1. The impact of genotype
      and gene expression levels on treatment outcome, and on the emergence and density of
      peripheral gametocytes will be examined.
