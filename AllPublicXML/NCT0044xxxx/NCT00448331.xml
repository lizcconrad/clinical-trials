      The purpose of this research study is to find out how many children in the Emergency Room
      have emotional issues and how many of them go unnoticed. In particular the study looks at how
      well a questionnaire for children and teenagers, the DISC Predictive Scales, Version IV
      (DPS-IV) works and what is the best way to ask the questions. In addition, for children aged
      9-17 this study will look at families' readiness to seek care when a problem is indicated.
