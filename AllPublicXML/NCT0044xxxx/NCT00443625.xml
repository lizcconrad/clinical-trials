      This study was designed to investigate the food effect of SK3530 on the pharmacokinetics
      (PKs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PDE5 inhibitor, SK3530, is expected to be taken concomitantly with food. The food
      interaction studies of other PDE5 inhibitors (Viagra, Levitra and cialis) have already
      accomplished and the results have provided useful information to the patients. The objective
      of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of SK3530 and its metabolite (SK3541)
      under the fasted and fed (low-fat meal and high-fat meal) conditions.
