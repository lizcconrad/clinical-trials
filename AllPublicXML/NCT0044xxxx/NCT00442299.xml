  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The uremic syndrome is mainly related to the retention of a host of compounds, due to altered
      glomerular filtration and other factors of renal dysfunction, e.g. tubular secretion. Uremic
      retention solutes are arbitrarily subdivided in three different categories according to their
      physicochemical characteristics and their subsequent behaviour during dialysis: (i) the
      small, water-soluble, non-protein bound compounds, (ii) the larger middle molecules, mainly
      peptides and (iii) the small protein-bound compounds (1).

      Although direct proof is lacking, several lines of evidence indicate that albumin is the most
      important carrier protein. Removal of protein bound uremic retention solutes is limited.

      The Prometheus® system fractionates blood into plasma and cellular components, using an
      albumin-permeable polysulfon filter (AlbuFlow®) with a specially designed sieving coefficient
      curve (1.0 for 2-microglobulin, &gt;0.6 for albumin, &lt;0.3 for IgG, &lt;0.1 for fibrinogen and
      &lt;0.01 for IgM). Due to the high sieving coefficient of the filter for large molecules (i.e.
      cut-off at about 250 kD) molecules up to the size of albumin (69 kD) easily pass from blood
      into the secondary circuit which is filled with isotonic sodium chloride solution, whereas
      larger molecules like fibrinogen (340 kD) cannot pass through the filter. In the secondary
      circuit the filtered plasma with the albumin-bound toxins flows through one or two adsorbers
      in a row with maximized adsorption capacity for putative liver toxins that are directly
      adsorbed (`fractionated plasma separation and adsorption' or FPSA). The purified plasma is
      then returned to the blood side of the albumin filter. In order to eliminate water-soluble
      toxins, blood thereafter undergoes hemodialysis using a conventional high-flux dialyser.

      We hypothesise that removal of protein bound uremic retention solutes can be improved by FPSA
      as compared to standard hemodialysis.
