  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purposes of this study are: demonstrate the safety and efficacy of TPV/r among HCV
      or hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infected HIV+population, three-class (NRTI, NNRTI, and PI)
      experienced, with documented resistance to more than one PI. Determine pharmacokinetic data
      in this co-infected population and potential utility of using therapeutic drug monitoring
      (TDM) in improving efficacy outcomes.

    <measure>Treatment Response at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment response is a confirmed virologic response, defined as a viral load less than 50 copies/mL at two consecutive measurements at least 5 days apart, without death, permanent discontinuation, or introduction of a new antiretroviral</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Primary Safety Endpoint Was the Occurrence of Dose-limiting Hepatotoxicity During the Study.</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of the study through 48 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Dose-limiting hepatotoxicity was defined as Grade 4 ALT or AST elevation confirmed in 48h or any evocative symptoms or signs of hepatitis, if it not clearly attributable to another cause.

    <time_frame>After 2 weeks of treatment until the end of trial</time_frame>
    <description>A high inhibitory quotient (IQ), the ratio of trough plasma drug concentration to the protein-adjusted viral IC50, is a useful indicator of the potential efficacy margin of antiretroviral drugs. The IQ for TPV is calculated by the formula IQ = TPV Ctrough / (3.75 x Z x fold change of the patients virus), where Z = wild type control IC50 IIIB.</description>

    <description>Patients with TPV trough above 120 μM are at high risk of developing a Grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevations. The risk of Grade 3 or greater transaminase elevations appeared to be uniform at TPV trough concentration below 120 μM. Hence, for this study the TPV trough should be maintained below 120 μM.</description>

          <description>A high inhibitory quotient (IQ), the ratio of trough plasma drug concentration to the protein-adjusted viral IC50, is a useful indicator of the potential efficacy margin of antiretroviral drugs. The IQ for TPV is calculated by the formula IQ = TPV Ctrough / (3.75 x Z x fold change of the patients virus), where Z = wild type control IC50 IIIB.</description>
