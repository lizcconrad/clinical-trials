      We are collecting baseline data on patients who have high blood pressure readings (160/100 or
      higher) at a 9-1-1 response by an EMT. We want to understand what these patients currently
      remember occurring during the 9-1-1 response around their high blood pressure measure; if the
      patients seek a second reading; if the patients seek follow-up care as a result of the high
      blood pressure measure. We are also interested if patients trust EMTs as a provider of
      preventive health care. This baseline data will also allow us to more accurately measure the
      success of a future intervention study aimed at motivating subjects to receive a follow-up
      hypertension assessment from a physician after receiving a high blood pressure reading from
      an EMT.
