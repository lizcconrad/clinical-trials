  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Babies who are suspected of having persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) will be included
      in this study. PPHN is a condition in which the blood is restricted from flowing to the lungs
      in a normal way making it hard for babies to breath and placing strain on the heart. This
      study will observe whether certain hormones that measure stress (N-terminal pro-brain
      natriuretic peptide) can help determine how well a baby will do when they have PPHN.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PPHN occurs in infant &gt; or = 34 weeks gestation and is characterized by an elevation in
      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and right-to-left shunting of the blood at the atrial,
      ductal, and pulmonary levels, leading to hypoxemia. Management of these infants is complex
      (and the clinical course) is often difficult to predict.

      Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac hormone that is secreted from cardiac myocytes
      and cardiac fibroblasts. Upon activation, the prohormone is cleaved into a biologically
      active BNP and an inactive N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP). BNP and NT-proBNP levels are
      increasingly being used for diagnostic purpose in adults and have been correlated to adult
      pulmonary hypertension. Multiples studies have been performed to determine normal values for
      NT-proBNP in the pediatric population. One study measured NT-proBNP levels in umbilical cord
      blood during the second trimester and at delivery of uncomplicated pregnancies and determined
      normal reference values of NT-proBNP. It is thought that NT-proBNP has potential for use in
      term infants with PPHN.

      The objective of this research is to correlate NT-proBNP levels to left ventricular
      dysfunction in term infants with PPHN. Secondarily, we want to assess the possible use of
      NT-proBNP to predict response to inhaled nitric oxide and the ability to successfully wean
      off inhaled nitric oxide.

    Interim analysis showed greater variablility in NT-proBNP findings than anticipated.
