  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This bicentric, randomized, controlled trial examines the effectiveness of an automatic
      control of pressure support ventilation (SmartCare/PS) in critically ill patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the weaning process vigilance, pulmonary mechanics and respiratory drive of the
      patient are changing. Consequently, ventilation settings have to be modified very often. The
      modifications can be conducted either according to a weaning protocol or automatically by an
      expert system (SmartCare/PS). This trial compares protocol-guided weaning with automatic
      weaning in post-surgical patients and examines the effect on total ventilation time, numbers
      of manipulations and alarms of the ventilator, length of stay in the ICU and in the hospital,
      28- and 90-day mortality.
