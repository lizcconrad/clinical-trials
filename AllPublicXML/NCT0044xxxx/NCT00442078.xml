    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male, with post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence (either after radical prostatectomy
             or prostatectomy of prostate adenoma, whatever the route used), and for whom there has
             been more than 6 months follow-up since the date of that procedure.

          -  The patient should have been proposed urinary re-education, which was refused for
             personal reasons, or should still suffer from urinary incontinence despite the
             re-education.

          -  Urinary incontinence is materialized in this population by a score between 4 and 16
             (inclusive) for the three questions of the ICIQ questionnaire.

          -  A urodynamic assessment including flow measurement and residue will have been carried
             out.

          -  A urethroscopy or urethrography will have been carried out to eliminate cases of
             urethral stenosis.

          -  Inclusion is subject to obtaining informed written consent, after remittance of the
             information sheet, and having had a detailed medical examination carried out.

          -  Medication for urinary incontinence and in particular anticholinergic drugs must have
             been stopped at least 15 days prior to initial assessment and for the duration of the
             trial. The same goes for urinary re-education.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Progressing prostatic neoplasia materialized by testing of PSA levels.

          -  Prostate radiotherapy.

          -  Neurological disorder which might lead to urinary incontinence or hinder assessment.

          -  Urethral or anastomotic stenosis materialized by urethroscopy or urethrography.

          -  Hyperactive detrusor muscle with leakage contemporaneous with uninhibited
             contractility.

          -  Chronic retention of urine with leakage due to overflow.

          -  Current urinary infection. This would be a temporary exclusion since assessment can
             take place after treatment and monitoring for sterility of urine.
