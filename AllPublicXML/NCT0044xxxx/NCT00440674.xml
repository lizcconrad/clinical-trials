      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a direct
      stenting technique compared to conventional stenting with pre-dilatation strategy using the
      CoStar Paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system for the treatment of a single de novo lesion
      in a native coronary artery ≤ 25 mm long in a native coronary artery 2.5-3.5 mm diameter.

      Prospective, multi-center, randomized (1:1), open-label study to evaluate direct stenting
      compared to conventional stenting with pre-dilatation strategy in treatment of a single de
      novo Lesion of a single native coronary artery in patients undergoing elective percutaneous
      coronary intervention.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention

          -  Documented stable or unstable angina pectoris or with documented ischemia, or with
             documented silent ischemia

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥25% documented within the last 6 weeks

          -  Acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft surgery

          -  Single target vessel / single target lesion to be treated

          -  Target lesion may be composed of multiple lesions but must be completely coverable by
             one (1) study stent

          -  Cumulative target lesion length per vessel is ≤ 25 mm

          -  RVD of 2.5-3.5 mm

          -  Target lesion diameter stenosis ≥ 50% and &lt; 100%

          -  Target vessel has not undergone prior revascularization within the preceding 6 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known sensitivity to cobalt chromium, Paclitaxel or PLGA

          -  Acute MI within 72 hours prior to the index procedure as defined by the presence of a
             new pathologic Q-wave, or a creatine kinase (CK) level of &gt; 2x the laboratory upper
             limits of normal and elevated MB

          -  The patient is in cardiogenic shock

          -  Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA) within the past 6 months

          -  Acute or chronic renal dysfunction (creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL or &gt; 150 µmol/L)/

          -  Contraindication to ASA or to Clopidogrel

          -  Thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;100,000/mm3)

          -  Any prior true anaphylactic reaction to contrast agents

          -  Patient is currently taking Colchicine

          -  Patient is currently, or has been treated with Paclitaxel (systemic) within12 months
             of the index procedure

          -  Comorbid condition(s) that could limit the patient's ability to participate in the
             study, compliance with follow-up requirements or impact the scientific integrity of
             the study

          -  Left main coronary artery disease (stenosis &gt;50%), whether protected or unprotected.

          -  Target lesion involves a bifurcation with a diseased (&gt;50% stenotic) branch vessel
             &gt;2.0 mm in diameter that requires intervention.

          -  Target lesion is totally occluded Thrombolysis In MI (TIMI flow ≤1).

          -  The target vessel has had prior drug-eluting stent placement to vessel segment (or
             branch) proximal to intended target lesion site.

          -  Angiographic restenosis of any segment of the target vessel that has undergone prior
             PCI.

          -  Angiographic evidence of atherosclerotic disease with &gt;50% diameter stenosis (by
             visual estimate) proximal or distal to the target lesion (applies to the major
             epicardial portion of the target vessel and contiguous vessel segment if the target
             lesion is located in a branch vessel)
