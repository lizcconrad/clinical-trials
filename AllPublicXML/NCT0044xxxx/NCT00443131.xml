  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, two experimental malaria vaccines (with adjuvants) are tested to evaluate and
      characterise how the vaccine exactly works on the immune system by comparing it to a control
      (without adjuvant). The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA
      Amendment Act, Sep 2007.
