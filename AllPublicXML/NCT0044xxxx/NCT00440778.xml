      HYPOTHESES

        1. Bolus administration of total abciximab dose provides superior maximal and mean platelet
           aggregation inhibition (PAI) compared with standard bolus (0.25 mg/kg) administration.

        2. Total dose of abciximab can be given as a single bolus and is more effective than bolus
           (0.25 mg/kg) + 12 hrs infusion in terms of acute and mid-term angiographic and clinical
           results.

        3. Intracoronary (ic) abciximab administration is more effective than intravenous (iv)
           route of administration in terms of acute and mid-term angiographic and clinical
           results.

        4. There is a relationship between PAI and angiographic perfusion scores.

        5. Routine use of sirolimus-eluting stents (Cypher, Cordis) in primary-PCI is associated
           with a low rate of target vessel revascularization and complications.

        6. Cardiac MRI early and late after primary-PCI provides detailed information on myocardial
           injury and irreversible necrosis, which are correlated with angiographic perfusion
           scores.

        7. After uncomplicated trans-radial PCI, patients can be retransferred early to their
           referring center.

      OBJECTIVES AND END-POINTS The objectives of the present study are to assess the benefits and
      safety of 1) a single bolus of abciximab (100% dose) compared with the standard bolus (ca 80%
      of the total dose) + 12h infusion (ca 20% of the total dose), and 2) intracoronary abciximab
      bolus administration compared with intravenous route of abciximab administration in primary
      PCI.

      The primary PLATELETS end-points are the percentage of patients with ≥ 95% platelet
      aggregation inhibition 10 minutes after abciximab bolus (MAX) and the mean platelet
      aggregation inhibition 10 minutes after abciximab bolus (MEAN).

      The secondary CLINICAL end-points of the study are:

        -  The composite of death, stroke, repeat myocardial infarction, urgent target vessel
           revascularization and major bleedings at 30 days following primary PCI.

        -  The composite of cardiovascular death, repeat myocardial infarction and repeat target
           vessel revascularization at 6-months follow-up.

      The secondary ANGIOGRAPHIC end-points of the study are:

        -  The proportion of patients having myocardial blush grade 2-3 and TIMI 3 score at the end
           of PCI in the culprit vessel.

        -  The restenosis rate (diameter stenosis ≥ 50%) and late loss in the culprit vessel at
           6-months follow-up.

      Other exploratory end-points are the feasibility and safety of early transfer to the
      referring hospital after uncomplicated primary PCI, the cardiac MRI measurements and platelet
      aggregation inhibition at 6h post-PCI.
