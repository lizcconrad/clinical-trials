        Inclusion Criteria:

        1) Patients who consent for study participation and submit written informed consent with
        free will by patient or legally authorized representative.

        2) Patients aged between 20 years or above and under 75 years old at the time of obtaining
        informed consent.

        3) Patients with acute pulmonary embolism within 5 days after the onset.

        4) Patients with acute pulmonary embolism with hemodynamic instability and fulfill all of
        the following 4 items:

          1. Confirmed to have thrombi, emboli, or disorders in pulmonary circulation detected by
             pulmonary angiography or computed tomography.

          2. Confirmed to have any of the following right ventricular overloads by
             echocardiography:

             i) Dilation of right ventricular cavity or hypokinesis in ventricular wall

             ii) Floating thrombi in pulmonary artery and right heart

             iii) Paradoxical motion in the interventricular septum

             iv) Disparity of tricuspid regurgitation pressure

             v) Loss of inrespiratory changes of inferior vena cava in diameter

             vi) Enlargement of pulmonary artery

          3. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) is 20 mmHg or above

          4. PaO2 is 65 mmHg or below (confirmed by blood gas analysis)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with concurrent hemorrhage (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding, urinary tract
             bleeding, retroperitoneal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, or hemoptysis).

          2. Patients who underwent intracranial or spinal operation or injury within 2 months
             prior to study treatment.

          3. Patients with intracranial tumor, arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm

          4. Patients with hemorrhagic diathesis (e.g., vascular purpura, thrombocytopenia,
             hemophilia)

          5. Patients with hypertension of systolic blood pressure &gt;=180 mmHg or diastolic pressure

             renal disorder (e.g., renal failure).

          8. Patients received thrombolytic drug (t-PA or urokinase) within 7 days prior to study
             treatment.

          9. Patients with pulmonary cardiac arrest (CPA).

         10. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to monteplase or protein preparations.
