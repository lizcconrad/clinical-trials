  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II clinical trial in patients who have not received systemic treatment for
      follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The study combines rituximab, an approved drug for this
      disease, with AT-101, an experimental drug. The hypothesis is that by adding AT-101 to the
      rituximab regimen, improvement to patients' response to the treatment will be observed verses
      rituximab alone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed, previously untreated Grade I-II follicular B-cell
             non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (stage I, II, III and IV). Patients may have received radiation
             therapy to one lymph node region; Stage I or II patients must have relapsed after
             prior radiation therapy to be eligible;

          -  Patients with any FLIPI score may participate. Patients with FLIPI scores 3-5 may be
             enrolled with asymptomatic disease, or without worsening disease or disease
             related-symptoms; however patients with FLIPI scores of 0-2 must have evidence of
             worsening disease;

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1;

          -  Measurable disease;

          -  Adequate hematological function as indicated by:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1,000/µL; +Hemoglobin &gt;8 g/dL (It is acceptable
                  to transfuse PRBC to achieve this criterion);

               -  Platelet count &gt;50 x 109/L.

          -  Adequate hepatic and renal function as indicated by:

               -  Serum creatinine ≤2.0 mg/dL;

               -  Serum albumin ≥2.5 g/dL;

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN);

               -  Serum AST and ALT ≤1.5 x ULN.

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have severe lymphoma-related symptoms requiring a rapid response to
             therapy (e.g., requirement for cytoreduction due to advanced disease or organ
             compromise, respiratory compromise because of large effusions or airway obstruction,
             bowel obstruction, ureteral obstruction, and chylous ascites);

          -  Active symptomatic fungal, bacterial and/or viral infection including, but not limited
             to active HIV or viral hepatitis (A, B or C);

          -  History of hepatitis B infection;

          -  Any B-cell, T-cell or transformed lymphoma other than histologically confirmed
             follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma;

          -  Central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, CNS or leptomeningeal involvement by lymphoma
             (treated or in remission), HIV-related lymphoma, or patients with symptoms suggesting
             HIV infection;
