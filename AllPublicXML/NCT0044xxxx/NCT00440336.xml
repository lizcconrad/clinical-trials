      WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT? Glaucoma and ocular hypertension are chronic eye diseases that can
      damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss or blindness. The optic nerve acts like an
      electric cable with over a million wires. This nerve is responsible for carrying images from
      the eye to the brain. The way glaucoma and ocular hypertension cause blindness depends on
      many factors, but the most important factor is the increased pressure inside the eye
      (intraocular pressure).

      There is no cure for glaucoma or ocular hypertension. However, lowering the pressure inside
      the eye has been shown to slow the progression of disease. Intraocular pressure can be
      lowered by glaucoma medication, laser treatment, or surgery.

      You have open angle glaucoma, pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, or ocular hypertension. Researchers
      want to find out more about how 2 drugs called Cosopt (dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol
      maleate) and Xalatan (latanoprost) can help people with these conditions.

      Cosopt and Xalatan are both eye drops that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) to reduce intraocular pressure in people with open angle glaucoma and
      ocular hypertension.

      The study doctor will do a laser procedure called Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) on
      people in this study to help lower their intraocular pressure. The FDA has approved SLT to
      treat open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.

      Then the study doctor will ask some participants to use either Cosopt or Xalatan, if their
      intraocular pressure is still too high 4 to 6 weeks after the SLT procedure. The study doctor
      wants to see which of the 2 study drugs (Cosopt or Xalatan) is better at reducing intraocular
      pressure after SLT.

      It is planned that about 30 people with glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are at least 18
      years old will be in this study. Out of the participants whose intraocular pressure is still
      too high after SLT, half will use Cosopt and half will use Xalatan. You do not have to be in
      this study to have SLT or to use Cosopt or Xalatan.

      Introduction Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty has been shown as a relatively safe and
      effective treatment modality for lowering IOP in various forms of open-angle glaucoma (Latina
      et al). It lowers IOP by increasing aqueous outflow through its effect at cellular level
      possibly either (1) through migration and phagocytosis of trabecular meshwork debris by
      macrophages or (2) by stimulating the proliferation of healthy trabecular and endothelial
      cells.

      Cases who don’t achieve target IOP following SLT therapy need additional treatment in form of
      topical medications. Conventionally common topical antiglaucoma medications to treat glaucoma
      after SLT therapy either suppress aqueous secretion (B-blockers or carbonic anhydrase
      inhibitors) or enhances uveoscleral aqueous outflow (Prostaglandin analogues). Since
      Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty acts on outflow pathway, further additional IOP reduction can
      be achieved more effectively by a class of drug which acts on different pathway; on aqueous
      secretion by aqueous suppressants like Cosopt. In contrast drugs acting on outflow pathway
      like prostaglandin analogue ( Xalatan etc) will possibly be less additive in further reducing
      IOP after SLT since SLT also has effect on the same pathway- outflow pathway.

      Previous studies (Fechtner et al. J Ocul Pharmacol Ther. 2005 Jun;21(3):242-9 and Fechtner et
      al. Acta Ophthalmol Scand. 2004 Feb;82(1):42-8.) have shown equal efficacy of Cosopt and
      Latanoprost in reducing IOP in treatment of glaucoma. But to our knowledge, no long term
      prospective study has evaluated aqueous suppressants (Cosopt) and prostaglandin analogues
      with respect to their comparative efficacy in treatment of uncontrolled glaucoma status post
      SLT therapy.

      OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this study is to compare the IOP lowering efficacy of
      aqueous suppressants (Cosopt) and prostaglandin analogues (Xalatan) when used status post SLT
      in the management of Open Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension.

      INCLUSION CRITERIA 1. Adult subjects of either sex, of any race, eighteen years of age or
      older. 2 Diagnosis: Primary Open Angle Glaucoma, Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma, Ocular
      Hypertension.

      3. Mild to moderate glaucoma only: Pattern standard deviation (PSD); more than 1DB and less
      than 6 DB on Humphrey Visual Field.

      3. Subject may be;

        -  A newly diagnosed glaucoma or

        -  A pre-existing glaucoma on not more than two topical antiglaucoma medications. 3 On no
           systemic medications known to increase IOP (e.g. steroids) 4 Visual acuity equal or
           better than 20/200 in the study eye 5. IOP less than 35 mm Hg in the study eye 6 No
           previous intraocular surgery within last 6 months, except laser PI greater than 3 months
           ago.

      EXCLUSION CRITERIA Pigmentary OAG, Proliferative diabetic retinopathy, History of chronic or
      recurrent severe inflammatory eye disease (i.e. scleritis, uveitis, herpes keratitis), known
      allergy to COSOPT or any of Prostaglandin Analogues, Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease
      (COPD), sinus bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 60 beats per minute), second or third-degree
      atrioventricular block, overt cardiac failure. Pregnant and nursing mothers.

      STUDY DESIGN: Single site, unmasked, prospective, randomized study STUDY PROCEDURE

      Visit 1 Visit 2 Visit 3 Visit 4 Visit 5 Visit 6 Screening Phase SLT Treatment Phase Safety
      check 2 weeks after SLT RANDOMIZATION 4 to 6 weeks after SLT Follow up visit, 6 weeks after
      randomization Last Visit 3 months after randomization Determine eligibility by doing routine
      eye exam including IOP check by Goldmann applanation tonometer, Gonioscopy, fundus exam,
      Humphrey Visual Field (if HVF not done within last 6 months).

      Subjects, who fulfill the eligibility criteria and give consent for participating in study,
      will be scheduled for SLT. All eligible subjects will receive SLT. Pre-existing glaucoma
      cases already on antiglaucoma medications will discontinue all the antiglaucoma medications
      since the day of SLT treatment and will be off the drops for next 4 to 6 weeks. Similarly
      newly diagnosed glaucoma will not be on any antiglaucoma medications. for next 4 to 6 weeks.
      Each subject will have IOP check at 2 weeks after SLT treatment. It will be done to rule out
      any unusual IOP spike following SLT. Each subject will have routine eye exam including IOP
      check at this visit. The subjects with uncontrolled IOP despite SLT therapy will be
      randomized to receive either COSOPT or Prostaglandin analogue (XALATAN). IOP check and
      routine eye exam. IOP check, routine eye exam including fundus exam and Humphrey Visual
      Field.

       If IOP is uncontrolled at the visit 5, a stepped drug therapy will be initiated based on
      following protocol:

        1. For patients who are in Cosopt group after randomization. Sequence of additional
           medications will be following:

           First Step: Alphagan (Brimonidine) Second Step: Prostaglandin Analogues

        2. For patients who are in Xalatan group after randomization. Sequence of additional
           medications will be following:

      First Step: Alphagan (Brimonidine) Second Step: Dorzolamide (Trusopt)

      Note: IOP will be measured using a Goldmann Applanation Tonometer at 8 AM and 10 AM at
      visits: Visit I, Visit IV, Visit V and Visit VI. A ± 30 minute window will be allowed for
      each measurement recording.

      IOP measurement at Visit II (SLT treatment phase) and Visit III (safety check) can be done at
      random time.
