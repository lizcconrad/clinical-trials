      The purpose of this study is to determine if levels of ischemia modified albumin (IMA) in
      blood are elevated in patients with suspected infection and are predictive of severity of
      illness in patients with sepsis.

      In order to compare subjects with infection to those without infection who are representative
      of the ED population at each site, a group of non-infected control patients will be enrolled.
      Each hospital will enroll subjects with age (by decade) and sex matched controls to reflect
      the population of subjects suspected of infection.

    <textblock>
      Sepsis is an unconquered challenge in medicine, affecting people of all ages and
      demographics. Severe sepsis affects approximately 751,000 patients in the United States per
      annum, with healthcare costs approaching $16.7 billion dollars a year. Mortality from severe
      sepsis and septic shock approaches 30 - 70 % with 215,000 deaths annually. Thus, sepsis is a
      disease with healthcare dollars and mortality rates approaching those of heart disease and
      cancer.

      Identifying patients with sepsis, and in particular hypoperfusion, is a challenge to the
      clinician. A variety of clinical and laboratory findings are helpful, but there is no single
      test to identify sepsis or assess its severity.

      Ischemia and reactive oxygen species play a significant role in the pathogenesis of sepsis.
      Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that septic shock results in dysfunction of
      autoregulatory mechanisms and misdistribution of blood flow, precipitating both regional and
      global ischemia. A method that can help rapidly assess hypoperfusion would be clinically
      useful. Ischemia modified albumin (IMA) is a potential marker for ischemia in acute coronary
      syndrome patients; thus, it is hypothesized that IMA may be also useful as a prognostic
      biomarker for clinical identification of infection and the severity of illness in patients
      with sepsis.
