      . PRIMARY ENDPOINT

      The primary endpoint will be the change from baseline (Visit 3) to 6 months (Visit 6) of
      centrally measured HbA1c

      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term clinical benefit of tight glycemic control in people with diabetes is well
      known . HbA1c generally assesses the average/long term quality of glycemic control, it has
      been clearly demonstrated that a target of HbA1c at 7.0% or less has benefits for diabetic
      patients

             at least 3 months prior to inclusion.

          -  Patients have been treated with multiple daily injections and use rapid Insulin Analog
             for their meal prior to study entry.

          -  Have an HbA1c value ≥ 8 %.

          -  Pediatric patients must be aged between 2 and 18 years old and adult patients be aged
             between 19 and 65 years old.

          -  Patients from PRT group must be willing to wear sensors and transmitter connected to
             the pump Paradigm® Real-Time for up to 24 weeks and to change sensors, insulin
             infusion sets and reservoirs every 3 days (~60 times during the study period ).

          -  Patients from CSII group must be willing to wear an insulin pump, change insulin
