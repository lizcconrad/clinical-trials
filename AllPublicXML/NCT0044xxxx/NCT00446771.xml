  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has an open-label, randomized, crossover design, in which each subject will receive
      mannitol powder for inhalation using a dry powder inhaler with and without premedication with
      a bronchodilator, mannitol powder for inhalation in capsules administered orally, and
      mannitol in a commercial formulation designed for intravenous use.
