  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol (LNG/EE) is an investigational drug that is being developed
      as an oral contraceptive (birth control pill). The purpose of this trial is to compare
      different preparations of LNG/EE by assessing the way they are absorbed into the blood.
