    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
      reduce atrial fibrillation and other outcomes after cardiac surgery. In this
      placebo-controlled trial, patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery
      with or without valve repair will be treated with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
      perioperatively. The following hypotheses will be tested: 1. omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
      acids reduces the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) after cardiac surgery, 2. omega-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids, administered in the perioperative period for cardiac surgery,
      decreases postoperative complication rates, and 3. omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
      decrease intensive care unit and hospital length-of-stay.

      Atrial fibrillation is the most common complication after bypass surgery. It is a significant
      burden to the healthcare system because it is associated with increased hospital costs and a
      longer hospital length-of-stay. Atrial fibrillation occurring after bypass surgery is
      associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Atrial fibrillation is also associated
      with an increased risk for strokes, use of potentially harmful drugs, and the need for
      pacemaker therapy.

      This study is for patients who are undergoing elective bypass surgery. Patients who meet
      study criteria and who consent to participate in the study will be randomized to treatment
      with omega-3 fatty acids or matching corn oil placebo, prior to surgery. After surgery,
      treatment will continue until the primary endpoint, atrial fibrillation, is reached, or 14
      days, whichever is first.
