  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out the effect of replacing testosterone in the form of a
      gel (AndrogelÂ®) on the amount of fat mass in males with low testosterone and diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypogonadism is associated with increase in fat mass, decrease in muscle mass, accelerated
      bone loss, decreased libido and effects on mood. Androgen replacement in this context is
      clearly beneficial, and numerous studies have demonstrated improvements in bone and muscle
      mass, reductions in body fat and improvement in insulin sensitivity, libido and mood
      following treatment. Testosterone replacement leads to a dose-dependent decrease in adipose
      tissue and increase in muscle mass and strength. The principal focus of the proposed research
      is to evaluate the effect of androgel on lean body mass and regional adipose tissue mass
      (including hepatic and visceral fat) in type 2 diabetic patients with hypogonadism, a
      population that is likely to benefit from a reduction in adipose tissue and an increase in
      muscle mass.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males with age 35-75 years inclusive.

          -  Evidence of hypogonadism: Hypogonadism will be defined as low total testosterone (&lt;300
             ng/dL) and low calculated free testosterone (below 6.5ng/dL; calculated using
             testosterone and SHBG). Testosterone levels will be measured between 8 and 10 am.
             Subjects who have normal total but low free testosterone levels (or vice versa) will
             be asked to come again after one week to have their testosterone levels re-measured.
             They will be included in the study in their free and total testosterone levels are low
             on re-measurement.

          -  Type 2 diabetes

          -  Hemoglobin A1c &lt;8.0 %

          -  Subjects on medications for diabetes will be allowed as long as they are on stable
             doses of these compounds for at least 6 weeks. The dose of thiazolidinediones will
             have to be stable for 3 months prior to the study. The dosage of diabetic medications
             will not be changed during the study.
