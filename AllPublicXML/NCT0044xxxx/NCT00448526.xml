  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease all the world in spite of
      progress in new treatment for diabetes and anti hypertensive drugs. Additional treatments are
      thus needed to arrest the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Although there is insufficient
      evidence to suggest that a low-protein diet improves renal dysfunction, it is recommended as
      a mainstay of nutritional management. We here assessed the role of low protein diet in renal
      function as well as albuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy for a median of
      5 years.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Terminated: recruiting or enrolling participants has halted and will not resume because low
    protein diet is not feasible nor efficious.
