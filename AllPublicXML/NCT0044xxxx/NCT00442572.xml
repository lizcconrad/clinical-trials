  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of intermittent treatment with PEGASYS
      in HBeAg negative patients with chronic hepatitis B who have demonstrated virological and
      biochemical response after treatment with interferon alfa. After 48 weeks therapy with
      interferon alfa, and 24 weeks treatment-free follow-up, eligible patients will be randomized
      into the PEGASYS or the observational group. Those in the PEGASYS group will receive 4
      therapeutic cycles of long term intermittent treatment with PEGASYS (135 micrograms sc weekly
      for 12 weeks, followed by a treatment-free period of 12 weeks) and those in the observational
      arm will receive no specific antiviral treatment. The anticipated time on study treatment is
      1-2 years, and the target sample size is 100 individuals.

    <description>Stable virological response is serum Hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA) &lt;20 000 copies/ml during the treatment (after each 12 weeks) and after the follow-up period (24 weeks after the last treatment period).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With HBsAg Seroconversion</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 108</time_frame>
    <description>The development of antibodies against HBsAg is known as HBsAg seroconversion. It signifies clearance of HBsAg and resolution of the chronic infection. НBsAg seroconversion is the final goal of anti-hepatitis B virus treatment and it is closest to the definition of &quot;cure&quot; but in practice it is very rare in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With HBV DNA Levels Under the Lower Limit (Serum HBV DNA Level &lt; 300 Copies/ml) For a Significant Quantity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 108</time_frame>
    <description>HBV DNA level, or viral load, is an indicator of viral replication. Higher HBV DNA levels are usually associated with an increased risk of liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV DNA level typically falls in response to effective antiviral treatment.</description>

    <measure>Fibrosis-4 and Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet Ratio Index Scores For Change in Liver Fibrosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 108</time_frame>
    <description>Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) and Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) are non-invasive scoring systems, which are calculated on the basis of laboratory tests that indicates the level of liver fibrosis. The APRI scores are calculated based on Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) levels and platelet counts whereas FIB-4 scores are calculated based on platelets, ALT, AST and age. For APRI, the scores are interpreted as ≤ 0.5 is 81% sensitive and 50% specific for a diagnosis of significant fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C (CHC), where as a cut-off &gt; 1.5 is 35% sensitive and 91% specific for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis. The majority of biomarker panels will produce inconclusive results for a proportion of participants falling within the indeterminate range (between 0.5 and 1.5) for a specific fibrosis end-point. For FIB-4, the scores are interpreted as FIB-4 score of &lt; 1.45: absence of cirrhosis, FIB-4 score of 1.45 to 3.25: inconclusive, FIB-4 score &gt; 3.25: cirrhosis.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With HBsAg Seroconversion</title>
        <description>The development of antibodies against HBsAg is known as HBsAg seroconversion. It signifies clearance of HBsAg and resolution of the chronic infection. НBsAg seroconversion is the final goal of anti-hepatitis B virus treatment and it is closest to the definition of “cure” but in practice it is very rare in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB).</description>

        <population>Safety population included all the randomized participants who passed during at least one treatment period, and had at least one efficacy and safety evaluation.

        <title>Fibrosis-4 and Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet Ratio Index Scores For Change in Liver Fibrosis</title>
        <description>Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) and Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) are non-invasive scoring systems, which are calculated on the basis of laboratory tests that indicates the level of liver fibrosis. The APRI scores are calculated based on Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) levels and platelet counts whereas FIB-4 scores are calculated based on platelets, ALT, AST and age. For APRI, the scores are interpreted as ≤ 0.5 is 81% sensitive and 50% specific for a diagnosis of significant fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C (CHC), where as a cut-off &gt; 1.5 is 35% sensitive and 91% specific for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis. The majority of biomarker panels will produce inconclusive results for a proportion of participants falling within the indeterminate range (between 0.5 and 1.5) for a specific fibrosis end-point. For FIB-4, the scores are interpreted as FIB-4 score of &lt; 1.45: absence of cirrhosis, FIB-4 score of 1.45 to 3.25: inconclusive, FIB-4 score &gt; 3.25: cirrhosis.</description>
