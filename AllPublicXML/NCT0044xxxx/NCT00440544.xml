    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a subunit tuberculosis vaccine given as two
      nasal immunizations composed of a hybrid protein antigen from M. tuberculosis virus mixed
      with a toxoid adjuvant, causes untoward adverse reactions when administered to healthy adult
      volunteers. Both subjects who have not received Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and subjects
      who have already received BCG will be enrolled. An initial evaluation of immune responses to
      the vaccine will also be undertaken.

      undertaken using flow cytometry to enumerate antigen specific IFNg containing T cells;
      ELISPOT to determine IFNg secreting antigen specific T cells; serology and nasal wash
      antibody.
