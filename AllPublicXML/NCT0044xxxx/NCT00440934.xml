  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocarcinoma (HCC) is the first cause of deaths due to cancer worldwide. More than one
      million two hundred thousand new patients are diagnosed each year. The prognosis of patients
      suffering from advanced hepatocarcinoma is poor with an average survival of less than six
      months. Phase I data suggest that low levels of electromagnetic fields administered
      intrabucally with a portable and programmable device are a safe and potentially effective
      treatment for advanced cancer. The device is connected to a spoon-like coupler placed in the
      patient's mouth during treatment. Patients with advanced HCC and limited therapeutic options
      will be offered treatment with a combination of frequencies.

      Hepatocarcinoma (HCC) is the first cause of deaths due to cancer worldwide. More than one
      million two hundred thousand new patients are diagnosed each year. The prognosis of patients
      suffering from advanced hepatocarcinoma is poor with an average survival of less than six
      months. Therapies for hepatocarcinoma are limited. Resection of the primary tumor is the
      therapeutic approach of first choice when possible. Although this intervention results in
      long-term survival for some patients, only a minority of them are surgical candidates because
      of limitations due to tumor size, patient's overall condition or presence of hepatic
      cirrhosis.

      Phase I data suggest that low levels of amplitude-modulated electromagnetic fields
      administered intrabucally with a portable and programmable device are a safe and potentially
      effective treatment for advanced cancer. The device is connected to a spoon-like coupler
      placed in the patient's mouth during treatment. Patients with advanced HCC and limited
      therapeutic options will be offered treatment with a combination of HCC-specific frequencies.

      The patients will be offered ambulatory treatment, which will be administered three times a
      day for 60 min until disease progression or death.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patients must have a diagnosis of inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma.

          -  The patients who have an AFP level higher than 400 ng/ml and an appearance
             characteristic of cancer of the liver do not need histological confirmation. These
             patients must however have a negative serology for the antigen of surface of hepatitis
             B If serology for this antigen is positive, they must have a rate of AFP higher than
             4000 ng/ml.

          -  Presence of one or more lesions measurable(s) according to criteria's RECIST.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other anti-cancer treatments are not authorized during this study.
