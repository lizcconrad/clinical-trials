    <textblock>
      The current study aims at comparing outcomes achieved using the Mifne approach of treating
      autistic children with results obtained when routine standard treatment is used. A
      prospective comparative study will be performed comparing the results of 12 children treated
      at Mifne with 12 children treated with treatment as usual. A child and adolescent
      psychiatrist using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic
      Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) will make the diagnostic assessment and a developmental
      psychologist will make the developmental and psychological assessments using the Vineland
      Adaptive Behavior Scales-Revised and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID II) before
      the child enters the study. Each child will be reassessed following completion of the Mifne
      intervention, at three and at six months after commencement of treatment. The control child
      will also be reassessed at three and at six months after commencement of a therapeutic
      intervention.
