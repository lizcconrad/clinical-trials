  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the treatment of Alemtuzumab in combination
      with CHOP(cyclophosphamide,doxorubicin,vincristine and prednisolone) are effective as first
      line treatment in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are more common in Asia than in Europe and United States
      (17-40% vs. 5-10%). Most studies reported a poorer prognosis for PTCL compared to B-cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL).

      CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) is currently regarded as a
      standard chemotherapy regimen for patients with newly diagnosed NHL.

      Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD52, a cell surface
      protein present at high density on most normal and malignant B and T lymphocytes.Malignant T
      cells express particularly high numbers of CD52 cell surface markers (approximately 500,000
      molecules/lymphocytes),T-cell malignancies may thus be particularly responsive to
      alemtuzumab.

      As the response rate tend to be higher in patients newly diagnosed with PTCL, this study
      evaluates the efficacy of alemtuzumab in combination with CHOP administered as up-front
      therapy in patients newly diagnosed with PTCL in terms of response rate and overall survival.
