      This study, which will be conducted at the emergency room of the Sacré-Cœur hospital,
      requires the recruitment of 60 subjects and involves some telephone follow-up.

      Calcitonin administered as an intranasal spray is already used to relieve pain caused by
      broken vertebrae and we seek to determine if it can be as efficient in the case of pain
      caused by broken ribs.This study aims at testing the hypothesis that subjects suffering from
      the accidental fracture of one or more ribs will get relief through the intranasal spraying
      of calcitonin and/or will use less opiate medication for pain relief (a combination of
      oxycodone chlorhydrate and acetaminophen called Percocet®).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 18 or more.

          -  Accidental rib fracture (one or more) visible on a lung\thorax radiography, or on a CT
             Scan of the thorax, as determined by the emergency physician or the radiologist.

          -  The rib fracture is the main cause of pain.

          -  The patient says yes to the question &quot;do you wish something for your pain&quot; (the result
             of the quantitative assessment of the pain in not taken into consideration) or the
             patient has already received an analgesic before the initial assessment by the
             emergency physician.

          -  The patient is seen no more than 48 hours after the accident.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is already receiving SC.

          -  Allergy or intolerance to SC, oxycodone chlorhydrate or acetaminophen

          -  Active neoplasia history for at least 5 years

          -  Toxicomania history as revealed by case history

          -  Osteoporosis linked to hyperparathyroidism

          -  Patient already using opiate analgesics or other analgesics on a regular basis
             (excluding aspirin at doses of 325 mg or less, as a prophylactic for cardiovascular
             diseases and under stable posology for at least 15 days)

          -  Steroid use within the past month

          -  Pregnancy, breast feeding

          -  Non-availability of patient for telephone follow-ups or follow-up appointments.
