  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not a new brain function monitor can
      distinguish between anesthetized and awake patients. The device implemented utilizes
      functional near-infrared (fNIR) technology to detect anesthesia depth as well as reaction to
      stimuli during surgical procedure.

      After obtaining consent the device is placed across the forehead of the patient. A baseline
      signal is obtained prior to induction. The fNIR signal is continuously recorded throughout
      the procedure. Key events as well as administration of drug are recorded in order to observe
      changes in the signal trend. Neither the device nor the light emitted is hazardous to the
      patient - no risks or discomforts are involved.
