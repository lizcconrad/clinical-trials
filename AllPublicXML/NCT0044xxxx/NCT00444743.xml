          -  Be able and willing to comply with study visits and procedures per protocol.

          -  Women of child bearing potential must use medically acceptable means of birth control
             in an effective manner and agree to continue its use during the study and 6 weeks
             after the last dose of study drug.

          -  Sexually active men must agree to use a medically acceptable form of contraception
             during the study and continue for 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug.

                  within 5 years before the screening visit.

               -  Any condition for which participation in this study is judged by the physician to
                  be detrimental to the patient, such as history of significant or unstable
                  cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurological, or psychiatric disease.

               -  Significant ongoing infection requiring systemic antibiotic, antifungal,
                  antiviral, or ant anti-mycobacterial therapy.

          -  Autoimmune or connective tissue disorder other than sarcoid or birdshot uveitis, (e.g.
             Rheumatoid Arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, or Scleroderma.)

          -  Other known active eye diseases or eye infections (bacterial, fungal, or viral) that
             may interfere with the evaluation of uveitis.

          -  Scheduled elective surgery during study participation

          -  Participated in any previous clinical trials using MM-093 or have any prior exposure
             to MM-093.

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity to goat, sheep, or cow milk products derived from
             goat, sheep or cow milk (patients who are lactose intolerant are not excluded.)

          -  Any other acute or clinically important condition that the investigator feels would
             jeopardize the integrity of the study (e.g. a CTCAE grade 2 or above clinical finding
             or laboratory result.)
