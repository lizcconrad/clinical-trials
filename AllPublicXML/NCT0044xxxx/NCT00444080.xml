    <description>Standard trabeculectomy procedure
Creation of a fornix or limbal based conjunctival flap in upper quadrants
Creation of a limbal-based scleral flap extending into clear cornea
Delicate application of MMC solution onto sclerectomy bed. (MMC concentration 0.4mg/ml for 1-3 minutes)
Creation of fistula 1mm x 2mm in size
Iridectomy
Suturing the scleral flap
Repositioning of conjunctiva with sutures After procedure, antibiotics &amp; steroids are administered topically; eye is covered with a pad - patient is discharged.</description>

    <description>Ex-PRESS implantation procedure:
Creation of a fornix or limbal based conjunctival flap in upper quadrants
Creation of limbal-based scleral flap extending into clear cornea
Delicate application of MMC solution onto sclerectomy bed. (MMC concentration 0.4mg/ml for 1-3 minutes)
Penetration into anterior chamber using 23-25G needle, halfway between the white sclera and clear cornea (in the center of the grey zone);creation of track incision at limbus
Prior to implantation, a thorough mobility check should be performed
Implantation of Ex-PRESS implant loaded on its introducer, through that pre-incision
Withdrawal of introducer
Tucking plate under the scleral flap, and verification of its position
Suturing scleral flap After implantation procedure, antibiotics &amp; steroids administered topically; eye is covered with a pad - patient is discharged.</description>
