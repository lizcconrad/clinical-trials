      The variations of ENaC have an impact on the degradation of epithelial sodium channels and
      sodium reabsorption, and thus are associated with hypertension and hypokalemia.

      Liddle's syndrome is a rare monogenic form of autosomal-dominant hypertension caused by
      truncating or missense mutations in the C-termini of epithelial sodium channel β- or
      γ-subunit encoded by SCNN1B or SCNN1G. Our purpose is to determine the hotspot of mutation
      causing Chinese Liddle's syndrome.

      The second purpose is to determine wether the polymorphisms of ENaC are associated with
      hypertension in Chinese. Some polymorphisms of ENaC associated with hypertension may be
      genetic risk factors for Chinese hypertension.

        Patients were defined as being hypertensive if they had systolic and/or diastolic BP levels
        &gt;=140/90mm Hg on three occasions within 2 months and if they were without any
        antihypertensive treatment, and/or if they had been diagnosed as being hypertensive in the
        past and were currently receiving antihypertensive medications. The normotensive controls
        were defined as having systolic and/or diastolic BP levels &lt;130/85mm Hg and with no family
        history of hypertension. Patients were excluded when they had any known renal diseases or
        secondary hypertension.
