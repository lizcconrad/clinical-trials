      To find out how the application of acupuncture needles to the proposed acupuncture points:

      Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD)

      Acupuncture is being used as one part of Chinese medicine for more than 2,500 years in
      treating diseases. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that acupuncture
      can suppress the “pain” area in the brain so as to reduce the pain that felt by human
      subjects. Western medicine proposed the acupuncture mechanisms as to “provoke the release of
      endogenous substances” from central nervous system so in reducing pain. Many studies had been
      done using acupuncture in reducing pain for post-operation period, however, most of them were
      not very systematic and even some of them are leak of control group. Furthermore, to our
      knowledge, the use of acupuncture for reducing anxiety during EGD has not been previously
      investigated.
