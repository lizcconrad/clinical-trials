  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease and ischemic heart disease is the #1 killer in Canada. Currently,
      Cardiac invasive catheterization angiography (CICA) is the gold standard for the assessment
      of the arteries in the heart. However, cardiac catheterization has risks which prohibit its
      use in all patients. These risks include: death, heart attack, stroke and bleeding. Cardiac
      computed tomography angiography (CTA) is a new non-invasive technology which may enable the
      evaluation of patients' coronary anatomy without exposing patients to the risks of invasive
      cardiac catheterization.

      The purpose of this project is to compare CT angiography (CTA) to Tc-99m single photon
      emission computed tomography (Tc-99m SPECT)

      We will enroll patients who are waiting for a CICA or who have been referred for a TC-99m
      SPECT or CTA scans at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. Consenting patients who are
      waiting for a CICA will have both a CTA and a Tc-99m SPECT scan. Consenting patients referred
      for a CTA or Tc-99m SPECT will have both the CTA and Tc-99m SPECT in a random order but not
      CICA (unless ordered by your physician).
