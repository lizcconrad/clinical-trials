      The aim of the present study is to take stronger action in solving the problems of
      malnutrition in the hospital setting and in the first two months after patient's discharge.
      The main objective is to evaluate the clinical benefit (eg. QoL, body composition and body
      function) of nutritional intervention (nutritional therapy) in a sample of patients at
      nutritional risk according to the NRS 2002.
