      Primary: To compare the pharmacodynamic efficacy of PN 200 in controlling intragastric pH
      (percent time pH&gt; 4.0) following twice daily administration at different dosing times
      relative to food (30 or 60 minutes prior to food or taken togeterh with food) on Day 5.

      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of different dosing times of PN 200 relative to
      food on the intragastric pH profile of PN 200. PN 200 contains immediate release omeprazole,
      which may be subject to acid degradation in the stomach. Food is known to have a buffering
      effect on acid and therefore may result in less degradation of immediate release omeprazole.
      Alternatively, food may decrease the absorption of omeprazole in the duodenum. The relative
      magnitude of these effects is unknown. The data from this study will aid in choosing the
      optimal timing of PN dosing relative to food in future studies. The study is not blinded
      because the primary endpoint (intragastric pH) is a physiological variable not believed to be
      readily influenced by conscious or subconscious subject control.

          2. Female subjects are eligible for participation in the study if they are of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming
                  pregnant); or,

               -  Childbearing potential, have a negative pregnancy test (urine) at screening, and

                    -  Hormonal contraception by oral route, implant, injectable, vaginal ring; or,

                    -  Any intrauterine device (IUD) with published data showing that the lowest
                       expected failure rate is less than 1% per year;

                    -  Double barrier method (2 physical barriers or 1 physical barrier plus
                       spermicide); or

                    -  Any other method with published data showing that the lowest expected
                       failure rate is less than 1% per year

          3. Physical examination findings within normal limits for age

          4. Participation in any study of an investigational treatment in the 4 weeks before
             screening or participation in another study at any time during the period of this
             study

          5. Any significant medical illness that would contraindicate participation in the study

          6. Gastrointestinal disorder or surgery leading to impaired drug absorption

          7. Any significant mental illness, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder

          8. Cardio- or cerebrovascular disease, based on history or risk factors, or clinically
             significant ECG in the investigator's opinion
