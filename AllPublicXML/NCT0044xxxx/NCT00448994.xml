  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the rate at which stem cell transplant patients can
      develop infection caused by a group of viruses, known as adenovirus, and common fungi. Stem
      cells are unspecialized cells, capable of producing more stem cells or other specialized
      cells, and are used to replace damaged or diseased cells. The study will be conducted in
      children (2-17years old) being transplanted with stem cells from a donor. Patients undergoing
      stem cell transplantation are more likely to develop infections as their immune systems are
      weakened. Blood, stool, urine and throat swab samples will be collected (for at least 100
      days on a weekly basis) to detect infection(s) caused by adenovirus or fungus. Subjects will
      participate for up to 1 year following the transplant procedure.

      This study is a multi-center observational study to determine the usefulness of real time PCR
      in the detection of adenovirus and fungal infections in patients following HSCT. Quantitative
      viral load monitoring will be evaluated to establish correlation with clinical symptoms and
      to measure the effectiveness of the therapeutic interventions. Samples will be collected
      prior to HSCT and on a scheduled weekly basis for 100 days post-HSCT and after that when
      patients show signs of infection. Patients' signs and symptoms and outcomes will be recorded
      for correlation with viral load. In addition, viral cultures will be performed on the same
      schedule as PCR assay using 3 samples (throat swab, stool, and urine). The study will be
      conducted at approximately 6 centers in the United States.
