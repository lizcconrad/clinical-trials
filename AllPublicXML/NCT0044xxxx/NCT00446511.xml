  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this extension study is to compare the long-term safety of valsartan versus
      enalapril, and the effectiveness of the combination of valsartan and enalapril versus
      enalapril alone in children with hypertension.

    <time_frame>Core Baseline (Week 0) to Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>After the patient had been sitting for 5 minutes, with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured 3 times using a calibrated standard sphygmomanometer and appropriate size cuff. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 1-2 minute intervals and the mean of these 3 sitting blood pressure measurements was used as the average sitting blood pressure for that visit. A negative number indicates lowered blood pressure.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) control was defined as msSBP and msDBP &lt; 95th percentile for gender, age, and height. After the patient had been sitting for 5 minutes, with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured 3 times using a calibrated standard sphygmomanometer and appropriate size cuff. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 1-2 minute intervals and the mean of these 3 sitting blood pressure measurements was used as the average sitting blood pressure for that visit.</description>

    <description>24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was conducted once during the extension in a subset of patients at selected centers. For all patients who completed a qualifying ABPM at baseline, an ABPM was to be performed at Week 20. The ABPM monitor was placed on the non-dominant arm.</description>

        <description>After the patient had been sitting for 5 minutes, with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured 3 times using a calibrated standard sphygmomanometer and appropriate size cuff. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 1-2 minute intervals and the mean of these 3 sitting blood pressure measurements was used as the average sitting blood pressure for that visit. A negative number indicates lowered blood pressure.</description>
