      -  Thermogenesis is a company that sells a machine for the production of fibrin sealant of
           single donor plasma, the CryoSeal Fibrin Sealant System (CS-1).

        -  Fibrin sealant consists of two components: cryoprecipitate and thrombin. Cryoprecipitate
           is the fraction of human plasma that contains concentrated coagulation factors, such as
           fibrinogen. Thrombin is an enzyme that facilitates the conversion of fibrinogen into
           fibrin, so that a clot will be formed.

        -  Fibrin sealant can be used in surgery to increase hemostasis in the wound after e.g.
           knee- or hip replacement, cosmetical surgery or partial liverresections.

        -  Until now, mainly autologous plasma was used to produce fibrin sealant with the CS-1.
           Within Sanquin there is a question whether fibrin sealant can be produced from the
           allogeneic quarantaine plasma that is in stock. Therefore in this study will be studied
           whether allogenous single donor fibrin sealant produced using the CS-1 is effective in
           wound healing and as consequence of this can be registered as a product of Sanquin. To
           answer these questions a national working party is formed, working party Fibrin Sealant.

        -  So far, three man personnel in Sanquin Blood Bank Nort East Region (SBNO) are certified
           by Thermogenesis to use the CS-1 for production of fibrin sealant and an in vitro
           validation has been performed.

        -  The next step will be a study for the in vivo effectiveness of fibrin sealant produced
           of single donor allogeneic quarantaine plasma using the CS-1. As control patients
           without fibrin sealant treatment will be studied. Two hospitals (Refaja Hospital in
           Stadskanaal and Wilhelmina hospital in Assen) are already interested in participating in
           this study. Probably, three more hospitals will participate.

        -  The use of fibrin sealant will be studied in a prospective randomized trial for patients
           undergoing knee and hip replacements.

      1. Introduction

             -  Until now, mainly autologous plasma was used to produce fibrin sealant with the
                CS-1. Within Sanquin there is a question whether fibrin sealant can be produced
                from the allogeneic quarantaine plasma that is in stock. Therefore in this study
                will be studied whether allogenous single donor fibrin sealant produced using the
                CS-1 is effective in wound healing and as consequence of this can be registered as
                a product of Sanquin.

             -  The use of fibrin sealant will be studied in a prospective randomized trial for
                patients undergoing knee and hip replacements.

        2. Aim

           · To study the effectiveness of fibrin sealant produced of single donor allogeneic
           plasma when used intra-operatively after total knee or hip replacement.

             -  Primairy endpoint: wound healing.

             -  Secondary endpoints: total blood loss until 24h post-operative, amount of blood
                transfused, motion of the joint (knee) after surgery, amount of pain after surgery,
                use of antibiotics, wound infections, stay in hospital, adverse events,
                satisfaction with fibrin sealant as used by the physician.

        3. Hypothesis

             -  We hypothesize that use of fibrin sealant will have a positive effect on wound
                healing, will cause less blood loss, decreased use of antibiotics and and will
                cause that a decreased number of infections will be seen compared to patients who
                are not treated with fibrin sealant. Through this, hospital stay will probably be
                shortened for patients who are treated with fibrin sealant.

             -  As a working hypothesis we assume a score for wound healing of at least 20% lower
                and at least 20% less blood loss for the fibrin sealant treated group.

             -  Orthopedic Surgery department of hospitals

             -  Patient data (can be filled in on the forms in the appendix)

             -  Fibrin Sealant data (can be filled in on the form in the appendix)

             -  Department O&amp;O of SBNO for analysis of data

        7. Patients 7.1 Inclusion

             -  Age, minimum of 18 years

             -  Gender, man or woman

             -  Admission of the patient after informed consent 7.2 Exclusion

             -  Liver failure

             -  Congenital or acquired coagulation disorders

             -  Thrombocytopenia, &lt; 100 x10^9PLT/L 7.3 Number of patients

             -  The number of patients needed in this study to indicate a statistical significantly
                difference can be calculated from a pilot study for wound healing in patients that
                have undergone knee- or hip replacement.

             -  Knee replacement: For calculation of the number of patients we aim to see a
                significant difference of at least 20% better wound healing after use of fibrin
                sealant during surgery. From a pilot we observed for wound healing a score of
                0.71±0.49. With the power at 80% and alpha at 0.05 we need 193 evaluable patients
                in both study group (fibrin sealant treated) and control group (non fibrin sealant
                treated).

             -  Hip replacement: For calculation of the number of patients we aim to see a
                significant difference of at least 20% better wound healing after use of fibrin
                sealant during surgery. From a pilot we observed for wound healing a score of
                1.58±0.79. With the power at 80% and alpha at 0.05 we need 96 evaluable patients in
                both study group (fibrin sealant treated) and control group (non fibrin sealant
                treated).

        8. Adverse events

             -  Each adverse event (AE) that occurs during of after the use of fibrin sealant will
                be noted on the form by the physician on duty.

             -  An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient (&quot;patient&quot; is defined as any
                subject who has been enrolled in the study as evidenced by the subject having
                signed informed consent) or any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, an
                abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease that occurs during the course of
                the clinical investigation. The AE may or may not be considered as related to the
                investigational drug or device. All AE's should be recorded in the patient's chart
                and graded mild, moderate, or severe. All AE's shall be handled to the hospital
                procedures in force and as soon as possible passed down to the study coordinators,
                in case of fatality at least within 24h.

                  -  Mild: Symptom barely noticeable to patient; does not influence performance or
                     functioning. Prescription drugs not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom
                     but may be given because of personality of patient.

                  -  Moderate: Symptom of sufficient severity to make patient uncomfortable;
                     performance of daily activities influenced; patient is able to continue in
                     study; treatment for symptom is needed.

                  -  Severe: Symptom causes severe discomfort, or may be of such severity that
                     patient cannot perform daily routines, may cause cessation of treatment with
                     fibrin sealant; or even may be fatal.

             -  After complementary follow-up the physician on duty will conclude with notice of
                argumentation whether the AE:

                  -  is not caused by fibrin sealant

                  -  is possible, but not necessary caused by fibrin sealant (causes cannot be
                     proven nor excluded)

                  -  is probably caused by fibrin sealant

                  -  is certainly caused by fibrin sealant

        9. Procedure 9.1 Set up clinical trial

             -  The study is a randomized prospective clinical trial.

             -  Fibrin sealant treated patients will be compared with non fibrin sealant treated
                patients.

             -  Patients included undergo total knee or hip replacement.

             -  During participation of the patient, only the study coordinator of the hospital and
                the staff of the operation room know whether a patient is treated with fibrin
                sealant or not.

             -  Nurses and patients can be informed at the end of participation of the patient (at
                discharge of the hospital).

             -  Primairy endpoint is wound healing.

             -  Secondary endpoints are total blood loss until 24h post-operative, amount of blood
                transfused, motion of the joint (knee) after surgery, amount of pain after surgery,
                use of antibiotics, wound infections, stay in hospital, adverse events,
                satisfaction with fibrin sealant as used by the physician.

             -  Each group (fibrin sealant treated and non fibrin sealant treated) wil contain 193
                patients for knee and 96 patients for hip surgery.

           9.2 Production and release of fibrin sealant

           · Fibrin sealant will be produced and released from SBNO according to the procedures in
           force.

           9.3 Controled treatment with fibrin sealant

             -  Each patient who might be included (see 7.1 and 7.2) will be asked for admission to
                participate in this study by informed consent prior to surgery. Therefore a letter
                with information about this study will be given to each patient who might be
                included.

             -  After admission an envelope will be openend by the study coordinator in the
                hospital in which a code is for treatment or no treatment with fibrin sealant. The
                study coordinator will tell the outcome only to the personel of the OR who need to
                know it for preparation and usage of the fibrin sealant. People from the operation
                room do not communicate this outcome to the nursery. Except for treatment with
                fibrin sealant there will be no difference in treatment of the patients.

             -  Patient and nurses (when desired) will be informed about treatment with fibrin
                sealant or not when the patient leaves the hospital and is discharged from this
                study.

             -  Prior to surgery a blood sample of the patient will be taken to determine the
                platelet count, hematocrit and hemoglobin.

             -  Fibrin sealant, if used, will be assessed just before closing the wound. 9.4
                Parameters

             -  The following parameters of patients and surgery will be noted pre-operative by

                  -  Mobility of knee at discharge from hospital. Also date at which 90° flexion is
                     reached will be noted

                  -  Hospital stay after surgery in days

       10. Analyzing and reporting of results 10.1 Analyzing results

             -  Anonimized patient data will be put in and analyzed in an Excel file.

             -  Results of knee and hip replacements will be analyzed and reported separately.

             -  Via an unpaired t-test differences in primary and secondary endpoints between
                fibrin sealant treated and non fibrin sealant treated patients will be studied.

             -  The Fisher's exact test will be used to determine the effect of use of fibrin
                sealant in wound leakage, wound infections and undesired events.

             -  Of the results a report will be written. Also a report for data of each separate
                hospital will be written. Results about knee and hip replacements will described
                separately.

       11. Time scheduling

             -  The study will start in January 2007. After minimaal 193 evaluable patients per
                group for knee surgery (193 patients treated with fibrin sealant and 193 patients
                not treated with fibrin sealant) and minimal 96 evaluable patients per group for
                hip surgery (96 patients treated with fibrin sealant and 96 patients not treated
                with fibrin sealant) the study will be finished.

             -  It is expected that this study will take about 1 year, in case 5 hospitals
                participate.

             -  Only in case of serious reasons (e.g. severe adverse events) the study will be
                terminated early.
