  <brief_title>Study to Demonstrate Equivalence of Formoterol 12 and 24 µg Delivered Via Two Types of Single Dose Dry Powder Inhalers (Concept1 and Aerolizer)</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomized, Multi-centre, Double-blind, Double Dummy Placebo Controlled Single-dose Cross-over Study to Demonstrate That 12 and 24 µg of Formoterol Delivered by Concept1 Has a Bronchodilator Efficacy Which is Equivalent to the Same Dose of Formoterol Delivered by Aerolizer in Adult Patients With Persistent Asthma</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to demonstrate that formoterol 12µg and 24µg delivered by a new
      inhalation device (Concept1) are equivalent to the corresponding dose of formoterol delivered
      by the Aerolizer device in terms of efficacy, in patients with persistent asthma.
