  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 8-week, crossover study will compare the quality of 24-hour IOP control with TTFC versus
      travoprost when both medications are dosed in the evening. Such a crossover comparison may
      determine the real efficacy of the new fixed combination versus travoprost monotherapy. The
      results should enhance the investigators understanding on the best dosing of TTFC and may
      influence its clinical use in Europe. Finally, the results would better delineate the future
      role of TTFC in glaucoma management after PG monotherapy, or instead of unfixed therapy with
      PG analogs and timolol. This study should assist the general ophthalmologist worldwide to
      plan optimal stepwise medical therapy.
