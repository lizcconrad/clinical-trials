      RATIONALE: Studying mammograms for breast density changes over time may help doctors predict
      breast cancer risk.

      PURPOSE: This natural history study is looking at changes in breast density and gathering
      health information over time to assess breast cancer risk in women with breast cancer and in
      healthy women.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Characterize each woman's individual mammographic density (MD) longitudinal change
           trajectory in women with breast cancer and in healthy female participants to assess
           within-individual MD longitudinal change and breast cancer risk.

        -  Examine whether these patients or healthy participants manifest different patterns of
           within-individual change in MD and evaluate predictors of across-individual differences.

        -  Determine whether the developmental profile of MD differs systematically between these
           patients and healthy participants.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, retrospective, controlled study. Patients and healthy
      participants are frequency-matched by age (± 2 years) and ethnicity.

        -  Questionnaire: Patients and healthy participants complete a self-administered
           questionnaire providing detailed information on breast cancer risk factors, including
           demographics, behavioral and lifestyle factors, reproductive history, family history of
           breast cancer, comorbidities, medication and hormone replacement therapy use, and breast
           cancer screening history. This information is then cross-validated with documented data
           abstracted from medical records to provide a longitudinal and historical framework for
           assessing individual risk.

        -  Mammographic density (MD) assessment: Patients and healthy participants are evaluated
           for patterns of longitudinal change in MD and subsequent breast cancer risk by
           retrospective review of screening mammograms performed prior to breast cancer diagnosis.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1500 patients and 1500 healthy participants will be accrued for
      this study.

        Breast cancer cases diagnosed after 1994 and equal number of frequency-matched (by age
        within 2 years and ethnicity) controls. Cases and eligible controls with at least 3
        screening mammograms since 1994 will be recruited through the University Hospitals Breast
        Center, and primary care clinics within the University Hospitals Health System (UHHS). The
        restriction of 3 or more screening mammograms will allow us to adequately model the
        longitudinal change patterns.
