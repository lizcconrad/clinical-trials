  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CATO population is a very well documented population during two years. During this study
      patients were treated according to the CATO algorithm, after that patient were treated
      according to the Dutch national (GINA derived) guidelines up to 6 years of follow-up. The
      purpose of this prospective follow-up study is to understand the long-term effects of
      treatment. Therefore the measurements done at baseline (CATO part 1) are repeated after 6
      years in this CATO-population (CATO follow-up).
