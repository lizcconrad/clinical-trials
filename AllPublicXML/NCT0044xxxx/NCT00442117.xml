      This study will be an open-label, parallel-group comparison of Mometasone Furoate Dry Powder
      Inhaler (MF-DPI) 200 mcg once daily in the evening with two puffs vs. Budesonide Dry Powder
      Inhaler (BUD-DPI) 200 mcg twice daily with two puffs each time in patients previously treated
      with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or without ICS with diagnosed mild persistent or moderate
      persistent asthma (classified as Global Initiative For Asthma, 2005) in the previous 4 weeks.
      The primary efficacy endpoint is percent change from baseline in FEV1.

          -  The subject must be diagnosed mild persistent or moderate persistent asthma and
             his/her FEV1 must be &gt;= 60% of predicted normal at both the Screening and Baseline
             visits, when short-acting inhaled beta agonists have been withheld for at least six
             hours and long-acting inhaled beta agonists have been withheld for at least 12 hours.

          -  Subjects must demonstrate an increase in absolute FEV1 of &gt;= 12%, with an absolute
             volume increase of at least 200 mL, after reversibility testing at the Screening
             visit, or historically within the past 12 months; Subjects without documented absolute
             FEV1 of &gt;= 12% in reversibility test within the past 12 months need to demonstrate a

          -  Subjects who have required ventilator support for respiratory failure secondary to
             their asthma within the last 5 years.

          -  Subjects who have used any investigational drug in the 30 days prior to Baseline, or
