      Purpose is to identify whether immune markerscan predict success of salvage anti-retroviral
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last several years two markers of disease have been utilized to determine if
      antiretroviral therapy has been successful, one is a CD4 cell count (reflects the
      immunocompetence of an infected individual) and a HIV viral load (a blood test used to
      determine the amount of HIV in the infected individual). However in patients who fail their
      first line of therapythe likelihood of extended resuppressing viral replication with
      subsequent therapies may be as low as 25-50%. This information may take several months to
      determine the new therapies possible continuing success. It would be preferable to have
      additional markers that respond to therapies in the first several weeks to such therapies,
      therfore possibly offering patients alternate treatment earlier without potentiatinglong term
      side effects and possible further drug resistance.
