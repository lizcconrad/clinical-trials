  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that Rellidep will be effective in improving the symptoms of
      major depression. The available evidence strongly suggests that Rellidep contains a mood
      altering ingredient or ingredients. This open-label, non-randomized study sets out to
      validate its potential antidepressant activity.The study will include secondary aims of
      evaluating the effect of Rellidep on reducing symptoms of anxiety, a common symptom
      associated symptom of depression and improving quality of life.

      About twenty-five patients with major depressive disorder will be assigned to open-label
      Rellidep (2000 mg/day) for a period of 8 weeks. All patients will be assessed by various
      measures of global improvement, depression, quality of life, sexual experience, anxiety and
      measures of side effects as well as standard laboratory tests.
