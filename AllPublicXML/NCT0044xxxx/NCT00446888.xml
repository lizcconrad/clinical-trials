  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare two different nutritional supplements with respect to
      their effect on building muscle, and to determine the factors that control the rate at which
      muscle tissue can be produced in subjects with cancer. After three days of receiving all
      meals from the Reynolds Institute on Aging in order to stabilize their diet, subjects will
      then return to the Institute to perform a single day study, where they will be given one of
      two supplements to drink. Blood will be taken from a catheter placed in one of their arms and
      three muscle biopsy samples will be taken from a leg. Subjects will have x-ray evidence of
      cancer and be 40 years of age or older in order to participate. It is the hypothesis that a
      nutritional supplement with a high amount of protein and containing leucine will target the
      metabolism problems in cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Muscle protein is generally diminished in cancer patients, with an effect on outcome.
      Research has shown that recurrence in treated patients is directly related to the extent of
      muscle loss. The effects of nutritional supplements; however, is still controversial.
      Anorexia due to metabolic changes in cancer patients can lead to reduced food intake and
      supplementation orally has often failed to show weight gain in these patients. These
      observations have led to the conclusion that even though food intake should be increased in
      order to gain lean body mass, this is difficult to achieve unless specific metabolic
      abnormalities are targeted.

      This study is a comparison of two supplements on muscle protein synthesis. Approximately 40
      patients with radiographic evidence of cancer, ages 40 and older will be enrolled.

      Participation will require a screening procedure, including a history of medical problems and
      a physical exam, which may include blood testing for HIV or hepatitis as well as possibly for
      various basic diagnostic parameters. There may also be a urine-based drug screen or pregnancy
      test (if female). Participants should be in general good health and not have a variety of
      exclusion criteria.

      There will be three days of diet stabilization, during which all meals will come from the
      Reynolds Institute of Aging. If subjects cannot comply with the diet, dietary recording will
      be substituted. Following these three days, there will be one day of main study activities.
      There will be catheters placed in both arms and blood samples will be taken from one of
      these. Stable amino acid isotopes will be infused into the bloodstream through the other.
      There will be three muscle biopsies taken from the thigh muscle throughout the day. Two doses
      of a nutritional supplements will be consumed 20 minutes apart during the main study day.
