  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MOA-728, an investigational drug, is currently being studied for the relief of constipation
      associated with postoperative ileus and treatment of opioid induced constipation in patients
      receiving palliative care. This study will further investigate the IV formulation of MOA-728
      comparing PK/PD time points for a 20-minute versus a 4-hour infusion.
