  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This program developed by the HSFO aims at helping people of Ontario and their primary
      healthcare providers better diagnose, manage and control high blood pressure. The High Blood
      Pressure Strategy brings together healthcare providers and patients to improve the way in
      which family doctors, nurse practitioners and pharmacists work together and with patients
      towards improved control of high blood pressure through the use of evidence-informed tools
      combined with local systems change.

      Approximately 5,000 patients will participate in the study at 11 family practice sites
      throughout Ontario. Each of the 11 clinic sites will be randomised to either intervention or
      delayed intervention 9 months later. The intervention is a systems change involving
      interprofessional education and management tools to bring together physicians, nurses and
      pharmacists with the patient. Patients will be monitored by their family doctor or nurse
      practitioner at scheduled follow-up visits during a period of 36 months for an effect of the
      intervention over time on the patient's blood pressure.
