  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration is one of the major causes of blindness in the western
      world. There is an exsudative and a non-exsudative form of age-related macular
      degeneration.Most studies concentrate on the exsudative form. In the non-exsudative form the
      policy is generally watch and see, but patients are at risk to develop an exsudative form. So
      far, the only accepted therapy to reach stable disease in the non-exsudative form is
      high-dose supplementation of antioxidants. Another approach to improve visual acuity in
      patients with non-exsudative form of macular degeneration is rheohemapheresis treatment, an
      extracorporeal therapy where plasma is separated from blood cells. By the use of a hollow
      fiber filter plasma is depleted of high molecular weight proteins and reinfused. Others
      report describe the supplementation of lutein (a vitamin A derivative) as possible treatment
      option. However, none of the studies have yet examined a combination of rheohemapheresis and
      lutein supplementation.

      Rheohemapheresis will be performed in 5 cycles. One cycle consists of 2 rheohemapheresis
      treatments on day 1 and day 4. A cycle lasts for 4 weeks and will be repeated every fourth
      week. During each treatment &gt; 75% to 100% of patients total plasma volume has to be
      filtered.General medical reviews, ETDRS and Radner visual acuity assessment, ophthalmologic
      examinations, ocular imaging with OCT 3, autofluorescein imaging and infrared imaging,
      multifocal ERG, ocular echography, and blood examinations will be performed.
