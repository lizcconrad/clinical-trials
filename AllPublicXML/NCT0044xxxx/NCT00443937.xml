  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cyclosporine (CNI), a potent immunosuppressive drug used in transplant recipients to prevent
      graft rejection, can cause renal impairment in some patients. The aims of this study are

        -  To determine the influence of CNI discontinuation on the drug exposure and key
           pharmacokinetic parameters of everolimus and enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium
           (EC-MPS)

        -  To determine the adequate dosing of everolimus and EC-MPS in a CNI-free regimen

        -  To investigate the CNI-free regimen with EC-MPS and everolimus with respect to safety
           (e.g. rejection rates) and tolerability

        -  To investigate renal function after CsA withdrawal

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients having a kidney transplant since at least 6 months but for no longer than 5
             years.

          -  Patients in a stable condition in terms of graft function

          -  Patients currently receiving EC-MPS and CsA with or without corticosteroids as part of
             their immunosuppressive regimen for at least 1 month prior to Baseline

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to
             study inclusion. If positive, the patient will not be enrolled. Effective
             contraception must be used during the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with any known hypersensitivity to EC-MPS or everolimus or other components
             of the formulation (e.g., lactose)

          -  Patients with a history of severe rejection (according to BANFF criteria) within 3
             months of enrollment in this trial.

          -  Changes to the immunosuppressive regimen during the last 3 months due to immunologic
             reasons.

          -  Patients with thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;100,000/mm3), with an absolute neutrophil
             count of &lt;1,500/mm3 and/or leukocytopenia (leukocytes &lt;4,500/mm3), and/or hemoglobin
             &lt;9.0 g/dL at baseline.

          -  Patients with proteinuria at baseline (&gt; 1g/d)

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
