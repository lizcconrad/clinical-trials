    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial is planned to evaluate an interactive voice response (IVR)
      mediated follow-up and triage system, against usual care, to help smokers hospitalized with
      Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) to quit smoking. The investigators hypothesize that compared to
      usual care, participants in the IVR group will; a) have a significantly higher 7-day point
      prevalence abstinence rate at 26 and 52 weeks after hospital discharge, b) will have a higher
      rate of continuous abstinence at 26 and 52 weeks after hospital discharge, c) will use a
      greater number of proven effective interventions over time, and d) will develop greater
      self-efficacy with respect to smoking cessation, over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Quitting smoking appears to be the single most effective intervention or treatment to reduce
      mortality in patients with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). However, despite interventions,
      almost two-thirds of smokers resumed smoking in the year after hospitalization for CHD
      related illnesses; one-third resumed smoking within one month. A critical challenge for
      institution-level programs is how to provide consistent patient follow-up and linkage to
      community-based smoking cessation resources. Interactive voice response (IVR) technology has
      the potential to improve follow-up with smokers after hospitalization and to enhance triage
      to clinical support for smoking cessation. IVR uses natural language to place automated
      out-going calls that can pose questions regarding smoking status and progress with smoking
      cessation, that is then dropped into a database. A counselor is then able to link with the
      database and obtain information about the patient's smoking cessation needs and provide
      support as appropriate. A randomized control trial (RCT) is planned to evaluate whether an
      IVR system for follow-up and triage helps smokers hospitalized for CHD, quit smoking over 26-
      and 52-week follow-up periods. Participants are randomized into either a Usual Care or IVR
      group. Both groups will receive in-patient counseling and offer of nicotine replacement
      therapy. The IVR group will additionally receive a telephone call from the IVR system three,
      14, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 days after hospital discharge. Variables that will be assessed
      at 26 and 52 weeks include: smoking status, both 7-day point-prevalent and continuous
      abstinence, as well as self-efficacy for smoking cessation, use of effective cessation
      resources and patient satisfaction (at 26 weeks).
