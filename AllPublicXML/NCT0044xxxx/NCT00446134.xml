    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to select an optimal dose of taribavirin by comparing the
      efficacy and safety of 3 taribavirin dose levels, 20, 25, and 30 mg/kg/day, versus ribavirin
      800 to 1400 mg/day based on body weight, both administered in combination with peginterferon
      alfa-2b to therapy-naive patients with chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection.

    <time_frame>Treatment Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint was the numbers of responders at Treatment Week (TW) 12. Responders are defined as patients achieving either viral negativity or a partial response (PR). Viral negativity is defined as &lt;100 copies/mL serum HCV RNA. A PR is defined as &lt; 100 copies/mL serum HCV RNA and at least a 2-log decrease from baseline in serum HCV RNA levels. Responder rates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated for each treatment group.</description>

    <description>The primary safety endpoint will be the numbers of patients with hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL (anemia) at any time during the treatment period. The comparison of anemia rates between taribavirin and ribavirin groups will be carried out using the Fisher's exact test or Chi-square test. The 95% confidence interval of the difference in proportion will be analyzed.</description>

        <description>The primary efficacy endpoint was the numbers of responders at Treatment Week (TW) 12. Responders are defined as patients achieving either viral negativity or a partial response (PR). Viral negativity is defined as &lt;100 copies/mL serum HCV RNA. A PR is defined as &lt; 100 copies/mL serum HCV RNA and at least a 2-log decrease from baseline in serum HCV RNA levels. Responder rates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated for each treatment group.</description>
