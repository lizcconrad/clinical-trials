  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapy-associated diarrhea during radiation therapy of small pelvis (including enteritis as
      a result of radiation therapy and enteritis as a result of radiation- and chemotherapy) is a
      common problem in multimodal cancer therapy. We investigate the therapeutic effect of either
      loperamide or tinctura opii in therapy- associated diarrhea in patients who receive radiation
      therapy of the small pelvis with or without chemotherapy.
