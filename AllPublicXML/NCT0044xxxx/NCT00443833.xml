    <textblock>
      Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is characterized by episodes of reversible hypokalemia
      and weakness in thyrotoxic patients. It is commonly found in males of Asian descent and is
      also seen in individuals having Native American or Hispanic ancestry. Therefore genetic
      etiology has been hypothesized. This study, we aim to find the susceptibility genes that
      associate with TPP. Both candidate genes approach and genome wide association study have been
      conducted.

      This study is a genetic association study. It included 50 cases of TPP patients and 80 cases
      of male, hyperthyroid patients who didn't have hypokalemia as a well characterized controls.
      After informed consent were obtained, genomic DNA from leukocyte were extracted. Pooled DNA
      were constructed and whole genome scan using 10K GeneChip microarray were genotyped on pooled
      genomic DNA.
