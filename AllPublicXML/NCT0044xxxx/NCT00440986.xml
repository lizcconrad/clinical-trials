    <textblock>
      The purpose of study is to determine the best and durable choice of treatment between
      phlebotomy and eritrocytoapheresis in the medium- and long-term clinical management of HH

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients affected by Hereditary hemochromatosis need a completeinitial staging of disease, a
      correct clinical management, a good chance of treatment and long-term follow-up. Clinical
      manifestations at presentation and during follow-up may consistently vary according to
      diagnostic criteria, treatment options and follow-up durability, up to the interruption. So,
      25 caucasian patients, 16 males and 6 females of age &gt;18 yrs. have been consecutively
      diagnosed and randomly included into two arms of treatment, phlebotomy vs.
      eritrocytoapheresis, evaluating, at baseline and 6-12-18-24-36 months, the clinical status
      concerning liver, kidney, pancreas, heart, endocrine iron overload and function and final
      outcome related to therapeutic strategy, including the cost/effectiveness analysis
