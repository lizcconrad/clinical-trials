  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients who undergo cardiovascular surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass will
      develop a kidney injury following their surgery. The purpose of this study is to take a blood
      sample from patients before they have this type of surgery and then at nine time points after
      their surgery to test their plasma for a biomarker called NGAL and compare the NGAL levels to
      their creatinine levels. We hypothesize that NGAL is an earlier marker for kidney injury than
      creatinine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 350 adults scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery involving the use of
      cardiopulmonary bypass will be enrolled. Blood samples will be obtained from all patients in
      the study for future measurement of both plasma NGAL and plasma creatinine levels in the same
      sample at each of nine time points.

      Blood samples for later assessment using the Triage NGAL Test will be processed to plasma at
      the clinical site, frozen and shipped to Biosite for storage. Testing with the Triage NGAL
      Test will be conducted at Biosite by trained laboratory personnel. The results of these
      assessments will be blinded to the medical team during the study and will not impact the
      medical management of the patient.

      The medical team caring for each study patient should obtain clinical laboratory tests per
      their usual post-operative routine and manage the patient accordingly. Any serum creatinine
      measurements obtained by the site as part of this routine care both pre-operatively and
      through Day 10 post-operatively will be recorded as well as any additional post-operative
      renal insults, the development of oliguria, the need for a nephrology consultation,
      initiation of dialysis and mortality will also be recorded through Day 10.

        4.2.1 Inclusion Criteria

          1. Male or female scheduled for cardiovascular surgery (other than cardiac transplant)
             requiring cardiopulmonary bypass

          2. 18 years of age or older

        i. The first approximately 150 to200 patients enrolled must have:

        • A Prediction of Acute Renal Failure Score ≥ 5 (see Reference 18 and Appendix B)

        ii. The subsequent patients enrolled must have one or more of the following risk factors
        for post-bypass renal injury:

          -  Age &gt; 70;

          -  Pre-operative creatinine &gt; 1.4 mg/dL;

          -  NYHA Class 3 or 4 heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 35%;

          -  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus;

          -  Undergoing cardiac valve surgery;

          -  History of previous cardiac surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 18 years

          -  Already receiving dialysis, in imminent need of dialysis or considered highly likely
             to need dialysis in the immediate post-operative period for fluid management

          -  Any known or suspected renal ischemic insult(such as cardiac arrest)or nephrotoxic
             insult(other than intravascular contrast procedure) during the 48 hours prior to
             surgery
