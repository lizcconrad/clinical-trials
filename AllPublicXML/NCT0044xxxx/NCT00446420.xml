    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that adding midazolam and/or fentanyl to propofol sedation for elective
      outpatient colonoscopy increases cognitive impairment at hospital discharge without improving
      intraoperative conditions or reducing intraoperative side-effects.

      200 healthy patients aged 18 years or older will be randomised to receive propofol or
      propofol plus midazolam and/or fentanyl. Cognitive impairment will be tested at hospital
      discharge using Cogstate computerised testing software.

      A great variety of drug combinations are administered to patients having elective outpatient
      colonoscopy. In addition, as patients are going home, some may have residual cognitive
      deficits that making leaving the hospital unsafe. This study aims to find drugs combinations
      that are associated with the least cognitive impairment.
