      The objective of the study is to induce a protective immune response against malaria in
      healthy human volunteers. The different parts of the immune response will then be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efforts to develop vaccines against malaria still represent a substantial focus of current
      research activities. Factors that have hampered the development of a subunit vaccine include
      the complexity of the malaria life cycle, the wide variety of immune response induced by the
      malaria parasite, and an incomplete knowledge of protective immunity. This study is therefore
      aimed at inducing protective immunity against malaria in 15 healthy volunteers. Volunteers
      will be exposed to the bites of infectious mosquitoes 3 times with live P. falciparum
      sporozoites under chloroquine prophylaxis. Challenge with infected mosquitoes will be given
      after stopping chloroquine prophylaxis.

      Five volunteers will form a control group; they will be exposed to non-infectious mosquitoes
      under chloroquine prophylaxis.

      Endpoints include the time and height of parasitemia after challenge, the development of
      fever and immunological parameters.
