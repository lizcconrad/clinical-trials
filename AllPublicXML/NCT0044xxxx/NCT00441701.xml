  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study conducted at multiple centers, of navarixin (SCH 527123, MK-7123) in
      participants with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Part 1 of
      the study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, rising-dose study consisting of
      four treatment groups enrolled in three cohorts. The duration of treatment, for each cohort,
      will be a 2-week run-in period, followed by a 12-week double-blind treatment period.
      Treatment initiation for each cohort was staggered by 4 weeks to allow for safety assessment
      prior to use of higher doses of navarixin. Part 2 of the study will be a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel group study consisting of four treatment groups
      enrolled as one cohort. The duration of treatment will consist of a 2-week run-in period,
      followed by a 12-week double-blind treatment period.

    <measure>Part 1: Number of Participants Who Experience at Least One Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product, biologic (at any dose), or medical device, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. The number of participants who experienced an AE, regardless of causality or severity, was summarized.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product, biologic (at any dose), or medical device, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. The number of participants who discontinued study drug, whether permanently or temporarily, due to an AE was summarized.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were assessed for absolute PBN counts at Baseline and Week 12. The reported standard deviations (SDs) are pooled across all treatment groups.

             discontinue smoking, or reduces cigarette consumption, he/she will be allowed to
             complete the study.

          -  History of daily sputum production for at least the past 3 months.

          -  Post-bronchodilator FEV1 must be &gt;=800 mL, and &gt;=40% to &lt;=70% of predicted FEV1.

             relationship with a male partner who has had a vasectomy.

        Female participants should be encouraged to continue using a highly effective method of
        birth control 30 days following the end of treatment.

          -  Female participant of child-bearing potential who is not currently sexually active

             of the study and agree to have sexual relations only with women using a highly
             effective birth control method according to the note for guidance on non-clinical
             safety studies for the conduct of human clinical trials for pharmaceuticals

             postmenopausal.

          -  Capable of complying with the dosing regimen and visit schedules.

          -  Willing to give written informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Clinically relevant medical conditions (eg, hematologic, cardiovascular, renal,
             hepatic, neurologic, or metabolic).

          -  Taken inhaled or systemic steroids within 4 weeks of Screening Visit (Visit 1).

          -  Received an investigational drug within the last 30 days.

          -  Produced an inadequate amount of sputum at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or is known
             to have difficulty producing sputum.

          -  PBN count of &lt;3000 cells/microliters at Screening Visit (Visit 1).

          -  Part of the staff personnel directly involved with this study.

          -  Family member of the investigational study staff.

          <description>Participants were assessed for induced sputum absolute neutrophil counts via the nebulized method at Baseline and at Week 12. The reported SDs are pooled across all treatment groups. The rationale for the use of an ANOVA method using pooled SD values is the assumption that the SDs are similar across treatment groups.</description>
