    <measure>Responders Rate at Week 6 (Pain While Moving)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The responder rate was defined as the percentage of patients whose pain score while moving during the last 48 hours, measured by means of a 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, 0 = no pain, 10 = maximum pain) decreased by at least 50% at Week 6 as compared to baseline. Pain at movement is the cardinal symptom of plantar fasciitis and the 10 cm VAS is a reference method for the assessment of pain intensity.</description>

    <measure>Changes From Baseline in Gerbershagen's Score at Week 18</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The Gerbershagen scale gives a global score ranging between I and III, with lower scores reflecting less impact of pain in terms of temporal, spatial aspects, drug taking behaviour and utilization of the health care system. The changes in Gerbershagen's global scores from baseline to Week 18 are reported as percentage of patients for each of the specified categories.</description>

    <measure>Changes From Baseline in Maximum Pain (Pain While Moving) at Each Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 2, 6, 10, 14 and 18</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments of the pain intensity while moving (maximum pain during the previous 48 hours) were performed by means of a 10 cm VAS (0 = no pain, 10 = maximum pain) at each visit. The changes from baseline, expressed as Pain Intensity Difference (PID) values at each indicated timepoint are reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) for Maximum Pain for Overall Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 2, 6, 10, 14 and 18</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments of the pain intensity while moving (maximum pain during the previous 48 hours) were performed by means of a 10 cm VAS (0 = no pain, 10 = maximum pain) at each visit. The PID values at each timepoint were determined by comparison to baseline, followed by calculation of the area under the curve (AUC) of PID as a function of time (i.e. SPID). The least square (LS) means of SPID, adjusted for the baseline value of pain while moving are reported.</description>

    <measure>Changes From Baseline in Pain Threshold at Each Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 2, 6, 10, 14 and 18</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum pain felt in the medial back foot was measured using an algometer. The pain threshold corresponded to the maximum pressure at which pain was still tolerated. Changes from baseline, expressed as pain threshold differences at each indicated timepoint are reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Sum of Pain Threshold Differences (by Measurement of AUC) for Overall Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 2, 6, 10, 14 and 18</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments of the pain threshold using an algometer (which was the pressure corresponding to the maximum tolerated pain) were performed at each visit. Pain threshold differences at each timepoint were determined by comparison to baseline, followed by calculation of the AUC of the pain threshold difference as a function of time. The LS means of AUC, adjusted for the baseline value of pain threshold are reported.</description>

        <title>Assessment of Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) for Maximum Pain for Overall Study</title>
        <description>Assessments of the pain intensity while moving (maximum pain during the previous 48 hours) were performed by means of a 10 cm VAS (0 = no pain, 10 = maximum pain) at each visit. The PID values at each timepoint were determined by comparison to baseline, followed by calculation of the area under the curve (AUC) of PID as a function of time (i.e. SPID). The least square (LS) means of SPID, adjusted for the baseline value of pain while moving are reported.</description>

          <title>Assessment of Dorsal Extension / Plantar Flexion Range of Motion (ROM) of the Affected Foot At Week 18</title>
          <description>Dorsal extension and plantar flexion of the affected foot were assessed at baseline and at Week 18. A ROM of approximately 70 degrees is considered to be normal. The LS means, adjusted for the baseline value are reported.</description>
          <population>The ITT analysis set was defined as the set of randomized patients who received study treatment and for whom values of the efficacy parameters were available at baseline and at least one later timepoint. This variable was only analyzed for 34 patients (18 for Dysport® and 16 for Placebo) for whom ROM was determined at both baseline and Week 18.</population>
