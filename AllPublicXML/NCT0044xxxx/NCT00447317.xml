      This randomized study will pilot test an intervention, based on self-efficacy theory and
      involving personal digital assistant (PDA)-based dietary self-monitoring, to improve
      adherence to the peritoneal dialysis dietary regimen. 60 individuals, 21 years of age or
      older, who are on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or nightly cycler peritoneal
      dialysis, will be recruited to the study. Participants will be randomized to one of 2 groups.
      Group A will receive a 4-month active intervention of decreasing intensity over time
      delivered via mail, telephone, and during regularly scheduled dialysis clinic visits. Group B
      will receive a 4-month attention control experience in which they receive reinforcement of
      standard dietary education. With this study the investigators will:

        1. Explore the impact of the intervention on dietary sodium intake,

        2. Explore the intervention on blood pressure,

        3. Explore the impact of the intervention on morning post dialysis weight (i.e. weight
           after conclusion of continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) or after long dwell
           for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, AND

        4. Explore the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The investigators will recruit those individuals:

          -  who are 18 years of age or older,

          -  who are literate, community-dwelling adults, and

          -  who have been receiving maintenance PD for at least 3 months. Individuals on
             maintenance PD less than 3 months are excluded to allow for patients to adjust to the
             PD regimen, and for stabilization of nutritional status in the early weeks of dialysis
             (i.e. they may be considered for the study after 3 months of dialysis)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Excluded from the study will be individuals:

          -  who are deemed by dialysis center staff to have a problem with cognitive function and
             to be chronically noncompliant to the dialysis regimen (e.g. misses multiple
             appointments and dialysis treatments),

          -  those who cannot read or write, those who do not speak English,

          -  those who plan to move out of the area or change dialysis centers within the next 5
             months,

          -  those with a terminal illness and life expectancy of less than 12 months,

          -  those who are scheduled for a living donor transplant,

          -  individuals who cannot see the PDA screen or use the stylus to make selections from
             the PDA screen, or

          -  individuals who are living in a nursing home or personal care facility, who would have
             limited control over their dietary intake
