  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 60 million adults in the United States have high blood pressure (BP) in the
      pre-hypertension (SBP 120-139 or DBP 80-89). Hypertension is estimated to account for 1 in 8
      deaths in the world, and in the US the direct and indirect costs of high BP are estimated to
      reach $59.7 billion in 2005. JNC-7 guidelines recommend lifestyle modifications for
      prehypertension, followed by antihypertensive medication if BP progresses to Stage I
      hypertension. Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is an increasingly popular practice
      that has been purported to alleviate stress and treat certain health conditions. Some stress
      management therapies and one meditation therapy (e.g., Transcendental Meditation) have shown
      promise in reducing elevated BP, but MBSR has not been evaluated as a treatment for high BP.
      When added to lifestyle modification advice, MBSR may be an appropriate complementary
      treatment for prehypertension. However, prior to a large randomized clinical trial of MBSR
      for prehypertension and/or hypertension, pilot data is necessary to provide preliminary
      evidence of a treatment effect and to evaluate feasibility. This feasibility randomized
      clinical trial of MBSR for unmedicated prehypertension will provide preliminary evidence to
      support a larger randomized clinical trial by evaluating the feasibility and safety of MBSR
      as a complementary treatment for high BP and by documenting any treatment effect. Sixty
      patients with unmedicated BP in the range of SBP 120-139 mm Hg or DBP 80-89 mm Hg will be
      randomly assigned to MBSR or a progressive muscle relaxation control condition. All patients
      will receive lifestyle modification advice. Patients will complete 8 weeks of MBSR delivered
      in a group format by an experienced psychologist trained in MBSR or 8 weeks of progressive
      muscle relaxation training matched for therapist contact and homework. Patients BP will be
      assessed prior to randomization and following treatment by researchers blind to treatment
      assignment. Accrual rates, acceptance of randomization, treatment adherence, treatment
      fidelity, and patient satisfaction with treatment will be evaluated.
