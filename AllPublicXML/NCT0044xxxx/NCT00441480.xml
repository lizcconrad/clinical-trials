  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether plant sterols esterified to fish oil fatty
      acids in a fish oil matrix improve the lipid profile, predominantly LDL-cholesterol and TG
      concentrations in healthy hyperlipidemic subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phytosterols and omega-3 fatty acids (n-3) are natural food ingredients with potential
      cardiovascular (CVD) benefits. Phytosterols inhibit dietary cholesterol absorption and
      biliary cholesterol re-absorption, thereby reducing blood cholesterol levels, while
      consumption of n-3 is associated with a significant reduction in plasma triglyceride
      concentrations. Furthermore, n-3 may also beneficially modify a number of other risk factors
      of CHD, like anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether plant sterols esterified to fish
      oil fatty acids in a fish oil matrix improve the lipid profile, predominantly LDL-cholesterol
      and TG concentrations in healthy hyperlipidemic subjects. In addition the supplement efficacy
      to lower other CVD-related risk factors of healthy will be evaluated.
