  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, open-label study of a total of approximately 560 subjects with active
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to one or more
      disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Enrollment in the study was conducted in two
      stages. In Stage I of the study, approximately 400 subjects receiving non-biological DMARDs
      (with the exception of methotrexate [MTX] monotherapy or MTX and leflunomide combination
      therapy) were enrolled. In Stage II of the study, approximately 160 subjects receiving a
      Federal Drug Administration-approved biological DMARD at the time of screening were enrolled.

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Developing a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Within 24 Weeks After Receiving the First Course of Rituximab Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From first treatment with rituximab (Day 1) through Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, significantly abnormal laboratory finding, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medical product or other protocol-imposed intervention. An AE was classified as an SAE if it: Resulted in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to the investigational product; required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; was life-threatening or considered a significant medical event by the investigator.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients Who Developed a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) During or Within 24 Hours of Rituximab Infusions</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of rituximab treatment through 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients developing a SAE during or within 24 hours of a rituximab infusion is reported separately for each of the 2 infusions in the first course of treatment (Days 1 and 15) and the second course of treatment (optional retreatment during Weeks 24 to 40). See the Primary Outcome Measure for a definition of a SAE.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients Who Developed a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Within 24 Weeks After Receiving the Second Course (Optional Retreatment) of Rituximab Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of the second course of rituximab treatment through Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, significantly abnormal laboratory finding, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medical product or other protocol-imposed intervention. An AE was classified as an SAE if it: Resulted in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to the investigational product; required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; was life-threatening or considered a significant medical event by the investigator.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With an Improvement of 20%, 50%, and 70% in American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Scores (ACR20/50/70) From Baseline at Weeks 24 and 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24 and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement must be seen in tender and swollen joint counts and in at least 3 of the following 5 parameters. Patient and physician assessment of patient disease activity (DA) in previous 24 hours on a visual analog scale (VAS, no DA to maximum DA); patient assessment of pain in previous 24 hours on a VAS (none to unbearable); Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (20 questions, 8 components: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities, 0=without difficulty to 3=unable to do); and C reactive protein or, if missing, erythrocyte sedimentation rate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients Achieving Disease Activity Score 28-Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS 28-ESR) Remission and DAS 28-ESR Low Disease Activity Scores at Weeks 24 and 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24 and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>DAS 28-ESR was calculated using counts of tender and swollen joints (28 joints, 28TJC and 28SJC), a patient assessment (PA) of disease activity (DA) in previous 24 hours on a visual analog scale (no DA to maximum DA), and ESR at the current visit, using the following formula: 0.56 × 28TJC + 0.28 × 28SJC + 0.70 × ln(ESR) + 0.014 × PADA. The DAS 28-ESR score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more rheumatoid arthritis. DAS28-ESR Remission was defined as a DAS 28-ESR score of &lt; 2.6. DAS28-ESR Low Disease Activity was defined as a DAS28-ESR score of ≤ 3.2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients With European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Good and Moderate Responses at Weeks 24 and 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24 and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in the post-baseline DAS 28-ESR score from baseline was used to determine the EULAR responses of moderate response and good response. The DAS 28-ESR score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more rheumatoid arthritis. For a post-baseline score ≤ 3.2, an improvement &gt; 0.6 to ≤ 1.2 was a moderate response and ≥ 1.2 a good response. For a post-baseline score &gt; 3.2 to ≤ 5.1, an improvement &gt; 0.6 was a moderate response. For a post-baseline score &gt; 5.1, an improvement ≥ 1.2 was a moderate response. A good response could not be achieved for post-baseline scores &gt; 3.2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Change From Baseline at Weeks 24 and 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24 and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI assesses how well the patient is able to perform 8 activities: Dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. The patient answers 20 questions with 1 of 4 responses with the past week as the time frame: 0=without difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. The highest score for any question in a category determines the category score. The total score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled). A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>DAS 28-ESR was calculated using counts of tender and swollen joints (28 joints, 28TJC and 28SJC), a patient assessment (PA) of disease activity (DA) in previous 24 hours on a visual analog scale (no DA to maximum DA), and ESR at the current visit, using the following formula: 0.56 × 28TJC + 0.28 × 28SJC + 0.70 × ln(ESR) + 0.014 × PADA. The DAS 28-ESR score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more rheumatoid arthritis. DAS28-ESR Remission was defined as a DAS 28-ESR score of &lt; 2.6.

        <title>Percentage of Patients With European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Good and Moderate Responses at Weeks 24 and 48</title>
        <description>Improvement in the post-baseline DAS 28-ESR score from baseline was used to determine the EULAR responses of moderate response and good response. The DAS 28-ESR score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more rheumatoid arthritis. For a post-baseline score ≤ 3.2, an improvement &gt; 0.6 to ≤ 1.2 was a moderate response and ≥ 1.2 a good response. For a post-baseline score &gt; 3.2 to ≤ 5.1, an improvement &gt; 0.6 was a moderate response. For a post-baseline score &gt; 5.1, an improvement ≥ 1.2 was a moderate response. A good response could not be achieved for post-baseline scores &gt; 3.2.</description>

        <description>The HAQ-DI assesses how well the patient is able to perform 8 activities: Dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. The patient answers 20 questions with 1 of 4 responses with the past week as the time frame: 0=without difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. The highest score for any question in a category determines the category score. The total score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled). A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>
