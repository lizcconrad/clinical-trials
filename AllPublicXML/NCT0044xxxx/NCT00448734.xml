    <textblock>
      This study will review the safety of picoplatin, a new type of platinum drug, with docetaxel,
      a drug commonly used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Patients who are eligible for this
      study will have had a diagnosis of hormone-refractory prostate cancer that has metastasized
      to other areas of the body, and have not been previously treated with chemotherapy drugs.
      Picoplatin will be administered in combination with docetaxel and prednisone to identify the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Patients will receive IV treatments of picoplatin with
      docetaxel every 3 weeks, with prednisone, 5 mg orally, twice daily.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Radiologic evidence of metastatic disease (Jewett-Whitmore Stages D1-D2 or TNM Stage
             N1-3 or M1).

          -  Disease progression or recurrence documented by either: increasing serum PSA on three
             consecutive measurements each obtained at least one week apart, or findings on
             radiographic imaging studies.

          -  Non-surgically castrate subjects must be receiving androgen ablation therapy as
             maintenance therapy.

          -  Adequate hormonal therapy as documented by a castrate level of serum testosterone (all
             subjects without surgical castration must have a serum testosterone less than 50
             ng/ml).

          -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed after the withdrawal of antiandrogens (6 weeks in
             the case of bicalutamide).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with cytotoxic agents (except estramustine), radioisotopes, or
             biological therapies other than hormones.

          -  Clinical evidence of brain or leptomeningeal metastases.

          -  Symptomatic peripheral neuropathy of Grade 2 or higher.

          -  History of another cancer within the preceding 5 years, except for superficial skin
             cancers.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to drugs formulated with Polysorbate 80.

          -  Prior radiotherapy that included ≥ 30% of the bone marrow (e.g., the whole of the
             pelvis or half of the spine).

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness (e.g., active infection).

          -  Serious medical or psychiatric illness that could potentially interfere with the
             completion of the study treatment according to this protocol.

          -  History of serious cardiac disease, defined as myocardial infarction within six months
             of enrollment, congestive heart failure classified by the New York Heart Association
             as Class III or IV, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, poorly controlled or unstable
             angina, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia.
