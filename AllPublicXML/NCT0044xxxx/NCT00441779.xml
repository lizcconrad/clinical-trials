  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood transfusions are frequently necessary in situations in which there is a large amount of
      blood loss. In some individuals who receive a blood transfusion, white blood cells from the
      donor's blood may remain in the body for years, a condition known as microchimerism. This
      study will evaluate the occurrence of microchimerism among the following three groups of
      individuals who previously received transfusions: 1) individuals with traumatic injuries; 2)
      individuals with burn injuries; and 3) individuals who underwent elective orthopedic
      operations.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 10% to 15% of injured patients who receive blood transfusions experience a
      condition known as transfusion-associated microchimerism. This occurs when white blood cells,
      or leukocytes, from the donor's blood persist in the recipient long after the transfusion
      occurs. The genetically distinct donor cells can remain in the individual for decades, and
      may account for as many as 4% of the white blood cells in the recipient's body. This suggests
      that the donor cells are tolerated by the recipient's immune system. The purpose of this
      study is to compare the incidence of microchimerism among individuals with three different
      types of injuries: 1) traumatic injuries; 2) thermal, or burn, injuries; and 3) injuries
      resulting from elective orthopedic surgical procedures.

      In this study, blood samples will be collected from individuals who were treated for
      traumatic injury, thermal injury, or elective orthopedic surgical procedures at the
      University of California at Davis Medical Center. Individuals who were treated from 2000 to
      2003 and received a blood transfusion, as well as a control group of individuals who did not
      receive a transfusion, will be approached to enroll in the study. Individuals who agree to
      participate will have their blood analyzed for evidence of microchimerism. Information on
      health status, injury characteristics, hospital care, blood transfusion details, and blood
      donor characteristics will be collected from all participants.

    A separate study (similar subjects) identified transfusion-associated microchimerism only
    rarely, making this observational study impractical to conduct.
