    <textblock>
      A multicentre, prospective, open label study of acromegalic patients evaluating the efficacy
      and safety of different dose-intervals of Lanreotide Autogel 120mg according to international
      standards and compared to previous treatment with Octreotide LAR 10, 20 or 30 mg.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Six repeated applications of Lanreotide Autogel 120mg administered every 28, 42 or 56 days.
      For the first three injections, the interval depends on the Octreotide LAR dosage
      administered previously. The dose interval is titrated after injection 3 depending on the
      efficacy of the therapy with Lanreotide Autogel

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must give written (personally signed and dated) informed consent before
             completing any study-related procedure.

          -  The patient must have a documented diagnosis of active acromegaly and be adequately
             treated with a stable dose (10, 20 or 30 mg) of Octreotide LAR for at least 6 months
             immediately prior to study entry. A documented diagnosis of active acromegaly is
             defined as IGF-1 more than 30% higher than two Standard Deviations ( +2 SD) above the
             normal age and sex adjusted value (see Appendix 6) or GH level after OGTT (Oral
             Glucose Tolerance Test) &gt; 2ng/mL while not under drug treatment for acromegaly. For
             patients having undergone surgery or radiotherapy, this diagnosis must have been
             performed after the most recent surgical or radiation treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has had pituitary surgery (adenomectomy) within 6 months prior to study
             entry

          -  The patient has received stereotactic (LINAC, Gamma Knife) radiotherapy for acromegaly
             within three years or conventional radiotherapy for acromegaly within five years prior
             to study entry
