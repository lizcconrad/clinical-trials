      To determine whether certain alleles or haplotypes of major histocompatibility complex gene
      are associated with AIP in Korean population, we undertook this study with high-resolution
      typing for HLA (sequence-based typing).

      Primary outcomes: detection of novel allele associated with AIP in Korean population
      Secondary outcomes: detection of genetic factor for relapse of AIP during steroid treatment

      Autoimmune chronic pancreatitis (AIP) can be defined as a chronic inflammation of the
      pancreas due to an autoimmune mechanism; autoimmunity is responsible for producing the
      pancreatic lesion. AIP is a distinctive type of chronic pancreatitis that shows reversible
      improvement of pancreatic morphology and function with oral steroid therapy, in comparison to
      other types of chronic pancreatitis which hardly respond to various treatments. AIP is
      increasingly being recognized to be a worldwide entity. The sudden increment in cases
      reported probably reflects the growing awareness of the entity, rather than a rise in the
      true incidence. In previous Japanese report, HLA DRB1*0405-DQB*0401 haplotype may be
      associated with autoimmune pancreatitis in the Japanese population. However, to date there
      was no subsequent data for supporting these results. In addition, this Japanese study had a
      limitation in methodology by using a low-resolution typing for HLA. Although this entity is
      well responsive to steroid therapy, relapse of AIP during steroid treatment is not uncommon.
      Unfortunately, there has been no laboratory or genetic predictor for responsiveness to
      steroid therapy in patients with AIP. To further clarify and confirm high-risk and protective
      genotypes for autoimmune diseases, therefore, high-resolution typing for HLA should be
      needed. Thus, to determine whether certain alleles or haplotypes of major histocompatibility
      complex gene are associated with AIP in Korean population, we undertook this study with
      high-resolution typing for HLA (sequence-based typing).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with autoimmune pancreatitis

          -  The diagnosis is mainly based on the following three characteristic findings proposed
             by Japan Pancreas Society in 2002: (1)Imaging studies: irregular narrowing of the main
             pancreatic duct and diffuse enlargement of the pancreas, (2) Laboratory data: elevated
             serum IgG or the presence of autoantibodies, (3) Histological examinations: fibrotic
             changes with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the pancreatic tissue.

          -  Age 18 years and above

          -  No serious medical or psychological condition that would preclude study treatment

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory
             tests, and other study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age below 18 years

          -  Pregnancy
