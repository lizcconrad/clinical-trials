  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a case management linkage
      intervention designed to increase utilization of oral health care services among HIV+
      individuals enrolled in HIV primary care that have not seen a dental provider in the
      preceding twelve months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent national studies demonstrate that oral health is one of the highest unmet health needs
      for HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals, although it is recognized as playing a less critical
      role in the medical management of HIV/AIDS. Social and economic factors have contributed to
      less than optimal use of oral health services for HIV+s in the United States. According to
      recent data, from Miami-Dade County, Florida, only 24% of HIV+s served by Ryan White-funded
      medical clinics had obtained oral health services in the past 12 months.

      To address the underutilization of oral health care services, we propose to develop,
      implement, and evaluate an intervention to assist low-income HIV+s in obtaining access to
      oral health services as well as increase appropriate utilization of these services. The case
      management intervention is adapted from an intervention that had been previously tested in a
      CDC-funded, multi-site study designed to link recently diagnosed HIV+s to primary medical
      care.

      A two-arm randomized trial among HIV+ individuals who are currently enrolled in HIV primary
      medical care, but not receiving oral health care, will be conducted to test the intervention.
      The two arms will consist of a case management intervention and standard-of-care.
      Participants will be assessed at baseline and at 6, 12 and 18 months after baseline to
      document their utilization of oral health services. An interdisciplinary team of behavioral
      and clinical research scientists with experience in developing and evaluating health care and
      prevention intervention targeting low income, HIV+s will conduct this research.

    <description>The intervention represents a brief, &quot;real world&quot; intervention that could easily be adopted by HIV care clinics to facilitate linkage and increase use of oral services by their HIV+ patients (if shown to be effective). We are seeking to compare this intervention to usual practice in these clinics.</description>
