  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of escalating doses
      of EC0225 in patients with refractory or metastatic tumors who have exhausted standard
      therapeutic options.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, dose escalation study of EC0225 administered by intravenous bolus (IV)
      during weeks 1 and 3 of a 4-week cycle to patients with refractory or metastatic cancer who
      have exhausted standard therapeutic options. EC0225 is a drug that is specifically designed
      to enter cells via a folate vitamin receptor. Experimental evidence shows that the target
      receptor is over-expressed in many human cancers. There are no previous human studies of
      EC0225; however, lab research (research in test tubes or animals) using EC0225 has shown
      activity against tumors in animals. This activity in animal models suggests that EC0225 may
      be useful as chemotherapy against human cancers. The primary objective of this study is to
      determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of EC0225 given by intravenous bolus. The
      efficacy of treatment will also be measured.
