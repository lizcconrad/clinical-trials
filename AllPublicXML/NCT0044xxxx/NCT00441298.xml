      This phase IIb, two-arm, double-blinded, randomised, placebo controlled trial comparing 1%
      Tenofovir gel with a placebo gel is an expanded safety and effectiveness trial involving 900
      young women at risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection. Participants will be provided with
      a supply of single-use, pre-filled applicators according to their randomisation. While in the
      study, participants will be asked to apply a first dose of the assigned study gel within 12
      hours prior to coitus and insert a second dose as soon as possible within 12 hours after
      coitus. All participants will receive HIV risk reduction counselling, condoms, and syndromic
      treatment of sexually transmitted infections, if required.

      Purpose: To assess the safety and effectiveness of tenofovir gel, a candidate vaginal
      microbicide, in sexually active women at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      infection in South Africa.

      Design: Phase IIb, two-arm, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial comparing 1% tenofovir
      gel with a placebo gel.

      Study Population: Sexually active, HIV-uninfected women aged 18 to 40 years in South Africa

      Study Size: 900 women

      Treatment Regimen: Participants will be provided with a supply of single-use, pre-filled
      applicators according to their randomisation. While in the study, participants will be asked
      to apply a first dose of the assigned study product, 1% tenofovir gel or placebo gel, within
      12 hours prior to coitus and insert a second dose as soon as possible within 12 hours after
      coitus. They will be advised to use only two doses of gel in a 24-hour period.

      Study Duration: Approximately 30 months in total. Accrual will require approximately 14
      months and follow-up will continue until 92 incident HIV infections are observed in the
      study, which is expected to occur approximately 16 months after the end of the accrual
      period.

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a candidate vaginal microbicide, tenofovir gel,
      when applied intravaginally by women, in preventing sexually transmitted HIV infection.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the impact, if any, of tenofovir gel on the incidence rate of deep epithelial
           disruption

        -  To assess the impact, if any, of tenofovir gel on viral load in women who become
           infected with HIV during the trial.

        -  To assess tenofovir resistance in HIV seroconvertors in the trial

        -  To ascertain the impact, if any, of tenofovir gel on pregnancy rates and outcomes

        -  To assess the impact, if any, of product hold at study exit on HIV infection and
           tenofovir resistance

      Ancillary Objective

      â€¢To assess the impact, if any, of tenofovir gel in preventing sexually transmitted
      infections, including herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and human papillomavirus (HPV)
      infections.

        -  CAPRISA Vulindlela Clinical Research Site, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
