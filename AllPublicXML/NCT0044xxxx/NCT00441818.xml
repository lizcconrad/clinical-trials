  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a lymphoid malignancy that accounts for approximately 7,000 to
      8,000 new cancer cases per year in the United Sates. It occurs with a bimodal age-incidence
      distribution peaking in the 15- to 30-year old and 50- to 60-year old age groups. The
      pathological hallmark of the disease is the presence of malignant Reed Sternberg (RS) cells.
      Reed-Sternberg cells are interspersed among a heterogeneous population of non-malignant
      reactive cells, including T cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, B lymphocytes, plasma cells,
      histiocytes, fibroblasts, and stromal cells.

      While more than 80% of patients will respond to initial radiotherapy or combination
      chemoradiotherapy, some patients will experience early relapse after initial therapy or be
      refractory to first-line therapy. These patients may be treated with second-line therapy,
      which may include autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Patients with HL who relapse
      after first- and second-line therapy, or who are refractory to therapy, with or without
      autologous BMT, have a poor prognosis. The long-term event-free survival rate in this patient
      group is less than 10%; median survival is 16 months. At present, these patients have no
      treatment options other than investigational therapies.
