  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non randomized crossover trial investigating whether changing the pattern of
      bicarbonate administration during hemodialysis will result in the more efficient filtration
      of highly protein bound solutes. The experimental group will be dialyzed with low bicarbonate
      dialysate for the first half of dialysis then switched over to normal bicarbonate dialysate
      for the second half. The control group will be dialyzed entirely with normal bicarbonate
      dialysate. The two groups will switch one week late and patients will serve as their own
      matched controls for a completely standard dialysis and one that is split into two halves
      with different bicarbonate concentrations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will try to perform dialysis with a low bicarbonate bath which will leave
      patients blood pH (Hydrogen ion concentration) relatively unchanged then switch to a normal
      bicarbonate bath during the second half of dialysis so that they attain the pH (Hydrogen ion
      concentration) they normally would. Investigators will use these measurements to test test
      the hypothesis that Indoxyl Sulfate (IS) binds to proteins with greater affinity under basic
      conditions and further to test the hypothesis that it is possible to remove a greater amount
      of Indoxyl Sulfate (IS) when patients are maintained relatively acidotic during dialysis for
      a longer period of time due to the greater availability of free IS that can pass through the
      dialyzer.
