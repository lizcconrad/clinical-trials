  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are investigating whether slow administration of carbetocin is tolerated by
      patients better than if it is administered quickly, with respect to side effects such as
      headache, nausea, vomiting and facial flushing.

      Patients undergoing elective cesarean under spinal are included in the study. These patients
      are treated with carbetocin to reduce blood loss from the lining of the womb after delivery
      of the baby. The study is a randomised double blind controlled trial with 2 groups. One group
      will receive carbetocin quickly, the second group will receive carbetocin slowly. The
      investigators will compare the difference between groups with respect to side effects and the
      effect of carbetocin on the cardiovascular system.
