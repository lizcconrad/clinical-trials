  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase II study of BI 695501 to assess handling experience of patients
      with Rheumatoid Arthritis using an autoinjector. The extension phase is to provide patients
      with additional exposure to BI 695501 and to enhance the safety database for this compound.

    <measure>Autoinjector Assessment Period: Percentage of Successful Self-injections as Reported in the Questionnaires Completed by Both the Trial Site Personnel and the Patient Analysing All Self-injections</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 50.</time_frame>
    <description>All self-injections occurring after the training self-injection up to the End of Trial (EoT) visit were analyzed. Successful self-injections were based on the response to Question 2 on the questionnaire, which queried whether the full content of the autoinjector was injected into the body. An injection was considered successful when both the patient and the qualified trial site personnel responded yes to the Question 2 on their respective questionnaires. If they responded no to Question 2, patients and trial site personnel were instructed to also answer Question 3, which asked what prevented the patient for injecting the full contents of the autoinjector.
Percentage of injections calculated relative to the total number of first injections.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Any Autoinjector Handling Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 50.</time_frame>
    <description>An autoinjector handling event included any one of the following events which prevented the patient from successfully self-injecting the full content of the autoinjector and which occurred after the training self-injection up to the EoT Visit: removing the cap of the autoinjector (3a); pressing the injection button of the autoinjector (3b); or holding the autoinjector down against the skin until the injection is completed (3c).
Percentage of injections was calculated relative to the total number of injections (both unsuccessful and successful).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Percentage of Patients With Local Injection Site Reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 17 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Qualified trial site personnel contacted the patient 48 hours after each self-injection during the autoinjector assessment period to collect all Adverse Events (AEs), including injection-site reactions. Data is reported as Treatment-Emergent AEs (TEAEs), defined as AEs that started or worsened on or after the first dose of trial medication during the treatment period and prior to the last date of trial medication during treatment period + 10 weeks (70 days) inclusive. The autoinjector assessment period started on the first autoinjector administration date (Day 1 visit) and ended on Day 50 visit date (included). If a TEAE occurred in the 10 weeks after the last autoinjector administration but prior to the first injection during the extension phase, it was to be accounted for in the autoinjector assessment period.
Percentage of subjects calculated relative to the total number of subjects in the analysis set.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Percentage of Patients With Drug-related Adverse Events Per Investigator Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 17 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment-related TEAE was defined as any TEAE assessed by the investigator as related to the trial medication. Data is reported for the autoinjector assessment period. TEAEs were defined as AEs that started or worsened on or after the first dose of trial medication during the treatment period and prior to the last date of trial medication during treatment period + 10 weeks (70 days) inclusive. The autoinjector assessment period started on the first autoinjector administration date (Day 1 visit) and ended on Day 50 visit date (included). If a TEAE occurred in the 10 weeks after the last autoinjector administration but prior to the first injection during the extension phase, it was to be accounted for in the autoinjector assessment period.</description>

        <title>Autoinjector Assessment Period: Percentage of Successful Self-injections as Reported in the Questionnaires Completed by Both the Trial Site Personnel and the Patient Analysing All Self-injections</title>
        <description>All self-injections occurring after the training self-injection up to the End of Trial (EoT) visit were analyzed. Successful self-injections were based on the response to Question 2 on the questionnaire, which queried whether the full content of the autoinjector was injected into the body. An injection was considered successful when both the patient and the qualified trial site personnel responded yes to the Question 2 on their respective questionnaires. If they responded no to Question 2, patients and trial site personnel were instructed to also answer Question 3, which asked what prevented the patient for injecting the full contents of the autoinjector.
Percentage of injections calculated relative to the total number of first injections.</description>

          <title>Autoinjector Assessment Period: Percentage of Successful Self-injections as Reported in the Questionnaires Completed by Both the Trial Site Personnel and the Patient Analysing All Self-injections</title>
          <description>All self-injections occurring after the training self-injection up to the End of Trial (EoT) visit were analyzed. Successful self-injections were based on the response to Question 2 on the questionnaire, which queried whether the full content of the autoinjector was injected into the body. An injection was considered successful when both the patient and the qualified trial site personnel responded yes to the Question 2 on their respective questionnaires. If they responded no to Question 2, patients and trial site personnel were instructed to also answer Question 3, which asked what prevented the patient for injecting the full contents of the autoinjector.

        <description>Qualified trial site personnel contacted the patient 48 hours after each self-injection during the autoinjector assessment period to collect all Adverse Events (AEs), including injection-site reactions. Data is reported as Treatment-Emergent AEs (TEAEs), defined as AEs that started or worsened on or after the first dose of trial medication during the treatment period and prior to the last date of trial medication during treatment period + 10 weeks (70 days) inclusive. The autoinjector assessment period started on the first autoinjector administration date (Day 1 visit) and ended on Day 50 visit date (included). If a TEAE occurred in the 10 weeks after the last autoinjector administration but prior to the first injection during the extension phase, it was to be accounted for in the autoinjector assessment period.
