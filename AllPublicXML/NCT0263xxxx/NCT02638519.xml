  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves imaging participants' brains using MRI. The goal is to develop a
      high-resolution, high-sensitivity imaging tool, hyperpolarized xenon functional brain
      magnetic resonance imaging, which can provide more sensitive measurement of brain function,
      facilitating the development of drugs for more successful treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The described study is a pilot study in which the investigators aim to develop an enhanced
      sensitivity tool for assessment of neural function. Participation involves at least two study
      visits no longer than three hours in length each. During visit 1, informed consent and
      screening for eligibility will take place. During visit 2, fMRI scanning will take place in
      which participants will complete simple tasks. Two types of MRI scans will be performed:
      traditional proton fMRI and hyperpolarized xenon-129 fMRI (HP 129Xe fMRI) scans. The trade
      name for xenon-129 hyperpolarized with a Xemed LLC polarizer is NeuroXene.

      Participants will be placed in the 3T MRI at the Thunder Bay Regional Research Institute with
      a Clinical MR Solutions (CMRS) Dual Brain Coil that fits over their head like a helmet.
      Several inhalation procedures will be performed by participants when breathing NeuroXene from
      a tube in the scanner. Preparation and administration of NeuroXene and the CMRS Dual Brain
      Coil will be carried out according to the SOP's developed by the TBRRI and Xemed LLC.

      MRI scanning will be performed with a MR Tech and Registered Respiratory Therapist present.
      Dispensing of 129Xe will be monitored using a gas dispensing form and a drug accountability
      log. This study will have a monitor assigned to it from the TBRRI that is not involved in
      this clinical trial. This is to ensure participant safety and adherence to the protocol.

    <description>Healthy volunteers will inhale NeuroXene using various breathing methods. The CMRS 1H-129Xe dual-tuned quadrature head coil will be used to acquire MRI images of the human brain after inhalation of NeuroXene. The coil permits the acquisition of both conventional proton and HP xenon gas images. Two types of MRI scans will be performed: Traditional proton fMRI and Hyperpolarized Xenon-129 fMRI. The order of scans will be randomized to account for bias caused by scan order.</description>
