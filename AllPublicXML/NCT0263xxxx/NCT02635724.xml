  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and effectiveness of a single dose of
      600 mg IV peramivir in the treatment of elderly subjects with acute uncomplicated influenza
      infection and in subjects with acute uncomplicated influenza infection at higher risk for
      influenza complications. All subjects will receive IV peramivir.
