    <textblock>
      First Sense Medical®, LLC is a medical device company developing a novel breast cancer
      screening tester called the First Sense Breast Exam® Tester. This radiation free tester is
      being developed to produce data which will be analyzed by Therma-Scan Reference Laboratory.
      When the tester is in production, a test will take approximately 7 minutes and will be
      performed in a doctor's office.

      This study is designed to evaluate the First Sense Breast Exam® test and the analysis by
      Therma-Scan. The First Sense Breast Exam® test is an adjunct to a mammogram. Currently,
      mammography is the standard of care in screening for breast cancer, and manual thermology is
      an adjunctive screening method. All of the study costs will be incurred by the sponsor and
      the subject will incur no costs to participate in the study. The First Sense Tester is a
      non-significant risk device where the tester's imaging camera makes no contact with the
      subjects during the entire procedure.
