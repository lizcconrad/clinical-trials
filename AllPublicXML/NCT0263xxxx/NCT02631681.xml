      Exercise intervention for men with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to investigate the effects of patient education and exercise
      intervention implemented in daily clinical practice for men with prostate cancer on androgen
      deprivation therapy

        -  Functional capacity

        -  Quality of life

        -  Body composition

        -  Blood pressure

      and to assess safety of progressive resistance training for participants with bone
      metastases.
