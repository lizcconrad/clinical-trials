    <textblock>
      The Contraceptive Choice Center will use an innovative-model of contraceptive care which was
      developed as a part of the Contraceptive CHOICE Project (CHOICE). This delivery model will
      deliver high-quality family planning services for women and reduce unintended pregnancies and
      births. This intervention will result in improved health for women, improved health care, and
      reduced costs to Medicaid.

      The Center will provide care to women ages 14-45 years of age.

      The Center will provide high-quality contraceptive care using the innovative model of the
      Contraceptive CHOICE Project. Specifically, the model will provide the following components:
      1) Structured, evidence-based contraceptive counseling; 2) education of providers about
      long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods and evidence-based guidelines for
      contraceptive provision; 3) removal of patient barriers to family planning services; and 4)
      post-visit contraceptive support. The model addresses the barriers to contraceptive uptake.
