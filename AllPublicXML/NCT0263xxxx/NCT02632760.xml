  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative anaemia is common (â‰ˆ30%) in patients awaiting cardiac surgery, and is associated
      with increased complications, ICU and hospital stay, and mortality. The extent of anaemia is
      worsened by haemodilution occurring with cardiopulmonary bypass and surgical bleeding
      (average blood loss 0.5-1.5 litres), which in turn impair end-organ blood flow and tissue
      oxygen delivery. Further, the need for blood transfusion is greatly increased in anaemic
      patients, and is associated with poor outcomes. In addition, blood transfusions are costly
      (&gt;$700 per unit), with around 50% of all transfusions used in surgery being for cardiac
      surgery. The investigators have identified high rates of bleeding complications and
      transfusion requirements in Australian cardiac surgery; and in another international
      collaboration, it was found that anaemia, transfusion and kidney injury are inter-related
      after cardiac surgery. After risk-adjustment, the combination of these three risk factors was
      associated with a 3.5-fold (95% CI 2.3-5.2) increased odds of kidney injury.

      Both anaemia and red cell transfusion are independent risk factors in major surgery. Some of
      the investigators reviewed Australian cardiac surgery patients from six Victorian hospitals,
      2005-2011. We linked the ANZ Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons cardiac surgery database to
      laboratory data, including preoperative haemoglobin and all issued blood products (manuscript
      in preparation). Anaemia was defined according to the WHO definition (Hb &lt;130 g/L for males
      and &lt;120 g/L for females). There were 15,948 cardiac surgery patients available for inclusion
      in the analysis, of which 28% were anaemic. Anaemic patients were more likely to receive a
      red cell transfusion (71% vs. 40%, p&lt;0.001), more transfused units of blood (median 4 [IQR
      2-8] vs. 3 [2-5], p&lt;0.001), and had higher 30-day mortality (5.4% vs. 1.9%, p&lt;0.001), new
      renal failure (43% vs. 26%, p&lt;0.001), and longer hospital stay in survivors (13 days [8-23]
      vs. 8 days [6-14], p&lt;0.001). After multivariable adjustment, preoperative anaemia was an
      independent predictor of mortality (adj. OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.14-1.88, p=0.003). Similar results
      were obtained when restricted to elective surgery, but with hospital stay 9 days (7-17) vs. 7
      days (6-11), p&lt;0.001. Other large studies are consistent with this.

      The investigators have also analysed data for patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery
      from the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database
      (a validated outcomes registry from 211 hospitals worldwide). In 227,425 patients undergoing
      noncardiac surgery, and found that preoperative anaemia was associated with increased 30-day
      mortality (adj. OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.31-1.54) and morbidity (adj. OR 1.35, 1.30-1.40).

      Alfred hospital (Melbourne) transfusion data for 2012-14 (n=2,091) show that anaemic (27% of
      cohort) and non-anaemic cardiac surgical patients had intraoperative red cell transfusion
      rates of 31% and 14%, respectively; p&lt;0.01.

      Iron deficiency is the commonest cause of anaemia worldwide, and iron deficiency per se
      independently worsens outcomes after surgery. The traditional textbook definition of iron
      deficiency anaemia refers to depletion of the body's iron stores due to dietary deficiency or
      chronic blood loss - an absolute iron deficiency. Chronic disease and inflammation have a
      direct effect in the pathway of iron absorption and metabolism leading to a state of
      functional iron deficiency and anaemia. Specifically, the iron regulatory protein hepcidin is
      upregulated, blocking pathways of iron transport. This prevents iron absorption from the gut,
      further uptake by the reticuloendothelial system increases stores (ferritin), but
      distribution and transfer to the bone marrow is blocked. Consequently, despite normal or even
      increased body iron stores (with normal ferritin levels), these are artifactual, and a state
      of 'functional iron deficiency' exists. This is commonly seen in renal and cardiac disease
      and increasingly recognised as a cause for anaemia in the surgical patient. Importantly, IV
      iron has been shown to overcome this functional deficiency and correct anaemia.

      IV iron therapy is effective in treating anaemia in medical (heart failure, kidney disease),
      post-partum, and preoperative settings (orthopaedic surgery, colon cancer resection,
      hysterectomy, hip/knee joint replacement. Earlier IV iron preparations using high molecular
      weight dextran were associated with anaphylaxis due to pre-formed antibodies, but newer
      preparations are safer, enabling delivery of a full treatment dose in 15 mins, so iron can be
      administered safely and quickly in outpatients. It is now readily available in Australia and
      is PBS-listed. This gives patients the equivalent dose of 12 months of tablets in only 15
      mins.

      Iron deficiency is very common in patients having coronary artery surgery. It is highly
      plausible that anaemia correction will improve patient outcome following cardiac
      surgery.However, some data suggest that free iron mediates free radical production associated
      with organ damage or infection in surgery and this balance between effective anaemia
      correction and potential risk needs further research. A definitive large trial is needed to
      determine if IV iron safely, effectively, and promptly corrects preoperative anaemia, and
      thus reduces risk in cardiac surgery.

      The investigators undertook a Cochrane review of iron therapy to treat anaemia in adults
      including 4,745 participants in 21 trials. This found a trend for better haemoglobin levels
      with IV iron (MD 0.50 g/dL, 95% CI 0.73-0.27; six studies, N=769) but with considerable,
      unexplained heterogeneity. Differences in the proportion of participants requiring
      transfusion were imprecise (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66-1.06; 8 studies, N=1,315). Thus the current
      evidence base is sparse; few randomised trials have been done and these were too small -
      there remains considerable equipoise.

      Review of the literature on anaemia and iron therapy in cardiac surgery, which included 4
      small trials of IV iron. Overall, half of all cardiac surgery patients were anaemic before
      surgery. Preoperative anaemia was found to be independently associated with higher mortality
      and blood transfusion rate, as well as longer ICU and hospital stay. As also shown by others,
      preoperative haematocrit was a powerful independent predictor of mortality, renal failure and
      deep sternal wound infection. In adjusted analyses each 5 point decrease in preoperative
      haematocrit was associated with an 8% increased risk of death (OR, 1.08; p&lt;0.0003), a 22%
      increased risk of postoperative renal failure (OR, 1.22; p&lt;0.0001), and a 10% increased risk
      of deep sternal wound infection (OR, 1.10; p&lt;0.01). There is a need for a well-designed,
      pragmatic trial to assess the role of preoperative anaemia treatment using IV iron in
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
