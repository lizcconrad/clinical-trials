      There's a considerable controversy regarding the effectiveness of plantar orthoses in the
      treatment of flexible flat foot, despite being the most widely used treatment. Several
      studies tried to investigate the correction of the deformity using plantar orthoses, but
      there are few studies with a control group of people, not enough to compare the effectiveness
      of the treatment.

      A randomized, double-blind, parallel design clinical trial was conducted with two study
      groups. The sample consisted of 61 children, aged 3 and 4 years old, who were randomly
      assigned to each study group. One group (intervention group) received treatment with
      functional plantar orthotics, and the other group (control group) received treatment with
      placebo-type plantar orthotics, to use as a reference or comparison. Both groups were
      followed for a one-year period. Before delivering the treatment, all subjects underwent
      dorsoplantar radiography, repeated at the end of the treatment (after one year). Differences
      in the talus-calcaneus, tibionavicular and talus-first metatarsal angles were compared, pre
      and post-treatment of both study groups. Test analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed
      as a statistical test.
