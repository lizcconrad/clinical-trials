  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore the significance of Solute Carrier Family 1 Member 5 (SLC1A5) in the occurrence of
      esophageal cancer, by comparing the expression of SLC1A5 between esophageal cancer tissues
      and adjacent tissues.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an observational study. The investigators will aim to enroll 100 male and female
      adult patients (aged 18 years and over) of all ethnicities/races, who have been referred to
      the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University for esophageal cancer.

      The investigators will be using a standardized data collection form. This is an observational
      study in which standard of care will be practiced and the patients are not placed at
      additional risk from participating in this study. However, as the investigators are
      collecting data prospectively, all participants will sign consent. An attempt will be made to
      see if there is a correlation between the expression of SLC1A5 with esophageal cancer.

    <description>For immunohistochemistry assay： Briefly, the samples will be cut into slices, which will be stained with standard steps. Finally, three high power fields will be randomly selected from each slice and the average optical density (OD) will be measured in each field.</description>

    <measure>SLC1A5 expression detected by WesternBlot</measure>
    <time_frame>within one year (plus or minus 1 month) after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Western blot assay will be done by comparing the intensity of bands. To start with, xray film will be scanned on a flat-bed scanner. Then the grayscale image will be analyzed with software. Finally the Gray Value of each band will be obtained for analysis.</description>
