  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with esophageal cancer, treatment with curative intent can be given to medically
      fit patients without distant metastases. It may consist of chemoradiotherapy or surgery alone
      or in combination. Surgery in combination with chemotherapy is another option. For patients
      who are not medically fit for surgery or with unresectable invasion in adjacent structures
      the only alternative with curative intent is, with current knowledge, definitive
      chemoradiotherapy. In the current study the investigators aim to improve prognosis for
      patients not suitable for surgery. Patients receive treatment with conventional
      chemoradiotherapy (oxaliplatin, fluorouracil and radiotherapy) with the addition of a more
      recently developed drug, an antibody called cetuximab.

      Patients are treated with three cycles of oxaliplatin and fluorouracil 750 mg/m2/24 hours,
      day 1-5. Each cycle lasts for 21 days. Oxaliplatin is given with 130 mg/m2 in the first cycle
      and in cycle 2 and 3 which are administered concomitant with radiotherapy the dose is reduced
      to 85 mg/m2.

      A loading dose of cetuximab 400 mg/m2 is given one week before the start of radiotherapy, and
      thereafter 250 mg/m2 is given weekly during the course of radiotherapy.

      Concomitant with chemotherapy radiotherapy to a total dose of 50 Gy is given (2 Gy once daily
      in 25 fractions, 5 days a week) with a photon beam linear accelerator.

      After treatment patients are followed every 6 months for three years with clinical
      examination and a CT-scan.
