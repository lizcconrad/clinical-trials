  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate a novel stimulation protocol of repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of unifocal neocortical epilepsy,
      namely continuous thetaburst stimulation (cTBS). As this is a pilot study, the primary
      endpoint is on safety and tolerability of the treatment. However, information on clinical
      efficacy and mechanism of action will also be collected.

      1. Study design:

           This is an open label prospective pilot trial of continuous thetaburst stimulation
           (cTBS) in patients with unifocal neocortical epilepsy.

           The study comprises a 13-week period, consisting of 4 weeks baseline seizure frequency
           assessment, a one-week treatment period with baseline assessments on Monday (T0) and
           stimulation sessions from Tuesday to Friday (T1-T4), and an 8-week follow-up period with
           short-term assessments immediately after the final stimulation session on Friday
           afternoon (T4) and long-term assessments after 2 weeks (FU2) and 8 weeks (FU8).

        2. Objectives:

           The primary objective is to assess the feasibility, safety and tolerability of cTBS in
           refractory epilepsy patients. The secondary objectives are to assess the clinical
           efficacy and associated mechanism of action of cTBS in unifocal neocortical epilepsy.

        3. Rationale:

      An open label prospective design allows to make a first estimate on the safety, feasibility
      and tolerability of cTBS in refractory epilepsy patients. There are currently no reports
      available of cTBS performed in epilepsy patients. The ultimate aim is to assess clinical
      efficacy of cTBS with regard to seizure frequency, but a feasibility and safety study is a
      prerequisite in order to achieve this goal.

    <description>Cortical resting motor threshold is determined using single-pulse TMS over the primary motor cortex (M1) (ipsilateral to epileptogenic focus). Motor-evoked potential (MEP) is measured over the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) of the contralateral hand.

    <description>On 4 consecutive days patients receive 5 cTBS trains with a 10min intertrain-interval. One cTBS train consists of 600 pulses delivered in bursts at theta frequency (200ms) during 40s. Each burst comprises 3 pulses at 50Hz. Focal stimulation occurs over the epileptogenic focus (EF), perpendicular to the local gyral geometry, using online neuronavigation. Stimulation intensity is set relative to the resting motor threshold (rMT) determined at baseline (80% rMT). Stimulation intensity is further adjusted to the coil-cortex distance at the EF with the following formula: adjusted MT% (AdjMT) = rMT + 2,7*(DEF-DM1) [DEF = distance over EF; DM1 = distance over M1]. If rMT exceeds the capacity of the stimulator output, stimulation intensity is 100% of maximal stimulator output (MSO).</description>
