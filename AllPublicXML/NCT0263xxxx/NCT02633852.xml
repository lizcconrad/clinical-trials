      A 12-month, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Treat and Extend Regimen (TER) of
      Aflibercept (EYLEA) 2mg /0.05 ml as a Second Line Treatment for Diabetic Macular Edema - TADI

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicenter, single arm study. The study group will be composed of both type 1
      or 2 diabetes mellitus patients with centre involving DME. Patients with partial or
      incomplete response to first-line treatment of at least 4 monthly intravitreal injections and
      no longer than 12 months of treatment. Patients will get treatment to the study eye only
      (fellow eye will receive standat of care treatment)/ The study eye will receive intravitreal
      injection of aflibercept 2mg/0.05ml at enrolment (day 0). The next follow up visit will be 4
      weeks later. At any visit, if sub- or intra-retinal (or both) fluid is present the patient
      will receive intravitreal injection of aflibercept 2mg/0.05ml and treatment interval will
      remain 4 weeks. In case that there will not be resolution or improvement (define as decrease
      in central macular sub-field thickness of 10% or more from the previous visit or gain of one
      ETDRS line or more), the intravitreal injection of aflibercept will be discontinued after 6
      monthly injections and the patient will be followed every 4 weeks. If there will be worsening
      of 10% or more in macular thickness and/or loss of one EDTRS line or more of acuity following
      treatment discontinuation then injections will be resumed. In cases when there will be no
      sub- or intra-retinal fluid on OCT, a treat and extend regimen (TER) will be applied.
      Patients will receive injection of aflibercept 2mg/0.05ml, and the follow up interval will be
      extended by2 weeks. Maximal treatment interval will be 4 months. At any point where sub- or
      intra-retinal (or both) fluid will appear after the TER regimen was initiated, the interval
      between visits and treatments will be reduced back to previous interval which obtained a
      fluid free macula.The follow up period will be 52 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Ophthalmic Inclusion Criteria

          1. Incomplete response to previous intravitreal treatment, defined as remaining of sub or
             intraretinal (or both) fluid involving the fovea per OCT after at least 4 monthly
             intravitreal injections and no more than 12 months of treatment (maximum
             12intravitreal injections).

          2. Central macular sub-field thickness according to SD-OCT of at least 300 micron
             (Heidelberg Spectralis OCT or equivalent).

          3. Best corrected visual acuity in the study eye between 20/30 and 20/200, inclusive.

          4. Clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilatation to allow fundus imaging.

          5. Intraocular pressure (IOP) of 21 mmHg or less.

        General Inclusion Criteria

          1. Written informed consent

          2. Subjects of either gender, aged above 18 years with diabetic retinopathy.

          3. Women should be post-menopausal for at least 12 months prior to trial entry, or
             surgically sterile, or alternatively, use contraceptive.

          4. Ability to comply with study and follow-up procedures and return for all trial visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Ophthalmic Exclusion Criteria

          1. An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual
             acuity loss would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy,
             pigmentabnormalities, dense sub-foveal hard exudates).

          2. An ocular condition is present (other than diabetes) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of
             the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease,
             neovascular glaucoma, etc.).

          3. History of pan-retinal photocoagulation or focal laser treatment within three months
             prior to enrollment or anticipated need for pan-retinal photocoagulation in the six
             months following enrollment.

          4. History of intraocular surgery (including vitrectomy, cataract extraction, scleral
             buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior three months or anticipated within
             the next six months following enrollment.

        General Exclusion Criteria

          1. Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring
             dialysis or kidney transplant.

          2. A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in
             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular
             disease, and glycemic control).

          3. Any treatment with an investigational agent in the 60 days prior to trial entry for
             any condition.

          4. Known serious allergies to the fluorescein dye used in angiography (mild allergy
             amenable to treatment is allowable), or to the components of the aflibercept
             formulation.

          5. For women of child-bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become
             pregnant within the next 24 months.Women who are potential study participants should
             be questioned about the potential for pregnancy. Investigator judgment is used to
             determine when a pregnancy test is needed.

          6. Stroke or Myocardial infraction within 6 months of trial entry. -
