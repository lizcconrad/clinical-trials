    <textblock>
      Although education on neurophysiology of pain improves disability, there are limited effects
      in pain intensity. Hypnosis is an approach that has proven useful in pain intensity and
      psychosocial aspects in some chronic pain conditions, but there is insufficient evidence of
      its contribution in patients with chronic non specific low back pain. The aim of the study is
      to assess the efficacy of combining education on neurophysiology of pain and hypnosis in
      patients with chronic non specific low back pain in pain and disability outcomes.

      Introduction: Education on pain neurophysiology has beneficial effects on disability and
      psychosocial aspects in patients with non specific chronic low back pain. However, education
      has limited effects in pain. Hypnosis is an approach that has proven efficient in pain
      intensity and psychosocial aspects in some chronic pain conditions, but there is insufficient
      evidence of its contribution in patients with non specific chronic low back pain.

      Objectives: The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of combining education on
      neurophysiology of pain and hypnosis in patients with non specific chronic low back pain in
      pain and disability outcomes.

      Study design: randomized controlled trial with two arms and blinded evaluator. Local study:
      Interventions will be held at the Universidade Cidade de Sao Paulo (UNICID).

      Participants: One hundred patients with chronic non specific low back pain who are on the
      waiting list for physical therapy care at UNICID physical therapy clinic, interested and
      eligible for the study will be invited to participate.

      Intervention: Patients will be randomized to the education group about pain neurophysiology
      or to a group that combines education with hypnosis.

      Measurements: Clinical outcomes will be obtained after 2 weeks and 3 months after
      randomization. The primary outcome will be pain intensity (measured by the numerical pain
      scale) and general disability (measured by the Roland-Morris questionnaire). The secondary
      outcome will be catastrophic thoughts (measured by PCS-Brazil), specific disability (measured
      by the Patient-specific function scale) and global perceived effect (measured by the Global
      Perceived Effect scale).

      Limitations: Both the therapist and the patients will not be blinded to the intervention
      provided.

      Hypothesis: This is the first study that will provided results achieved by education about
      pain neurophysiology using hypnosis in patients with chronic non specific low back pain.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Numerical Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>It is a translated and adapted scale for the Portuguese language that assesses pain intensity levels perceived by patients through a 11-point scale (ranging from 0 to 10), with 0 being classified as &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 &quot;worst pain possible &quot;. Patients will be asked to mark the level of the average pain intensity and the more intense based on the last seven days.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire consists of 24 items describing everyday situations that patients may have difficulty in performing because of back pain. The greater the number of alternatives completed affirmatively, the greater the level of disability associated with lombar pain. Patients will be instructed to fill out the statements that actually describe their situation on the day of the interview. It`s tool was already translated and adapted for the Portuguese language.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks and 3 months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>PCS is used to assess negative thoughts related to dor54. It is a self-administered questionnaire with 13 items and 3 subscales: impotence, magnification and rumination. A 5-point scale is used for each item. The score of each item is summed to define each subscale score or total score which may range from 0 to 52 points. It`s tool was already translated and adapted for the Portuguese language.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Patient-Specific Functional Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks and 3 months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>We asked for the patient to identify up to 3 activities that are considered incapable of performing or presenting any difficulty. The measurement is made by Likert scale of 11 points for each activity, and the higher average score (ranging from 0 to 10 points) better is the patient's ability to make activity. It`s tool was already translated and adapted for the Portuguese language.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Perceived Effect Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks and 3 months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>It is a Likert scale of 11 points (ranging from -5 to +5) which compares the current state of the patient as the start of their symptoms. Positive scores are applied to patients who are better and negative scores apply to those who are worse off compared to the beginning of symptoms. The closer to the 5 means that the greater is the intensity perception. It`s tool was already translated and adapted for the Portuguese language.</description>
