  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test FOOTFIT and enhanced FOOTFIT+, home-based mobile health
      (mHealth) physical activity (PA) interventions for a minimally ambulatory, chronically-ill,
      population with leg ulcers. A highly sensitive clinically designed Bluetooth® enabled
      accelerometer and tracking device (BEAT) worn on the foot during a progressive and
      evidence-based non-exertive leg conditioning activities for lower leg function (CALF)
      captures minute foot movements and sends the data to a Smartphone. This six-week feasibility
      study will compare FOOTFIT to FOOTFIT+, with the added connectivity feature, to promote
      patient-provider communication, evaluate adherence to PA, and assess signals of efficacy on
      functional outcomes in a very low fitness population.

      FOOTFIT is a study of a lower leg conditioning mHealth intervention for patients with venous
      leg ulcers. The aims are to compare two versions, one of which is enhanced (FOOTFIT+), to
      determine which has the greatest impact on physical activity adherence, patient-provider
      communication, and leg function. FOOTFIT and FOOTFIT+ share three components: 1) a low-cost,
      tri-axial Bluetooth® enabled highly sensitive accelerometer and tracking device (BEAT) worn
      on the foot during, 2) phased conditioning activities for lower leg function (CALF) tracked
      by a, 3) Smartphone that captures signals from BEAT, provides motivational messages, CALF
      instruction, and automated feedback on progress. Forty patients will be targeted in this
      six-week study, 20 of which will receive FOOTFIT and 20 FOOTFIT+.
