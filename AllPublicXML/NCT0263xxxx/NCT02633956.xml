      This Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, with an
      open-label LTSE, will evaluate the effect of Obeticholic Acid, and the subsequent addition of
      statin therapy, on lipoprotein metabolism in subjects with NASH with fibrosis stage 1 to 4,
      but no evidence of hepatic decompensation.
