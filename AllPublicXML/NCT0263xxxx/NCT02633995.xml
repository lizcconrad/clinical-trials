  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of spinal anesthesia in pre-eclamptic pregnant woman is of considerable benefit, as
      these patients present particular hazards with general anaesthesia, such as concerns for
      rapid airway control and cerebral blood flow alterations during induction of general
      anaesthesia and intubation However, the incidence of hypotension is high during spinal
      anesthesia for Cesarean section and it may approach values up to 95 %.

      The parturient will be allocated into one of two equal groups (n=30), a severe preeclampsia
      group (A) and a normotensive group (B). All will receive colload (500 ml voluven) as a coload
      via wide bore (16 Gauge ) cannula within 5-10 minutes during induction of spinal anesthesia.
      Standard monitoring with electrocardiography, automated non-invasive arterial pressure (NIAP)
      measurement, and pulse oximetry will be performed. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), mean
      arterial pressure (MAP) and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) will be monitored. Baseline
      values will be recorded in the supine position. Central venous line will be inserted in
      severe preeclampsia group and central venous pressure will be measured every 10 minutes.

      Spinal anesthesia will be induced with a total of 10 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 25
      µg fentanyl (total volume 2.5 ml) at the L3-4 interspace in the sitting position then the
      patient will be returned immediately to the supine position with left lateral tilt.
