  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the effects of motor control
      exercises and standard exercises in the pain, incapacity and medicine intake of subjects with
      unspecific low-back pain.

    <textblock>
      Eighty-four subjects with unspecific low-back pain were randomly recruited for the present
      study. The subjects were randomly allocated into control group (who received one hour of
      standard physiotherapy exercises every days during ten days) or intervention group (who
      received one hour of control motor exercises every days during ten days). One month after
      finishing these ten days, patients should perform a home-based exercises program during two
      months (control group performed home-based standard physiotherapy exercises; intervention
      group performed home-based motor control exercises). Pain (visual analogic scale), incapacity
      index (Roland Morris questionnaire) and medicine intake (diary) were evaluated before the
      intervention, one month and three months after ending the first ten days of intervention.
