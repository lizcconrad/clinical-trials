  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the effect of HVPG-guided individualized therapy and
      non-HVPG guided traditional therapy in cirrhotic patients for secondary prophylaxis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled trial of Zelen-design. Patients randomly enter two
      treatment groups: 1) the HVPG group and 2) the non-HVPG group. Treatment allocation is by
      block randomization with an equal number for both groups. The results are concealed in opaque
      envelopes.After randomization, patients will have a second chance to decide if they want to
      stay in the current group.Patients can switch to another group according to their will. If
      they are in the HVPG groupï¼Œthey will receive HVPG measurement before treatment. If they are
      in the non-HVPG group, they start treatment without HVPG measurement and receive endoscopic
      treatment plus Carvedilol.The mortality rate and rebleeding rate will be analyzed.

    <description>Patients with an HVPG over 20mmHg will be suggested to receive transjugular intrahepatic portocaval shunt (TIPS) or surgical shunt operation.
Patients with an HVPG between 16 and 20mmHg can choose either endoscopic treatment or TIPS according their willingness and indication.
Patients with an HVPG below 16mmHg will be treated by endoscopy plus Carvedilol, until endoscopic treatment fails.</description>
