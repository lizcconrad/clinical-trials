      BACKGROUND: Individual approaches at the workplace might not be sufficient to control Work
      Related Musculoskeletal Diseases (WMSDs) since they are multifactorial and refractory cases
      might need an additional rehabilitation program.

      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate multifaceted intervention efficacy to manage the WMSDs.

      METHODS: A Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire was applied pre and post intervention to
      determine the efficacy of a multifaceted program, including ergonomics, exercise program and
      acupuncture/physical therapy exercises orientation at the workplace in 126 workers of a
      hearing-aid industry. Additionally, a self-perception survey (Likert scale) concerning
      absenteeism, quality of life and work ability helped to evaluate the program that lasts one
      year and ten months.

      The work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) have substantially increased worldwide from
      the 1980s In Brazil, MSDs are the leading cause of occupational diseases. The harm to society
      is enormous and justifies the study of methods to prevent them and / or reduce them. Many
      authors have evaluated isolated approaches to manage the problem, but as this is usually
      multifactorial, a set of interventions could bring better results. Physiotherapy is a
      specialty that works to improve working conditions through ergonomic interventions, physical
      therapy treatments and gymnastics and thus contributes to prevention and treatment of these
      disorders. The objective of this study is: to determine the effect of this set of
      interventions on the quality of life of workers and the productivity of a company that has
      been evaluated in a previous study to this. The study population will consist of 185
      employees of a multinational company that manufactures and sells hearing aids in Brazil. Of
      those, 126 made up the experimental group (headquarter) and 59 control group (subsidiaries).
      Two questionnaires, one on musculoskeletal symptoms and another on risk factors at work are
      applied. An ergonomic evaluation of activities and tasks will be held, which will assist the
      diagnosis of situations which may be modified by ergonomic measures. Management of
      pre-existing complaints by acupuncture and orientation of specific exercises are used. The
      program's effectiveness analysis will be done by two methods: a questionnaire assessing the
      perception of workers about the their quality of life at work and the number of
      musculoskeletal complaints pre and post-intervention.
