  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study comparing two methods of dressing a post operative wound that are currently
      in practice. One method is a traditional dry gauze dressing. The other method is using a
      negative pressure dressing that provides gentle suction on the wound.

      The investigators will attempt to determine how well the use of post-operative negative
      pressure dressing reduces wound healing problems in patients who have surgery after radiation
      for a sarcoma in the thigh or leg.

      Postoperative surgical site infections pose a significant challenge to the orthopaedic
      oncologist, especially in wounds that have been previously irradiated with neo adjuvant
      external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). There are many studies demonstrating the relatively
      high risk of wound complications after lower extremity sarcoma resection. Published data
      suggest that these preoperatively radiated wounds have a postoperative infection rate of
      17%-44% with &quot;traditional&quot; dressings (e.g. dry gauze surgical dressings).

      A prospective series of 190 patients and showed a wound complication risk of 35% in
      preoperative irradiated wounds. The morbidity associated with wound complications can range
      from moderate (prolonged dressing changes) to severe (life or limb threatening infection).
      Patients who develop wound complications have been shown to longer hospitalizations and
      higher costs [ref]. Anatomic location of the tumor has been shown to be a risk factor for the
      development of wound complications with lower extremities being higher risk than upper
      extremities. There are several published studies examining the effect of negative pressure
      wound therapy (NPWT) on high risk surgical wounds. Abdominal wound complications can be
      reduced with the use of incisional NPWT. In the orthopaedic literature the use of negative
      pressure incisional dressings have been shown to lower the risk of wound complications in
      total hip arthroplasty, acetabular fractures, and extremity fractures.

      To our knowledge, there have not been any published studies on the utility of negative
      pressure wound therapy in previously irradiated soft tissue sarcoma wounds. The investigators
      feel that this high risk patient cohort could potentially benefit from reducing wound
      complications through NPWT and is an ideal population to study its effect.
