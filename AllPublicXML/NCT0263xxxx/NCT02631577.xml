    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of
      induction treatment consisting of atezolizumab in combination with obinutuzumab plus
      lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL), followed by
      maintenance treatment with atezolizumab plus obinutzumab plus lenalidomide in patients who
      achieve a complete response (CR), a partial response (PR), or stable disease at end of
      induction.
