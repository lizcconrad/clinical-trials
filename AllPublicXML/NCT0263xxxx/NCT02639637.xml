  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibition in
      diabetics affects hemodynamic parameters and sympathetic activation in the setting of
      increasing concentrations of neuropeptide Y, an endogenous peptide. The central hypothesis is
      that DPP4 inhibition decreases degradation of neuropeptide Y, resulting in increased
      vasoconstriction and sympathetic activation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitors are routinely used for the treatment of type II
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Since the prevalence of hypertension is 1.5-3 times greater in
      diabetics compared to sex-aged matched controls, the use of antihypertensives such as ACE
      inhibitors is also common in diabetics. DPP4 is involved in the degradation of multiple
      vasoactive peptides, one of which is neuropeptide Y. This peptide is thought to play a role
      in blood pressure regulation and sympathetic nervous system activation. The aim of this study
      is to investigate how DPP4 inhibition affects vasoconstriction in response to increasing
      neuropeptide Y concentrations. Additionally, the investigators want to understand how the
      combination of DPP4 inhibition and ACE inhibition affects vasoconstriction and sympathetic
      activation. Understanding the hemodynamic and neurohumoral changes associated with DPP4 and
      ACE inhibitors has important implications for the millions of patients with T2DM who take
      these drugs concurrently.
