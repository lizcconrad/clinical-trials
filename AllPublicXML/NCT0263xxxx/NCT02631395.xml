  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very little is known about the potential for preventing the prevalence of shoulder complaints
      in handball players, particularly younger players. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      effect of a shoulder training program on shoulder pain during a season of team handball.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Six teams, consisting of 13 to 25 players each, were randomized into two groups throughout
      their competition seasons. Three teams participated in a seven--month, three--times--a--week
      shoulder--muscle strength--training program while three teams participated in a comparable
      handball training program but did not conduct any specific upper--body strength training.
      Effects of this strength--training program were evaluated by comparing pre-- and
      post--training data from a survey on shoulder complaints based on a self--report
      questionnaire (quick DASH) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The players completed the VAS on
      pain once a month. In addition to that the players were tested in a maximum push up test,
      dynamometer test for internal and external rotation strength in the shoulder and throwing
      distance in the pre- and posttest.
