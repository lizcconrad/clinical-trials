      This research study is evaluating an immune modulatory agent as a possible treatment for
      patients with Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP) with significant disease involving
      the larynx, trachea, and/or lungs. The investigators will be using Pembrolizumab as the
      treating agent.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not
      approved Pembrolizumab for your specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody. Pembrolizumab is being studied in several
      other clinical trials to see if it has an effect in helping the immune system to recognize
      and eliminate abnormal cells in the body. The antibody blocks a receptor expressed on immune
      cells, called T cells, and by blocking this receptor it has the potential to activate the T
      cells to kill abnormal cells, such as virally infected cells.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking at whether Pembrolizumab can restore
      the natural ability of the immune system to recognize and eliminate Human papillomavirus
      (HPV)-infected cells from the body.

             qualify for the study.

          -  Recovery from effects of any major surgery or significant traumatic injury at least 28

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

             [qualitative] is detected).

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. --Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
