    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to
      determine the efficacy and effectiveness of Ca and vitamin D supplementation provided daily
      throughout Marine Corps recruit training on maintenance of PTH and indices of bone strength
      in Marine Corps recruits. The investigators hypothesize that Ca+D will prevent elevations in
      PTH and result in greater increases in indices of bone strength compared to placebo.

      Military recruits undergoing initial military training (IMT) are 17 times more likely to
      develop stress fractures compared to active duty service members. Up to 800 male and female
      recruits will be enrolled at the MCRD, Parris Island, SC over two seasons (summer/fall and
      winter/spring) in order to account for seasonal variation in vitamin D status. Ca (2000 mg/d)
      and vitamin D (1000 IU/d) will be supplied as either capsules or a fortified food product
      daily throughout training. This study will provide novel data for the military, medical and
      scientific communities regarding the relationship between Ca and vitamin D supplementation
      and biomarkers of immune function, and the requirements for calcium and vitamin D to support
      bone health during IMT.
