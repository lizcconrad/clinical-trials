  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study volunteers will be required to conduct a home pregnancy test (HPT) at the trial centre
      and provide a sample of urine from the same void for further testing.

      Volunteers will then complete a product usage questionnaire and leaflet comprehension
      questionnaire at site.

      Follow-up information will be required from all volunteers as both additional urine sample(s)
      and pregnancy information to establish true pregnancy status at the study visit.

      Eligible volunteers will be recruited into the study and provide informed consent. Volunteers
      will then test their urine sample with the investigational HPT according to the device
      Instructions for use and record their result onto the results sheet. A sample of urine from
      the same void will be obtained for further testing by the study technicians.

      The technician will then test the volunteer's sample with a second investigational HPT, a
      professional use pregnancy test and a Clearblue Digital HPT, the results of which will be
      used to provide the volunteer with her pregnancy test result. During technician testing, the
      volunteer will complete the device usability and leaflet comprehension questionnaires.

      At the end of the study visit, all volunteers will be provided with materials to allow
      follow-up for the determination of pregnancy status.

      The majority of volunteers will be requested to provide one additional urine sample,
      collected 2 days after the study visit. If early pregnancy is suspected the volunteer will be
      requested to provide an additional 7 daily urine samples following the study visit. All
      volunteers will be required to provide details of pregnancy status (documented menses or
      pregnancy confirmation by health care professional) after the study visit.

      True pregnancy status will be determined by laboratory tests and clinical information. The
      study will continue until a minimum of 300 pregnant and 300 not pregnant volunteers have
      completed the study.
