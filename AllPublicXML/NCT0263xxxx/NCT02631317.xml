    <textblock>
      PROMISE is a prospective, nationwide, multicenter, longitudinal cohort study, focusing on
      hospital intravenous thrombolysis process reengineering for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). With
      a proposed &quot;Reengineered Process Framework&quot; for intravenous thrombolysis process by the
      PROMISE study steering committee, about 30 medical centers enters would be recruited
      nationwide, and each center would include consecutive AIS patients with an onset-to-door time
      (ODT) of less than 3.5 h. The investigators hypothesize that the proposed &quot;Reengineered
      Process Framework&quot; is suitable and feasible for hospitals in mainland of China; the rate of
      intravenous rt-PA thrombolysis in ischemic stroke patients with an ODT of less than 3.5 h
      would be more than 20% or be increased by 40% as compared with baseline; the proportion of
      patients with a door-to-needle (DNT) time of less than 60 min would be more than 20%, or be
      with an increase by ≥ 40% as compared with baseline.

      1. After reviewing domestic and international clinical research literature, the PROMISE
           study steering committee constructed the &quot;Reengineered Process Framework&quot; for
           intravenous thrombolysis process with business process reengineering theory. The
           suggested &quot;Reengineered Process Framework&quot; is regarded as feasible and suitable for
           hospitals in mainland of China.

        2. The study period is 12 months, of which the first 3 months is the baseline period. After
           3 months, all centers should develop new thrombolytic processes according to the
           &quot;Reengineered Process Framework&quot;. The new processes are gradually implemented since the
           4th month with continues care quality improvements.

        3. The &quot;Reengineered Process Framework&quot; adopts a form of comprehensive package, proposes
           unified key points of process reengineering, provides a series of supporting,
           standardized tools for process management, and establishes a real-time key performance
           indicator (KPI) monitoring feedback system, etc.

        4. Supporting, standardized tools includes: rapid identification tools of suspected stroke
           for medical personnel in the emergency system; stroke team building programs; real-time
           feedback form of KPI; standardized thrombolysis informed consent form and informed
           conversation public service advertising posters; suggested indications and
           contraindications for intravenous thrombolysis; standard operation procedure of
           intravenous rt-PA thrombolysis, etc.

      With these methods, it is expected to raise the thrombolytic rate for patients arrived at
      medical center within 3.5 hours after the onset, and to shorten the door to needle time in
      China.
