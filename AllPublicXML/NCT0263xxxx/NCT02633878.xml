    <textblock>
      Threatened miscarriage is manifested by vaginal bleeding, with or without abdominal pain,
      while the cervix is closed and the fetus is viable and inside the uterine cavity.Threatened
      miscarriage is a common complication of pregnancy occurring in 20% of all clinically
      recognized pregnancies and about half of these will eventually result in pregnancy
      loss.Micronized progesterone which is used in a range of indications including infertility
      due to luteal insufﬁciency and threatened and habitual abortion, has a similar molecular
      structure and pharmacological effects to endogenous progesterone.Chinese Herbal Medicines is
      a part of Traditional Chinese Medicines and has been widely used for the treatment of
      miscarriage in China and other Asian countries for centuries.CHM have become very popular
      alternative to Western medicines and are commonly used as an alternative treatment for
      threatened miscarriage.Amongst all the causes for threatened miscarriage, &quot;Kidney Deficiency&quot;
      is the most important cause leading to threatened miscarriage and &quot;Shou Tai Pill&quot; is the most
      frequently used formula (72.0%) to treat threatened miscarriage.This basic formula is made up
      of four individual Chinese medicines, including Chinese Dodder Seed (Semen Cuscuta), Chinese
      Taxillus Twig (Flerlia Taxillus), Himalayan Teasel Root (Radix Dipsaci), and Donkey-hide Glue
      (Colla Corii Asini).Furthermore, supplementary of Common/Wingde Yan Rhizoma in the formula
      can enhance the therapeutic effects by further strengthening kidney of pregnant women.The
      goal of this double-bind, randomized and double dummy controlled trial is to determine which
      of the two oral medications, CHM or Micronized progesterone, and will mostly likely result in
      live birth in women with threatened miscarriage.
