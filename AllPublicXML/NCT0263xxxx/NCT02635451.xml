      To study the association between maternal serum vitamin C concentration in women with preterm
      premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and women without PPROM.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The micronutrient vitamin C is an effective water soluble antioxidant that scavenges several
      reactive oxygen species, thus reducing oxidative stress, It also acts as an enzymatic
      cofactor to the enzymes lysyl hydroxylase and prolyl hydroxylase, which is required for
      synthesis of hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, Collagen requires hydroxyproline bridges
      across the triple helix to provide stability to it, Ascorbic acid also causes down regulation
      of the metalloproteinase-2 and biosynthesis of collagen where it is required for the
      formation of triple helical structure of collagen. Thus, ascorbic acid participates in the
      equilibrium between synthesis and degradation of collagen and this may be critical in
      reducing the occurrence of preterm PROM.
