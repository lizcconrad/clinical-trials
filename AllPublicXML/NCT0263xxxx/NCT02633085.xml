    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a patient satisfaction preference of
      Fixed Bearing versus Mobile Bearing Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty (UKA) in patients who
      are at a minimum two years post operative. Patient reported outcomes and expectations will be
      analyzed along with all retrospective chart data in patient with a Fixed Bearing or a Mobile
      Bearing UKA in one or both knees.
