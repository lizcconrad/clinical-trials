      The purpose of this study is to validate the dosimetric parameters that correlate with acute
      hematologic toxicity (HT) in patients with rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy.

      The investigators' ongoing retrospective study investigated the clinical and dosimetric
      parameter (dosimetry of pelvic bone marrow) which relate with acute hematologic toxicity in
      patient with rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. In order to validate
      the dosimetric limitation of pelvic bone marrow in decreasing the intensity of HT, the
      investigators want to conduct a study to observe the acute HT without assigning any specific
      interventions to the subjects of the study, who will receive the standard treatment according
      to the multidisciplinary team's (MDT) decision and patient choice. Therefore, this study's
      type is observational.
