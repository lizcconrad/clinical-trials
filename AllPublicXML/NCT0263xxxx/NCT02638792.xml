  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine if an internet-based exposure therapy is more
      effective in reducing excessive worry amongst patients who suffer from this problem than is
      internet-based stress management training.

      Trial Objectives: Primary objective is to investigate whether an Internet-based exposure
      therapy can reduce the degree of excessive worry to a significantly greater extent than
      Internet-based stress-management training. The secondary objective is to a) investigate the
      cost-effectiveness of this treatment b) to study if any variables could moderate/mediate the
      treatment outcome, c) and to investigate the importance of sudden gains for the treatment
      outcome

      Trial Design: Randomized controlled trial with an active control and a waitlist control, who
      also will recieve treatment after the first group has finished.

      Duration: Ten weeks

      Primary Endpoint:

      Difference in worry symptoms between the treatment groups at week 10. Long term follow-up is
      also investigated (baseline to 4-months after treatment completion and baseline to 12-months
      after treatment completion).

      Efficacy Parameters: Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ)

      Safety Parameters: Adverse Events is assessed via the internet.

      Description of Trial Subjects: Patients &gt; 18 years old with a PSWQ score more than 56 points

      Number of Subjects: 300

    <description>The internet-based exposure therapy (I-ET) group receives a ten-week Internet-based CBT treatment, which is an extended version of the self-help book &quot;Sluta älta och grubbla med kognitiv beteendeterapi&quot; (How to quit worrying and ruminating with Cognitive behavior therapy) by licensed psychologist Olle Wadström (2007). The main focus of the book is to expose to the frightening word/image and refrain from using neutralizing thoughts. This is supposed to lead to the extinction of upsetting words/images.</description>
