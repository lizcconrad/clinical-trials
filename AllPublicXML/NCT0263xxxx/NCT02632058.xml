  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is the acoustic perception of sound without any physical source. It is estimated
      that 15-21% of adults develop a Tinnitus, which can cause serious distress and debilitation
      in all aspects of daily life of the affected.

      There is currently no evidence for a successful treatment of tinnitus. While one treatment
      approach involves sound-based therapies, e.g. tinnitus retraining therapy. The treatment
      aspect in our setting involved cognitive behavioural therapy.

      Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the ears or head unrelated to an external source
      [Nondahl 2011]. It is a common condition with a prevalence of 25.3% (approximately 50
      million) among adults in the United States and increasing with age, peaking at age 60 - 69
      years [Shargorodsky 2012] and above the age of 55 years respectively [Nondahl 2012]. Of
      individuals with tinnitus, 7.9% (approximately 16 million) experience frequent tinnitus which
      involves perception at least once daily [Shargorodsky 2012]. Prevalence of tinnitus in adults
      in Europe is described at a similar level with 21.2% [Hendrickx 2007]. In Switzerland
      prevalence for tinnitus in individuals over the age of 15 years is 20%; of these 13% report
      having a current tinnitus and 7% report of having had tinnitus in the past five years. [Bieri
      2012]. It has been shown that the 10-year cumulative incidence for tinnitus is 12.7% [Nondahl
      2010]. Gender seems to play a role in the predisposition for tinnitus; prevalence for men is
      26.1% and for women 24.6% [Shargorodsky 2012], while the incidence for men is 14.8% and for
      women 11.2% [Nondahl 2010]. There is indication that there is also a gender-related level of
      affliction related to tinnitus, so that women feel more distress [Seydel 2013] and emotional
      disturbance than men [Pajor 2012].

      It has also been shown for tinnitus to have a familial occurrence; subjects related to a
      sibling with tinnitus have a 1.7 times higher probability to have tinnitus than subjects from
      a family without tinnitus. [Hendrickx 2007]. Tinnitus perceived as severe has a prevalence of
      1.3% [Nondahl 2012].

      Risk factors for developing tinnitus are numerous and include conditions involving auditory
      function (i.e. hearing impairment, exposure to noise and history of ear surgery, head injury
      or otosclerosis), cardiovascular-related (i.e. cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular
      disease, obesity, current smoking, higher number of packyears smoked and history of heavy
      alcohol consumption) [Nondahl 2012].

      Tinnitus is also known to be associated with various complaints such as sleep disturbances,
      which are reported to be greater in elderly people [Hebert 2007], although there seems to be
      no difference between people suffering from insomnia with or without tinnitus, which was
      measured in a population of 38-62 year olds [Crönlein 2007]. Furthermore, tinnitus severity
      significantly correlates with depression and anxiety symptoms [Udupi 2013]. In addition,
      there is a higher incidence of somatoform disorders in individuals with tinnitus [Zirke
      2013]. Although the severity of tinnitus is associated with anxiety and depression, a
      causality cannot be concluded [Zöger 2006].

      Concerning treatment of tinnitus, tinnitus masking and tinnitus retraining therapy are two
      successfully applied methods. While both methods use counseling and acoustic stimulation for
      intervention, the main objective in tinnitus masking is to use wide-band noise applied
      through ear-level devices, in order to provide immediate relief from tinnitus [Henry 2006].
      Although both methods show remarkable improvement in ameliorating tinnitus, in comparison the
      effects of tinnitus retraining therapy improve progressively over time [Henry 2006]. The
      results of tinnitus retraining therapy also sustain over time [Forti 2009] and improve
      quality of life of those affected [Seydel 2014].

      In recent years there have been numerous publications implementing a therapeutic model based
      on cognitive behavioral therapy with a sound-focused tinnitus retraining therapy, proving its
      effectiveness and long-term effects [Herraiz 2005, Robinson 2008, Zenner 2012, Cima 2012],
      with long-term effects persisting 15 years after completion of the therapy-program [Goebbel
      2006]. Also, tinnitus retraining therapy carried out as a short-term therapy in an outpatient
      setting has also showed to be maintained over time [Mazurek 2009]. Apart from its therapeutic
      effectiveness tinnitus therapy based on cognitive therapy shows an increased
      cost-effectiveness compared to usual therapy [Maes 2014].

      In the tinnitus-clinic in Chur we have been treating patients with a modified
      tinnitus-retraining program based on cognitive therapy for a decade. Patients are either
      admitted by their general practitioner, Otolaryngologist or self-admitted. We offer capacity
      to treat nation-wide patients in an inpatient setting, for a modified tinnitus retraining
      therapy lasting four to six-weeks, depending on severity of comorbid factors. Up to date,
      there is no other clinic in Switzerland treating individuals in an inpatient setting to the
      likes of ours. Admitted patients usually have a long way of suffering with an unsuccessful
      search for enduring relief. With this study we intend to show an improvement in treatment of
      tinnitus based upon our model of modified tinnitus retraining therapy. If our therapeutic
      model is successful, many individuals could benefit from a substantial improvement in quality
      of life.

        The study population consists of patients suffering from chronic tinnitus referred to our
        clinic by their treating physician. There is a remarkable level of suffering from chronic
        tinnitus in these individuals. The participants received an established routine treatment
        as part of multimodal treatment at an inpatient psychiatric facility. Clinical experience
        shows that the applied treatment poses a low risk and demonstrates a great amount of
        benefit. At admission to our clinic all participants were of age and able to give their
        consent to treatment.
