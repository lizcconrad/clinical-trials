  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) the treatment goal is
      revascularization of the occluded artery with the use of primary percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI). There is a large subset of patients with STEMI who also have significant
      disease in arteries other than the site of occlusion, and away from the culprit artery. It is
      estimated that up to 50% have disease of more than 50% in the non-culprit arteries.

      The evidence on how to treat those patients with multi vessel disease is conflicting. Earlier
      large-scale studies and registries have suggested early and complete revascularization is of
      no benefit or even harmful. More recent studies have showed the opposite of that. The CVLPRIT
      study showed that early complete revascularization or preventive PCI reduced primary endpoint
      of a composite of all cause mortality, myocardial infarction and need for repeat
      revascularization. The benefit was mainly due to reduced repeat revascularization in the more
      intensive intervention group. The PRAMI study showed very similar results as well.

      The use of Fractional flow Reserve (FFR) in deciding complete revascularization has also
      showed conflicting results so far. A previous trial showed that FFR guided intervention post
      STEMI increased MACE. This was conflicted with more recent study, which showed FFR guided
      complete revascularization improved outcome when compared with more conservative treatment of
      ischaemia driven intervention.

      In this study, the investigators are going to assess the issue of staged revascularization
      guided by FFR or by angiogram, compared to the standard treatment of ischaemia driven
      revascularization

      To compare the clinical outcomes measured by composite of mortality, myocardial infarction
      and repeat revascularization by using FFR guided and angiographically guided
      revascularization to the standard strategy of ischaemia driven revascularization.

      Participants will be allocated to three arms, first conservative group of ischaemia guided
      PCI, second FFR guided PCI and third angiogram guided PCI where patients where patients with
      more than 50% lesion will undergo revascularization.
