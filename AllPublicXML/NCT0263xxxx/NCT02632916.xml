  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to acquire preliminary, pilot data over a 2-year period on the
      safety and efficacy of subcutaneous denosumab versus the current CHEO standard-of-care
      (intravenous zoledronic acid) for the treatment of osteoporosis in children. Both denosumab
      (1.0mg/kg) and zoledronic acid (0.025mg/kg) will be given as four doses separated by a six
      month interval (i.e. at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months), with follow-up to 2
      years.

    <time_frame>48 hours after each drug administration (48 hours post baseline and 48 hours post 6, 12 and 18 month visits)</time_frame>
    <description>To observe the changes in serum ionized calcium levels at 48 hours following the administration of denosumab versus zoledronic acid. Hypocalcemia at 48 hours has been chosen as the primary outcome since this is a clinically important side effect of both denosumab and zoledronic acid, and 48 hours is around the time of the anticipated calcium nadir</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject or subject's legally acceptable representative has provided informed consent.

          2. Children aged 4 to 16 years at the time of enrolment.

          3. Children with a history of clinically significant bone fragility in the preceding 24
             months, requiring the child to have ONE or more of the following clinical profiles:

               1. At least one low-trauma vertebral or long bone fracture in a child with an
                  underlying disease known to be associated with osteoporotic fractures (e.g.
                  glucocorticoid-treated diseases, Crohn's disease, rheumatic disorders, Duchenne
                  muscular dystrophy, other muscular dystrophies, spinal muscular atrophy, cerebral
                  palsy); OR

               2. At least one low-trauma vertebral or long bone fracture in the last 24 months, in
                  a child with a known genetic osteoporotic condition such as osteogenesis
                  imperfecta (confirmed on molecular genetic testing); OR

               3. At least one low-trauma vertebral or long bone fracture in the last 24 months, in
                  an otherwise healthy child with a diagnosis of osteoporosis confirmed on
                  trans-iliac bone biopsy. Trans-iliac bone biopsy is a requirement in this
                  sub-group as per the usual standard of care, as this is the only test that will
                  definitively confirm osteoporosis in an otherwise healthy child who does not have
                  a genetic bone fragility condition.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any child for whom the treating physician feels participation is not advised.

          2. Prior treatment with an osteoporosis agent (e.g. bisphosphonate).

          3. Renal insufficiency defined as an eGFR less than 60ml/min/1.73m2.

          4. Active or prior diagnosis of malignancy or undergoing investigations for a suspected
             childhood cancer.

          5. Currently breastfeeding or plans to breastfeed during the study.

          6. Pregnancy (verified by pre-treatment pregnancy test in all menstruating or sexually
             active females).

          7. Untreated vitamin D deficiency, defined as a serum 25OHD level &lt;50nmol/L.

          8. Untreated hypocalcemia, defined as a serum ionized calcium level &lt;1.1mmol/L.

          9. Active or historic eczema/cellulitis.

         10. Children planning dental procedures and/or dental surgery during the course of the
             study.

         11. Children with a documented history of atrial fibrillation.

         12. Children with asthma who are acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) sensitive.

         13. Children that have had parathyroid or thyroid surgery.

         14. Children who are allergic to rubber or latex.

         15. Males with a pregnant partner.
