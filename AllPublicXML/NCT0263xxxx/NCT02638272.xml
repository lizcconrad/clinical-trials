  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whether radical debridement is necessary for the treatment of thoracic and lumbar
      tuberculosis is still questionable. The objective of this prospective randomized study was to
      compare the outcomes of radical debridement versus no debridement under different surgical
      procedures for the treatment of thoracic and lumbar tuberculosis.

    <textblock>
      Seventy-four thoracic and lumbar tuberculosis patients with a neurological function of grade
      D and E underwent surgeries from January 2009 to January 2014. All patients were divided into
      group A and group B by taking the drawing of lots. In group A, radical debridement, bone
      graft and instrumentation were performed. In group B, isolated posterior instrumentation
      without debridement were performed in all cases and drainage of iliopsoas abscess via
      laparoscopy in 2 cases. The operative time, blood loss, visual analogue score (VAS),
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), kyphotic angle, Frankel grading, fusion rate and
      complications were evaluated.
