  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) among
      participants diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and pair-matched on exposure
      propensity scores for new use of any sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i)
      versus new use of various other antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs), combined as one group.

      This study will be an overall retrospective, observational, new-user cohort study using 4
      large administrative claims databases in the US. Participants diagnosed with T2DM and
      initiated on SGLT2i or other AHAs (metformin, sulfonylureas (SU), thiazolidinediones (TZDs),
      DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP4i), GLP-1 agonists, insulin, and other AHAs) between April 1, 2013 and
      the end of claims data availability will be included in the study and will be estimated for
      incidence rates of DKA in the different AHA new-user groups.
