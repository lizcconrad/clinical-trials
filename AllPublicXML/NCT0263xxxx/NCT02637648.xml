    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of sodium oxybate on headache response
      (frequency), sleep quality and quality of life in the prophylactic treatment of patients with
      chronic and episodic cluster headache. Oral sodium oxybate, 3-9g per night, starting with 3g
      in two nightly dosages of 1.5g and increased by steps of 1.5g every second or third night
      until treatment Response will be evaluated in an interventional, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, randomised, parallel group, multicentre study. Primary outcome is reduction of
      nocturnal pain frequency Secondary outcomes are improvement of sleep quality at a subjective
      level as assessed by diary and standardized scales (PSQI, FOSQ), duration of pain free
      episodes, general clinical outcome (global evaluation), clinical global impression (CGI-S,
      CGI-I, CGI-E), quality of life (SF 36) and daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Score).

      Multicenter study to test the safety and efficacy of sodium oxybate in the prophylaxis of
      headache and sleep disturbances in patients with chronic and episodic cluster headache using
      a placebo-controlled, double blind, randomized study, parallel group design. Patients with
      predominant nocturnal attacks and poor sleep quality will be evaluated; At least 1 attack
      every other day and at least 8 attacks cumulatively by the time prior to randomization are
      required. Sodium oxybate will be orally administered, 3-9g per night, starting with 3g in two
      nightly dosages of 1.5g (the first at bedtime and the second 4 hours later). Dosage will be
      gradually increased by steps of 1.5g every second night until treatment response during a
      titration period of 14 days. Effects od sodium oxybate will be monitored via pain and sleep
      diaries during a 14 days stable treatment phase by reviewing sleep/pain diaries and Quality
      of life assessement. Primary outcomes are frequency of nocturnal pain attacks; Main secondary
      outcomes are frequency, intensity and duration of daytime pain attacks, improvement of sleep
      quality, quality of life, duration and rates of pain free episodes, decrease in escape
      medication for acute headache attacks (use of triptans). Safety parameters are ECG,
      laboratory, depressions scales, vital signs, respiratory polygraphy. Intent-to treat
      analysis, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with depending variable (reduction of
      pain frequency and pain intensity of nocturnal attacks) and the co-variates (age, sex ,
      chronic vs. episodic CH).

             endocrine, neoplastic, gastrointestinal, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic,
             neurological, pulmonary, and/or renal disease which would place the patient at risk
             during the trial or compromise the objectives outlined in the protocol.

          7. Patients who are unable or unwilling to temporarily discontinue any unauthorized drugs
             or substances, in particular refrain from alcohol (see section non-authorized
