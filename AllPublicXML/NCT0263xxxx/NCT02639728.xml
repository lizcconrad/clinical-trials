  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of coffee have been shown to act as a colonic stimulant. Caffeinated coffee
      stimulates colonic activity, most notably in the transverse/descending colon, in magnitude
      similar to a meal, 60% stronger than water, and 23% stronger than decaffeinated coffee. [1]
      Moreover, the consumption of both water and caffeine causes a decrease in the rectal sensory
      threshold for the desire to defecate, while anal sphincter pressure after caffeine intake is
      significantly higher than after water intake. This may result in an earlier desire to
      defecate. [2] Coffee has also been shown to have an effect on defecation by increasing rectal
      tone by 45% (measured with a barostat) thirty minutes after consumption. [3]

      Study Objectives

      Primary objective: To determine if the use of coffee in the postoperative period will reduce
      time to recovery of GI function by at least one day in patients undergoing elective
      colorectal operations. (This will be assessed by twice daily interview of patients as to
      whether they have passed flatus or had a bowel movement)

      Secondary objective: To determine if the use of coffee in the postoperative period will
      reduce hospital length of stay by at least one day, and to also evaluate the tolerance of
      solid food, which will help determine postoperative ileus and rates of vomiting/nasogastric
      tube (re)insertion, and other perioperative morbidities such as anastomotic leak, wound
      infection, and intra-abdominal abscesses in patients undergoing elective colorectal
      operations.

      Study Design

      This study involves the evaluation of patients who consume coffee compared with patients who
      consume warm water during the postoperative period after elective colorectal surgery with
      primary anastomosis.

      This study will be a single-center, randomized trial. Patients who undergo elective
      colorectal surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and agree to participate in the study will
      be randomized 1:1:1 to those who drink regular coffee, decaffeinated coffee, and no coffee.
      Randomization will occur via an online program (www.randomizer.org), which assigns
      participants to experimental conditions. The subjects assigned to drink regular coffee,
      decaffeinated coffee, or warm water will be given a 4oz cup three times daily and will be
      instructed to consume all of its liquid contents.

      Postoperative care will otherwise be the same for all subjects, as dictated by the clinical
      judgment of the surgical team.
