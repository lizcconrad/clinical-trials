  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) or bleeding in the brain as a result of ruptured aneurysm is a
      devastating type of stroke. Many patients who undergo emergent neurosurgery to repair the
      aneurysm and remove the bleeding suffer from complications in their subsequent hospital stay,
      the most frequent and morbid of which is delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) or small strokes
      resulting from impaired blood flow to certain vital brain centers. This occurs because of
      changes to the brain's blood vessels that occur after the bleed. The arteries can become
      narrow (spasm) or small clots can form within the vasculature that disrupts normal blood
      flow. Patients are left with profound neurologic deficits from these secondary complications.

      Anesthesiologists, neurosurgeons, and intensivists are in need of a way to protect the brain
      during this vulnerable period following aneurysm repair. One drug that may provide such
      protection is ketamine, a compound frequently used in operating rooms and intensive care
      units to provide anesthesia and analgesia. Ketamine works by blocking glutamate receptor ion
      channels that play a pivotal role in promoting brain cell death during strokes by flooding
      the brain with too much calcium and dangerous chemicals. This project is designed to test the
      efficacy of ketamine in protecting the brain following aneurysm repair by using a controlled
      infusion of the drug in the intensive care unit (ICU) when patients return from their
      operation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a devastating type of stroke, with significant
      long-term morbidity for patients who survive the initial bleed. The most frequent and morbid
      complication is delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) resulting from angiographic vasospasm of the
      arteries of the circle of Willis. At present, there is no protective therapy aimed at
      neuronal preservation during this period of ischemia. The standard medical care is primarily
      to maintain intravascular volume status to improve cerebral perfusion during arterial
      narrowing, or calcium channel blockers for smooth muscle relaxation on the arterial wall.
      Experimental and clinical data suggest a primary mechanism of neuronal injury during ischemia
      is excitotoxicity, glutamate-induced cell death resulting from overstimulation of ionotropic
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and resultant excessive calcium influx. Ketamine is a
      dissociative anesthetic with a mechanism of action of non-competitive antagonism of the NMDA
      receptor, routinely used in operating rooms and intensive care units as an analgesic and
      anesthetic. In addition to its anesthetic properties, ketamine is also an anti-inflammatory
      agent and a sympathomimetic, maintaining sedation without the adverse effects of hemodynamic
      instability. Identification of a neuroprotective entity for DCI following SAH would vastly
      improve the quality of life and shorten hospital stay for patients with a ruptured
      intracerebral aneurysm. It is critical to identify such agents so that patients survive their
      injury, spend shorter time in the ICU, and can return to work and maintain relationships.
