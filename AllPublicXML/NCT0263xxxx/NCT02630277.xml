      To assess the safety and efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept injection in the regression of
      retinal neovascularization secondary to high-risk PDR.

      To characterize baseline/post-induction/maintenance levels of proinflammatory mediators in
      patients with high-risk PDR

      This study will evaluate two dosing regimens (monthly and PRN following a loading dose) for
      treatment of PDR with intravitreal aflibercept injection. Additionally, the study will
      identify biomarker mediators in vitreous fluid present at baseline in patients with PDR and
      will track over the course of a year their profile changes in response to these two dosing
      regimens. The treatment regimens will provide information on the biomarker profile with a
      monthly regimen as well as with a variable regimen. Furthermore, biomarker mediators that may
      be associated with anti-VEGF responders and non-responders may also be identified. 105
      biomarker mediators (cytokines/chemokines) which have been identified as playing a role in
      PDR in published studies will be profiled in patients with PDR.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Eligible eyes will have active PDR with high risk characteristics (HRC) as defined by
             the DRS. All eyes must meet at least one or both of the following criteria:

               -  Any neovascularization of the disc (NVD) + vitreous hemorrhage

               -  Mild neovascularization of the disc (NVD) of at least 1/2 to 1/3 disc area as
                  shown in standard photograph 10A of the DRS

               -  Moderate neovascularization of the retina elsewhere (NVE) of at least 1/2 disc
                  area as shown in standard photograph 7 of the DRS + vitreous hemorrhage2.
                  Patient's study eye must be treatment naïve; no history of intravitreal
                  anti-angiogenic treatment, intravitreal steroid treatment, or any laser treatment
                  to study eye

          2. 18 years or older males and females with a history of diabetes mellitus and ability to
             sign informed consent

          3. ETDRS visual acuity score greater than or equal to 24 letters (approximately 20/320)
             and less than or equal to 85 letters (approximately 20/20) by the ETDRS visual acuity
             protocol at the screening visit

          4. Eyes with mild pre-retinal hemorrhage or mild vitreous hemorrhage that does not
             interfere with clear visualization of the macula and optic disc are eligible for this
             study

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:

          1. Presence of moderate or dense PRH or VH that prevents clear visualization of the
             macula and/or optic disc

          2. Presence of either:

               -  Significant epiretinal membranes involving the macula, or

               -  Proliferative diabetic membranes along the major retinal arcades that are
                  extensive enough to cause either:

               -  Significant vitreomacular traction or

               -  Significant impairment in visual acuity
