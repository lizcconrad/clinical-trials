    <textblock>
      Up to 30 women with known or suspected epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal cancer will participate in two different imaging cohorts. The Biodistribution
      cohort will include up to 10 patients and the Dynamic cohort will include up to 20 patients.
      Human dosimetry will be calculated from the Biodistribution cohort. The Dynamic cohort date
      will evaluate preliminary information on uptake of [18F]FTT in gynecological cancer and
      compare with PARP-1 activity in tissue.

        Inclusion Criteria for Biodistribution cohort

          -  Participants will be ≥ 18 years of age

          -  History of known or suspected epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
             peritoneal cancer (may have primary or metastatic cancer at the time of study
             enrollment)

          -  At least one lesion ≥ 1.0 cm that is seen on standard imaging (e.g. CT, MRI,
             ultrasound, FDG PET/CT)

          -  Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and be
             willing to provide written informed consent and participate in this study in
             accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior to study-specific
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria for Biodistribution cohort

          -  Females who are pregnant or breast feeding at the time of screening will not be
             eligible for this study; a urine pregnancy test will be performed in women of
             child-bearing potential at screening.

          -  Inability to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of an investigator or treating
             physician

          -  Any current medical condition, illness, or disorder as assessed by medical record
             review and/or self-reported that is considered by a physician investigator to be a
             condition that could compromise participant safety or successful participation in the
             study

        Inclusion Criteria for Dynamic cohort

          -  Participants will be ≥ 18 years of age

             peritoneal cancer (may have primary or recurrent cancer at the time of study
             enrollment)

          -  At least one lesion ≥ 1.0 cm that is seen on standard imaging (e.g. CT, MRI,
             ultrasound, FDG PET/CT)

          -  Clinical plan for biopsy or surgical procedure of at least one site of known or
             suspected cancer

          -  Willing to consent to collection of pathology tissue for the purposes of research at
             the time of clinical biopsy or surgical procedure.

          -  Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and be
             willing to provide written informed consent and participate in this study in
             accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior to study-specific

             child-bearing potential at screening.

          -  No clinical plan for biopsy or surgical procedure of known or suspected cancer

          -  Inability to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of an investigator or treating
             physician

          -  Any current medical condition, illness, or disorder as assessed by medical record
