  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most physiologically demanding things that older people do every day is to get up
      in the morning. After spending a night laying flat, where the blood distributes evenly across
      the body, when they stand in the morning (and the blood rushes to their feet), their
      cardiovascular system may not be able to compensate and maintain blood flow to the brain.
      This phenomenon is known as orthostatic or postural hypotension. The investigators have found
      in a group of young individuals that use of a dawn-simulation light that gradually wakes the
      brain is able to increase cardiovascular tone prior to arising. The goal of this experiment
      is to determine whether this dawn simulation light is able to increase cardiovascular tone in
      older adults such that they would have reduced or absent postural hypotension when they
      awaken in the morning. This would greatly reduce the risks of falls and their associated
      morbidities in older adults.
