    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of sustained peripheral nerve stimulation coupled
      with functional motor training, to improve hand motor function in poorly recovered stroke
      patients. The central hypothesis is that stroke patients with severe motor deficit receiving
      hand nerve stimulation and intensive task-oriented therapy will have improved motor function
      compared to patients receiving sham nerve stimulation and task-oriented therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the most devastating and prevalent diseases, but efforts to limit the amount
      of tissue damaged in the acute phase have been disappointing, highlighting the need for
      effective therapeutic interventions after neurologic damage has occurred. Data from animal
      and human models have suggested that sensory input plays an important role in motor output,
      possibly by influencing cortical plasticity. However, in spite of the advances to date,
      little is known about the extent to which sensory input in the form of peripheral nerve
      stimulation can be successfully combined to physical training especially in poorly recovered
      stroke patients. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of sustained peripheral nerve
      stimulation coupled with functional motor training, to improve hand motor function in stroke
      patients with severe motor deficit. The central hypothesis is that stroke patients with
      severe motor deficit receiving hand nerve stimulation and intensive task-oriented therapy
      will have improved motor function compared to patients receiving sham nerve stimulation and
      task-oriented therapy, and the degree of this behaviorally-measured effect will correlate
      with the neurophysiological effect measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation.

    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention, 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Score at post-intervention minus baseline, score at 1-month follow-up minus baseline. Each task is scored as amount of time taken to complete a task, which may range from just over 0 to 120 seconds. If the subject is unable to complete the task within 120 seconds, a score of 121 seconds is given. The scores from the 15 individual tasks are averaged, then the log is taken, resulting in the overall score. Therefore, the larger the score, the longer required to perform the tasks. Negative changes in score indicate that a subject, on average, was able to complete the tasks faster at post-intervention or at 1-month follow-up than at baseline.</description>

        <description>Score at post-intervention minus baseline, score at 1-month follow-up minus baseline. Each task is scored as amount of time taken to complete a task, which may range from just over 0 to 120 seconds. If the subject is unable to complete the task within 120 seconds, a score of 121 seconds is given. The scores from the 15 individual tasks are averaged, then the log is taken, resulting in the overall score. Therefore, the larger the score, the longer required to perform the tasks. Negative changes in score indicate that a subject, on average, was able to complete the tasks faster at post-intervention or at 1-month follow-up than at baseline.</description>
