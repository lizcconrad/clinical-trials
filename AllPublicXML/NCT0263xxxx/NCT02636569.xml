  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will test how well two topical medications work to prevent the
      development of non-melanoma skin cancers by reversing certain biomarkers in the skin. This
      study is also looking at the optimal dose of a medication in a small number of people.
      Biomarkers are molecules that are found in the body and inside of cells. Some biomarkers are
      associated with specific diseases such as skin cancer. In this study, two topical medications
      will be evaluated; diclofenac and alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO).

      Diclofenac and DFMO are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for other uses. 24
      patients will be enrolled in this study by University of Alabama at Birmingham.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men and women (≥ 18 yo)who have been seen as patients in the Dermatology Clinic at the
      University of Alabama at Birmingham with a history of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma
      of the skin and at least 8 actinic keratoses on the upper extremities are potentially
      eligible for study participation.

      We propose to examine two topical medications, both of which are already FDA approved, used
      alone or in combination with a placebo comparator. The purpose of the study is to see if
      diclofenac and α-difluoromethylornithine (DMFO) can be applied daily or if they need to be
      applied twice per day each in order to achieve the desired results. We will be examining
      levels of specific biomarkers in the skin that are associated with risk of developing skin
      cancer. We hope to see these levels decrease with once daily or twice daily use of these
      medications when both diclofenac and DMFO are used. Results from this study will help guide
      us in a second study where we will look at longer term use of these medications and how they
      are associated with changes in skin biomarkers that are related to skin cancer. The second
      longer study will use the dose (once or twice daily topical application of diclofenac and
      DMFO) that resulted in a decrease in biomarkers, as discovered in this currently proposed
      study.

    <description>Topical DFMO Diclofenac Each subject will be seen for a screening visit as well as a baseline visit and a visit at month 1. As part of the study small biopsies will be taken from two locations at the baseline visit. The biopsy will be taken from one area that is typically exposed to the sun as well as a site that is typically protected from sun light. A biopsy is a small surgical procedure where a small piece of your skin is removed.
After applying the medications for 30 days you will return to the clinic for your 30 day visit. At this visit you will again have two biopsies taken. One of these biopsies will be from the skin on your arm that was treated with medication for the prior 30 days, and the other biopsy will be from a site that typically is not exposed to the sun.</description>
