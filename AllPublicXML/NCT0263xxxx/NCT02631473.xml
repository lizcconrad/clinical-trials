  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, prospective pharmacokinetic study investigating two
      antiretroviral agents in parallel and employing an adaptive design with two stages, whereby
      the results obtained in the primary stage inform the doses selected for investigation in the
      secondary stage

      The objectives of this study are:

      Primary

        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetics of a new pharmaceutical formulation of efavirenz
           (NANO-efavirenz) in HIV negative healthy volunteers after single dose and a
           steady-state.

        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetics of a new pharmaceutical formulation of lopinavir
           (NANO-lopinavir) in HIV negative healthy volunteers

      Secondary

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of NANO-efavirenz and NANO-lopinavir in HIV
           negative healthy volunteers

        -  To assess the bioequivalence of a selected single-dose of NANO-efavirenz to a single
           dose 600mg of efavirenz as SustivaÂ®

        -  To investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms in drug disposition genes
           and drug exposure

             adherence to treatment, follow-up procedures or evaluation of adverse events. Smoking
             is permitted, but tobacco intake should remain consistent throughout the study

         10. Known cardiac disease history of any family history of sudden cardiac death.

             not to interact with study drugs.

         13. Females of childbearing potential without the use of effective non-hormonal birth
             control methods, or not willing to continue practising these birth control methods for
