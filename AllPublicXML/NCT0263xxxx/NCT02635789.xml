  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NPC-12G gel (topical
      formulation of sirolimus) versus placebo gel to facial angiofibroma and other skin lesions in
      patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease that causes
      benign tumors on the almost whole body (including skin, brain, kidney, lung and heart),
      behavior disorder as autism, mental retardation and neurologic symptom as epilepsy.
      Angiofibroma is TSC-specific facial skin lesions, and hamartoma caused by increase of the
      component of skin connective tissues and blood vessels. Other skin lesions due to TSC are
      white macule(hypomelanotic macule), plaque, shagreen patch and ungual fibromas. Current
      therapeutic methods for angiofibroma are laser or surgical treatments, but there are problems
      as many relapses, deficiency of evidence, change of pigment, scar and risk of infection.

      This will be a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel group
      trial. The trial has three phases; the screening phase, double-blinded treatment phase, and
      post-treatment phase. The screening phase comprises a screening visit where subject's initial
      eligibility will be evaluated. During double-blinded treatment phase, patients who meet all
      entry criteria for the trial will be randomized into two groups, and they will apply 0.2%
      NPC-12G gel or placebo gel topically twice a day for 12 weeks.
