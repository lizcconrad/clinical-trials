      To assess and compare the performance of the HR HPV HC2® test (Qiagen/Digene) and the APTIMA®
      HPV Assay (Hologic) using LBC Specimens (ThinPrep® Pap Test) for the detection of HPV
      infection and high-grade CIN lesions in a screening population of women 30 years of age or
      older in Germany.

      The study is conducted in the areas of Tuebingen, Freiburg and Saarbruecken in Germany. In
      total, 10.000 ThinPrep® LBC cervical samples were collected from June 2009 to May 2012.
      Liquid based cytology (LBC) was performed by a central laboratory in Saarbruecken. Human
      papilloma virus (HPV) testing with the HR HPV HC2® test and APTIMA® HPV Assay were performed
      at the Section of Experimental Virology, Institute of Medical Virology, University Clinic of
      Tuebingen, Germany (UKT).

      Within a follow-up phase women who tested positive in any test at baseline will be monitored
      over a period of 5 years.

      Study close out visit: In addition, approximately 5 years after baseline ThinPrep® LBC
      cervical samples will be collected from a random sample of 4000 study participants who tested
      triple negative at baseline for determination of the longitudinal negative predictive value
      (NPV) and HPV related disease after a 5 year period. Women who tested positive in any test
      will undergo colposcopy.
