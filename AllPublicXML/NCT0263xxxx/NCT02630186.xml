  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical research study is being carried out in two parts, Phase 1 and Phase 2. The
      primary purpose of the Phase 1 portion of the study is to observe the safety of the
      combination of rociletinib and MPDL3280A in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients.

      The primary purpose of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to evaluate the safety and
      anti-tumor effects of the combination of rociletinib and MPDL3280A, at the best doses for the
      combination determined in Phase 1, in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of rociletinib administered in combination with MPDL3280A.

      Phase 1: This will be the dose finding phase of the study. Patients will be enrolled to
      available Dosing Cohort. Patients who have progressed after prior first- or second-generation
      EGFR TKI, regardless of T790M mutation status, will be enrolled.

      Phase 2: Patients will be enrolled into 2 groups. Group A will enroll eligible first-line
      patients who are EGFR TKI treatment-na誰ve and chemotherapy-na誰ve. Group B will enroll
      eligible patients who have progressed after prior first- or second-generation EGFR TKI,
      regardless of T790M mutation status.
