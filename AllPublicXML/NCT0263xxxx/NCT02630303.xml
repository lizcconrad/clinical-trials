  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to establish the safety of high fluence LED-RL from 160 J/cm2 up to
      640 J/cm2 in healthy subjects. The hypothesis is that high fluence LED-RL phototherapy is
      safe in human skin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin fibrosis is involved in a variety of pathologic processes ranging from exuberant scar
      formation secondary to surgery or trauma, as in hypertrophic and keloid scars, to
      immune-mediated processes such as scleroderma and chronic graft-versus-host disease. As
      highlighted by quality-of-life studies, skin fibrosis imparts a significant socioeconomic
      burden due to the functional, aesthetic, and psychosocial impact it has on a patient's life.
      The effects of visible light, while common in the environment (visible spectrum accounts for
      44% of total solar energy), remain undefined. An important safety feature of visible red
      light (600 nm to 700 nm) is that it does not generate pro-carcinogenic DNA damage as does
      ultraviolet (UV) light. Recently published clinical observations indicate that red light in
      combination with other modalities such as photosensitizers in combined red light photodynamic
      therapy can lessen skin fibrosis. However, preliminary in vitro data generated by the
      investigator's research group suggests that red light can function as a stand-alone
      treatment, eliminating the side-effects of chemical photosensitizers and the potential
      long-term harm of current UV therapy. Furthermore, commercially available light emitting
      diode-red light (LED-RL) units exist and are already FDA-cleared for other dermatological
      uses (such as rhytides and acne), thus clinical translation for use in skin fibrosis could
      occur relatively quickly following safety and efficacy demonstration. Developing high fluence
      LED-RL phototherapy as a treatment for skin fibrosis would represent an important advance in
      scarring conditions that lacks the serious systemic side effects associated with
      immunomodulatory agents (such as oral steroids); avoids the need for invasive, painful
      injections with anti-fibrotic agents (such as intralesional steroids, 5-fluorouracil and
      bleomycin); and eliminates the UV-induced DNA damage associated with skin cancer and
      photoaging that are associated with current UVA/UVA1 and UVB/narrowband UVB phototherapy. To
      the investigator research group's knowledge, no clinical trials have been performed to
      determine the safety of high fluence LED-RL for treatment of skin fibrosis. Therefore, the
      innovation of this approach is that the investigator research group intend to study high
      fluence LED-RL as a safe modality for treatment of skin fibrosis.

    <description>The protocol for dose escalation requires subjects be enrolled sequentially in groups of five (three subjects randomized to LED-RL phototherapy and two subjects randomized to mock therapy).
After either a maximally tolerated dose (MTD) has been established, or the study endpoint of 640 J/cm2 has been achieved, an additional 27 LED-RL phototherapy subjects (for a total of 30) and 18 mock therapy subjects (for a total of 20) (determined randomly) will be enrolled to satisfy Hanley's Rule of Three, such that it can be concluded with 95% confidence that fewer than 1 person in 10 will experience an adverse event.</description>

    <description>The maximum recommended starting dose (MSRD) (160 J/cm2) will be administered to Group 1's LED-RL phototherapy randomized subjects and the LED-RL dose will be escalated in subsequent groups using the classical method for dose escalation as described by Spilker: starting with dose (X) increased by an equal amount (in this instance: X=160 J/cm2, 2X=320 J/cm2, 3X=480 J/cm2, 4X=640 J/cm2). Common expected procedure side effects are mild and temporary, including warmth, redness (erythema) and swelling (edema). The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level below the dose producing unacceptable but reversible toxicity and is considered the upper limit of subject tolerance.
All subjects will receive total of nine LED-RL phototherapy, three times per week for three consecutive weeks.</description>
