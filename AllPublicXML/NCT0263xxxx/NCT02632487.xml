  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of combining a traditional, structured
      exercise intervention with an innovative intervention designed to decrease sedentary behavior
      and increase non-exercise physical activity (NEPA).

    <textblock>
      A recruitment of 40 sedentary men and women â‰¥ 60 years of age with elevated cardiovascular
      risk and follow them for 20 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned (n = 20/group) to
      1) an 8-week, twice-weekly, multi-modal, center-based exercise intervention (EX) followed by
      12 additional weeks of follow-up assessment, or 2) the same intervention with participants
      also asked to wear a validated lightweight activity tracker on their hip during waking hours
      and instructed on how to reduce sedentary behavior increase NEPA within their daily routines
      (EX + NEPA). Evaluations will be done to 1) the extent to which EX + NEPA modifies sedentary
      behavior, 2) the impact of the interventions on cardiovascular risk factors, including blood
      pressure, exercise capacity, waist circumference, and circulating biomarkers, and 3) develop
      and optimize study procedures to guide the future trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sedentary lifestyle, defined as &lt;150 min/wk of moderate physical activity by CHAMPS
             questionnaire

          -  Moderate to high-risk of CHD events according to ATP-III risk classification algorithm
