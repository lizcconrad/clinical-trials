  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, GSK2820151, is a Bromodomain (BRD) and Extra-Terminal (BET) inhibitor arising
      from a distinct structural class. GSK2820151 potently inhibits tumor growth in vitro and in
      vivo in animal models. This first time in human (FTIH), open-label, dose escalation study is
      to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical
      activity of GSK2820151 in subjects with advanced or recurrent solid tumors. The objective is
      to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GSK2820151 in
      subjects 18 years or older with advanced or recurrent solid tumors. Eligible subjects with
      advanced or recurrent solid tumors will be enrolled in the dosing cohorts until MTD is
      established. All subjects will receive study drug. Subjects may continue treatment in the
      study until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The
      duration of study will depend on recruitment rates and the timing of subjects' duration on
      study (withdrawal rates due to toxicity or progression). It is anticipated that approximately
      30 to 50 subjects will be enrolled.

    <description>An accelerated dose escalation phase will be utilized in order to minimize sub-optimal drug exposures, followed by a conventional 3+3 dose escalation phase to achieve MTD. Initially, one subject per dose cohort will be recruited (accelerated dose escalation phase) until the first instance of a &gt;=Grade 2 drug related toxicity or dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Further cohorts will be recruited in blocks of three subjects (3+3 dose escalation phase). Projected dose levels are 3 mg, 6 mg, 12 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg. Additional subjects may be enrolled at previously cleared dose levels in order to obtain further data for PK and/or PD analysis. Once MTD is determined, additional subjects (18 subjects total at MTD) may be enrolled to collect additional safety data.</description>
