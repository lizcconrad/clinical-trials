  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a prospective, randomized trial to assess the impact of
      neuromuscular blockade on early (&lt;72 hours post-ICU admission) postoperative respiratory
      complications in cardiac surgical patients. The study will compare continual neuromuscular
      blockade with cisatracurium to a single dose of succinylcholine during general anesthesia for
      cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Residual neuromuscular blockade during the immediate postoperative period is an important
      patient safety issue. Although used to facilitate the technical performance of surgery,
      clinical studies have associated neuromuscular blockade (NMB) with increased incidence of
      postoperative respiratory complications. This effect is likely mediated by residual
      neuromuscular blockade interfering with airway tone and respiratory effort, leading to
      postoperative pneumonia, atelectasis or aspiration. However, the vast majority of these
      studies have involved non-cardiac patient populations, yet patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery are even more susceptible to the detrimental effects of residual neuromuscular
      blockade for a number of reasons. Despite widespread utilization of paralysis during cardiac
      surgery, very little is known about residual neuromuscular blockade in patients following
      cardiac surgery. Previously published clinical studies date from over a decade ago or are
      based on retrospective databases from non-cardiac surgery patients, precluding generalizable
      conclusions. Given the substantial role of neuromuscular blockade in the traditional
      management of cardiac surgical patients, prospective data is needed to determine the veracity
      of this association as well as the surgical tolerability of protocols that minimize
      intraoperative paralysis. The investigators will conduct a prospective, randomized trial to
      assess impact of neuromuscular blockade on early (&lt;72 hours post-ICU admission) postoperative
      respiratory complications.
