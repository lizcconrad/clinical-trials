  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal is to further develop a robotic exoskeleton for neurorehabilitation of arm
      function after stroke. The investigators previously developed a novel training protocol that
      combined the ARMin and HandSOME exoskeletons. This is one of only a few arm exoskeletons that
      allow coordinated whole limb training in reach and grasp tasks with both virtual and real
      objects. However, the robot has a very large inertia and friction, and only gross grasp
      patterns are available. In development work, the investigators will significantly modify the
      AMRin and HandSOME to deliver a state-of-the-art lightweight robotic exoskeleton capable of
      retraining a wide range of functional activities. In the subsequent testing phase, a clinical
      trial will examine the effects of robotic training in chronic stroke subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a pilot clinical trial, the investigators found that the current robotic exoskeleton
      elicited improvements in arm function that can potentially supplement conventional methods to
      improve outcomes. However, the robot has a very large inertia and friction, and only gross
      grasp patterns are available. Therefore, improvements in movement speed and fine grasp were
      limited after robotic training. In development work, the investigators will significantly
      modify the ARMin and HandSOME to deliver a state-of-the-art lightweight robotic exoskeleton
      capable of retraining a wide range of functional activities. The investigators will reduce
      the inertia and friction of the robot to 1/4 of current values, incorporate an adaptive
      algorithm to automatically adjust assistance levels and extend the range of grasp patterns to
      include power grasp, thumb-index finger pinch and key pinch. Using the improved device from
      the development activities, the investigators will perform a clinical trial to compare the
      effectiveness of robotic training to conventional therapy from an occupational therapist. To
      take advantage of the facilitatory effect of robot therapy on subsequent conventional
      therapy, the experimental treatment will be 12 hours of robot therapy followed by 12 hours of
      conventional therapy. Chronic stroke subjects (N=38) will be randomly assigned to receive
      this experimental treatment or 24 hours of conventional therapy from an occupational
      therapist.

    <measure>Change in Fugl-Meyer score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Test of Motor Function will be used to assess motor impairments at the shoulder, elbow, wrist and fingers. The Fugl-Meyer test scores reflexes and the ability to perform several movements and tasks on a 3-point scale. The Fugl-Meyer was designed for the recovery patterns observed after stroke and is very responsive to change in severe and moderately impaired subjects.</description>

    <measure>Change in Action Research Arm Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) is an impairment level measurement tool that assesses the functional limitations of the upper extremities. It is one of the most frequently used primary endpoints in upper extremity (UE) training trials in stroke. The assessment incorporates 19 items that are divided into four subscales: Grasp, Grip, Pinch, and Gross movement. Item scores are summed to form a subtest score, and then a full-scale score.</description>

    <measure>Change in Motor Activity Log</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Motor Activity Log (MAL) will be used to assess use of the limb at home. It is a structured interview during which respondents are asked to rate how they use their more-impaired arm for 28 activities of daily living (ADL) in the home over a specified period. Activities include brushing teeth, buttoning a shirt or blouse, and eating with a fork or spoon.</description>
