    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of vanilla odor on hypoxic intermittent
      events in premature infants born between 32.0 and 33.6 weeks of gestational age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A weekly screening will be done on all new hospitalized infants at the neonatal care unit of
      the CHUS born between 32.0 and 33.6 weeks of gestational age. At the beginning of their 2nd
      week in the neonatal care unit, infant's medical record will be consult for inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. At this moment, no information will be noted. Then, team research will
      discuss with neonatologist to have their opinion concerning the inclusion of a patient in the
      study. If they agree, the doctor or the nurse having a therapeutic link with the infant will
      ask parents' infant if they agree to meet the research team to discuss about the research
      project. Once the agreement will be obtained, parents will be approached by a member of the
      research team. Project will be explained, questions will be answered and consent form will be
      obtained. When an infant will be enrolled in the study, a code will be attributed to him and
      a randomization will established the order of the intervention.

      Option A) night 1: a 12h cardiorespiratory recording with vanilla, night 2: no recording and
      night 3: a 12h cardiorespiratory recording without vanilla OR Option B): night 1: a 12h
      cardiorespiratory recording without vanilla, night 2: no recording and night 3: a 12h
      cardiorespiratory recording recording with vanilla.

      A 3h polysomnography will be done in a sub-sample of 10-15 infants in the morning by the
      night 1 and 3 according by the pre-existing condition of vanilla or not.

      All data will be entered in a secured database and a double checked will be done by team
      members to assess the accuracy.
