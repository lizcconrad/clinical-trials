      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies hypnotherapy in treating chronic pain in cancer
      survivors. Hypnotherapy is a state of concentration and focused attention which can provide
      more control over the experience of acute and chronic pain and its impact and may provide
      comfort, maximize function, and improve quality of life in cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the feasibility (recruitment, attrition, adherence, logistical issues) of
      delivering the hypnosis (hypnotherapy) intervention to cancer survivors with chronic pain.

      II. To evaluate the acceptability of the hypnosis intervention among cancer survivors with
      chronic pain.

      III. To explore preliminary efficacy (estimate effect size) of hypnosis in relieving pain and
      improving associated anxiety and functional performance at 4 weeks and 8 weeks compared to a
      wait-list control.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION GROUP: Participants undergo hypnotherapy session over 20-30 minutes
      using a standardized script for pain reduction that contains post-hypnotic suggestions for
      permanence of hypnotherapy benefits. The hypnotherapy session is recorded and the participant
      listens to the recording daily for 4 weeks.

      WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP: At week 5, participants undergo hypnotherapy session over 20-30
      minutes using a standardized script for pain reduction that contains post-hypnotic
      suggestions for permanence of hypnotherapy benefits. The hypnotherapy session is recorded and
      the participant listens to the recording daily for 4 weeks.

    <description>Transcribed interview data and open-ended responses from the pre- post-Intervention Questionnaire will be organized in ATLAS.ti.

    <description>To evaluate the effects of the intervention on efficacy endpoints, general linear modeling will be used. Participants will be a random effect.

The interaction between group x time will show if the groups change differentially (whether intervention moderates change in outcome). Within the wait-list, O2 and O3 will be compared (paired t-test) to see if the wait-list replicates the immediate group's results.
