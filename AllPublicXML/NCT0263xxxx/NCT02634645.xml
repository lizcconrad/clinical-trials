    <textblock>
      A prospective outcomes study in patients with and esophageal cancer (EAC) and Barrett's
      esophagus (BE) associated neoplasia being evaluated for endoscopic eradication therapy (EET).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be enrolled in this study at the participating centers when evaluated in
      gastro-intestinal (GI) clinics and endoscopy suites. Initial evaluation of patients will
      include collection of data on demographics, assessment of risk factors such as smoking,
      metabolic syndrome, family history and detailed medication history, and past surgical
      history. All patients will be complete questionnaires regarding Gastroesophageal Reflux
      Disease (GERD) symptoms, GERD related quality of life (QOL) and overall health related QOL.
      Details of all previous endoscopic and surgical evaluation along with histopathology data
      will be documented. Patients undergoing endoscopic evaluation at the participating centers
      will have their endoscopic and histopathology results documented. This will include data
      collection regarding use of advanced imaging techniques, details regarding tissue
      acquisition, EET and adverse events. Patients undergoing esophagectomy will have surgical
      details documented along with complications related to surgery. Similarly, details regarding
      chemoradiation treatments will be documented .

        Formation of a multi-site prospective database of patients with BE associated neoplasia
        referred for consideration for EET and EAC.

        Women and minorities will be included as they are found to have BE, BE related dysplasia,
        and EAC. It is well recognized that the majority of patients diagnosed with BE are white
        males. However, we will actively seek to include all women and minorities with a diagnosis
        of BE associated neoplasia for the study.
