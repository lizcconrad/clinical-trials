      Preoperative detection of combined coronary artery disease by invasive coronary angiography
      (ICA) is recommended in American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)
      guidelines for most patients (&gt;40 yrs male or postmenopausal female) scheduled for heart
      valve surgery, but the low incident rate of coronary artery disease implied guidelines for
      the vast majority who ultimately will not undergo revascularization. Computed tomography
      angiography (CTA) has emerged as an alternative diagnosis procedure, which has the following
      advantages: non-invasive, low cost, provide information of lung and mediastinum. Our study is
      to evaluate the feasibility of computed tomography, instead of conventional invasive coronary
      angiography in evaluating coronary artery lesion prior to the heart valvular operation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Valvular heart disease is common in China, either rheumatic or degenerative, and valvular
      repair or replacement surgery is the important therapeutic method. In all forms of heart
      valvular disease, combined coronary artery disease worsens perioperative prognosis.
      Preoperative detection of combined coronary artery disease with invasive coronary angiography
      is recommended in most patients scheduled for valve surgery, while incidence rate of coronary
      artery disease in patients with valvular disease showed that only 3%-19% patients were
      diagnosed with significant stenosis. Although invasive coronary angiography is considered a
      safe procedure, it still carries a small risk of major (death, stroke, or vascular
      dissection) and minor (inguinal hematoma) complications. Furthermore, the catheterization
      procedure is rather expensive, as its invasive nature involves admission to a hospital and
      requires surveillance by an experienced team. As a non-invasive alternative diagnosis
      procedure, coronary computed tomographic angiography has showed promising performance with
      high negative predictive value (95%-100%). Furthermore, computed tomography is a noninvasive
      procedure with low risk and cost, and it can be easily performed at the clinic. Except for
      evaluation of coronary artery, computed tomography can also provide information of lung,
      mediastinum and cardiac structure, which may help physicians make early diagnosis and
      treatment. Computed tomography is not routinely utilized in clinical practice.

      Our study is a prospective multicenter study to assess the feasibility and safety of adding
      computed tomography as a gatekeeper and perform invasive coronary angiography selectively
      prior to valvular surgeries.

Those with positive findings in CTA (≥50% diameter stenosis in main coronary artery) or uncertain diagnosis caused by motion artifact or calcium artifact are required to undergo ICA, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is recommended in patients with significant stenosis according to the ICA result. Participants with negative findings in CTA do not need further coronary artery evaluation, and CABG won't be performed during the surgery.</description>
