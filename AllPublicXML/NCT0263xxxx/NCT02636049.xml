      This is a Phase 1, open-label, three-period sequential dosing study being conducted primarily
      to determine the pharmacokinetics of Triferic iron administered intravenously to healthy
      adults.. Participation will be up to 5 weeks total duration including Screening, Baseline,
      Treatment Period, and Follow-up. Following Screening, subjects will be admitted to the clinic
      on Day -1, prior to Baseline (Day 1). During the Treatment Period, subjects will receive two
      doses of Triferic. Each subject will receive a single 6-mg dose of Triferic administered IV
      over 3 hours (hr) on one day (Day 2), and a single 35-µg/kg dose of Triferic administered IV
      push the following day (Day 3). On Day 4, subjects will be discharged from the clinic and
      will return approximately one week later for their final Follow-up visit.

    <description>Each subject will receive a single 6 mg dose of Triferic administered as a continuous intravenous infusion over 3 hours. The Triferic IV dosing solution will have been prepared by diluting Triferic from ampules (5.44 mg/mL) in an appropriate amount of D5W to a concentration of 0.020 mg/mL. Administration of 300 mL IV at 100 mL/hr for 3 hours results in delivery of 6 mg of Triferic iron.</description>
