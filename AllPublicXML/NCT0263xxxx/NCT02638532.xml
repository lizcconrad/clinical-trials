      The specific aim of this outcomes study is to assess if the volume of fat that is injected
      into the foot is retained at 6 months, to determine the retention over time, and assess the
      quality of the bone before and after treatment. We will also correlate adipose stem cell
      characteristics to the fat retention over time.

      The study goal is to utilize MRI to further understand changes that are occurring in the foot
      when autologous fat is used to treat plantar fat pad atrophy of the foot. The etiology of fat
      pad atrophy may be age-related, due to abnormal foot mechanics, obesity, steroid use, or
      collagen vascular disease. Displacement or atrophy of the fat pad can lead to osseous
      prominences in the foot that may be seen with painful skin lesions. Disease states, such as
      diabetes, may have loss of soft tissue integrity. Fat pad atrophy may result in significant
      pain or compensatory gait leading to callous formation or ulceration. In sensate patients,
      the pain can lead to emotional and physical pain, leading to productivity and financial
      losses.

      Fat grafting to the feet is as a cosmetic surgery option. Although fat grafting is used often
      in standard care plastic surgery, for cosmetic reasons, it is considered part of the research
      in this trial. What happens to the fat after injection has not been well studied.
      Approximately 50 adults who experience pain from fat pad atrophy, either of the fore foot or
      heel will have fat pad grafting. The study will utilize MRI before and at 6 months
      post-procedure to assess changes in the quality of the bone of the foot as well as the 3D
      morphology of the fat. Specifically, the investigators want to know how the fat redistributes
      around the bone. In addition, the Adipose Stem Cell Biology Laboratory will assess the stem
      cell characteristics of the fat used for autotransplantation. This study will help build new
      collaborative efforts between Foot and Ankle Specialists, Stem Cell Biologists, and Plastic
      Surgeons, combining expertise in foot biomechanics with reconstructive fat grafting.

    <intervention_name>Foot Fat Pad Grafting</intervention_name>
    <description>Fat tissue to be used for grafting is harvested (usually from abdomen or thighs) with a small liposuction cannula. The fat tissue is then sterilely centrifuged and allowed to decant before separating the fluid and oil layers from the fat tissue fraction. The aspirated fat is then loaded into 1cc syringes and injected into the plantar fat pad using specialized injection cannulas.</description>
