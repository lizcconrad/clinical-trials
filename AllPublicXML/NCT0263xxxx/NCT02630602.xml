    <textblock>
      The purpose this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of a functional goat cheese on
      obese and overweight people with altered lipid profile. The functional goat cheese containing
      polyunsaturated fatty acid, in amounts exceeding other cheese, was developed to benefit
      cardiovascular health of people who need to normalize lipid profile; which in the long term
      can contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.

      A randomized, parallel, double-blind, controlled is being performing to evaluate the effect
      of a functional goat cheese on lipid profile in overweight or obese volunteers who need a
      special diet.

      Were included 60 volunteers (men and women) aged between 18 and 65 years (IMC ≥27&lt;40 Kg/m2)
      with a cardiovascular risk (&lt;10%). The volunteers are being followed at La Paz University
      Hospital of Madrid. For 12 weeks, the volunteers should consume 60 g of cheese daily
      (functional cheese or control cheese) and to receive advice to follow a balanced and
      individualized hypocaloric diet as well as physical activity.
