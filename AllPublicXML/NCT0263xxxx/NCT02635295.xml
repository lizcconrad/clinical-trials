      The aim of this study is:

        1. to evaluate the effectiveness of the nursing student - nurse teacher mobile cooperation
           (MC) during the clinical practicum,

        2. to measure the usability of the mobile application.

      The detailed research questions and hypothesis of this study are as follows:

        1. What is the impact of MC on the nurse competence level of nursing students evaluated by
           work role, teaching-coaching and therapeutic interventions?

           H1: Nursing students' using MC will have a stronger change in the self-assessed level of
           nurse competence than those using standard cooperation (SC).

           H2: Nursing students' using MC will have higher level of nurse competence assessed by
           mentors after clinical practicum than those using SC.

        2. What is the impact of MC on the clinical self-efficacy level of nursing students?

           H3: Nursing students' using mobile cooperation will have a stronger change in the
           self-assessed level of self-efficacy in clinical performance than those using standard
           cooperation.

        3. What is the impact of mobile cooperation on the satisfaction level of nursing students
           evaluated by supervisory relationship, pedagogical atmosphere on the ward and the role
           of nurse teacher?

           H4: Nursing students' using mobile cooperation will have higher level of satisfaction
           with the supervisory relationship, pedagogical atmosphere on the ward and the role of
           nurse teacher after clinical practicum than those using standard cooperation.

        4. What is the perceived usability of the mobile application by the intervention group?

      The ultimate goal is to establish a modern, innovative solution for the nursing student -
      nurse teacher cooperation to support and facilitate the clinical learning of nursing students
      during the clinical practicum.

      The study takes place in surgical and internal medicine wards and related specialties and
      subspecialties in five academic hospitals of one hospital district in Finland.The setting of
      the study have similar learning environments and mentors.

      The sample size was determined with power analysis and the target sample size is 50 subjects
      per group i.e. 100 in total.

      All eligible student participants are identified from the student group lists and the
      employment service database (Jobstep) of the polytechnic.

      Students are recruited by means of direct invitation at the polytechnic. The recruitment is
      continued until number of eligible participants desired is achieved. The mentors from the
      wards, supervising the students during the study, are informed of the study and recruited by
      direct invitations by the researcher.

      Students in the intervention group use MC during the 5 week clinical practicum, while
      participants in the control group use SC.

    <description>The perceived usability of the mobile application is measured by the students with the System Usability Scale, SUS. The intervention is assessed by a structured process evaluation questionnaire at week 5 (after the intervention). The perceived effects and development propositions for the intervention are measured qualitatively at week 6 by a focus group interview (semi-structured questions) with students and at week 16 by student essays (open-ended questions).</description>

    <description>The intervention include (1) use of mobile application in nursing student - nurse teacher (NT) cooperation during the 5 weeks clinical practicum and (2) training at the beginning of the clinical practicum in the functions of the mobile application by the researcher.
Students in the intervention group use mobile application for documentation of the terms of hours, learning diaries, objectives as well as mid-point and end-evaluation during the clinical practicum. NT and students have direct access to documents in the mobile application and to wireless communication regardless of time and place. The actions in the mobile application are automatically saved and shared between student and the NT.</description>
