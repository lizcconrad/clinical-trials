      To compare the clinical effects between the silicone nasolacrimal intubation under
      nasoendoscopy and dacryocystorhinostomy on patients with lacrimal duct obstruction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lacrimal duct obstruction is common among patients with epiphora,which is seriously affect
      the quality of life. The treatment principle is to restore or rebuild the lacrimal duct
      drainage channel. The classic operation type is dacryocystorhinostomy(DCR), which is complex
      for face-section particularly. However, with the development of endoscopy, the investigators
      prefer to the silicone nasolacrimal intubation under nasal endoscopy, which is more simple
      and efficient. With endoscopy, the investigators can see anatomical structures clearly and
      then can perform the operation much more perfectly.Compare to the classic one called DCR, its
      short and long term therapeutic effects are equal and even better.Therefore,the latter type
      does do good to both doctors and patients.

    <description>The silicone nasolacrimal intubation under nasal endoscopy can restore natural drainage pathway in tears and as an out-patient surgery, it is more simple,cheap and mini-invasive.Recessive Spherical Headed Silicone Intubation is safe,convenient and almost unpainful for no trauma.It has no facial scar and no damage for structure and function of lacrimal duct.Besides,silica gel is non-toxic and nonirritating.Nasal endoscopy handed by otorhinolaryngologist helps intraoperative visualization about anatomy of the nasal cavity,understanding and management of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction and is the only method that confirms the correct anatomic position of the catheterization and in real time,avoiding traditionally the blind raking-out wire by the ophthalmologist alone.Compare to the classic DCR,its short therapeutic effects are equal but more convenient and fewer time and money-cost.</description>

The treatment principle is to restore or rebuild the lacrimal duct drainage channel. The classic operation type is dacryocystorhinostomy(DCR), which is complex for face-section particularly.After surgery the lacrimal passage can't siphon the tear out physically any more so that it will effect the patients' life.Besides,the operating time,bleeding volume,hospitalization time and total cost for the surgery is higher.</description>

    <description>Local anesthesia,regular disinfection, spread sterile towels, exposure operative side.2%lidocaine infiltration anesthesia to inferior orbital nerves, lacrimal punctum and lacrimal sac. Nasal cavity was packed with gauze soaked in 2%ephedrine with 1%tetracaine 15 minutes before procedure.A routine silicone tube of spherical intubation was performed. Dilatated lacrimal point to the end, then inserted the probe with line from lacrimal punctum to inferior meatus through nasolacrimal duct.Cut the line and flush the lacrimal duct physiological saline in 5 mL, flowing the line into the inferior meatus, then suctioned out the line with nasal endoscopy and extracted the probe and dilatated the lacrimal duct again. Insert the spherical silicone tube from lacrimal point to the lacrimal sac, reversing to vertical direction to ensure the tube is inserted into the nasolacrimal duct, then catch the above line but cut short the follow one and fix.Unobstructed lacrimal irrigation.</description>

    <description>Surgery was performed under local anesthesia.Incision was taken over anterior lacrimal crest.Medial palpebral ligament was identified.Orbicularis was separated.Reflection of periosteum and dissection of lacrimal sac from lacrimal fossa was done.Sac was excised to make'H'shaped anterior and posterior flaps. Bony osteum of sufficient size was made with bone punch.Nasal mucosa was cut to make anterior and posterior flaps.Subsequently anterior to anterior and posterior to posterior flaps were sutured.</description>
