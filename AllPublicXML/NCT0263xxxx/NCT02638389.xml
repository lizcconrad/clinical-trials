  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3Kinase)/Protein Kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTor) pathway plays a role on the development and the venous/lymphatic vascular
      organisations.

      The investigators want to study the efficacy and the safety of Rapamycin, an mTor inhibitor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The complex vascular malformations induce chronical pains and organic dysfunctions causing
      significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the investigators need to establish
      guidelines in order to treat these pathologies. Standard treatments such as surgery or
      interventional radiology are of limited efficacy and related to a high level of recurrences
      as well as complications. Recent preclinical studies have shown the important role of the
      PI3Kinase/AKT/mTor pathway on the development and the venous/lymphatic vascular organisations
      suggesting an appealing therapeutic target to treat patients with venous, lympathic or
      complex vascular malformations.

      Investigators will realize a multicentric phase III study enrolling a higher number of
      patients to statistically evaluate the efficacy and the safety of the Rapamycin, an mTOR
      inhibitor, in the treatment of children and adults with vascular malformations for which
      conventional therapies such as surgery or sclerotherapy are ineffective or associated with
      high risk of important complications. Nearly 250 patients (200 adults and 50 children) will
      be enrolled in several european centers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with complex vascular anomalies that are refractory to standard care such as
             medical treatment, surgical resection and/or sclerotherapy/embolization (ineffective
             or accompanied by major complications)

          -  Patients must have adequate medullary function: Hemoglobine&gt; 10,0 g/dl, neutrophils
             &gt;1500/mm³ and platelets &gt; 100.000/mm³

          -  Patients must have the following laboratory values:
