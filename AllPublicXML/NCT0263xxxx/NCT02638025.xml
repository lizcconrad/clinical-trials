      This study use anterior segment spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) to exam
      patients with closed globe injury, and compared with slit lamp examination. The results
      showed that OCT can identify features of closed globe injury that were otherwise not visible
      on slit lamp biomicroscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The anterior segment architecture changes of closed globe injury patients include corneal
      damage, hyphema, angle recession and lens dislocation, which can be showed with OCT. OCT was
      superior to slit lamp biomicroscopy examination in detecting anterior segment architecture
      changes, especially in the presence of media opacities.
