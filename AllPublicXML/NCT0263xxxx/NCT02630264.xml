  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recombinant human endostatin adenovirus injection is a novel anti-tumor gene therapy drug.
      E10A contains a recombinant human endostatin gene with the second-generation recombinant
      adenovirus as its vector. After transfection tumor cells. E10A expresses human endostatin,
      which inhibits vascular endothelial cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis, and blocks
      tumor blood supply, thereby specifically inhibiting tumor growth and inducing apoposis of
      tumor cells. Both pre-clinical and animal models have demonstrated the anti-tumor activities
      of E10A. The safety and efficacy of E10A in treating head and neck cancer has also been
      demonstrated in Phase I and Phase II studies.

      Phase II Clinical Study From March 2008 to December 2010 Safety and efficacy of intratumoral
      injections of E10A to cisplatin and paclitaxel was evaluated a multicenter, open-label,
      randomized clinical study in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

      136 eligible patients were recruited and randomly assigned. Patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or nasopharyngeal carcinoma not suitable for
      operation or radiotherapy were randomly assigned to receive E10A plus chemotherapy every 21
      for a maximum of six cycles or to receive chemotherapy only.

      The primary end point was the objective response rate (RR), defined as the proportion of
      patients who had a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at the target tumor
      lesion. The secondary end points were the objective disease control rate (DCR, or stable
      disease (SD) + PR + CR at the target tumor lesion), the overall RR, the overall DCR, OS, and
      progression-free survival (PFS).

      The administration of E10A benefited some subgroups of patients. In the HNSCC patients, the
      objective RR was 36.5% (15/41) with E10A administration, exhibiting a trend of exceeding the
      rate of 20.0% (7/35) in the control group (P = 0.090; OR: 0.43), whereas the objective RR was
      44.4% (12/27) versus 40.6% (13/32) in the NPC patients (P = 0.487; OR: 0.86). Patients who
      had previously received chemotherapy in the E10A group had a 44.8% (12/29) objective RR,
      whereas patients in the control group had only a 22.6% objective RR (7/31; P = 0.06, OR:
      0.36). In contrast, patients without previous chemotherapy had a similar RR in both groups
      (34.3 versus 39.4%; P = 0.426, OR: 1.25).

      The difference in the Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS favored chemotherapy plus E10A, which
      resulted in a 3.43-month improvement. With a median follow-up of 10.47 months, the median PFS
      was 3.60 months (interquartile range: 2.60-7.63) in the control group and 7.03 months
      (interquartile range: 3.27-13.73) in the E10A group. As The median PFS was 3.60 months
      (interquartile range: 2.60-7.63) in the control group and 7.03months (interquartile range:
      3.27-13.73) in the E10A group.

      The OS of the E10A group was relatively prolonged in different subgroups compared with the
      controls (e.g., 13.37 months versus 9.67 months in the HNSCC patients, 13.03 months versus
      10.50 months in those who had received prior treatment; Figure 1), but these results did not
      translate into significantly superior survival.

E10A preparation:
Thaw frozen E10A stored at -20°C vials at room temperature until E10A is liquid.
Swirl gently. Do NOT shake.
Method of administration
E10A was diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride to appropriate dose according to the longest diameter of the target lesion.
After local anesthesia, we penetrated the syringe under normal skin subcutaneously 5 mm into the tumor or vertically into the lymph node under direct visualization and withdrew it to confirm the absence of blood.
Applied local compression for 10 minutes and pasted a sterile sticker on the injection site to avoid bleeding.</description>
