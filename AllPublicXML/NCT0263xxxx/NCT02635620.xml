  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether changing from conventional smoking to
      electronic cigarettes causes changes in conventional lung function parameters, bronchial
      reactivity, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), Carbon monoxide (CO), health effects and
      smoking behaviour.

      STUDY BACKGROUND / RATIONALE / PURPOSE:

      There is still little known about the health effects by vaping electronic cigarettes. Some
      former studies investigated the short term effects of vaping regarding lung function,
      respiratory resistance and FeNO (fractional exhaled nitric oxide). Flouris et al., 2013 did
      not found significant short term effects on conventional lung function parameters. Vardavas
      et al., 2012 also found no short term effects on conventional lung function parameters, but
      an increase of respiratory resistance and a decrease of FeNO. In contrast, Schober et al.,
      2014 observed an increase of FeNO after vaping electronic cigarettes.

      Experimental studies have shown, that electronic cigarettes induce an inflammatory process in
      epithelial cells (Lerner et al., 2015; Wu, Jiang, Minor, and Chu, 2014). Lim and Kim, 2014
      investigated the effects of e-liquids on the airway reactivity and inflammation on allergic
      sensitized mice. Reactivity and inflammation got worse.

      Long term data is still missing. For this purpose we want to investigate lung function,
      airway reactivity, health status and smoking/vaping behaviour in smokers at the time they
      intend to start vaping and after 3 months.

    <description>Probands are smokers who intend to start vaping for the first time. The probands are recruited in e-cigarette shops. It is aimed to include 60 persons who start vaping. A baseline visit at the beginning will measure conventional lung function parameters, mannitol provocation, FeNO and exhaled CO. The measurement will be repeated after 3 months to evaluate changes in these parameters. In addition there will be questionnaires concerning smoking/vaping behaviour and health status at the beginning and after 1, 2 and 3 months.</description>

    <description>Probands are smokers who intend to quit smoking within a clinical conducted smoking cessation program. It is aimed to include 20 persons who stop smoking. Like in the e-cigarette group, a baseline visit at the beginning will measure conventional lung function parameters, mannitol provocation, FeNO and exhaled CO. The measurement will be repeated after 3 months to evaluate changes in these parameters. In addition there will be questionnaires concerning smoking behaviour and health status at the beginning and after 1, 2 and 3 months.</description>
