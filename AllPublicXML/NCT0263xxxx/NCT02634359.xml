  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to collect data to assess the accuracy and reliability of Earlysense
      fertility cycle monitoring performance vs. acceptable known reference methods such as blood
      tests and intra-vaginal Ultrasound currently used as validated methods to detect ovulation
      and pregnancy. In addition the collected data will be used to further enhance and improve the
      existing algorithms.

      The study objective is to assess the accuracy and reliability of Earlysense cycle monitoring
      to detect ovulation and implantation vs. acceptable known reference methods including blood
      tests and Ultrasound examination that are currently used as validated methods to detect
      ovulation and pregnancy. In addition the collected data will be used to further enhance and
