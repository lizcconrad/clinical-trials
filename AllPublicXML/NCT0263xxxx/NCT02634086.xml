    <textblock>
      The study is to determine the long-term outcome of patients with coronary triple vessels
      disease (TVD) in the real world of China, by three different treatment strategies:
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or optimal
      medication therapy (OMT).

      About 10,000 participants will be enrolled into this retrospective study. Study coordinators
      will include both men and women over the age of 18 who had angiographic proved triple-vessel
      disease in a 15 years long-term. Detailed procedural data will be obtained by the study
      coordinator and local principal investigator. These data will be entered into the electronic
      data capture system. Participants will have telephone follow-up interviews conducted by the
      centralized follow-up center at Fuwai Hospital.
