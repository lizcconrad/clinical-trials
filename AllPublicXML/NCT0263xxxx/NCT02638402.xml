      To clarify the critical role of glycosyltransferases, altered Mucins, and RTKs in human
      ovarian and endometrial neoplasms, the study will examine the immunohistochemical expression
      profiles of glycosyltransferases, Mucins and receptor tyrosin kinases (RTKs) family in
      various stages and/or histologic subtypes of human ovarian and endometrial neoplasms and
      tissue microarrays.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glycosylation is a widely utilized chemical modification of proteins and lipids in mammalian
      cells during which saccharide units are covalently attached to the target structures and then
      sequentially elongated and branched - reactions facilitated by a large number of various
      glycosyltransferases. Alterations in this process have been associated with malignant
      transformation. To clarify the critical role of glycosyltransferases, altered Mucins (MUC),
      and RTKs in human ovarian and endometrial neoplasms, the study will examine the
      immunohistochemical expression profiles of glycosyltransferases (including
      β-1,4-Galactosyltransferase 1 (B4GALT1), β-1,4-Galactosyltransferase 3 (B4GALT3),
      β-1,4-N-Acetyl-Galactosaminyl Transferase 3 (B4GALNT3), Polypeptide
      N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (GALNT2), Polypeptide N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 6
      (GALNT6), β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GlcNAcT-III),
      β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GlcNAcT-V), and Glycoprotein-N-Acetylgalactosamine
      3-Beta-Galactosyltransferase 1 (C1GALT1), Mucins (including MUC1, MUC3, MUC15, and MUC20) and
      receptor tyrosin kinases (RTKs) family (including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
      Src, VEGFR, and c-Met) in various stages and/or histologic subtypes of human ovarian and
      endometrial neoplasms and tissue microarrays, and compare them with clinicopathologic factors
      including outcome of the patients.
