  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation remains one of the most common organ transplanted today but the
      surgical technique has changed very little from the original pelvic operation. The deceased
      donor renal transplant poses a particular challenge to the surgeon due to lack of detailed
      pre operative vascular assessment. The hemopatch is a promising new sealing synthetic
      hemostatIc agent with a novel dual mechanism of action that is more convenient to apply
      rather then using other hemostatic agents, which require warming and/or mixing.

    <description>The hemopatch is a promising new sealing synthetic hemostatic agent with a noval dual mechanism of action. The hemopatch is a polyethylene glycol coated (PEG coated) collagen patch. The PEG coating helps in rapid adhesion to the tissue surface while the collagen layer causes platelet activation and adhesion.</description>
