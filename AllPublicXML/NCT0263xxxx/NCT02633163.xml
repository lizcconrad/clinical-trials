    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cells
      (MSCs) obtained from umbilical cords for the treatment of adults with systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE). The goal of this study is to determine if patients receiving an MSC
      infusion plus standard of care respond better than patients receiving placebo infusion plus
      standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A phase 2 multicenter (several medical research centers participating), placebo controlled,
      randomized (assigned by chance), double blind (neither the participant nor the investigator
      will know if active drug or placebo is assigned) trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in
      adults.

      The MSCs will be obtained from healthy donor umbilical cords and two doses of MSCs will be
      tested. The cells will be produced at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and
      will be shipped to other participating centers for patients with SLE. Participants will
      receive either active drug or placebo through a single IV infusion. All participants will
      receive standard of care and their safety will be monitored throughout the study.
