  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine an effective and safe clinical dose of a new
      gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) P03277 injection for Central Nervous System (CNS)
      lesion detection and visualization by conventional steady-state CNS imaging. Therefore,
      Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR), a well-known quantitative parameter directly related to
      contrast medium/GBCA efficacy, has been chosen as the primary endpoint in order to have a
      precise determination of P03277 clinical dose.

      This is a multi-center, international, prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled,
      parallel dose groups, cross-over with comparator study in male and female subjects presenting
      with either known or highly suspected focal areas of disruption of the Blood Brain Barrier
      (BBB) (e.g. primary and secondary tumors, focal inflammatory or demyelination disorders), who
      are scheduled to undergo a routine contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the
      CNS.

      This study will be conducted in approximately 40 centers worldwide.

      Two subsets of subjects will be included in the study:

        -  The first subset will include the first subject of each study center. Subjects will be
           administered at 0.05 or 0.1 mmol/kg body weight (BW) of P03277 and MultiHance®, 0.1
           mmol/kg BW.

        -  The second subset will comprise all other subjects selected by the sites. Subjects will
           be administered at 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 mmol/kg BW of P03277 and 0.1 mmol/kg BW of
           MultiHance®.

      During the course of the study, two MRIs will be obtained from each subject: one unenhanced
      and P03277-enhanced MRI; and one unenhanced and MultiHance®-enhanced MRI. MRI evaluations
      will be performed by on-site investigators and three independent off-site blinded readers.
