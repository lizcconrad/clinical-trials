  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pilates is an exercise system developed over 70 years ago that has been recently received
      attention due to its beneficial effects on postural stability, coordination, muscle strength
      and flexibility. The studies published involving Pilates were very different among them
      regarding intervention period (5, 8, 12 and 24 weeks), frequency (2 and 3 sessions/week) and
      exercises (mat, mat with accessories, apparatus and others combinations), making meaningful
      comparison difficult. Furthermore, other important physical features to maintain an
      independent life at older age, such as cardiorespiratory fitness, were accessed in few
      studies. So, the effective benefits of Pilates method on physical fitness of
      community-dwelling older people remain unclear.
