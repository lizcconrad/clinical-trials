  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a severe form of pulmonary
      hypertension characterized by obstruction of the pulmonary vasculature by residual organized
      thrombi, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), progressive pulmonary
      hypertension, and right failure.

      In patients deemed operable, pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is the gold standard treatment
      and is the only potentially curative treatment. However, some patients are ineligible for
      surgery owing to occlusion of distal vessels. The best treatment option for these
      non-operable CTEPH patients is not yet established.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, riociguat is the only drug approved in Europe and US for the treatment of
      non-operable CTEPH. However, medical therapy with riociguat does not address obstructive
      lesions. In this sense, another treatment option, balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA), began
      recently to gain widespread interest after development in several centers. This procedure
      uses the standard balloon angioplasty technique to dilate selected pulmonary arteries. The
      main aim is to reopen vessels occluded by webs and bands. Several teams, mainly from Japan,
      have reported their experiences with BPA for the treatment of non-operable CTEPH and
      demonstrated impressive decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance and improvement in
      functional status and exercise capacity with an acceptable procedure-related risk. Although
      BPA has never been prospectively evaluated, most of the leading CTEPH centers worldwide have
      currently added BPA to their therapeutic options. However, no randomized controlled trial
      comparing safety and efficacy of medical therapy with riociguat versus pulmonary balloon
      angioplasty has been performed so far. Therefore, the respective places of medical treatment
      and of BPA in the management of inoperable patients with CTEPH need to be further evaluated.
