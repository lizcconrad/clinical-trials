      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of multiple
      doses of gemcabene 600 mg QD compared to placebo in patients with hypercholesterolemia not
      adequately controlled on high-intensity or moderate-intensity stable statin therapy. Patients
      with HeFH, ASCVD, or otherwise uncontrolled, may be included with baseline LDL-C value ≥ 100
      mg/dL. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to gemcabene 600 mg QD or placebo.
