  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of combining chemotherapy at different
      doses with a specific type of radiation therapy delivered to the entire lining of the lung to
      find out what effects, if any, it has on people. This radiation technique is called pleural
      intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). IMRT specifically targets the lining of the
      lung (pleura) where the cancer is and reduces the risk of damaging the lung itself. When
      given after chemotherapy, pleural IMRT has demonstrated promising results with respect to
      keeping mesothelioma under control longer. However, the investigators want to determine if
      giving pleural IMRT at the same time as chemotherapy is safe. If safe, further studies will
      be done to see if chemotherapy and pleural IMRT given at the same time keeps the tumor under
      control for a longer period of time than chemotherapy followed by pleural IMRT.

    <description>This is a single institution phase I study of pemetrexed/cisplatin given concurrently with pleural intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). All patients will receive pleural intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3-6 at each dose level of pemetrexed/cisplatin, and dose escalation will proceed in a standard 3+3 fashion until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is identified.</description>

    <description>Dose escalation of pemetrexed and cisplatin will follow the dose levels. The escalation will not exceed 500 mg/m^2 for pemetrexed in combination with 75 mg/m^2 of cisplatin even if the maximum tolerated dose is not identified. Each treatment cycle of chemotherapy will be 21 days. Patients will receive up to 2 cycles of chemotherapy during the radiation, and be followed for any DLT during the radiation therapy and for 12 weeks afterwards.</description>

    <description>Pleura intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) will be administered over approximately 6 weeks at 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. The prescription radiation dose may anywhere between 45 and 50.4 Gy in 25 fractions if necessary to meet the normal tissue dose constraints.</description>
