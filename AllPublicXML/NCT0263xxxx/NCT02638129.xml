      The purpose of this study is to evaluate cardiovascular (CV) safety of naltrexone
      hydrochloride (HCl) and bupropion HCl extended release combination (NB) compared with placebo
      and rule out excess risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) when given in
      combination with standard of care in overweight and obese participants with documented
      history of CV disease.

      The drug being evaluated in this study is naltrexone hydrochloride (HCl) and bupropion HCl
      extended release combination (NB). NB is being evaluated in this study to rule out excess
      cardiovascular risk. This study will evaluate the occurrence of major adverse CV events in
      participants who take NB compared with placebo given in combination with standard of care in
      overweight and obese participants with documented history of CV disease.

      The study will enroll approximately 8800 patients. After a 2-week lead-in period evaluating
      tolerance to NB (participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 week of NB [1 tablet
      per day] followed by 1 week of placebo [1 tablet per day] or 1 week of placebo followed by 1
      week of NB), participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups in a 1:1
      ratio, which will remain undisclosed to the patient, study site personnel, and
      investigator/study physician during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Naltrexone HCl 8 mg/bupropion 90 mg extended release combination tablets

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take tablet(s) in the AM and PM at the same time each day
      throughout the study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 6 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the
      clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 30 days after last dose of study drug for a
      follow-up assessment.
