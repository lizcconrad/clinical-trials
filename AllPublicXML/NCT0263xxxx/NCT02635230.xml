      The optimal antithrombotic therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with a
      CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥1 with concomitant acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or revascularisation by
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting, is still unknown. For these patients
      current North American and European guidelines recommend a triple therapy strategy, including
      vitamin K antagonists (VKA), aspirin and clopidogrel. A major drawback of this triple therapy
      strategy is a significant increase in the risk of major bleeding. Furthermore, the ommitance
      of aspirin and the introduction of more potent P2Y12 inhibitors as well as the non-vitamin K
      oral anticoagulants (NOAC), created numerous new antithrombotic treatment strategies for
      these patients with overlapping conditions. To date, evidence on the risks and benefits of
      these new antithrombotic treatment strategies is lacking.

      The WOEST 2 Registry aims to improve medical care for patients with AF and/or a heart valve
      prosthesis ánd undergoing coronary revascularisation through a better understanding of their
      demographics, antithrombotic management and related in-hospital and long-term outcomes. The
      WOEST 2 Registry will provide data to support benchmarking of antithrombotic treatment
      patterns and patient outcomes.

      Objective: To assess the different management patterns and related in-hospital and long-term
      safety and efficacy outcomes of combined use of chronic oral anticoagulation and a P2Y12
      inhibitor in patients with atrial fibrillation and/or a heart valve prosthesis undergoing
      coronary revascularisation.

        WOEST2 Registry is designed to recruit an unselected cohort of patients with AF and/or a
        heart valve prosthesis undergoing coronary revascularisation (PCI/CABG) within at least
        three European countries (Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom). The three international
        cohorts of patients reflect the spectrum of our study population within the geographic
        catchment regions. At least 15 hospitals of varying size and characteristics will
        participate in this study.
