      The purpose of the study is to test the effectiveness of two different weight loss
      interventions. Both of these interventions will provide weight loss information through twice
      weekly audio podcasts. In addition to the podcasts, participants will be asked to track their
      diet using either a wearable device on their wrist or through an app on their smartphone.

      This study will last approximately 6 months. Participants will attend one 1-hour orientation
      meeting at the beginning of the study and a 2-hour baseline assessment and training meeting.
      Additional assessments will be conducted at 3 months and 6 months. Weekly questionnaires will
      be administered. Everyone in the study will be asked to listen to 2 podcasts per week. Each
      of the podcasts will take about 15 - 20 minutes to listen to and so participants should
      expect to spend 30 - 40 minutes each week listening to podcasts. Participants will also be
      randomized to either track diet with an app on their smartphone or using a device they wear
      on their wrist. Each week, participants will be sent an email as a reminder on how to use
      their diet tracking device. They will also be encouraged to monitor their exercise and body
      weight.
