    <textblock>
      Monitoring and self-management are important components of effective chronic disease care and
      improved patient outcomes. With the rapid development of integration of mobile health
      technology (mHealth) into health care delivery services, mHealth intervention provides a
      great opportunity to improve the efficiency of chronic disease management. However, little is
      known about whether mHealth interventions can effectively impact the health and health care
      outcomes in underserved populations. This pilot study will assess the preliminary
      effectiveness of a mobile-based health intervention in an urban underserved community with a
      high incidence of hypertension. It is hypothesized that patients with hypertension will
      experience improved outcomes due to the use of a mHealth application compared with patients
      who are not using the application. The findings from this study will advance our
      understanding of the utility of mHealth interventions among underserved populations and
      generate evidence to support this new health care delivery approach in underserved urban
      communities.

      In this study, three hypotheses will be tested:

        1. Hypertension patients using the mHealth application exhibit a greater decrease in blood
           pressure and better maintenance over a 6-month period compared to those who receive
           standard care.

        2. Hypertension patients using the mHealth application will exhibit more effective
           self-management as compared to those who receive standard care.

        3. Utilizing the mHealth application helps nurses to monitor hypertension status more
           effectively than monitoring hypertension status without the mHealth application.

      A mixed study design will be utilized. This study will have two steps, implementation and
      evaluation. In implementation, a pilot version of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be
      utilized to examine BP decline and BP maintenance with 30 participants assigned either to
      standard care and treatment (the standard follow-up group) or to the standard care plus
      mHealth (the mHealth group). In evaluation, improved quality of life, patient self‐efficacy,
      greater treatment adherence, reduced hospital utilization, and health providers' feedback
      will be assessed through surveys and a group interview.

      Step 1: Implementation A pilot version of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be
      utilized to examine hypothesis 1. A parallel-group 6-month study design will be utilized, in
      which 30 participants will be randomly assigned either to the standard follow-up group or the
      mHealth group. Jordan &amp; Harris Community Health Center's (J&amp;HCHC) nurse will help to identify
      and random selected patients, nurses will not be blinded in this study, each nurse will keep
      monitoring their patients from both groups.

      Based on the J&amp;HCHC's current practice, all hypotension patients are required to visit the
      nurses for their regular hypertension care every week. Therefore, all participants in this
      study will be asked to visit J&amp;HCHC once a week for the 6-month period as usual. The standard
      follow-up group will receive regular hypertension care as usual which consists: nursing
      assessment, medication management, patient education, follow up and continuing care. Home
      monitoring is a great way to help detect and monitor high blood pressure. The mHealth group
      will ask to use iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor on a daily basis at HOME
      and also will be asked to visit J&amp;HCHC once a week to receive the regular hypertension care
      for the 6-month period as usual. After all participants complete their 6-month study, the
      study data will be collected from Electronic Health Record (McKesson) and patient's mobile
      devices.

      In this study, a FDA 510K approved device, iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor
      (iHealth Lab Inc.), will be utilized for the mHealth group. This is a fully automatic wrist
      cuff blood pressure monitor that uses the oscillometric principle to measure blood pressure
      and pulse rate. The monitor works with mobile devices to test, track and share vital blood
      pressure data. There are no physical risks associated with using this device to take the
      blood pressure at home. Besides the FDA 510K approval, iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure
      Wrist Monitor has also CE medical certification (Europe) and ESH Certification (European
      Society of Hypertension). iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor works with both
      Apple and Android devices. Apple iOS devices requires iOS version 5.0 or higher and Android
      devices requires operating system 3.0 or later.

      iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor can maintain a maximum of 10,000
      measurements or three years of usage. In addition, iHealth BP7-Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist
      Monitor has a Bluetooth sync system that will pair with both Apple and Android devices. The
      synchronization allows the monitor to send systolic and diastolic blood pressures and pulse
      rate to patients' mobile devices. The free iHealth MyVitals app then automatically keeps a
      history of BP data and gives patient the option to share their blood pressure data
      information with their healthcare provider. In addition to keep the data on the mobile
      device, patient also receive a free and secure cloud account. Vital data on the cloud allows
      patients to access from any computer and to share readings with their healthcare provider, if
      they choose to do so. With this type of information available, patients will be able to do
      self-management and nurses will be able to actively provide intervention activities.
      Conceptual diagram for iHealth BP-7 Wireless Blood Pressure Wrist Monitor device, apps and
      cloud sever are presented in research protocol

      Step 2: Evaluation

      The outcome evaluation for this study will be immediately started when the 6-month
      implementation step completed. The evaluation will be conducted from both patients and
      nurses. During this evaluation step, Hypothesis 2 and 3 will be tested. For hypothesis 2
      improved quality of life, patient self‐efficacy, greater treatment adherence, and reduced
      hospital utilization will be evaluated by the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF‐36) and
      Medication Adherence Self‐Efficacy Scale (MASES). All participate patients will be asked to
      complete these two surveys; the completion of two surveys will be approximately 10- 15
      minutes.

      For hypothesis 3, hypertension status monitoring experiences and feedbacks from health
      provider will be assessed by administering a group interview to five community nurses. This
      group interview also will be immediately conducted when the implementation step completed.
      This group interview will be approximately 90 minutes. Study principal investigator or
      co-principal investigator will lead this group interview. A group interview guide will be
      used to guide the process, and the entire interview will be audiotaped by digital recorder,
      and transcribed.
