      The objectives of the trial are to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of HORIZANT
      (Gabapentin Enacarbil) 600 mg daily, for the treatment of RLS in adolescents (13 to 17 years
      of age) diagnosed with moderate-to-severe primary RLS.

      Patients who complete the 12-week daily dosing efficacy and safety study (XP109) will be
      allowed to enroll in the open-label extension (OLE) study (XP110), thereby providing exposure
      to HORIZANT for up to 48 weeks. Enrolled patients will take open-label HORIZANT 600 mg
      tablets once a day at approximately 5 PM with food, beginning at Week 0 of the OLE study up
      to and including Week 36. After the end of the treatment period, a follow-up visit will be
      included 14 days (± 3 days) after the last dose of HORIZANT. Patients will visit the clinical
      site on 6 different occasions, including a follow-up visit 14 days (± 3 days) after the last
      dose of study drug.
