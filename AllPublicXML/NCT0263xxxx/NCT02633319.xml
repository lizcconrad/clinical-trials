    <textblock>
      The Malezi ne Kilimo Bora (&quot;Good Parenting and Farming&quot; in Kiswahili) Skilful Parenting and
      Agribusiness Child Abuse Prevention Study is a collaboration between the University of
      Oxford, University of Glasgow, and the Tanzania National Medical Research Institute (NIMR).
      It is pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) of a community-based intervention
      implemented by Investing in Children and Our Societies (ICS), an international
      non-governmental organization (NGO) with extensive experience operating in rural Tanzania.
      The overall focus of the project is to evaluate ICS's agribusiness and skilful parenting
      programmes' impact on the prevention of child maltreatment and improvement of child and
      family psychosocial and economic wellbeing (n = 8 villages, n = 16 farmer groups, n = 240
      families).

      Background on Child Maltreatment in Tanzania

      Child maltreatment and other childhood adversities often occur in many low- and middle-income
      countries at rates that are higher than in high-income countries - rates that often exceed
      50%. In Tanzania, a national survey examining violence against children (VAC) found that
      almost 73.5% of females and 71.7% of males between the ages of 13 and 24 had experienced
      physical violence by prior to the age of 18. Furthermore, 23.6% of females and 27.5% of males
      had experienced emotional violence by an adult during childhood, and 27.9% of females and
      13.4% of males had experienced some form of sexual violence before the age of 18 years. In
      addition, the survey identified an overlap among physical, emotional, and sexual violence
      against children. Approximately 80% of respondents who experienced sexual violence also
      experienced physical violence as a child, and nearly all children who experienced physical
      violence also experienced emotional violence. The VAC study also found that parents and other
      adult relatives are the most commonly reported perpetrators of physical and emotional
      violence against children, with corporal punishment considered a social norm.

      Recent advances in neuroscience, genomics, developmental psychology, epidemiology, and
      economics have shed light on the long-term and far-reaching consequences of childhood
      adversities, many of which, like child maltreatment, are directly related to poor parenting.
      These consequences include serious physical and mental health problems later in life, as well
      as difficulties in school, jobs, and relationships. Child maltreatment can have substantial
      intergenerational effects in which some parents who experienced maltreatment during childhood
      are more vulnerable to the risk of maltreating their own children. Child maltreatment is also
      a risk factor for later intimate partner violence, increased risk of HIV-infection, and
      transactional sex amongst AIDS-affected youth. Furthermore, not only is child maltreatment a
      serious public health and human rights issue, but it comes at an economic cost due to
      expenses relating to the treatment of victims' health problems, criminal justice and welfare
      costs, and lower economic productivity.

      The risks factors of child maltreatment can be best understood using an ecological framework.
      A recent review of 23 quantitative studies in Africa by Meinck et al identified a number of
      child, family, and social risk factors for child maltreatment. Child factors associated with
      increased likelihood of physical abuse included younger children, boys, children with
      disability or chronic illness, child behaviour problems, and school non-attendance and poor
      performance. Family-level factors include caregiver chronic illness, HIV/AIDS, caregiver
      mental health problems, caregiver disability, domestic violence, substance abuse, poor family
      functioning, and inconsistent parenting. Finally, household poverty and low socioeconomic
      status was found to be a major factor for increased risk of child abuse, as well as
      indirectly through increased family stress and reduced parental involvement.

      Parenting Programmes to Prevent Child Maltreatment

      Parenting programmes have shown particular promise in preventing child maltreatment and other
      childhood adversities and averting many of the life-long negative consequences for children
      and society. A recent meta-analysis reported that parenting programs successfully reduced
      substantiated and self-reported child maltreatment reports and reduced the potential for
      child maltreatment, both in high and middle-income countries. Often group-based, these
      programmes typically aim to strengthen caregiver-child relationships through play and praise,
      and to help parents to manage children's behaviour through effective, age-appropriate,
      positive discipline strategies. However, almost all the evidence for their effectiveness
      comes from high-income countries and they often cost many thousands of dollars per family
      served. They are thus prohibitively expensive for most governments and NGOs in low- and
      middle-income countries. Furthermore, their license-holders have been reluctant to implement
      them in such settings due to what they perceive as lack of the requisite infrastructure and
      trained personnel. In sum, there are currently no parenting programmes that are both
      evidence-based and affordable for low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), where the need is
      the greatest.

      Economic Strengthening Programmes

      Household poverty has also been identified as a risk factor for parental psychological
      distress and depression as well as physical and emotional child abuse. Consequently, in
      addition to improving parenting behaviour, in order to reduce the risk of child maltreatment,
      it may be necessary to address issues of poverty through economic strengthening programmes.
      These programmes include micro-financing, conditional and unconditional cash transfers, and
      agricultural interventions that provide skills training, credit loans, access to markets.
      However, there is still little empirical evidence on the benefits of an integrated approach
      of economic strengthening and parenting interventions. It may be sufficient to provide parent
      management training alone as a key mechanism of change in improving parent-child
      relationships and reducing the risk of child maltreatment. For instance, a recent
      meta-analysis by Leijten et al found that parenting programs were equally effective for
      socioeconomically disadvantaged families in comparison to non-disadvantaged families. On the
      other hand, some evidence suggests that families require additional support that addresses
      other social risk factors including poverty and material hardship. Furthermore, economic
      strengthening programs may in fact harm children if not combined with adequate child
      protection. Other research in East Africa indicates linkages between economic strengthening
      programs and child wellbeing, as well as the importance of integrating such interventions
      with psychosocial support. Nevertheless, more research is needed to understand the role of
      economic strengthening programs and parent management training in reducing on the risk of
      child maltreatment, as well as the utility of using a combined approach.

      Study Aims and Design

      This study aims to contribute to the literature on the prevention and reduction of child
      maltreatment in northern Tanzania. It will evaluate ICS's community-based intervention model
      that combines Agribusiness and Skilful Parenting training using a pilot cluster randomized
      controlled trial design (cRCT) in order to test intervention feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary efficacy. It will enable us to conduct both a process and rigorous outcome
      evaluation using a mixed-methods approach with qualitative focus groups and in-depth
      interviews combined with quantitative implementation data and self-report questionnaires.

      This pilot cRCT will randomly allocate 8 villages (16 farmer groups, 2 farmer groups per
      village, 240 families, 20 families per farmer group) into the following four allocation
      groups (2 villages per allocation group):

        1. Agribusiness only

        2. Skilful Parenting only

        3. Agribusiness plus Skilful Parenting

        4. One-year wait-list control

      For villages allocated to Agribusiness only, Skilful Parenting only, and/or the wait-list
      control group, participating farmer groups and families will have the opportunity to
      participate in the other intervention components after the final follow-up data assessment
      (1-year after baseline) provided that analysis of the results do not indicate any harmful
      effects.

      This study will examine preliminary intervention effects comparing intervention arms with the
      wait-list control group as well as among active arms (Proschan, 1999). Although our focus
      will be on the effect of economic strengthening combined with parenting programs on reducing
      the risk of child maltreatment and improve child wellbeing, the investigators will also be
      examining the potential benefits of Skilful Parenting or Agribusiness programs delivered
      separately in comparison to controls.

      This study will qualitatively and quantitatively examine intervention effects on parent-child
      interaction and child behaviour across the developmental spectrum. This includes (1) parents'
      report on interactions with a selected child between the ages of 3 to 17, (2) child report on
      parent-child interaction, child mental health, and child behaviour for families with children
      aged 10 to 16, and (3) early childhood development assessments in families with children aged
      0 to 3. The investigators will also examine the feasibility (acceptability, implementation,
      and participation) of the Agribusiness and Skilful Parenting interventions.

      Quantitative data collection will occur at 3 stages: baseline, immediate post-test, and
      1-year follow-up from baseline. The investigators will use descriptive and psychometric
      scales to measure family socioeconomic status, parent-child interaction (including child
      maltreatment or harsh parenting), parent mental health, child depression and behaviour, early
      child development and stimulation, and child biometric data. Quantitative data collection
      will include parent report assessments for families with children aged 3 to 17, child report
      assessments for families with children aged 10 to 16, and early childhood development
      assessments for families with children aged 0 to 3. As a result, each participating family
      will have a maximum of 3 assessments per data collection stage.

      Qualitative data will be collected from multiple sources using focus groups and in-depth
      interviews to strengthen the reliability of results: participating parents and co-parents,
      children, and facilitators. Focus groups (n=4) with participating families in the
      intervention arms will occur in local community centers at immediate post-test. In-depth
      interviews will take place at participants' homes with a targeted selection of participating
      parents, co-parents, and children (aged 10-16) at immediate post-test. In addition, focus
      groups will be conducted with program facilitators (n=8) at immediate post-test. Additional
      data will be collected from participants who drop out of the programme or have low attendance
      rates to examine barriers to participation.

      Quantitative process data will be collected using trained staff responsible for monitoring
      programme facilitators. Weekly facilitator fidelity checklists will be administered after
      each session of Skillful Parenting. Research staff will also collect data on participant
      enrolment, participation, and engagement using attendance registers and client satisfaction
      surveys administered the end of program completion. This will allow us to quantitatively
      examine predictors of programme enrolment, participation, and dropout as well as potential
      risk factors for withdrawal from the intervention.

    <time_frame>Baseline; 6-Months Follow-Up; 12-Months Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>Child abuse will be measured using adapted versions of the ISPCAN Child Abuse Screening Tool-Parent version (ICAST-P), a multi-national and consensus-based survey instrument measuring the incidence and prevalence of child abuse and neglect. This 19-item scale ICAST-P was validated in 6 LMIC and 7 languages (α = 0.77-0.88) and measures four types of abuse: physical, emotional and sexual abuse, as well as neglect. In this study, the response code was adapted to a frequency scale from 0 to more than 8 times as certain behaviour occurred in the past month. In this study, incidence child maltreatment will be scored as dichotomous variables for physical, verbal, and sexual abuse, as well as an overall indication of previous child abuse (0 = no abuse; 1 = previous abuse). The investigators will also assess frequency of overall abuse by summing all of the subscales as well as for each individual subscale.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; 6-Months Follow-Up; 12-Months Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>Parent-child interaction, will be measured using the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ) - Adult Report (37 items). The APQ contains five subscales assessing Positive Parenting (8 items), Parent Involvement (8 items), Inconsistent Discipline (11 items), Poor Supervision (10 items). The APQ has been shown to have moderate to strong internal reliability for both parent and child reports (Cronbach's α = 0.50 to 0.89). It has been used widely including in LMIC such as South Africa and Mexico. Caregivers report on the frequency of parenting behaviour based on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = never; 3 = Often, more than 5 times). Items are summed to create total frequency score (range 0 to 81) as well as for each subscale.</description>

    <description>Parenting stress will be assessed using the Parental Stress Scale (PSS; 18 items). PSS has been widely used to measure parenting stress, including in LMIC, such as Pakistan and China. The scale has also been used with non-parent caregivers such as grandparents. Caregivers report current positive attitudes (n = 8, e.g., &quot;I feel close to my child&quot;) and negative attitudes (n = 10, e.g., &quot;I feel overwhelmed by the responsibility of being a parent&quot;) related to parenting stress based on a five-point Likert scale (0 = strongly disagree; 4 = strongly agree). Positive items are reversed and then all items are summed to create a total parenting stress score (range 0 to 90).</description>

    <description>The Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (20 items) has been widely used throughout LMIC to assess self-report screening of adult depression. This was used in previous studies in sub-Saharan Africa of caregivers with strong reliability (α = .91). Caregivers report on the frequency of depressive symptoms in the previous week (0 to 7 times, e.g., &quot;I thought my life was a failure&quot;). Items are summed to create an overall depression score.</description>

    <description>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire has been used previously in Tanzania and has officially been translated into Kiswahili. It examines prosocial behaviour, conduct problems, hyperactivity-inactivity, peer problems, and emotional problems. The investigators also added a 5-item subscale to assess local cultural norms of child behaviour regarding respectability, or Hashima (e.g., &quot;My child's behaviour brings embarrassment to my family&quot;). Items are summed for each subscale (range 0 to 10). Behaviour problem subscales are also summed to create a total child behaviour problems score (0 to 50).</description>

    <description>The Revised Conflict Tactics Scale Short Form (CTS2S; 10 items) measures exposure to intimate partner physical and psychological violence (IPV). Assessments use adult self-report on the frequency of negotiation, physical assault, psychological aggression, sexual coercion, and physical injury. Answers are coded on a 5-point Likert scale of 0 to 4 (0 = never happened; 4 = more than 3 times in the past month). The CTS2S will determine an overall indication of IPV on a level of severity (sum of items) and prevalence (dichotomous variable indicating experience of conflict or not) as well as for each subscale. The CTS2S has been used extensively in studies on IPV in sub-Saharan Africa. The original validation study showed strong internal consistency (α = .89).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; 6-Months Follow-Up; 12-Months Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>Adult report of child involvement in labour will be measured using items from the UNICEF MICS Household Survey. This 6-item questionnaire asks caregivers whether their child was involved in farm work, running or helping to run a business, production of goods for sales, collection of firewood, or other household activities. It also assesses the amount of hours per week that the child is involved in each household task.</description>

    <description>Relative poverty will be assessed using 3 items from the Hunger Scale Questionnaire. These items examine food shortage and hunger in the household. Parents respond positively or negatively regarding the occurrence of hunger during the past 30 days and whether it occurred more than 5 times (e.g., &quot;the household has run out of money to by food&quot;). The scale produces scores for single occurrence and intensity of hunger.</description>

    <description>In order to assess the impact of agribusiness training, household agricultural assets will be measured using 8 items from the UNICEF MICS Household Survey. Caregivers will be asked if the household owns land for farming and, if so, how many acres (individually, not collectively). They will also be asked which animals they own and how many (e.g., cattle).</description>

    <description>Household assets will be assessed using items from the Economic Asset Index (9-items). The Economic Asset Index (EAI) measures relative household poverty based on methodology used in the Demographic Health Survey (DHS). This measurement has been used in over 55 countries, including Tanzania, and by the World Bank to asses relative poverty from a variety of factors. Instead of directly measuring poverty by income, the EAI examines adult reports of household ownership of consumer goods (cell phone, radio, car, etc.) and access to utilities and running water.</description>

    <measure>Change in Early Childhood Home Environment - Observed and Adult Report</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 6-Months Follow-Up; 12-Months Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>Observed early childhood home environment will be assessed using the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) assessment tool for infants and toddlers aged 0 to 3 years (44 items). It combines interview and observational items to assess the quality of family environment and engagement in child rearing. The scale includes 6 subscales: responsiveness (11 items), acceptance (7 items), organisation (6 items), play/learning materials (9 items), involvement (6 items), and variety of experience (5 items). The investigators eliminated one item on whether the family has a pet since it was considered culturally irrelevant. Double negative items on the Acceptance subscale were reversed to simplify the constructs. Assessors record whether the parent either reports the behaviour occurring or the behaviour is observed during the interview (0 = no; 1 = yes). Items are summed on each subscale as well as for an overall score on home environment stimulation and responsiveness.</description>

    <measure>Change in Child Development - Adult Report</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 6-Months Follow-Up; 12-Months Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>Child development will be assessed using the parent-report version of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire Version 3 (ASQ-3). This screening tool measures infant and toddler development from 2 months to 60 months (5 years) of age according to the following developmental domains: communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem-solving, and personal social skills. Each domain has 6 items (30 items in total). Distinct questionnaires are administered according to the child's age in 2-month intervals rounded to the nearest interval. The ASQ-3 is administered via caregiver self-report based on &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;Sometime,&quot; or &quot;Not Yet&quot; for each developmental milestone. In addition, if the caregiver is not sure of a specific item, they are given the opportunity to perform the task with their infant or toddler. The entire assessment takes approximately 20 minutes. Items for each subscale are summed to create total scores as well as an overall indication of child development.</description>

    <measure>Change in Infant/Toddler Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 6-Months Follow-Up; 12-Months Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>Child weight will be determined using a 25 kg Salter hanging scale (Weighing equipment, High Holborn, London, United Kingdom) with the child in light clothes and no shoes. A standard beam balance (SECA) will be used in weighing the young infants. The readings will be recorded to the nearest 0.1kg. Calibration of weighing scale to zero will be performed every day during the assessment period. A known 1kg weight will be used to standardize the scales every day for accuracy and consistency.</description>

    <measure>Change in Infant/Toddler Height</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 6-Months Follow-Up; 12-Months Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>Child height will be measured using a length board. Children will be placed lying shoeless in the supine position on the board with their heads placed at 900 to the fixed head piece. Research assistants will straighten the legs of the child at the knees and ensured that feet were at right angle to the sliding foot piece, which will be brought into contact to the child's heels. Child length will be recorded to the nearest 0.1 centimeters.</description>
