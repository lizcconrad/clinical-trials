  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of patients 60 and older with breast cancer is increasing as our population ages.
      Despite the fact that the majority of breast cancers occur in patients 60 and over, these
      patients are consistently under-represented in clinical trials. Because patients 60 and older
      are an under-studied group, investigators do not have detailed information on the side
      effects and experiences for these patients receiving chemotherapy. Understanding the side
      effects patients receiving chemotherapy experience is an important part of this study.

      In addition, past research has shown that having poor social support can affect quality of
      life, mood, and outcomes for people with cancer. However, few studies in the past have
      focused on improving the quality of life and support systems that patients have while they
      receive treatment.

      This research study is evaluating how engaging in an online support community may improve the
      experience of older patients receiving chemotherapy.

      This clinical trial will evaluate how an on-line health information sharing community of
      patients called PatientsLikeMe, www.patientslikeme.com, [or &quot;PLM&quot;] may help patients feel
      better supported during treatment. This study will also evaluate how much PLM can help
      collect information on side effects from chemotherapy and endocrine treatments, and radiation
      therapy.

          -  Participants must be women â‰¥60 years age with histologically or cytologically
             confirmed, stage I-III breast cancer with a treatment plan that includes any
             neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy(either in the context of standard treatment or a
             clinical trial and including chemotherapy, treatments targeting the human epidermal

             and/or radiation, patients must enroll within 6 months of diagnosis of breast cancer,
             defined as the date of initial biopsy. Patient may be receiving hormonal therapy,
             radiation therapy, or both at the same time of enrollment, (3) Patients who did not
