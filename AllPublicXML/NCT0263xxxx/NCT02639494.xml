      An evaluation of the feasibility of using the Self-Centering Guide Catheter to deliver a
      guide wire across a stenotic native aortic valve into the left ventricle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, open-label, single-arm feasibility study evaluating the Self-Centering Guide
      Catheter. All subjects who are candidates for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
      of a native valve with a transcatheter aortic valve that is introduced percutaneously via the
      femoral artery using conventional catheterization techniques will be evaluated for enrollment
      in this study. The Self-Centering Guide Catheter is intended to facilitate delivery of a
      guidewire across a stenotic native aortic valve and into the left ventricle.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Subject (or legal guardian) understands the study requirements and the treatment
             procedures and provides written informed consent before any study-specific tests or
             procedures are performed.

          -  Subject is eligible for and is an acceptable candidate for transcatheter aortic valve
             replacement of a stenotic (aortic valve area ≤1 cm2, aortic jet velocity ≥4.0 m/s, or
             mean gradient ≥40 mmHg) native valve with a transcatheter aortic valve that is
             introduced percutaneously via the femoral artery using conventional catheterization
             techniques.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has known hypersensitivity to the components of the device (e.g., polyether
             block amide, fluoropolymers, nickel, platinum, tantalum, titanium).

          -  Subject has a pre-existing prosthetic aortic valve.
