    <textblock>
      The proposed trial a &quot;Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled &quot;first in-human&quot; Study to
      Assess the Safety and Tolerability of Single Ascending Oral Doses of PBF-677 in Male Healthy
      Volunteers&quot; (Protocol Code No:CUNFI-1509 EudraCT No:2015-003546-57) will be a single-centre,
      randomized, double-blind, dose escalation study without therapeutic benefit, in which PBF-677
      will be administered as single, oral, ascending-dose to volunteers.

      Up to four different rising doses (100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg) will be tested in
      groups of 8 participants; in each dose level participants will be randomized to active drug
      or placebo in a 6:2 fashion. As this will be the first time that PBF-677 in going to be
      administered to humans, as a safety measure a stepwise drug administration will be performed
      in each cohort. The volunteers of each cohort will be divided in 3 blocks/subgroups:
      Initially, one volunteer will receive active drug (subgroup 1). After 48h of safety and
      tolerability assessment, a second subgroup of 3 volunteers will receive 2 active drug and 1
      placebo and after further 48h of safety and tolerability assessments a third subgroup of 4
      volunteers will receive 3 active drug and 1 placebo. After evaluation of safety, parameters
      of corresponding dose level the process will replicate one week afterwards in the following
      dosages.

      The principal variable safety and tolerability of PBF-677 will be evaluated with physical
      records (Electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, blood chemistry and haematology, conducted
      before, during and after study course). Assessment of the pharmacokinetic profile (Maximum
      plasma concentration of the drug (peak) after single dose (Cmax),Time necessary to reach Cmax
      (tmax), Area under the time-concentration curve to &quot;zero&quot; to time &quot;t&quot; (AUC0t), and
      Elimination half-life (t1/2) of PBF-677 will be included as secondary variable.
