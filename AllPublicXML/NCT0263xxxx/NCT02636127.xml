  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is an auto-immune systemic disease characterized by vascular damage,
      cutaneous and visceral fibrosis and a dysimmune condition.

      Therapies in this disease remain insufficient and the complications resulting from organs
      involvement lead to strong morbi-mortality.The dermic infiltrate of the patients includes a
      strong proportion of Tcells. T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells are potentially involved
      in the vascular damage of the SSc. However mechanisms at the onset of this endothelial
      cytotoxicity and its impact on the capacities of regeneration of the endothelial tissue
      remain poorly understood. Fractalkine is at the same time an endothelial membrane-bound
      adhesion molecule and a chemokine which is able to bind CX3CR1 expressed by the immune
      populations. The purpose of the project is to define the role displayed by cytotoxic,
      circulating immune populations of SSc patients in endothelial cytotoxicity as well as the
      role of the axis Fractalkine / CX3CR1 in mediating the interactions between the immune
      cytotoxic cells and the endothelium.
