          -  Subjects who have a history or current evidence of malignant biliary obstruction
             requiring biliary stent.

          -  Subjects who have had solid organ or bone marrow Transplantation.

             non-healing wound unrelated to the primary Tumor.

          -  Subjects who have received systemic cancer therapy, radiotherapy, investigational drug
             treatment outside of this study within 4 weeks before the start of study treatment,
             granulocyte colony stimulating factors, (G-CSF) or granulocyte macrophage-stimulating
             factors (GM-CSF), erythropoietin-stimulating agents within 3 weeks before the start of
             general screening, drugs with known renal toxicity and strong cytochrome P450 3A4
             (CYP3A4) inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers within 2 weeks before the treatment.
