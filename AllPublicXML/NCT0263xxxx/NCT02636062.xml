    <textblock>
      This study is a non-randomized prospective cohort study that will define the rate of index
      atherosclerotic plaque development in adults with a prior coronary artery calcium (CAC) score
      of 0 given prior CAC zero &gt; 5 years previous. Ancillary testing of serum, whole blood, and
      endothelial dysfunction will be performed to investigate any detectable systemic processes
      that predict CAC development.

      This study is a non-randomized prospective cohort study that will define the rate of index
      atherosclerotic plaque development in adults with a prior CAC score of 0 given prior CAC zero
      &gt; 5 years previous. Study personnel will abstract CAC and coronary computed tomography
      angiography (CCTA) results on or prior to 31 December 2010 in a single, high-volume military
      medical center. All patients with CAC scores of zero, irrespective of whether or not this
      zero CAC was calculated in the presence of a CCTA with non-calcified plaque, will be offered
      inclusion in the study cohort. Patients will be contacted via telephone and offered study
      participation. Patients who sign written informed consent will be interviewed to abstract
      current medical history, medications, exercise practices, and social history. Cardiovascular
      risk factors of interest will be hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and family
      history. Patients will then undergo blood draw (complete metabolic panel, complete blood
      count, lipid panel, serum insulin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin A1c,
      and thyroid function testing) to screen for undergoing cardiovascular risk factors and to be
      used as potential risk markers. Additionally, whole blood and serum will be obtained for
      future investigation to determine new markers of coronary artery disease (CAD) progression
      and genetic polymorphisms that may predict CAD progression. Patients will also undergo
      EndoPat testing utilizing an EndoPAT 2000® (digital pulse amplitude tonometry) to assess for
      endothelial dysfunction. Finally, patients will undergo repeat coronary artery calcium
      scoring based on standard laboratory protocols based on heart rate and body mass index.

      The biological specimens collected in this study will be used for future testing and
      evaluation of exploratory systemic biomarkers with respect to prediction of coronary artery
      disease (CAD) progression and incident development of CAD. Specifically, samples are being
      collected to investigate pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory makers and the effect on CAD
      development and progression as measured by coronary artery calcification (CAC). DNA samples
      will be tested for genetic factors and identify trends amongst patients with CAC development,
      particularly focusing on those with aggressive, multivessel CAC development.

             testing, but any major cardiovascular events (MACE) will be documented in order to
             report the 5 year MACE rates amongst CAC zero patients in our population.)
