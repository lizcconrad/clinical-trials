  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial for patients with metastatic hormone receptor (HR)-positive human
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer who have progressed on an
      aromatase inhibitor plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor (either palbociclib or ribociclib) to either
      fulvestrant alone or fulvestrant with ribociclib (LEE-011). The purpose of the trial is to
      determine whether there is continued benefit for patients to remain on a CDK4/6 inhibitor at
      the time of switching anti-estrogen therapy. As ribociclib and palbociclib have a similar
      toxicity and drug profile and mechanism of action, we feel that it is appropriate for
      patients to receive either drug with an aromatase inhibitor prior to randomization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in early detection and therapeutic options, unresectable or metastatic
      breast cancer remains incurable and is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality.
      Breast cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease. This study will be evaluating estrogen
      receptor (ER) expression positivity and/or progesterone receptor (PgR) positivity of breast
      cancer with the absence of over-expression or amplification of HER2.

      Inhibitors of the cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) have been developed and
      demonstrated impressive activity in patients with ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer
      with marked improvements in progression free survival. This question is asking whether CDK
      4/6 inhibition should be continued with hormone therapy in patients who will be switching
      their hormone therapy in the metastatic breast cancer setting.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men or women at least 18 years of age with histologically or cytologically confirmed
             adenocarcinoma of the breast with unresectable or metastatic disease.

          2. Most recent tumor biopsy or surgical resection specimen must be either
             estrogen-receptor (ER) positive, progesterone receptors (PgR) positive, or both, as
             defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) ≥1% (as per the American Society of Clinical
             Oncology (ASCO)-College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines).

          3. HER2-negative breast cancer defined as a negative in situ hybridization test or an
             immunohistochemistry (IHC) status of 0, 1+ or 2+. If IHC is 2+ (i.e. indeterminate), a
             negative in situ hybridization (Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), Chromogenic
             in situ hybridization (CISH), or Silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH)) test is
             required by local laboratory testing. (as per the ASCO-CAP guidelines).

          4. Postmenopausal status or receiving ovarian ablation with a GnRH agonist such as
             goserelin. Postmenopausal status is defined by any one of the following criteria:

               -  Prior bilateral oophorectomy.

               -  Age ≥60 years.

               -  Age &lt;60 and amenorrhea for 12 or more months (in the absence of chemotherapy,
                  tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression) and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol in the postmenopausal range per
                  local normal.

             If the patient does not meet criteria for postmenopausal status but is receiving
             ovarian ablation therapy with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist such as
             goserelin, the patient is eligible for this study, provided that the GnRH agonist is
             started at least 2 weeks prior to cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1) of anti-estrogen therapy.

          5. Have evidence of measurable or unmeasurable disease.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          7. Scenario 1: No prior cdk 4/6 inhibitor. If patient has not previously received
             letrozole, letrozole will be supplied by Novartis. If previously progressed on
             letrozole, another aromatase inhibitor that the patient has not previously received is
             allowed, per standard of care (anastrazole or exemestane, not supplied by study).
             Ribociclib will be supplied by Novartis. If patient has previously received letrozole,
             anastrazole, and exemestane, (s)he is not eligible. No prior fulvestrant allowed.

          8. Scenario 2: the patient must have received an aromatase inhibitor plus palbociclib as
             standard of care or received a cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6 inhibitor
             (palbociclib or ribociclib) as part of a clinical trial, and demonstrated evidence of
             disease progression. If the patient was enrolled in a randomized clinical trial
             involving ribociclib or palbociclib, then it must be known after study discontinuation
             and unblinding that the patient received the investigational drug and not placebo.
             Documentation of progression and duration of response on aromatase inhibitor plus CDK
             4/6 inhibitor should be provided whenever possible. No prior fulvestrant allowed.

          9. Adequate baseline laboratory studies (hematologic and chemistry), including the
             following parameters:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500 per microliter, Platelets ≥ 75,000 per
                  microliter, Hemoglobin level ≥ 8.0 gm/dL on screening complete blood count

               -  Potassium, sodium, total calcium (corrected only in the case of hypoalbuminemia),
                  magnesium, and phosphorus within normal limits of the local laboratory (screening
                  values can be rechecked after electrolyte repletion and before the first dose of
                  study medication, if necessary).

               -  Serum creatinine level ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt; 50
                  mL/min.

               -  In absence of liver metastases, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
                  aminotransferase (AST) should be below 2.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN). If
                  the patient has liver metastases, ALT and AST should be &lt; 5 × ULN.

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN. (In patients with well documented Gilbert's
                  Syndrome, total bilirubin ≤ 3 × ULN with direct bilirubin within normal range.)

               -  international normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5

         10. a) Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization obtained from the subject/legal
             representative prior to performing any protocol-related procedures b) Subjects must be
             willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule, laboratory
             testing, and other requirements of the study

         11. Must be able to swallow ribociclib and oral aromatase inhibitor, such as letrozole

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior selective estrogen receptor down-regulator use (SERD), including fulvestrant

          2. Patient has a known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of ribociclib, aromatase
             inhibitors (such as letrozole) or fulvestrant

          3. Active central nervous system (CNS) disease. History of CNS metastases or cord
             compression is allowable if the patient has been clinically stable for at least 4
             weeks since completion of definitive treatment and is off systemic steroids. In the
             case of brain metastases, the patient must have stable or improved imaging at least 4
             weeks after completion of definitive treatment. If there is evidence of active
             leptomeningeal disease, the patient is ineligible.

          4. Identified as having visceral crisis, lymphangitic spread, or leptomeningeal
             carcinomatosis. Visceral crisis is not the mere presence of visceral metastases but
             implies severe organ dysfunction as assessed by symptoms and signs, laboratory
             studies, and rapid progression of the disease.

          5. Received more than 1 prior systemic chemotherapy in the unresectable or metastatic
             setting. If the patient received 1 prior systemic chemotherapy, the patient is
             eligible. To clarify, this prior line can be single agent or combination (example,
             carboplatin/gemcitabine given concurrently). Patients do not need to have demonstrated
             disease progression on chemotherapy to be eligible. Having received prior targeted
             therapies for breast cancer (such as everolimus or experimental agents) does not
             affect eligibility for this study, with the exception of patients who have received
             the investigational CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib (LY2835219). If the patient has
             previously received abemaciclib, the patient is not eligible for this study.

          6. Completion of major surgery or radiation within 14 days prior to starting
             investigational drug or has not recovered from major side effects.

          7. Residual acute toxic effects of prior anti-cancer therapy that have not resolved to
             CTCAE v.4 Grade ≤1 (except alopecia or other grade II or above toxicities not
             considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator's discretion).

          8. Presence of a concurrent malignancy or malignancy diagnosed within 5 years of
             randomization, with the exception of basal or squamous cell carcinoma,
             non-melanomatous skin cancer, curatively resected cervical cancer, localized prostate
             cancer treated with curative intent, and stage I colorectal cancer treated with
             curative resection,

          9. Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs (e.g. ulcerative diseases,
             uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel
             resection).

         10. Patient has a known history of HIV infection (testing not mandatory)

         11. Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization
             abnormality including any of the following:

               -  History of myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris, symptomatic pericarditis,
                  or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) within 6 months prior to study entry

               -  Documented cardiomyopathy

               -  Patient has a known Left Ventricular Fraction (LVEF) &lt;50% as determined by
                  Multiple Gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO).

               -  Long QT syndrome or family history of long QT syndrome or family history of
                  idiopathic sudden death or congenital long QT syndrome, or any of the following:
                  i. Risk factors for Torsades de Pointe (TdP) including uncorrected hypokalemia or
                  hypomagnesaemia, history of cardiac failure, or history of clinically
                  significant/symptomatic bradycardia ii. Concomitant medications(s) with a known
                  risk to prolong the QT interval and/or known to cause Torsades de Pointe that
                  cannot be discontinued or replaced by safe alternative medication (e.g. within 5
                  half-lives or 7 days prior to starting study drug) iii. Inability to determine
                  the QTc interval

               -  Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia),
                  complete left bundle branch block, high-grade Atrioventricular (AV) block (e.g.,
                  bifascicular block, Mobitz type II and third degree AV block)

         12. Corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 480 msec on screening electrocardiogram. If QTc
             prolongation is felt to be related to electrolyte imbalance, an EKG can be repeated
             after correction of electrolytes.

         13. The presence of any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that
             would, in the investigator or treating physician's judgment, cause unacceptable safety
             risks, contraindicate patient participation in the clinical study or compromise
             compliance with the protocol. This includes uncontrolled infections that could
             potentially be exacerbated by anti-neoplastic treatment, active untreated or
             uncontrolled fungal bacterial or viral infections, etc.

         14. Currently receiving treatment, including medications and herbal preparations, with
             known strong inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome p450 enzymes CYP3A4/5 medications
             that have a narrow therapeutic window and are predominately metabolized through
             CYP3A4/5 or herbal preparations/medications, dietary supplements, which cannot be
             discontinued at least one week prior to receiving investigational drug.
             Anti-retrovirals, anti-microbials, and anti-arrhythmics are the most common
             medications that interact with these enzymes. Section 5: Pharmaceutical Information
             and Appendix B for more information and a list of drugs that should not be used
             concurrently with ribociclib. An additional reference can be the CT scholar tool
             designed for Novartis Oncology

         15. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents concurrently or have
             received investigational agents within 14 days or 5 half-lives of the compound or
             active metabolites, whichever is longer before the first dose of the study treatment.

         16. Subject is pregnant or nursing. Serum or urine Beta-Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)
             must be checked in all pre- and peri-menopausal patients. (Fulvestrant is pregnancy
             category D and CDK4/6 inhibitors have demonstrated teratogenicity/fetotoxicity in
             animal studies.)

         17. The effects of ribociclib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because the effects of chemotherapy are known to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and 3 weeks after completion of ribociclib administration.
