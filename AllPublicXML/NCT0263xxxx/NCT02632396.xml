    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ixazomib citrate (ixazomib)
      when given together with rituximab and to see how well they work after stem cell transplant
      in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma that are no longer showing signs or symptoms
      of cancer. Ixazomib may stop the growth of cancer cell by blocking enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may interfere with the ability of cancer
      cells to grow and spread. Giving ixazomib together with rituximab after transplant may help
      prevent the cancer from coming back.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose and assess the safety of ixazomib when
      administered as post-transplant maintenance in mantle cell lymphoma and to evaluate the
      safety of rituximab in combination with the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of ixazomib.
      (Phase I)

      II. To assess preliminary evidence of efficacy of ixazomib in combination with rituximab when
      administered as post-transplant maintenance in mantle cell lymphoma. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate for preliminary evidence of efficacy of ixazomib (+/- rituximab) maintenance
      therapy in patients with mantle cell lymphoma undergoing autologous stem cell transplant in
      first partial or complete remission. (Phase I)

      II. To evaluate for preliminary evidence of efficacy of ixazomib (+/- rituximab) maintenance
      therapy in patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have a complex karyotype and other
      high-risk cytogenetic or clinical markers. (Phase I)

      III. To evaluate toxicities associated with prolonged administration of ixazomib maintenance
      therapy in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). (Phase I)

      IV. To evaluate the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients who have completed an
      autologous transplant for mantle cell lymphoma and to assess the impact of MRD on outcomes
      for patients receiving maintenance therapy. (Phase I)

      V. To evaluate efficacy of ixazomib with rituximab maintenance therapy in patients with MCL
      who undergo autologous stem cell transplantation in first remission who have a complex
      karyotype and/or additional high risk cytogenetic or clinical features at diagnosis. (Phase
      II)

      VI. To further evaluate safety and toxicity of prolonged administration of ixazomib. (Phase
      II)

      VII. To evaluate long-term disease-related and survival outcomes for patients with MCL who
      receive post-transplant maintenance therapy with ixazomib with rituximab. (Phase II)

      VIII. To evaluate the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients who have completed
      an autologous transplant for mantle cell lymphoma and to assess the impact of MRD on outcomes
      for patients receiving maintenance therapy. (Phase II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the prognostic value of pre-transplant positron emission tomography
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in mantle cell lymphoma.

      II. To evaluate the ability of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to identify
      high-risk cytogenetic features in patients with MCL.

      III. To evaluate the impact of ixazomib maintenance (+/- rituximab) on immunoglobulin levels
      for patients completing autologous stem cell transplantation for mantle cell lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ixazomib followed by a phase II study.

      Beginning between 70-180 days after stem cell transplant, patients receive ixazomib orally
      (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15, and rituximab intravenously (IV) (or subcutaneously [SC] after
      first dose if deemed appropriate) on day 1 of courses 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 2
      years.

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min using Cockcroft-Gault formula.

          -  Note: Patients are expected to initiate therapy as close to day +100 as possible. No
             patient may initiate therapy before day +70 and initiation of therapy beyond day +130
             is allowed ONLY for patients who meet all eligibility criteria except for hematologic
             parameters, in which case patients may be delayed until their hematologic laboratories
             meet criteria but no later than day +180. Regardless of the time of therapy
             initiation, patients must meet all eligibility criteria and must have completed all
             consent documentation and screening procedures within the specified window.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients who are lactating or have a positive serum pregnancy test during the
             screening period.

          -  Failure to have fully recovered (ie, ≤ grade 1 toxicity) from the reversible effects
             of prior chemotherapy, except for laboratory abnormalities which are addressed above.

          -  Major surgery within 14 days before enrollment.

          -  Radiotherapy within 14 days before enrollment; if the involved field is small, 7 days
             will be considered a sufficient interval between treatment and administration of the
             ixazomib.

          -  Central nervous system involvement with lymphoma at any time in the patient's history;
             intrathecal prophylaxis during induction is allowed as long as active disease has not
             been identified.

          -  Infection requiring intravenous antibiotic therapy or other serious infection within
             14 days before study enrollment.

          -  Evidence of current uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions, including uncontrolled
             hypertension, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina, or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months; patients
             experiencing an isolated cardiac complication at the time of transplant who have been
             evaluated by cardiology and remained stable for at least 60 days are eligible.

          -  Systemic treatment, within 14 days before the first dose of ixazomib, with strong
             cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A) inducers (rifampin, rifapentine,
             rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital), or use of St. John's wort.

          -  Ongoing or active systemic infection, active hepatitis B or C virus infection, or
             known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. Patients who have previously tested
             positive for hepatitis B core antibody may be eligible if they are confirmed to NOT
             have active disease and are on appropriate anti-viral therapy. No additional hepatitis
             or HIV testing is required for patients who have been evaluated during their induction
             and/or pre-transplant work-up and have had no clinical evidence of HIV, hepatitis B or
             hepatitis C since their last evaluation.

          -  Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion,
             potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol.

          -  Known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the
             various formulations of any agent. Patients with a prior reaction to rituximab are
             permitted if the investigator feels that this reaction is manageable with standard
             supportive care measures and would otherwise be comfortable administering rituximab
             outside of the clinical trial setting.

          -  Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the oral
             absorption or tolerance of ixazomib including difficulty swallowing; patients with
             known GI involvement with mantle cell lymphoma who have no clinical evidence of active
             disease at the time of enrollment are eligible.

          -  Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years before study enrollment or
             previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual
             disease; patients with non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of any type, or low
             risk cervical cancer are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection and
             are deemed free of disease by their treating physician; patients with low risk
             prostate cancer who are under observation are eligible if their urologist or
             oncologist does not expect them to require therapy within 1 year.

          -  Patient has ≥ grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, or grade 2 with pain on clinical
             examination during the screening period.

          -  Receipt of therapy on a clinical trial, including investigational and
             non-investigational agents not included in this trial, within 30 days of the start of
             this trial and throughout the duration of this trial; participation on non-therapeutic
             clinical studies is allowed, and patients who participated on a clinical trial for
             induction and/or transplant but who have completed the prescribed therapy course for
             that study and have been off therapy for at least 30 days are eligible.

          -  Prior exposure to ixazomib; however, prior bortezomib exposure is allowed.

          -  Patients with any history of relapsed/refractory disease, or who have progressed at
             any time since beginning induction therapy are not eligible; patients who have
             evidence of residual disease by FISH, cytogenetics, SNP array, or flow cytometry
             without any measurable nodal disease or morphologic evidence of disease in the bone
             marrow or peripheral blood are eligible.
