      The aim of this study is to assess the effects and safety of the early application of
      BILEVEL-APRV protocol and conventional ventilation strategy that used low tidal volume and
      adequate PEEP level in ARDS patients .

    <textblock>
      Although mechanical ventilation is life-sustaining for patients with ARDS, it can perpetuate
      lung injury. A number of recent advances have greatly improved in the mechanical ventilation
      strategies and treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), however, Mortality
      remains high, even with the use of low tidal volume and adequate positive end expiratory
      pressure(PEEP). Numerous experimental showed that the BILEVEL-APRV mode used in animal ARDS
      model can improve gas exchanges and hemodynamic tolerance of the ventilation while reducing
      the dosage for sedative drugs.

      The aim of this single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, open study is to compare
      the effects and safety of the early application of BILEVEL-APRV protocol and conventional
      ventilation strategy that used low tidal volume and adequate PEEP level in ARDS patients .
