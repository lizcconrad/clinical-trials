  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is a chronic, multifactorial characterization, which changes in bone
      alignment, cartilage and structures that provide joint stability appear to be strongly
      correlated with the origin of this disease.This project will aim to verify the effectiveness
      of interferential current, short wave and low level laser therapy on an exercise program for
      mobility and pain in knee osteoarthritis. Blind randomized, placebo controlled. Five groups:
      exercise group, exercise group + Ultrasound therapy, exercise group + interferential current,
      exercise group + short-wave diathermy, exercise group + Low level laser therapy. Before and
      after the trial protocol by the following instruments: Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC), numerical scale of pain assessment (END), Visual
      Analogue Scale Fatigue (VAS-F), issue F2.2 Instrument assessment of quality of life of the
      World Health Organization (WHOQOL-100) test sitting and standing + numerical rating pain
      scale, algometry. This project hypothesizes that the inclusion of photothermal and electrical
      agents in an exercise program will provide an improvement in pain, mobility and knee function
      in individuals diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis.
