    <description>DNA was extracted from venous blood;genomic DNA underwent PCR amplification; finally, PCR products were purified and directly sequenced by Invitrogen Corp or Biosune Corp.Then ALDH2 genotype was distinguished depend on a G-to-A missense mutation on exon 12 of ALDH2 gene.</description>

      4 ml vein blood samples were collected from aortic dissection or controls in tubes containing
      EDTA. The samples would be centrifuged and saved in a -80℃ ultra-low temperature
      refrigerator.

      1 cm2 of aorta specimen were collected from patients operated on for Type A dissection, and
      refrigerated with liquid nitrogen.
