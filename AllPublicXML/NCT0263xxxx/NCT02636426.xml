  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sorafenib is an oral anticancer drug and inhibits multiple protein kinases important for
      tumor growth and metastases, including VEGFR, PDGFR, and RAF kinases. In daily clinical
      practice it is currently used at a dose of 400 mg twice daily in a continuous schedule. In
      this phase I study patients will be treated with a new dosing schedule of sorafenib: i.e. a
      high-dose, pulsatile schedule. The tolerability and safety of this new schedule is examined
      in exposure escalation cohorts based on a target plasma AUC0-12h (area under the curve).
      Exposure escalation cohorts are used instead of conventional dose escalation cohorts because
      the effect of a drug is dependent of its AUC levels and large differences in plasma sorafenib
      AUC0-12h have previously been shown between patients treated at the same dose level. Using
      pharmacokinetic monitoring, the sorafenib dose will be adjusted to a target plasma AUC0-12h.
      The escalation cohorts consist of 3-6 patients per exposure level starting with a target
      plasma sorafenib AUC0-12h level of 25-50 mg/L/h. After the determination of the maximum
      tolerated AUC0-12h, 10 additional patients will be entered into an expansion cohort. In the
      expansion cohort the patients will be treated with a weekly pulse of sorafenib at the maximum
      tolerated AUC0-12h for further assessment of safety and preliminary exploration of efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Preclinical research showed improved efficacy of sorafenib when given in a
      high-dose, pulsatile schedule compared with conventional (lower dose) continuous scheduling
      as a result of higher peak concentrations in the tumor. In this phase I study patients will
      be treated with high-dose, pulsatile sorafenib in exposure escalation cohorts. Exposure
      escalations cohorts are based on a target plasma AUC0-12h (area under the curve) and are used
      instead of conventional dose escalation cohorts because the effect of a drug is dependent of
      its AUC levels and large differences in plasma sorafenib AUC0-12h have previously been shown
      between patients treated at the same dose level.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated plasma AUC0-12h of high-dose sorafenib administered
           in a weekly, pulsatile schedule.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of high-dose, pulsatile sorafenib.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic behaviour of sorafenib and its major active metabolite
           pyridine N-oxide when administered in a weekly, pulsatile schedule.

        -  To determine a recommended phase II plasma AUC0-12h of high-dose sorafenib in a weekly
           pulsatile schedule.

        -  Preliminary assessment of the efficacy of high-dose, pulsatile sorafenib administered at
           the maximum tolerated plasma AUC0-12h.

        -  To determine skin and intratumoral concentrations of sorafenib and their correlation
           with plasma and whole blood concentrations.

        -  To select 1-2 optimal time points from the AUC0-12h data to determine sorafenib exposure
           using a finger puncture.

      Study design: A single center, open-label, phase I study of high-dose, pulsatile sorafenib
      administered in exposure escalation cohorts.

      Study population: Adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease for whom no
      standard therapy exists.

      Treatment: Patients will be treated in exposure escalation cohorts with high-dose sorafenib
      administered in a weekly pulsatile schedule. Using pharmacokinetic monitoring, the sorafenib
      dose will be adjusted to a target plasma AUC0-12h. The escalation cohorts consist of 3-6
      patients per exposure level starting with a target plasma sorafenib AUC0-12h level of 25-50
      mg/L/h. After the determination of the maximum tolerated AUC0-12h, 10 additional patients
      will be entered into an expansion cohort. In the expansion cohort the patients will be
      treated with a weekly pulse of sorafenib at the maximum tolerated AUC0-12h for further
      assessment of safety and preliminary exploration of efficacy.

             measures (e.g., cervical cap, condom, or diaphragm) during the course of the trial.
             Oral birth control methods alone will not be considered adequate on this study,
             because of the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between study drug and oral
             contraceptives. Concomitant use of oral and barrier contraceptives is advised.
             Contraception is necessary for at least 6 months after receiving the study protein
             kinase inhibitor.

         17. Concomitant medication with drugs having proarrhythmic potential (such as sotalol,
             haloperidol, flecainide) is not permitted during the study.
