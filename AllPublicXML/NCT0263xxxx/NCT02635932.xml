  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis is a degenerative or inflammatory joint that affects
      the trapeziometacarpal joint (TMC) of the thumb. Its main symptom is pain that leads to
      difficulty in manual function and decrease the patient's quality of life. Immobilization of
      TMC thumb joint by bracing has been effective in reducing pain and improving function.
      Objective: To compare the effectiveness between day and night functional splint for patients
      with trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis in improving pain and function

    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial, and blind where selected 60 patients diagnosed with
      trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis.Os patients were assessed by a blinded evaluator at the
      beginning of treatment and after 45, 90 and 180 days in relation to pain, thumb range of
      motion, strength hold, tweezers, dexterity, function and satisfaction.
