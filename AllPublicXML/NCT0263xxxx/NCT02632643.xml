    <textblock>
      The study aims to demonstrate the efficacy of the sensorimotor approach developed by A. Piron
      (taught to the patient in three sessions) regarding three parameters related to TMD: facial
      pain, functional incapacities and hypertonia.

      The subjects in the study are 18 to 77 years old and present the following conditions: a TMD
      disorder caused or aggravated by hypertonia and responsible for cervico-maxillo-facial pain
      and/or a functional incapacity in the last 30 days.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall relief (from 0% to 100%) based on the ratio of &quot;complaint after treatment&quot; to &quot;complaint before treatment&quot;. Multiple measurements related to both pain and functional incapacity are aggregated to arrive at one reported value: complaint</measure>
    <time_frame>Beginning (day 0); during treatment (day 30 and day 90); end (day 180)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's complaint is calculated:
By integrating the weighting of both pain (P) and functional incapacity (FI) parameters in the complaint. 11 possibilities: [100% P - 0% FI] OR [90% P - 10% FI] OR [80% P - 20% FI] etc.
Patient's complaint = Pain and/or functional incapacity
Assessement of pain integrates 2 or 3 or 4 parameters: 2 are constant (intensity and frequency), 2 are optional (quality of life and drugs) because some painful patient don't take drug or don't have an altered quality of life. If there are 2 parameters, each = 50%; if 3 parameters, each = 33,3%; if 4 parameters, each = 25%
The scoring of the 4 pain parameters is based on questionnaires: Intensity: GCPS v2.0 (part 1): Score 0 to 100; Frequency (last month): Score 0 to 30; Drug: number of gram of the most specific medication (last month); Quality of life: GCPS v2.0 (part 2): score 0 to 6
Assessement of functional incapacity integrates 1 parameter: the JFLS-20 questionnaire (score from 0 to 200)</description>
