      Primary Objective:

      To assess the pharmacodynamic response (PD) of a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of SAR438544
      versus recombinant glucagon in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients under induced
      hypoglycemia.

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single SC dose of
      SAR438544 versus recombinant glucagon in T1DM patients under induced hypoglycemia.

      The total duration of study per patient is up to 8 weeks with 3 to 28 days screening period,
      1 day for treatment for both periods and 7 to 14 days wash out between 2 administrations, and
      7 days (+/- 1 day) follow-up after last IMP administration.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to glucagon, lactose or any other constituent in GlucaGen^®
             HypoKit and SAR438544 or Novolin^®R and their excipients.
