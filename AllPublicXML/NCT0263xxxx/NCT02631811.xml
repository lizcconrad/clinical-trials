    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that patients with acute leukemia have many symptoms during
      disease These symptoms decrease the quality of life and may even appear or worsen other
      symptoms such as depression Several studies point to the involvement of supportive care and
      palliative care is delayed in these patients The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact
      on the quality of life of an early and standardized involvement of a support / palliative
      care team for patients with acute leukemia in first relapse compared to a control group .
