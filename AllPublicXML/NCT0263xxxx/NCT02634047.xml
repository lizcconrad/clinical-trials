  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the difference in the first attempt and
      overall success rate of different techniques for insertion of transesophageal
      echocardiography. Secondary aim is to investigate the difference of the duration of insertion
      using the selected technique, complications during insertion such as oropharyngeal mucosal
      injury and hematoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighty adult patients, who received general anaesthesia for elective open heart surgeries
      that required transesophageal echocardiography insertion, will be randomized by means of a
      computer-generated randomization order into two groups: Conventional group (Group C), and
      videolaryngoscope group (group VL).

      Success rate of the selected technique (first attempt and overall), duration of insertion for
      selected technique, complications such as oropharyngeal mucosal injury and hematoma will be
      noted.
