      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a guided imagery intervention on
      perceived stress in pregnant adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant adolescents attending a local alternative education program will be subjects of this
      study. Students will participate in four, 15 minute guided imagery sessions over about a 4-6
      week period. They will complete a pregnancy specific stress questionnaire before beginning
      and after completion of the guided imagery protocol. The students will also complete a short
      9-question stress measure before and after each of the individual guided imagery sessions.

      The specific aims are:

        1. to evaluate whether a guided imagery intervention reduces perceived stress in pregnant
           adolescents; and

        2. to evaluate whether a guided imagery intervention enhances well-being in pregnant
           adolescents.

      The hypotheses are that the intervention will reduce perceived stress and enhance well-being
      in these subjects. The purpose of this study is to assess whether employing a guided imagery
      intervention with pregnant teens and education will reduce perceived stress levels and
      improve well-being.

    <measure>Change in Psychological Stress Measure-9 (PSM-9) score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the PSM-9 before and after listening to guided imagery sessions for each of the 4 weekly intervention sessions. The Psychological Stress Measure-9 (PSM-9) is a 9 item questionnaire measuring stress. The original form was published in Canada by Louise Lemyre, PHD and Rejean Tessier, PHD in 1988 and the 9 item was published in 2002. Each response rests on an 8 point likert scale. For general surveys of health and well-being in the workplace, an abridged 9-item version was developed to meet a variety of research needs and applications. The PSM-9 version is used at Hydro-Quebec and Renault (France) as well as in public service, hospitals, community services, and private practice. It has the same psychometric qualities of reliability, validity, and internal consistency (.89) and maintains the same heuristic value for statistics: normality of distribution and responsiveness (Lemyre, Chair, &amp; Lalande-Markon, 2009).</description>
