    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this study because you have a biliary cancer that is
      incurable and has spread to other organs. Chemotherapy is often used to help shrink the
      cancer temporarily and may improve survival. In Canada, the combination of gemcitabine and
      cisplatin is the chemotherapy combination used to treat biliary cancer that has spread. There
      is no other known treatment for biliary cancer that has spread to other organs. It is hoped
      that this new combination of drugs (nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and cisplatin) will improve
      the tumor shrinkage rate.

      This study is being done because we do not know whether 2 or 3 chemotherapy drugs is better
      to treat biliary cancers.

      We hope to learn whether giving nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and cisplatin together in
      patients with biliary cancer can increase tumor shrinkage without too many side effects.

      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) nab-paclitaxel,
      gemcitabine, and cisplatin has on you and your biliary cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that there is a large degree of pathologic homology between the
      pancreas and biliary tract. Indeed, the biliary tract has been referred to as &quot;an incomplete
      pancreas&quot; and embryologically the two originate from the same structure. It is thus plausible
      that oncogenesis in the pancreas and biliary tract are related and that pancreas and biliary
      cancers have reciprocal effective treatment strategies.

      To date, the only chemotherapeutic agents effective in advanced biliary tract tumors is the
      combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin. Known and approved therapies for advanced pancreas
      cancer include single agent gemcitabine, the four drug combination of FOLFIRINOX
      (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan), the questionable limited benefit
      of inhibiting the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway, and most recently the combination
      of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.

      Based on promising results in pancreas cancer, investigators hypothesize nab-paclitaxel in
      combination with gemcitabine + cisplatin will be an effective cytotoxic combination in BTC
      treatment.
