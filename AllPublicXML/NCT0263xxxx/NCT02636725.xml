  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that combination axitinib with pembrolizumab will improve
      progression-free survival relative to historical controls.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a single-institution, open-label, single-arm phase II study. Since the
      primary endpoint is survival outcome, progression-free survival (PFS) sample size calculation
      is based on a single-arm survival design. The investigators will employ early stopping rules
      for lack of efficacy, based on previously reported historical controls (19% PFS at 3 months)
      and a large database suggesting that a progression-free rate at 3 months of &gt; 40% correlates
      with an active drug in the second-line setting for patients with advanced sarcoma.

      Patients will be treated with twice daily dosing of axitinib alone for the first 7 days,
      followed by concurrent axitinib administered twice daily at 5 mg orally (PO), plus
      intravenous administration of pembrolizumab every 21 days. Patients will be assessed every
      three weeks for toxicity. After the first five patients are enrolled, the investigators will
      assess safety of the combination. If 2 or fewer patients exhibit dose-limiting toxicity
      (DLT), the investigators will then proceed with intrapatient titration of axitinib dosing at
      each cycle based on the presence or absence of predefined toxicities.

      Correlative studies characterizing T-cells in tumor tissue and in peripheral blood will be
      performed at three timepoints: 1. pre-treatment, 2. on-treatment on cycle 3 day 1, and 3.
      off-study. Additional exploratory imaging investigations, and assessment of circulating tumor
      cells are included for all patients.

      Trial therapy will last until withdrawal of consent, disease progression and/or unacceptable
      toxicity, whichever occurs first.
