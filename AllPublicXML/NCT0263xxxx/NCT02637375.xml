    <textblock>
      Based on preclinical data implicating GR, AR, and JAK/STAT activation as potent mechanisms of
      breast cancer cell survival despite chemotherapy administration (i.e. chemotherapy
      resistance), the study will test a novel approach for improving chemotherapy effectiveness by
      adding Hsp90 inhibition to antagonize the anti-apoptotic signaling pathways that are
      initiated via GR, AR, and JAK/STAT activation.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      Primary:

      • To determine tumor GR, AR, JAK and other Hsp90 client protein expression before and after
      two weeks of ganetespib monotherapy

      Secondary:

        -  To determine the pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate associated with weekly
           treatment of ganetespib plus paclitaxel followed by the combination treatment of
           doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide

        -  To characterize the toxicity of study treatment
