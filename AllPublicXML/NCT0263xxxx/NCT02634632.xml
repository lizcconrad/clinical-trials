    <textblock>
      Legitimized by the Leonetti law of April 22, 2005, advance directives (AD) appear in various
      places of care that alongside the end of life, and even tend to be generalized to all areas
      related to health care in general. In this context, a prospective study to assess how the
      patient will seize the AD and identify the different problems writing these AD will be
      conducted. From this study, it will establish recommendations for the implementation of AD in
      the Multidisciplinary Oncology Department and Therapeutic Innovations service and in oncology
      in general. They will be asked patients if they choose to write their AD, complete and sign
      the AD pre-written in the book or not to draft their AD. The choice of the patients, but also
      the reasons they associate thereto and, where appropriate, their AD written will be
      collected. The patient will also inform its demographic and socio the case report (clinical
      data) should be completed by the investigator. During the first part of research, the use of
      AD by patients and will be assessed and analyzed in connection with the characteristics of
      these patients (history of the disease, course of care, socio-demographic) and the reasons
      they set out to explain their choice. For those who write their AD, they will, in a second
      step, subject to thematic content analysis to identify the main aspects that the subject
      convened to consider its end of life.This research therefore lead to the definition of the
      contours of a user device AD in oncology in general. This study was qualified biomedical
      research because of the sensitive nature of the study population and bring the patient to
      personal preoccupations when filling the questionnaire on the choice of directing advance
      directives and their contents.
