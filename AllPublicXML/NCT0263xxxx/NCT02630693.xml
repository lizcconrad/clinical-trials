  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of endocrine therapy and
      Palbociclib at a daily dose of 100 mg will result in a better response to therapy with fewer
      dose interruptions than the proposed dosing regimen of 125 mg daily for 21 days out of a 28
      day cycle in combination with endocrine therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard or usual treatment of this type of breast cancer is endocrine therapy.
      Palbociclib is a new type of drug for breast cancer. Laboratory tests as well as studies in
      animals and people show that it may help slow the growth of breast cancer. The most widely
      tested regimen of Palbociclib for patients with metastatic/advanced breast cancer is 125 mg
      every day for 21 days out of a 28 day cycle in combination with standard endocrine (hormone)
      therapy. This study explores if administering a lower dose of palbociclib - 100 mg given
      every day of a 28 day cycle in combination with standard endocrine (hormone) therapy - may
      result in more tumour shrinkage and be better tolerated.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Premenopausal and postmenopausal women 18 years of age or older.

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast, with ER positive and HER2
             negative status based on local testing on most recent pathological tumour specimen.

          -  Patients must satisfy the following criteria for prior therapy:

               -  Progressed during treatment or within 12 months of completion of adjuvant
                  endocrine therapy or

               -  Progressed during prior endocrine therapy for advanced/metastatic disease. Note:
                  'Progressed during endocrine therapy' means that the patient progressed while on
                  or within 1 month after discontinuation of endocrine therapy.

          -  One line of chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic disease (regardless of prior adjuvant
             chemotherapy use) is allowed in addition to endocrine therapy.

          -  Patients must have evidence of disease to be eligible for the study, but measurable
             disease is not mandatory.

          -  For those patient with measureable disease who will be included in the response
             assessment, the following criteria must apply:

                  axis)

               -  Conventional CT scan, MRI ≥ 20 mm

               -  Measurable lesions must be outside a previous radiotherapy field if they are the
                  sole site of disease, unless disease progression has been documented.

        Tumor lesions previously irradiated or subjected to other loco regional therapy will only
        be deemed measurable if progression at the treated site after completion of therapy is
        clearly documented.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients registered on this
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there
