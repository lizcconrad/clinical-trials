  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe whether hepatic infusion by oxaliplatin, irinotecan
      and raltitrexed with or without embolization by lipiodol or microspheres are effective in the
      treatment of refratory liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.

      Colorectal cancer is one of most popular cancer worldwide. Patients with liver metastasis
      have poor prognosis except for curative resection. Chemotherapy combined biologic agents have
      improved mCRC median progress free survival and median overall surivival, but it is difficult
      to deal with liver lesions after FOLFOX and FOLFIRI treatments failed. We aim to observe the
      safety and efficacy of hepatic infusion and embolization of oxaliplatin, irinotecan and
      raltitrexed treatment for refratory liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the
             colon or rectum that is metastatic to the liver and for which standard curative
             measures do not exist

          -  Patients must have received prior irinotecan-based treatment for their disease and had
             documented progression by RECIST criteria; patients must also have received prior
             fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin-based therapy

          -  Liver disease must not be amenable to potentially curative surgical resection

          -  Patients must have liver-only or liver-predominant disease to be eligible for this
             study; hepatic disease must be dominant, but patients are allowed to have extrahepatic
             disease provided it is not judged likely to be life threatening within 3 months

          -  Patients must have a patent portal vein as documented by CT, MRI, or ultrasound

          -  Prior radiation therapy is allowed but must have been completed &gt;= 4 weeks prior to
             study entry; patients with history of prior radiation to the liver including
             radio-labeled microspheres cannot take part in this study

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1

          -  Previous surgery or RFA to the liver is allowed; patients with history of
             chemoembolization or radio-labeled microspheres are excluded

          -  Life expectancy of &gt;= 12 weeks

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/uL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/uL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; ULN

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)/Alkaline Phosphatase =&lt; 2.5 X institutional ULN

          -  Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL

          -  PT/PTT &lt; 1.5 X ULN

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and sexually active males must agree to use an
             accepted and effective method of contraception prior to study entry and for the
             duration of the study; WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who
             has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal
             ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal; even women who are using
             oral, implanted or injectable contraceptive hormones or mechanical products such as an
             intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent
             pregnancy or practicing abstinence or where partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy)
             should be considered to be of child bearing potential

          -  Patients must demonstrate ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hepatic decompensation, or the presence of hepatic encephalopathy Before entering the
             study with gastrointestinal bleeding within 30 days

          -  Pregnant or nursing women may not participate in this trial because of the increased
             risk of fetal harm including death from the therapeutic agents

          -  Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this study because of their
             poor prognosis and frequent development of progressive neurological dysfunction that
             would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  As patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, known HIV-positive patients and those with
             known hepatitis B or C are excluded from the study Uncontrolled intercurrent illness
             including, but not limited to, ongoing or active bacterial infection, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Patients with clinically evident ascites requiring medical management or paracentesis,
             or Childs-Pugh score B/C are not eligible

          -  Patients with evidence of other cancer within 5 years, excluding adequately treated
             basal cell carcinoma of the skin

          -  Patient with significant cardiac, renal or hematologic or pulmonary dysfunction

          -  Patients with previous chemoembolization to liver metastases Patients may not receive
             any other anticancer therapy while on study, including immunotherapy; patients may not
             receive any other clinical investigational drug
