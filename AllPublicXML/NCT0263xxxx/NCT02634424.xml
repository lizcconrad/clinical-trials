      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the implementation of pharmacokinetic (PK) driven
      prophylaxis in current clinical practice
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Starting from 3 pharmacokinetic (PK) points, data are entered in the PK calculator device,
      and treatment dose is adjusted following the results of PK values obtained and clinical
      bleeding data
