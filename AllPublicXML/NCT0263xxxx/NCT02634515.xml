  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study in healthy volunteers aimed to demonstrate similar PK and PD properties of the new
      short-acting human soluble insulin, Julphar Insulin R, and the already approved reference
      insulin, Huminsulin® Normal. The trial participants received both study treatments on two
      separate dosing days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The daily injection of insulin is a necessity for many patients with diabetes mellitus in
      order to treat hyperglycemia. Julphar Insulin R and Huminsulin® Normal are both soluble
      insulins intended for subcutaneous administration and consist of a neutral solution
      containing recombinant human insulin as the active ingredient. The new insulin, Julphar
      Insulin R is biosimilar to Huminsulin® Normal. Demonstration of bioequivalence from a PK and
      PD perspective of the two insulins are necessary to achieve market approval for Julphar
      Insulin R.
