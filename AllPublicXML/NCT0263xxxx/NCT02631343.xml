  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While newborn and child survival remains a priority, optimal development of survivors is
      receiving increasing attention. Interventions that impact both survival and development
      should be prioritized for action. Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) improves survival, and
      potentially neurodevelopment, in preterm and low birth weight infants in hospital settings
      but its coverage remains low. Innovation is required to allow the community-based delivery of
      KMC by front-line workers. This could greatly accelerate scale up and sustainability of this
      intervention in low resource settings.

      The proposed randomized trial is planned in a setting where 40% of births take place at home.
      Early discharge (as early as within 12 hours of birth) is common for facility births, often
      at the request of families for social and cultural reasons. Many of the hospitals do not have
      incubators for the care of very small babies.

      Low birth weight (LBW) infants will be identified through surveillance. Eligible infants will
      be randomized into the intervention and control groups. Mother in the intervention group will
      be supported by a ANM-like study workers assisted by ASHA-like study workers to provide
      Kangaroo mother care (KMC) to their babies at home. Breastfeeding support will also be
      provided to these mothers by ANM-like study workers. Essential newborn care will be delivered
      through Government workers in both groups. Survival will be measured in all enrolled infants
      through contacts at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months of age. Information will also be ascertained on
      initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding rates, incidence of infection in the
      neonatal and in the 1-5 months period. Development outcomes (Maternal Depression, Maternal
      sense of competence, Mother-infant Bonding, Mother-infant interaction, Newborn Behaviour,
      Infant temperament, Brain development) will be measured at enrolment, 6weeks, 6 and 12 months
      of age. Growth will be measured at enrolment and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.
