      Objective: To compare vNOTES (vaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery) and
      established total laparoscopic hysterectomy for successful removal of a non-prolapsed uterus
      in women due to undergo hysterectomy for benign gynecological pathology.

      Study design: Randomized controlled/single
      center/single-blinded/parallel-group/non-inferiority/efficacy trial.

      Study population: All women aged 18 to 70 years regardless of parity with a non-prolapsed
      uterus and a benign indication for hysterectomy.

      Randomization: Women will be randomly allocated to undergo one of two techniques for removal
      of the uterus immediately before surgery by using a computer generated randomization list. We
      will use stratified randomization according to the estimated uterine size on clinical
      examination.

      Intervention: Women will be treated by a surgeon who is not blinded to the treatment
      allocation and who is equally skilled in performing both techniques. In the intervention
      group a vNOTES technique will be used.

      Control: In the control group surgery will be done by a classical laparoscopic technique.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Primary study outcome parameters: successful removal of the womb with the intended approach
      without conversion to an alternative approach.

      Secondary outcomes: the proportion of women admitted to the in-hospital ward for at least one
      night observation, based on their own preference; postoperative pain scores using a VAS
      (Visual Analogue Scale) measured between day 1 till 7 by the participating women following
      surgery and the total amount of analgesics used as described in the standardized pain
      treatment protocol from day 1 till 7; postoperative infection defined by lower abdominal pain
      with fever &gt; 38°C and positive clinical signs or laboratory findings; per- or postoperative
      complications according to the Clavien- Dindo classification detected during the first six
      weeks of surgery; hospital readmission within 6 weeks following surgery; duration of the
      surgical procedure; incidence and intensity of dyspareunia recorded by the participants at
      baseline, 3 and 6 months by self-reporting using a simple questionnaire and VAS (Visual
      Analogue Scale); sexual wellbeing recorded by the participants at baseline, 3 and 6 months by
      SSFS (Short Sexual Functioning Scale); health-related quality of life, at baseline, at 3 and
      6 months by self-reporting the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire; direct and indirect costs incurred up
      to 6 weeks after the hysterectomy associated with both procedures.

      1. Objectives of the HALON Trial The primary research questions of this IDEAL stage 2b
           efficacy trial are as follows: is a vNOTES (vaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal
           Endoscopic Surgery) hysterectomy at least as effective compared to the standard
           transabdominal laparoscopic approach (LSC) for removing a non-prolapsed uterus without
           the need for conversion to an alternative approach? (non inferiority design)

           Secondary research questions are:

             -  Do more women treated by vNOTES prefer to leave the day care unit on the day of
                surgery compared to LSC?

             -  Do women treated by vNOTES suffer from less pain compared to women treated by LSC
                in the first postoperative week?

             -  Is the removal of a uterus by vNOTES faster compared to LSC?

             -  Does a vNOTES cause more pelvic infection or other complications compared to LSC?

             -  Does a vNOTES result in more hospital readmissions within 6 weeks after surgery
                compared to LSC?

             -  Does a vNOTES approach result in more women reporting dyspareunia, less sexual
                wellbeing or less health-related quality of life at 3 or 6 months after surgery
                when compared to women treated by LSC?

             -  What are the direct and indirect costs up to 6 weeks after the surgical
                intervention of a vNOTES compared to LSC?

        2. TRIAL DESIGN 2.1. Design A single center, single-blinded, parallel group randomized,
           non-inferiority efficacy trial.

           2.2. Simple pilot randomized trial. 2.3. Time schedule Based upon the mean number of
           hysterectomies performed annually for benign gynecological disease at the department of
           Obstetrics and Gynecology of the participating center (168) the investigators estimate
           that the duration of recruitment will be 12 months. Based upon the follow up (6 months)
           and the period of analysis/reporting (3 months) the total study period will be 2 years.

           2.4. Participating center Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Imeldahospital
           Imeldalaan 9 2820 Bonheiden Belgium

        3. ELIGIBILITY, CONSENT AND RANDOMIZATION 3.1. Screening and consent prior to surgery All
           women aged 18 to 70 years, regardless of parity, with a non-prolapsed uterus in need of
           a hysterectomy for benign indication are eligible for inclusion.

           3.2. Determining eligibility All women aged 18 to 70 years, regardless of parity, with a
           non-prolapsed uterus in need of a hysterectomy for benign indication who provide consent
           to participation are eligible in the HALON trial and will be randomized before the
           procedure.

           3.3. Randomization If the woman is eligible for the HALON trial, the trial secretary
           will obtain a randomized allocation the day before surgery. This will be done using a
           randomization list generated by a free computer software program offered by Research
           Randomizer (https://www.randomizer.org). The random sequence generation will be
           concealed using sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes. The envelope will be
           opened by the nurse assistant the day before surgery for practical logistic reasons.

           3.4. Patients with strong preference for treatment A minority of women will express a
           clear preference for one of both treatments (e.g. strong desire to have no scar) and for
           this reason will not wish to be randomized between surgical treatments. To investigate
           how outcomes vary by choice, these women could be followed up in exactly the same way as
           for those women randomized into the HALON trial. A formal non-randomized follow-up of
           these women will not be done for logistical reasons.

           3.5. Stratification of randomization A blocked randomization procedure will be used to
           avoid chance imbalances for the parameter 'uterine size'.

        4. TREATMENT ALLOCATIONS 4.1. Surgical procedures The principal investigator, who has
           training and experience in both laparoscopy and NOTES, will perform all surgical
           procedures. He is therefore not blinded. All vNOTES participants will be blinded by
           three superficial non-therapeutic or &quot;mock&quot; skin incisions similar to those done with
           the laparoscopic technique.

           4.1.1 vNOTES hysterectomy This is the surgical procedure done in the intervention arm of
           the HALON trial. 4.1.2 LSC hysterectomy This is the surgical procedure done in the
           control arm of the HALON trial.

        5. FOLLOW-UP AND OUTCOME MEASURES 5.1. Clinical assessments 5.1.1 Format PROMs (Patient
           reported outcomes) will be collected using a postal questionnaire, which will include a
           combination of disease specific (Pain on sexual intercourse measured by VAS scale and
           SSFS Scale) and generic measurement instruments (EQ-5D).

           The postal questionnaires will be sent from the HALON Trial Office with postage paid
           envelopes two weeks before the due date. Reminders will be sent to patients if the
           questionnaire is not returned within one week of the due date and attempts will be made
           to contact the patient by phone if the questionnaire is not returned by two weeks after
           the due date.

           5.1.2 Timing of assessments The primary outcome will be measured clinically at the end
           of the surgical procedure. In addition PROMs will take place at baseline (pain on sexual
           intercourse, health-related quality of life and sexual well being), the evening of the
           surgical intervention (in-hospital admission), during the first postoperative week (pain
           by VAS scores and analgetic drugs) and at 3 and 6 months (dyspareunia/ sexual well
           being/health related quality of life). Clinical physician assessment will take place the
           evening of the surgical intervention (in-hospital admission) and during the first six
           weeks following surgery (pelvic infection, surgical complications, hospital readmission
           rate).

           5.2. Primary clinical outcome measure The proportion of women successfully treated by
           removing the uterus by the intended approach without conversion to another approach,
           using a dichotomous outcome measure, will be used as a measure of efficacy.

           5.3. Secondary clinical outcome measures

           The following secondary outcomes will be measured:

             -  The proportion of women addmitted in-hospital for at least one night observation
                based on their own preference, as a dichotomous outcome.

             -  Postoperative pain scores, as an ordinal outcome, measured using a VAS (Visual
                Analogue Scale) twice daily from day 1 till 7 self-reported by the participating
                women.

             -  Postoperative pain defined by the total amount of analgesics used as described in
                the standardized pain treatment protocol, as a continuous outcome.

             -  Postoperative infection as a dichotomous outcome.

             -  Per- or postoperative complications according to the Clavien- Dindo classification
                detected during the first six weeks of surgery, as a dichotomous outcome.

             -  The proportion of women readmitted to hospital within 6 weeks following surgery.

             -  Incidence and intensity of dyspareunia recorded by the participants at baseline, 3
                and 6 months by self-reporting using a simple questionnaire and VAS scale, as a
                dichotomous and ordinal outcome.

             -  Sexual wellbeing at baseline, at 3 and 6 months by self-reporting the SSFS (Short
                Sexual Functioning Scale).

             -  Health related quality of life, at baseline, at 3 and 6 months by self-reporting
                the EQ-5D-3L scale.

             -  Duration of surgery measured as the time in minutes from the insertion of the
                bladder catheter to the end of vaginal/abdominal wound closure, as a continuous
                outcome. 5.4.The direct and indirect costs up to 6 weeks after the hysterectomy of
                the vNOTES technique compared to LSC.

        6. ACCRUAL AND ANALYSIS 6.1. Sample size The sample size for the primary outcome of this
           trial has been chosen to give good statistical power to preclude any clinically
           important inferiority of vNOTES compared to laparoscopy and is based on evidence
           retrieved from a Dutch prospective cohort study. Based on the power calculations for the
           primary outcome and assuming a loss-to-follow-up rate of 15% we decided to include 66
           study participants in the HALON trial.

      6.2. Projected accrual and attrition rates Based upon the mean number of hysterectomies
      performed annually at the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the participating center
      (168) the investigators anticipate that the duration of recruitment will be 12 months. Based
      upon the follow up (6 months) and the period of analysis/reporting (3 months) the total study
      period will be 2 years. First publication will be possible within four years of trial
      commencement.

      The sample size calculations have allowed for a 15% loss to follow up rate. In order to
      minimize rates of attrition a dedicated research secretary will be amployed to optimize
      recruitment and follow up.
