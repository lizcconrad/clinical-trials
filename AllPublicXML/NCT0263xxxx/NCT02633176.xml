  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ⅲ randomized, controlled, multi-center, trial comparing cisplatin plus
      docetaxel to cetuximab, cisplatin, and docetaxel induction chemotherapy followed by
      concurrent chemoradiation in previously untreated patients metastatic nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma (mNPC) to determine whether the addition of cetuximab to induction chemotherapy and
      chemoradiation could improve therapeutic efficacy in mNPC, and investigate predictive and
      prognostic factors for mNPC.
