             procedures was determined by 2 expert committees: a surgical committee comprising 2
             cardiovascular surgeons and a noninvasive cardiologist, and an interventional
             committee comprising 2 interventional cardiologists and 1 noninvasive cardiologist.

             arrhythmias, congenital heart disease, intracardiac mass, moderate or severe valvular
             stenosis or regurgitation.

          7. History of life threatening allergic or immune-mediated reaction.

          8. Systemic infection or severe local infection.

             patient's short-term survival.

         18. Patients with serious complications of coronary artery disease (e.g., perforation of
             interventricular septum and ventricular aneurysm and mitral regurgitation due to
             papillary muscle dysfunction).

         19. Abnormal coagulation function.

         20. Patients with hemodynamic instability which may lead to serious complications.

         21. Any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, would place the patient at
             under risk.
