  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of vitrectomy for the treatment
      of diabetic macular edema. Diabetes is known to cause retinal blood vessels to leak, leading
      to swelling of the central retina (macula), and decreased vision. Removing the vitreous gel
      with vitrectomy surgery is known to decrease the swelling caused by diabetes. Diabetic
      retinopathy is often treated with laser or injections of medicine in to the eye.
