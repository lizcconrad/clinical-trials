  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of dental root coverage using the tunnel
      technique with connective tissue graft (CTG) and the same technique with collagen matrix for
      treatment of multiple gingival recessions Miller Class I and II.

      This study is a randomized-controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the medical databases, there are limited randomized clinical trials comparing
      xenogenic collagen matrix and CTG used with the tunnel technique. The collagen matrix is a
      possible alternative to connective tissue graft.

      The purpose of this clinical study is to compare short-term (3-6 months) outcomes of a root
      coverage using the tunnel technique with the collagen matrix and the same technique with CTG
      for the treatment of multiple recessions Miller class I and II.

      Twenty eight patients are enrolled in the study. Patients in the test group are treated with
      xenogenic collagen matrix using the tunnel technique whereas patients in the control group
      with CTG. Clinical recordings are obtained at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. The
      percentage of average recession coverage (ARC) is evaluated after 3 and 6 months after the
      surgery.

    <description>The surgery starts with the sulcular incisions in the region of recessions, which enable access for the supraperiosteal preparation. The procedure is extended into the mucosal tissue using the tunneling knives. The partial-thickness flap is performed at the buccal site. Only the papillary regions are fully detached with the periosteum. The graft is placed into the tunnel and stabilized with absorbable sutures.The mobilized mucous flap is advanced coronally and stabilized with non-absorbable suspensory sutures.</description>
