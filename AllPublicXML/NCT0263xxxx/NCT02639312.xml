      Background:

      Some head and facial abnormalities are rare and present at birth. Others are more common, and
      may not show up until puberty. These conditions have different causes and characteristics.
      Researchers want to learn more about these conditions by comparing people with face, head,
      and neck abnormalities to family members and to healthy volunteers without such conditions.

      Objectives:

      To learn more about abnormal development of the face, head, and neck. To determine their
      genetic variants.

      Eligibility:

      People who have not had surgery for facial trauma:

      People ages 2 and older with craniofacial abnormalities (may participate offsite)

      Unaffected relatives ages 2 and older

      Healthy volunteers ages 6 and older

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam focusing on head, face,
      and neck

      Participants may be followed for several years. Visits may require staying near the clinic
      for a few days.

      A visit is required for the following developmental stages, along with follow-up visits:

      Age 2 6

      Age 6 10

      Age 11 17

      Age 18 and older

      Visits may include:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Questionnaires

      Oral exam

      Blood and urine tests

      Cheek swab: a cotton swab will be wiped across the inside of the cheek several times.

      Cone beam CT scan (CBCT): x-rays create an image of the head, face, teeth, and neck.
      Participants will

      stand still or sit on a chair for about 20 minutes while the scanner rotates around the head.

      Photos of the head and face

      Offsite participants will provide:

      Copies of medical and dental records

      Leftover tissue samples from previous surgery

      Blood sample or cheek swab

      This is a natural history study that will examine craniofacial anomalies that affect the
      normal development of the facial skeleton, including birth defects and dentofacial
      developmental abnormalities that express themselves with the growth of the individual.
      Craniofacial anomalies may be rare and present at birth, such as hemifacial microsomia (1 in
      every 7500 live births), or common, such as dentofacial deformities including the Habsburg
      Jaw or mandibular prognathism (1% of the US population) that becomes apparent as a child
      enters puberty. These are striking disorders as they involve the face and surrounding
      structures, which is a focal point of self-identity and are intimately tied to quality of
      life and daily function. The primary objectives of this study are:

        1. To characterize rare and common craniofacial anomalies using both extensive clinical
           evaluations, 3D cone-beam computed tomography-based geometric morphometric and
           cephalometric analyses, and surface morphology

        2. To determine the genetic variants for rare and common craniofacial anomalies.

      The secondary objective is to establish a curated craniofacial phenomic/genomic database. The
      study population includes individuals ages greater than or equal to 2 years with any
      craniofacial anomaly but will focus on two specific conditions that affect facial skeletal
      development: hemifacial microsomia and mandibular prognathism in children and adults. Up to
      1920 subjects and family members as well as 480 healthy volunteers will be recruited through
      referrals from NIH or outside providers and institutions. This natural history protocol will
      generate research data that will improve the understanding and etiology of craniofacial
      dysmorphologies.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        For Subjects:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 2 with craniofacial anomalies/abnormalities. Affected
             family member (defined as an individual with a demonstrable relationship (any family
             relationship no matter how distant) with the above subject in the pedigree) who
             expresses craniofacial anomalies will be classified as a subject.

          -  Able to provide consent or in the case, of minors, have a legally-authorized
             representative to provide consent.

        For Unaffected Family Members:

          -  These family members are defined as individuals with a demonstrable relationship (any
             family relationship no matter how distant) with a proband subject by pedigree who do
             not express craniofacial anomalies.
