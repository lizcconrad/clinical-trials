  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate a drug called AG-519, which is being developed for
      the treatment of a disease called pyruvate kinase deficiency (also known as PK deficiency)
      and other forms of anemia. This study is a 5 part study with Part 1 enrolling healthy
      volunteers into single ascending dose (SAD) groups, Part 2 enrolling healthy volunteers into
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) groups and Part 3 enrolling healthy volunteers to investigate
      how much of the study drug is taken up by the body and how food affects the uptake of a
      prototype formulation of AG-519, Part 4 enrolling healthy volunteers of Japanese origin to
      compare to the results of subjects of non-Japanese origin, and Part 5 a non-randomized,
      open-label, multiple dose study enrolling healthy volunteers to further investigate how much
      of the study drug is taken up by the body when dosed over 14 days.
