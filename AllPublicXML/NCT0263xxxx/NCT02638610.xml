      The aim of the study: Assessment of Changes of Periocular Skin Sensation Following Eyelid and
      Ocular Surface Surgeries.

      Study design: an interventional study that will be conducted at the ophthalmology department,
      Meir hospital, Kfar Saba, Israel.

      the study will include 60 healthy patients, at the ages of 40-80, which are candidates for
      eyelid surgery: blepharoptosis repair, blepharoplasty, ectropion repair and entropion repair.

      The patients will be recruited from Meir's ophthalmology outpatient clinic. Each patient will
      undergo a full ophthalmologic examination including relevant assessment of the specific
      eyelid pathology.

      The eyelid's sensation will be assessed at 6 points of the eyelid using the Cochet-Bonnet
      filament-type aesthesiometer (Luneau Ophtalmologie, Paris, France). Measurements will take
      place before surgery, and two weeks, three months and six months after surgery.

    <description>The eyelid's sensation will be assessed at 6 points of the eyelid using the Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer (Luneau Ophtalmologie, Paris, France). Measurements will take place before surgery, and two weeks, three months and six months after surgery.
This instrument contains a 6 centimeters long, retractable, flexible monofilament. For any given length, when applied perpendicularly to a test surface, the filament will exert a precise pressure before visibly bending. The filament's length inversely corresponds to the pressure exerted by the aesthesiometer such that the shorter the filament length, the more pressure it exerts on the test surface.</description>
