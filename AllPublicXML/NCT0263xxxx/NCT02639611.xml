      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in shoulder tightness, chest
      tightness, and general pain related to post-mastectomy reconstructive surgery with tissue
      expansion in women who are randomized to receive acupuncture treatment immediately after
      surgery (twice a week for 6 weeks) compared to those who are randomized to no acupuncture
      treatment for 6 weeks, but offered acupuncture at the end of the 6 week study period.
