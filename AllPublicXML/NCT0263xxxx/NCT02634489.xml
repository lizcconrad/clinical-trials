    <textblock>
      A study to compare the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin HCl and solifenacin succinate after
      co-administration of single entity tablets and of the combination tablet EC905 under steady
      state conditions at three dose strengths.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 3 dose cohorts of 15 subjects each. In Period 1, subjects will be randomized to
      either receive multiple doses of both tamsulosin HCl and solifenacin succinate as single
      entity tablets, or the combination tablet EC905. The alternate treatment will be provided in
      Period 2. The cohorts will be balanced for period effects and first-order carry over effects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to tamsulosin HCl, solifenacin succinate, EC905 or
             any of the components of the formulations used.

          -  Any of the liver function tests above the upper limit of normal at repeated
             measurements.

          -  Any clinically significant history of asthma, eczema, any other allergic condition or
             previous severe hypersensitivity to any other drug (excluding non-active hay fever).

             diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg (blood pressure measurements taken in triplicate
             after subject has been resting in supine position for 5 min; pulse will be measured
             automatically).

             Syndrome (LQTS).

          -  Use of any prescribed or OTC (over-the counter) drugs (including vitamins, natural and
             herbal remedies, e.g. St. John's wort) in the 2 weeks prior to admission to the

          -  Regular use of any inducer of liver metabolism (e.g. barbiturates, rifampin) in the 3
             months prior to admission to the Clinical Unit.

          -  Any use of drugs of abuse within 3 months prior to admission to the Clinical Unit.

          -  History of smoking more than 10 cigarettes (or equivalent amount of tobacco) per day

             40 cc of spirits or 1 glass of wine) within 3 months prior to admission to the
             Clinical Unit.

          -  Donation of blood or blood products within 3 months prior to admission to the Clinical
             Unit.

          -  Positive serology test for HBsAg, anti HAV (IgM), anti-HCV or anti-HIV 1+2.

          -  Participation in any clinical study within 3 months or participation in more than 3
             clinical studies within 12 months, prior to the expected date of enrolment into the
             study, provided that the clinical study did not entail a biological compound with a
             long terminal half-life. An exception is (partly) participation in Astellas study
             905-CL-071, provided a washout of at least 12 days is considered prior to
             re-enrolment.
