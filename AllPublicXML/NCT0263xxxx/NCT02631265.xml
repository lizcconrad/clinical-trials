  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that insulin basal rate reduction initiated at exercise onset can reduce
      the hypoglycemic risk during exercise. However, another potentially more efficient strategy
      to prevent exercise-induced hypoglycemia could be to reduce insulin basal rate a certain time
      prior to exercise. No study investigated what would be the best timing to initiate such
      temporary basal insulin reduction. Therefore, the objective of this study will be to compare
      the efficacy of three strategies to prevent exercise-induced hypoglycemia during a 45 min
      exercise at 60% VO2peak (moderate intensity): 1) reduce insulin basal rate at the time of
      exercise; 2) reduce insulin basal rate 20 minutes prior to exercise; 3) reduce insulin basal
      rate 40 minutes prior to exercise. Investigators hypothesize that the time spent in
      hypoglycemia will be less when the insulin basal rate is reduced 40 minutes prior to exercise
      compared to a reduction at the time of exercise. Secondary hypotheses are: 1) Time spent in
      hypoglycemia will be less when the insulin basal rate is reduced 20 minutes prior to exercise
      compared to a reduction at the time of exercise; 2) Time spent in hypoglycemia will be less
      when the insulin basal rate is reduced 40 minutes prior to exercise compared to a reduction
      20 minutes prior to exercise.
