  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TetraGraph is a newly developed EMG-based (electromyograph), quantitative, battery-powered
      neuromuscular monitoring system intended for daily clinical use. The primary aim of this
      clinical investigation is to examine the applicability (ease of use, equipment need, etc.),
      repeatability (precision or internal consistency) and performance (signal quality, accuracy
      of outcome, voltage of stimulation output before and during a stimulus) and tolerability of
      the Tetragraph device in healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint will be assessment of the ability of the TetraGraph prototype to deliver
      neuro-stimulation, and assessment of the ability to acquire muscle action potentials and
      record these evoked responses on the SD-card. The study will be performed on healthy
      volunteers - 10 male and 10 female. Testing will be done at two separate
      stimulation/recording sites: ulnar nerve stimulation/abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle
      recording; and ulnar nerve stimulation/adductor pollices (AP) muscle recording. The side of
      testing (RIGHT vs. LEFT hand) will be determined a priori and randomly by the principal
      investigator, such that 10 volunteers each will be tested on the RIGHT and 10 on the LEFT
      hands. At each stimulating/recording site two stimulation protocols (single twitch
      stimulation and train-of-four stimulation) will be performed with growing current intensity
      (10-60 mA (milliAmps), in a 10 mA step-up fashion). Volunteers will rate the tolerability of
      each stimulation protocols on a visual analogue scale. EMG data will be recorded on the SD
      card and evaluated off-line.

    <description>The secondary outcome measures is a composite of several performance data:
Confirmation that the prototype can independently stimulate and record repetitive patterns of neuro-stimulation (1 Hz ST and TOF);
Verify that stimulus artifact will not exceed 2.0 mV( millivolt), nor overlap with the evoked EMG response when a stimulus is applied;
Validate the consistency of delivered stimuli, assessed by repeatability of evoked responses.
Verify delivery of neuro-stimulation at varying currents, from the lowest current that produces an evoked response to the current above which the evoked response no longer increases, at increasing current levels separated by steps of 10 mA;
Determine any difference in recording performance using evoked responses (1 Hz ST, TOF) between recordings at two different hand muscles, the abductor digiti minimi and adductor pollices muscles;
Document consistency of stimulation at constant currents independent of patient age, sex, handedness or</description>

    <measure>Safety assessment of TetraGraph device</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects will be followed for the time of measurements an expected avarage of one hour</time_frame>
    <description>The safety of Tetragraph device will be assesses by checking the stimulating and recording electrode positions for skin reactions and by establishing the discomfort, if any, associated with nerve stimulation in awake, un-medicated human volunteers. Assessment will be made using an 11-point visual analog score (VAS) scale, anchored with 0 (representing no distress) and 10 (representing the worst distress ever experienced) (Table I). These VAS scores will be compared to those reported in the literature.</description>
