    <textblock>
      The ProArc Medical ClearRing™ system is a prostatic reshaping device that is designed to
      treat Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) due to BPH.

      During the procedure an implant is delivered into the prostate tissue obstructing the urethra
      and restricting urine flow. The delivery system uses an electro-cutting blade to perform a
      circular and superficial incision, in which the implant is placed. Such an implant, with the
      shape of an open ring, expands the obstructed area, reducing the fluid obstruction through
      the prostatic urethra.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be conducted on BPH patients, candidates for TURP and will aim to
      evaluate the ability of the ClearRing™ to improve BPH symptoms while conforming to safety of
      the procedure.

      In the proposed study the implants will be inserted by a dedicated delivery system with the
      aid of resectoscope. Electrical current will be administered by off-the-shelf CE Mark
      diathermy that passes through the system to cut and pave the ring course.

      The proper positioning of the implants will be evaluated by cystoscopy or TRUS and following
      implant positioning the device will be withdrawn.

      The delivery tool, the implants, resectoscope and the diathermy equipment will be supplied by
      ProArc Ltd.
