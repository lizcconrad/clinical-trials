      This study is designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      for locally advanced thymoma or thymic carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complete resection is difficult to achieve without damaging the main organs in some locally
      advanced thymoma or thymic carcinoma. The previous trials have showed that radiotherapy was
      significantly associated with prolonged OS and chemotherapy is playing an increasing role in
      treatment of patients with advanced thymoma or thymic carcinoma. However, whether or not
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy is safety in locally advanced thymoma or thymic carcinoma is
      still unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced thymoma or thymic carcinoma.
