      Background:

      The present study aims to identify the mechanisms underlying the deficit in facial emotion
      recognition reported both in schizophrenia and the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and thus,
      reveal a distinction between the two disorders. Indeed, despite the clinical overlap between
      the two syndromes, some of the symptoms appear to be specific to only one of them. In
      particular, the disturbance of visual functions is specifically observed in the 22q11.2DS.
      Hence, the difficulties in facial emotion recognition in schizophrenia and in the 22q11.DS
      are likely accounted by different cognitive impairments. Investigating which mechanisms are
      disturbed would allow a specialized support for patients.

      Our main hypothesis is that the deficit in facial emotion recognition is more related to
      visual impairments in the 22q11.2DS than in schizophrenia. This hypothesis will be tested in
      two groups of patients (22q11.2DS and schizophrenic patients) and a control group (healthy
      subjects) using an experimental paradigm based on electroencephalography (EEG).

      A second aim of this study is to determine whether the severity of the two disorders'
      symptoms is correlated with the cerebral response to facial expressions. To answer this
      question, a set of clinical and neuropsychological tests will be conducted for each patient.

      Methods:

      This study will be conducted using visual steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs).
      Visual SSVEPs are periodic neural electrophysiological activities that arise in response to
      fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS). They will be recorded in response to the periodic
      presentation of faces, according to an oddball paradigm. While pictures of faces will appear
      at a 6 Hz rate, only 1 out of 5 will display an emotion, corresponding to a 1.2 Hz oddball
      frequency. Different emotions will be tested (happiness, sadness, anger, fear and disgust),
      displayed with different intensities (20%, 60%, 100%). SSVEPs at 6 Hz will reflect general
      visual mechanisms (in response to a mixture of low-level (i.e., contrast coding) and
      high-level (i.e., face detection) processes). Importantly, SSVEPs at 1.2 Hz will index the
      visual mechanisms specifically involved in facial expression perception and their sensitivity
      to emotion intensity. Both measures will help determine the underlying brain topographies.

      Alongside, clinical and neuropsychological tests will be conducted. While the clinical tests
      will evaluate the severity of the symptoms, the neuropsychological tests will assess
      different features such as attention, memory, verbal and visuo-spatial abilities. The
      patients' scores will be linked with their cerebral activity in response to facial
      expressions.

      Outcomes:

      To better understand the impairment of facial emotion recognition in schizophrenia and
      22q11.2DS and to improve its care.

    <description>SSVEPs arise in response to the periodic presentation of emotional faces. They are analyzed in the frequency domain. Two types of responses are expected: the general visual response (6 Hz and its harmonics) and the expression-specific response (1.2 Hz and its harmonics). Both responses will be compared across the different groups.</description>
