      Study Design: Longitudinal Experimental Study

      Objective: Analyze the relationship between Upper Limb Neural Tension Test (ULNTT1) and
      cervico-thoracic spine biomechanics using a new motion-capture spine movement data analyzing
      model based on Least Square Approximation.

      Summary of Background Data: ULNTT1 is a test able to determine cervical nerve roots and
      brachial plexus displacement within their interface structures. No studies were conducted
      about ULNTT1 and cervico-thoracic spine motion patterns relationship.

      Methods: 12 subjects with ULNTT1 asymmetry &gt; 10° (AS group) and 11 subjects with ULNTT1
      symmetry (S group) at clinical tests will be enrolled for the study. Subjects will be
      analyzed for ULNTT1 with an electrogoniometer using two parameters, one operator and one
      patient-dependent. Fine lateral bending cervico-thoracic spine motion patterns will be
      collected with motion-capturing technique and data will be analyzed with Least Square
      Approximation tools. Subjects with impairments in cervico-thoracic spine mobility will
      undergo to correction of those with spinal manipulative therapy. ULNTT1 and spine mobility
      will be so re-evaluated with same methods.

    <description>ULNTT are neurodynamics test of brachial plexus. Two parameters are collected during the procedure: firm resistance to elbow extension, named R2, operator dependent, and severe pain onset, named P2, patient dependent. Both results are expressed as degrees that left to full elbow extension. Four repetition per side are performed and average value is calculated.</description>
