  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current protocols use G-CSF to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells from matched sibling
      and volunteer unrelated donors. Unfortunately, this process requires four to six days of
      G-CSF injection and can be associated with side effects, most notably bone pain and rarely
      splenic rupture. BL-8040 is given as a single SC injection, and collection of cells occurs on
      the same day as BL-8040 administration. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      this novel agent for hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization and allogeneic
      transplantation based on the following hypotheses:

        -  Healthy HLA-matched donors receiving one injection of BL-8040 will mobilize sufficient
           CD34+ cells (at least 2.0 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg recipient weight) following no more than
           two leukapheresis collections to support a hematopoietic cell transplant.

        -  The hematopoietic cells mobilized by SC BL-8040 will be functional and will result in
           prompt and durable hematopoietic engraftment following transplantation into
           HLA-identical siblings with advanced hematological malignancies using various
           non-myeloablative and myeloablative conditioning regimens and regimens for routine GVHD
           prophylaxis.

        -  If these hypotheses 1 and 2 are confirmed after an interim safety analysis of the data,
           then the study will continue and include recruitment of haploidentical donors.
