  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complex oro-facial pain is a poorly diagnosed and poorly treated cause of significant
      suffering and disability. This study will explore the ability of fMRI to identify patients
      with complex oro-facial pain who respond to transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To establish baseline patterns of MRI in patients with chronic oro-facial pain without a
           definitive etiologic diagnosis.

        2. To estimate the rate of treatment success of transcranial stimulation of the primary
           motor cortex (M1) in these patients.

        3. To identify post-treatment MRI patterns that are associated with treatment success.

      Methods: Patients diagnosed with complex oral or facial pain at the UMPhysicians Complex
      Facial Pain Clinic who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be offered participation in
      the study. They will undergo baseline evaluation for depression with the HAM-D and MADRAS
      scales and for quality of life with the WHOQOL-BREF scale. Pain will be assessed using a 10
      point visual analogue scale. Resting and pcasl MRI will be done within 24 hours before the
      first treatment. Treatment will consist of five daily sessions of motor cortex stimulation
      contralateral to the pain. Visual analogue pain scores will be obtained just before each
      treatment. Rating scales, resting and pcasl MRI will be repeated within 24 hours and at 2
      weeks after the last treatment. Analysis: FMRI activation patterns will be examined by the
      investigators and correlated with treatment outcomes with the goal of identifying fMRI
      characteristics that can select patients suitable for further study.
