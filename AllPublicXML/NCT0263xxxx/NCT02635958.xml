  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With, one in three Americans now having a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30, and the
      fastest growing segment of the population having a BMI greater than 40, it is paramount to
      conduct validation of approaches to measure body composition. Currently the dual-energy x-ray
      absorptiometry (iDXA) is the gold standard for measuring the body composition. But it is
      often difficult to perform since it is limited to specific height, weight and BMI's. InBody
      is a tool which uses bio electric impedance to measure the body composition. This study will
      compare both approaches. Validation is necessary as it is clinically quite pertinent to
      accurately assess a patients' body fat percentage, fat free mass, and total body water and
      changes that are occurring with nutritional support.

      This study will use a stratified design. Eligible participants will be categorized with BMI
      category to receive InBody followed by iDXA. A total of 176 participants will be placed in 1
      of 4 arms (n = 44 per arm) based on their BMI: 1) 18.5-24.9; 2) 25-29.9; 3) 30-34.9; and 4) ≥
      35. Within these arms, the 44 participants will participate in an InBody 770® body
      composition measure as well as an iDXA body composition measure.
