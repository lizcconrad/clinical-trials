    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works in treating patients with human T-cell
      leukemia virus (HTLV)-associated T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Nivolumab is an antibody, which is
      a type of blood protein that tags infected cells and other harmful agents. Nivolumab works
      against a protein called programmed cell death (PD)-1 and may help the body destroy cancer
      cells by helping the immune system to keep fighting cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of nivolumab for patients with HTLV-associated
      adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma (ATLL).

      II. To determine the efficacy of nivolumab for patients with HTLV-associated ATLL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine effects of nivolumab on HTLV-1 proviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) loads.

      II. To determine the effects of nivolumab on anti-HTLV-1 and anti-ATLL immune responses.

      III. To determine effects of nivolumab on HTLV-1 integration site clonality.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 14 days for 46 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
