  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop an abnormal gait detection algorithm and a vibratory
      stimulation system on a lower limb to improve gait stability and prevent falls. The
      investigators want to detect, assess and communicate fall risk indicators obtained via the
      shoe sensors, and assess effectiveness of a gait synchronized vibration system to the plantar
      surface in reducing fall risk.The system consists of a gait measurement module, an abnormal
      gait detection module, and a vibratory stimulation module.

      Forty (40) Individuals with decreased confidence in ambulatory scores (&lt;80%) as per the
      Activities Specific Balance Confidence questionnaire, will undergo functional assessments for
      visual (Snellen chart, Humphrey Visual Field Testing, Gaze Stabilization test, depth
      perception evaluation), vestibular (Dizziness Handicap Inventory, Head Thrust test) and
      proprioceptive (Balance Master, Berg Balance Scale, Joint Position Sense) impairments, to
      evaluate factors which might contribute to increased falls risk.

      Participants will be asked to walk return for a second visit and to walk with a shoe sensor
      and gait synchronized vibratory stimulus under conditions of (1) Baseline performance on the
      Six Minute Walk test (2) Performance on the Six Minute Walk test and Dynamic Gait Index
      without vibratory stimulus (3) Performance on the Six Minute Walk test and Dynamic Gait Index
      with vibratory stimulus.

    <measure>Dizziness Handicap Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported questionnaire designed to identify functional, physical or emotional difficulties subjects experience as a result of dizziness or unsteadiness. Subjects will answer the 25 item form with &quot;yes&quot; (4 points), &quot;sometimes&quot; (2 points) and &quot;no&quot; (0 points) for a maximum of 100 points. Scores 16-34 indicate a mild handicap, 36-52 a moderate handicap and scores 54 or greater indicate severe handicap. The cut off for participation in the study will be scores &lt;16.</description>

    <measure>Dynamic Gait Index</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This test will evaluate an individual's impairments in ambulating under different circumstances to assess for fall risk. Subjects will be asked to walk under normal circumstances on level ground, walking as quickly as they can, walking with horizontal head turns, vertical head turns, stop and pivot, step over obstacles, step around obstacles and walking up stairs. Subjects will be scored out of a possible 24 points for the 8 domains awarding 3 points for normal ambulatory patterns, 2 points for mild impairments in performing exercises, 1 point for moderate impairments and 0 points for severe impairment. Scores less than or equal to 19 are predictive of falls whereas scores 22 or greater indicate safe ambulators. The cut off for participation in the study will be scores &lt;22</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Gaze Stabilization via the Head Thrust Test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The subject's head is suddenly and rapidly rotated through a small range (15-30 degrees) and then stopped. The patient's task is to maintain fixation on a visual target. This is repeated to both sides. Individuals with normal vestibular function will be able to maintain visual fixation. Individuals with bilateral vestibular loss will demonstrate corrective saccades following the head thrust test in both directions. Individuals with unilateral vestibular loss will demonstrate corrective saccades after head rotation towards the side of decreased function. The cut off for participation in the study will be any corrective saccades following cessation of head rotation.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Six Minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>18 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to walk as far as they can over a period of six minutes as rapidly as they can. We will evaluate the difference between distances walked at baseline with regular foot wear, while wearing the shoe without vibratory stimulus to assess gait parameters using the shoe sensor and finally while wearing the shoe with vibratory stimulus turned on.</description>

The questionnaire asks participants to score how much pain they have experienced during the past week from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain), followed by how much difficulty is experienced in physical functioning during stair navigation and shopping ranked from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), then overall how well they are coping with their arthritis pain and how they feel they are doing from 0 (very well) to 10 (very poor). Scores below 7 show minimal arthritic pain and scores cutting at 15 and 25 show increasing severity of symptoms. The cut off for participation in the study will be &lt;=7.</description>

    <description>Subjects, wearing regular footwear, will begin in a seated position in an arm chair and are instructed to rise, walk three meters and return to the chair and assume the seated position once more. The examiner will begin timing the patient on the word &quot;go&quot; and will stop time when the patient completes the exercise. A score greater than 15 seconds in this assessment indicates an increased risk for falls.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Video Documentation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be videotaped during their performance in the Six Minute Walk Test and the Dynamic gait index to visually assess and document any changes in gait parameters such as cadence, velocity, stride and step lengths under conditions of baseline level walking and with and without vibratory stimulus. The videotaping procedures will focus on the subject's lower extremities but may include their face in order to fully capture the gait</description>

    <intervention_name>Gait Synchronized Vibration System</intervention_name>
    <description>A wearable vibratory shoe that delivers stimulus to the soles that is synchronized with step resulting in improved gait.The shoe consists of two externally mounted vibration units (tactors).
