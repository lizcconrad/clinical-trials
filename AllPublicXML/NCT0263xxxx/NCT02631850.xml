  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current proposal aims to conduct a multi-site randomized controlled trial comparing
      virtual-reality gaming delivery of Constraint Induced Movement therapy (CI therapy) with (1)
      traditional clinic-based CI therapy of equal total active therapy duration and (2) a control
      group equating the dose of in-person therapy. Individuals with chronic stroke will be
      randomized to one of four different interventions: (1) traditional clinic-based CI therapy
      (35 therapist/client contact hours), (2) therapist-as-consultant virtual reality CI therapy
      (5 therapist/client contact hours in the clinic and 15 hours of independent game play at
      home), (3) therapist-as-consultant virtual reality CI therapy with additional therapist
      contact via telerehabilitation (5 therapist/client contact hours in the clinic, 4 therapist
      contact hours via teleconference, and 15 hours of independent game play in the home), and (4)
      5 hours of standard occupational therapy. After 6-month follow-up, individuals assigned to
      standard OT/PT will cross over to a modified gaming therapy condition (a stand-alone
      application of the rehabilitation game without additional therapist contact).

    <description>Participants will receive a 35-hour &quot;dose&quot; of CI therapy. Treatment will consist of 35 therapist/client contact hours in the clinic, 10 weekdays, over 3 weeks. To promote carry-over of motor gains to daily activities, participants will complete: (1) a treatment contract, (2) daily self-report of arm use, and (3) problem-solving to overcome barriers to use of the more affected upper extremity. In addition, the client will agree to wear a padded restraint mitt on the less affected hand for the majority of waking hours to encourage use of the weaker hand for daily activities. Finally, the participant will agree to 30 minutes per day of individualized task-practice outside the clinic (in addition to training in the clinic) focused on functional activities catered towards accomplishing the person's therapeutic goals.</description>

    <description>15 hours of progressive massed motor practice will occur through in-home video game play over 15 consecutive weekdays. Participants will play the game during times of their choosing. The participant will wear an activity monitor biofeedback device for the majority of waking hours. As with traditional CI therapy, the client will agree to an additional 30 minutes per day of individualized task-practice. Five therapist/client contact hours will occur in the clinic on approximate treatment days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and will focus on treatment elements that cannot be readily addressed through the game, such as problem-solving to help the participant carry over motor gains to daily life.</description>

    <description>Five therapist/client contact hours will occur on approximate treatment days 1, 3, 6, and 11 (same schedule as gaming CI therapy). 1 hour progressive resistance exercise to establish and progress an upper extremity home exercise program, 2 hours of neuromuscular reeducation, and 2 hours functional practice on ADLs with verbal encouragement to use the more affected upper extremity to the largest extent possible. Home practice consists of stretching exercises, designed to increase range of motion, prescribed twice daily. After completing their participation in the standard OT condition (6 months), participants will be crossed-over to a CI therapy gaming only condition. This condition will be identical to that described above, excluding therapist contact throughout the intervention. Rather, participants will receive a DVD explaining the intervention and guiding them through use of the system.</description>
