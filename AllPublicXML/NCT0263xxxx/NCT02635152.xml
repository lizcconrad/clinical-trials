  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a computerized intervention designed to
      reduce appearance and evaluation related interpretation biases will reduce symptoms
      associated with body dysmorphic disorder.

      The present study aims to examine the feasibility of a remote treatment for body dysmorphic
      disorder delivered via the Internet. To evaluate the efficacy of the IBM protocol we have
      developed in reducing negative appearance and evaluative related interpretations, we will
      conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial over the internet. Individuals with a diagnosis
      of body dysmorphic disorder (N = 40) will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1) IBM or
      2) progressive muscle relaxation. Each condition will consist of eight 10-25 minute treatment
      sessions. Participants will complete two sessions per week for four weeks and will be
      administered assessments at pre-treatment, one week post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up.
      We hypothesize that: 1) IBM will lead to greater reductions in BDD symptoms than the PMR
      condition; 2) IBM will lead to greater reductions in depression, anxiety and suicidal
      ideation than the PMR condition; 3) IBM will lead to greater reductions in threat
      interpretations and greater increases in benign interpretations than the PMR condition; 4)
      The effects of condition on BDD symptoms will be mediated by changes in BDD-related
      interpretation bias; and 5) The effects of training in the IBM condition will be maintained
      at the 3-month follow-up assessments.

    <description>Treatment consists of eight brief sessions. In Task 1, participants read unique scenarios (&quot;You notice someone pointing in your direction&quot;). A sentence meant to resolve the ambiguity will appear (&quot;This person thinks they reco_nize you&quot;). After filling in the missing letter, the interpretation is reinforced by requiring the participants to correctly answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to a comprehension question (&quot;Is this person mocking you?&quot;). In Task 2, participants are shown a word denoting a threatening (&quot;mocking&quot;) or benign (&quot;cheerful&quot;) interpretation. Participants are presented with an ambiguous scenario (&quot;You hear people at a nearby table laughing&quot;) and asked to denote whether the word and the sentence are related. Participants will receive positive or negative feedback based on their response.</description>
