  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonadherence to medication is a major obstacle to successful treatment of renal transplant
      patients. This study has two primary aims. The first is to test whether a culturally
      sensitive cognitive-behavioral adherence promotion program could significantly improve
      medication adherence to tacrolimus prescription. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      either group CBT or to standard care. The second aim is to pilot a novel strategy of
      adherence measurement - unannounced telephone pill counts, which has been shown to be a valid
      and reliable means to measure medication adherence in other patient populations. Participants
      will be recruited from waiting area of the kidney transplant clinic at SUNY Downstate Medical
      Center in Brooklyn, NY. Three unannounced telephone pill counts will be conducted prior to
      start of the intervention in order to establish baseline adherence and three pill counts will
      be conducted post-intervention. Tacrolimus trough concentration levels will also be collected
      as an additional biological measure of adherence.
