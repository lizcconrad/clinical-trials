    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the quality of life in patients
      undergoing the Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy, PD) for pancreatic cancer. The
      Whipple procedure can be done by laparoscopic (small incisions) or an open procedure (large
      incision) to treat the patients cancer. The goal of this study is to see if there is any
      difference in quality of life between patients who undergo the laparoscopic or the open
      Whipple procedure. Surgical technique (minimally invasive versus open) will be at the
      discretion of the operating surgeon. Patients will not be randomized to a treatment arm.

      A subset of these patients will also be asked to take part in a pre- and postoperative
      in-depth interview to explore the lived experiences of patients with resectable pancreatic
      cancer.
