  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase 2 study to evaluate the combination of Vigil™ and nivolumab in
      advanced or metastatic NSCLC that is progressive on or after one prior platinum-based
      systemic therapy. Patients meeting study eligibility criteria will receive Vigil™ every 2
      weeks (for a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 12 doses) and nivolumab every 2 weeks. The
      combination of Vigil™ and nivolumab will demonstrate a higher objective response rate (ORR)
      than the historical ORR of single agent nivolumab in patients with advanced NSCLC.

    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase 2 study to evaluate the combination of Vigil™ autologous tumor
      cell immunotherapy and nivolumab PD-1 inhibitor therapy in patients with advanced or
      metastatic NSCLC that is progressive on or after one prior platinum-based systemic therapy
      (ALK or EGFR mutation-targeted therapy should have been received if appropriate mutation
      present).

      Patients undergoing a standard surgical procedure (e.g., tumor biopsy, palliative resection,
      or thoracentesis of malignant pleural effusion) may elect to have tumor tissue procured for
      manufacture of Vigil™ vaccine. Patients meeting study eligibility criteria will receive
      doublet therapy comprising of (i) Vigil™ 1 x 10^7 cells by intradermal injection every 2
      weeks for a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 12 doses and (ii) nivolumab 3 mg/kg by intravenous
      infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks. Three to six weeks after tissue procurement has
      occurred eligibility will be reconfirmed by the study site. Subjects must begin the study
      regimen within 6 weeks of tissue procurement. Radiological assessment of tumor response will
      be performed at screening, Cycle 5 (Week 9) and approximately every 2 months thereafter until
      progressive disease unless the subject is lost to follow-up, withdraws consent for study
      related procedures, or initiates another cancer therapy. Tumor biopsy for correlative studies
      should be obtained at tissue procurement and at Cycle 5 (Week 9). Peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) for correlative studies should be obtained before tumor procurement,
      and prior to initiation of study therapy on Day 1 at Cycle 1 (Week 1), Cycle 5 (Week 9),
      Cycle 9 (Week 17) and EOT.

             results of the study, interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration
             of the study, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the
             opinion of the treating Investigator.
