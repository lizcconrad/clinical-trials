  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a bone labeling calcium tracer methodology to compare the dose-response
      effect of blueberry consumption on calcium retention and bone loss. Post-menopausal women
      will receive food or beverage products containing freeze-dried blueberries in the amount
      equivalent to 0.75 (low), 1.5 (medium), and 3 cups (high) of fresh blueberries per day over a
      42-day period. The hypothesis is that the polyphenolics found in blueberries will reduce
      calcium loss from bones.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be dosed with Ca-41, a rare long-lived radioisotope of calcium. After the
      equilibration of tracer in the body and its deposition in bones (150 days), subjects will be
      randomized to one of 6 dose sequences, all of which will begin with a 42-day baseline period.
      During baseline, 24-hour urine will be collected every 14 days. Following baseline, subjects
      will enter a 42-day intervention period with one of three doses of blueberries equivalent to
      0.75 (low), 1.5 (medium), and 3 cups (high) of blueberries per day. Each dose will be
      provided in the form of freeze-dried blueberry powder incorporated in 2-4 foods or beverages
      per day. During the intervention, 24-hour urine will be collected weekly for 6 weeks except
      week 1. After intervention, subjects will enter a 42-day washout period, during which 24-hour
      urine will be collected every 3 weeks. The entire study duration will be 444 days for
      subjects who have not been dosed with Ca-41 previously. In a crossover design, all subjects
      will complete three 42-day intervention periods corresponding to the three doses of
      blueberries (low, medium, and high), each followed by a 42-day washout period. The
      dose-response effect of continuous blueberry consumption over a 42-day period on bone
      resorption in healthy post-menopausal women will be studied by measuring the loss of Ca-41 in
      urine by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry.
