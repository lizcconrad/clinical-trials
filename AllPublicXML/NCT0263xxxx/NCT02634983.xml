  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess global ventilated lung volume in moderate to severe
      COPD patients using MRI lung imaging after 8 days of treatment with QVA149 compared to
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current physiological measures of small airway dysfunction are limited, subject to a high
      degree of variability and do not allow a quantitative assessment of global and regional
      ventilation defects. The MRI approach represents an opportunity to better understand the
      impact of a potent dual bronchodilator on the small and central airways and thereby
      increasing ventilated lung volume, gas exchange, and ventilation-perfusion deficits.This
      study will investigate the effect of QVA149 on global and regional lung ventilation using MRI
      lung imaging to enhance the understanding of QVA pharmacology in COPD patients.
