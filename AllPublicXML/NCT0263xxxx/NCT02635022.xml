      Aims: (1) to Establish the FLS services at the National Taiwan University Hospital Jinshan
      Branch. (2) To establish a anti-osteoporosis medication management service at Jinshan Branch.

      Method: From Aug., 2015, a fracture liaison services (FLSs) following the 13 'Capture the
      Fracture Best Practice Standards' were implemented at the National Taiwan University Hospital
      Jinshan Branch health care system. The Jinshan Branch program enrolled patient with 1) new
      hip fracture 2) newly identified vertebral fractures (radiological or clinical) from both
      inpatients and outpatients. At the same time, a osteoporosis medication management service is
      also establish as a complement of FLS to enroll patients on antiosteoporosis medications
      (AOMs) but not necessary with fracture.

      Participating physicians will select those eligible for services and refer to study
      coordinators. Study coordinators will conduct baseline assessments on osteoporosis/fracture
      risks, record medical conditions, AOMs, provide educations on osteoporosis, fracture,
      sarcopenia, fall, medications, nutrition, and exercise. They also arrange return clinic
      visit, telephone reminder and follow up for patients, and communicate with providers on
      regular bases.

      During the whole study period, the investigators planed to enroll 200 patients (with or
      without fracture). Each patient would be assessed at baseline, and every 4 months last for
      two years.

      Background:The Asia Fracture Gap Taiwan Study (AFGTS) showed that among fragility fracture
      sufferers, only 1/4 of them underwent bone mineral density (BMD) tests and 1/3 of them
      received treatments for osteoporosis. Secondary fragility fracture prevention services are
      needed to improve the care gaps. In addition, one-year adherence to oral anti-osteoporosis
      medication (AOMs) was only about 30%. In recent years, efforts have been made to change the
      delivery of these medications from oral form to injection form every, 3, 6 or 12 months to
      increase adherence. However, both patients and providers are sometimes confused about the
      multiple choices. Also, patients may receive extra medications if providers did not keep
      tract of their previous AOM uses or patients may changes providers. There were urgent needs
      to provide AOM monitoring and management services to improve cares.

      . Aims: (1) to Establish the FLS services at the National Taiwan University Hospital Jinshan
      Branch. (2) To establish a anti-osteoporosis medication management service at Jinshan Branch.

      Method: The FMS was designed following the 13 'Capture the Fracture Best Practice Standards'.
      The National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) institutional review board approved the study
      in Aug., 2015. Patients were eligible to be enrolled into the FMS part of the study if they
      had

        -  Age &gt;=50 and one of the below

        -  New hip fracture in orthopedic ward

        -  Newly identified radiographic vertebral fractures from plan films in geriatric ward or
           clinical vertebral fractures in outpatient clinics

        -  Newly prescribed with AOMs

        -  Recent change of AOMs

        -  Poor adherence to AOMs

        -  Participating physicians feel that the service will benefit the patient in overall
           osteoporosis and medication managements.

      Exclusion Criteria:

        -  Life expectancy less than 2 years or can't be assessed for communication problems

        -  Atypical fractures

        -  Patient in other medication clinical trials

        -  Unwilling to accept the assessment and treatment

      Osteoporosis-related assessments, treatments, consultations on diet, medications, exercise,
      fall prevention were given mainly by care managers. A system is set up to remind patients to
      take their medications at home or to return to clinic for regular injections of medications.
      Follow up assessments included adherence to education instructions, medications, fall and
      fracture incidences. During the whole study period, we planed to enroll 200 patients. Each
      patient would be assessed at baseline, and every 4 months last for two years.

      Anticipated results:

      Establish Osteoporosis-related patient database combined with NTUH Participating physicians
      and care managers will learn new skills in managing osteoporosis patients.

      Enhance adherence to AOMs The results published in the International Osteoporosis Conferences

    <description>Changes of medication adherence for all participants will be assessed at the 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months after enrollments. However, the main primary outcome will be set at the adherence at 12 months. If the patient changes medication, all AOMs adherence will be combined.
Specific formulas of medication adherence assessments are as below:
for oral medications: adherence is defined as: medication taken/ medication prescribed within past 3 months
for injection medications: adherence is defined as: of injection/ of due injection since baseline or last follow up phone call. Statistics: Simple counts of adherence (%) among all participants.</description>
