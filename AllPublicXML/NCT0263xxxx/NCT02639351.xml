          2. Healthy volunteers with good physical and mental health status, determined on the
             basis of the medical history, a physical examination and the results of the screening
             tests as judged by the investigator

          3. Individuals who have voluntarily given written informed consent after the nature of
             the study has been explained according to local regulatory requirements, prior to
             study entry

          3. Clinical conditions representing a contraindication to intramuscular vaccination and
             blood draws

          4. Abnormal function of the immune system

          5. Received immunoglobulins or any blood products within 180 days prior to informed
             consent

          6. Received an investigational or non-registered medicinal product within 30 days prior
             to informed consent or intend to participate in another clinical study at any time
             during the conduct of this study

          7. Vulnerable subjects (e.g. persons kept in detention), study personnel or an immediate
             family or household member of study personnel, subjects with legal incapacity or
             limited legal capacity

          8. Any relevant deviation from the laboratory parameters at screening as judged by the
             investigator

          9. Previously received any vaccine that included a MenC antigen

         10. Previously suspected or confirmed disease caused by N. meningitides

         11. Had household contact with and/or intimate exposure to an individual with culture
             proven MenC

         12. A positive serum or urine pregnancy test prior to the study vaccine administration or
             are currently lactating.

         13. A positive drugs-of-abuse test prior to the study vaccine administration;

         14. Received any other vaccines within 30 days prior to enrolment in this study or who are
             planning to receive any vaccine within 30 days from the administration of study
             vaccines

         15. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the
