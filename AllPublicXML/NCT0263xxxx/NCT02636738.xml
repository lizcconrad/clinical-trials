      This study aimed to evaluate the safety and utility of VelaTM XL thulium laser in cutting and
      hemostasis for gastrointestinal epithelial neoplasia in Chinese population.

      Vela China study will enroll at least 60 patients. Follow up points are 72 ±3 hours post
      procedure, 7±2 days post procedure, 14 days(±2 days) post procedure.

    <description>The procedure is mostly completed solely at one ESD procedure by VelaTM XL thulium laser, only if the direction of the laser could not be adjacent to the target, endoscopy knives will be assisted. The technique success rate will be calculated by the ratio of operation success subjects to total enrolled subjects.</description>
