      This study investigates one of the mechanism factors of neck pain. Cervical lordotic angle
      alterations affect the tension of serratus anterior muscle. Expected result that the long
      thoracic nerve can be affected in this situation, and could be observed the functional
      changes of the nerve with serratus anterior electromyographic findings.

      Different methods exist in order to evaluate muscle function. For the neck pain, the most
      commonly used method by researchers and clinicians are spot radiography and surface
      electromyography (sEMG). Radiographs can be used for the kyphotic angle or cervical lordotic
      angle measurements. Parameters that can be studied by EMG are amplitude, timing, conduction
      velocity, fatigability and characteristic frequencies/patterns.

      The long thoracic nerve innervates the serratus anterior muscle. This nerve arises from the
      anterior rami of three spinal nerve roots: the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves
      (C5-C7) The nerve descends through the cervicoaxillary canal behind (posterior to) the
      brachial plexus and the axillary artery and vein, resting on the outer surface of the
      serratus anterior. The Serratus anterior electromyography, the needle can be inserted into
      the muscle superficially to the fourth to sixth rib in the medial or posterior axillary line.
      The usual nerve latency time is between 2.6-4 ms.

      In this study, the results of serratus anterior muscle EMG activity and postural cervical
      angle alterations (lateral radiography) in patients with chronic mechanical neck pain will be
      compared with healthy volunteers without neck pain.

    <description>Pain is a sensory and emotional experience, modified by multiple factors, including meaning, context, previous pain experience, culture, gender, expectation, anxiety, depression, fear, family and social factors. Patients admitted to hospital experience a high prevalence of moderate and severe pain. The VAS (Visual Analog Scale, 0 mm &quot;no pain&quot;, to 100 mm,&quot; the worst pain possible &quot;) is used to assess chronic neck pain. The authors aim to find a correlation between factors either neck pain (with VAS), cervical lordosis angle and long thoracic nerve electrophysiological results.</description>

    <description>Obtaining patients lateral spot cervical spine radiography and will measure;
The segmental angle will be measured from C2-C7 inferior endplates on the lateral radiography
If there is a segmental kyphosis (for example kyphotic angle in C4-5 level), the segmental cobb angle will be measured in the level of the main kyphosis
The segmental cobb angle will be measured between C2-C4 inferior endplates and C4-C7 inferior endplates</description>
