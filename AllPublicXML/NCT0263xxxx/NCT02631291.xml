    <textblock>
      This study is for adults 60 years and older who are grieving the recent loss of a spouse or
      partner. Bereavement is one of the most distressing transitions faced by older adults and
      triggers dramatic changes to older adults' daily routine which puts them at-risk for a mood
      disorder. The purpose of this study is to promote bereaved elders' mental health by focusing
      on healthy lifestyle practices. Study treatment involves using a tablet to record their daily
      physical activity, diet, and sleep behaviors, for 12 weeks. The investigators follow-up with
      people for up to one year.

      Preventing mental health problems that develop following spousal bereavement is important
      because these conditions are highly prevalent and have lasting adverse consequences for the
      well-being of the bereaved survivor. The proposed research will evaluate the feasibility and
      acceptability of a healthy lifestyle intervention that uses a technology-based behavioral
      self-monitoring protocol to encourage engagement in physical activity, healthy eating, and
      good sleep practices following spousal bereavement. Data from 10 participants will be used
      for the development of a prevention intervention manual (Aim 1). A small pilot study will be
      conducted (Aim 2) in which 50 participants will be randomly assigned to 12 weeks of (1)
      behavioral self-monitoring using a smartphone (n=20), (2) behavioral self-monitoring using a
      smartphone + motivational interviewing-based lifestyle coaching (n=20), or (3) enhanced usual
      care (n=10). Blood samples will be collected to explore inflammatory cytokines as a potential
      mediator/moderator of mental health risk.

    <description>Behavioral self-monitoring will teach older adults to pay attention to their daily lifestyle practices and the conditions in which they occur. Behavioral self-monitoring is crucial for detecting change early, thereby preventing complications (mental illness symptom burden) that are associated with disruptions in healthy lifestyle practices. The steps of behavioral self-monitoring include: (1) selecting a goal, (2) paying attention to some aspect of behavior, and (3) recording some details of that behavior in a diary.</description>
