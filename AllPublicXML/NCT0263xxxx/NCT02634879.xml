    <textblock>
      The shift towards value-based reimbursement in U.S. healthcare is accelerating. Payment
      reform initiatives have taken many shapes—accountable care organizations, bundled payments,
      value-based purchasing, medical homes, global payment—but all share the common strategy of
      tying provider (physician, hospital, health system) reimbursement to performance on costs,
      outcomes, or both. Yet, pay-for-performance has demonstrated little effect on physician
      behavior and patient outcomes. Payers and provider groups are in need of novel approaches to
      structure provider incentives—both financial and non-financial—to better promote the delivery
      of quality, cost-effective care. In this project, the study team plans to study how
      behavioral economic principles can improve the effectiveness of physician incentives to
      deliver higher quality and lower cost care. They will test the application of specific
      behavioral economic principles including immediacy, social pressure, and loss aversion in
      incentive design and implementation. The study will contribute to an empirical foundation for
      re-design of existing physician incentive programs and implementation of new policies through
      secondary data analyses and a multi-arm experiment that evaluate the impact of promising
      behavioral economics principles on the effectiveness of provider financial and nonfinancial
      incentives.

      The key goal of this project is to demonstrate how using behavioral economic principles to
      inform the structure of provider incentives and the practice environment can improve provider
      performance, especially in settings that are moving away from fee-for-service reimbursement
      and fragmented care towards new payment and delivery models that emphasize coordination of
      care and provider accountability. The project will build upon the recently completed 'Phase
      1' project in which a set of behavioral economic approaches to provider performance were
      identified that could meaningfully improve provider performance, a focused research agenda of
      high-priority tests of these concepts (i.e., content of this proposal) was developed; and
      information on how behavioral economics can be used to improve incentives for physicians was
      disseminated. For this phase, an experimental evaluation will be conducted of the impact of
      social pressure by varying individual and group incentives and the comparative effectiveness
      of two loss aversion framing methods (endowment versus performance gap) on provider
      performance via a multi-arm experiment. We will complement the quantitative evaluations with
      pre- and post-intervention qualitative surveys of physicians and patients to better
      understand the influence on behavior change, culture, acceptability of the incentive program,
      and patient reported outcomes on health and experience.
