  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study in healthy volunteers aims to demonstrate similar PK and PD properties of the new
      human isophane Insulin, Julphar Insulin N, and the already approved reference Insulin,
      Huminsulin® Basal. All participants will receive both study treatments on two separate dosing
      days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Daily injections of insulin are a necessity for many patients with diabetes mellitus in order
      to treat hyperglycemia. Julphar Insulin N and Huminsulin® Basal are both intermediate-acting
      human isophane insulins, i.e. consist of a suspension containing a crystalline precipitate of
      isophane human insulin (NPH) complexed with protamine sulphate and zinc. The new insulin,
      Julphar Insulin N, is biosimilar to Huminsulin® Basal. Demonstration of similar absorption
      (PK) and effects (PD) are necessary to achieve market approval of Julphar Insulin N.

             mL of beer, one glass of wine of 120 mL, or 40 mL spirits).

          -  A positive result in the alcohol and/or urine drug screen at the screening visit.

          -  Smoker (defined as a subject who is smoking more than 5 cigarettes or the equivalent
             per day) who is not able or willing to refrain from smoking and use of nicotine
