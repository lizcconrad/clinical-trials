      This study was a prospective, randomized controlled intervention pilot study conducted in a
      metropolitan city in the upper Midwest of the United States. Forty women who met the criteria
      for depression based on the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical
      Manual of Mental Disorders IV (SCID-I; First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &amp; Williams, 1997)were
      randomized to an experimental mindfulness-based yoga condition (n=20) or a walking control
      condition (n=20). Both programs were home-based motivational sessions delivered over the
      telephone and lasted 12 weeks. Assessments were conducted at baseline, three months (i.e.,
      post-intervention), one-month follow-up (i.e., one month after the intervention ended).
      Participants were instructed to continue their usual depression care. The primary dependent
      variable was depressive symptoms based on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The secondary
      dependent variable was rumination scores on the Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS). This
      protocol was approved by the University of Minnesota's Institutional Review Board (IRB).
      Participants completed informed consent forms sent through the mail; consent to participate
      in physical activity was also obtained from the participant's healthcare provider.
      Recruitment for this trial occurred from February, 2013 to January, 2014 and follow-up
      assessments were completed by May, 2014.

    <description>Participants in the 12-week mindfulness-based yoga condition were guided by a gentle yoga DVD that included postures (asanas), pranayama (breathing exercises), and relaxation (meditation). Participants were asked to complete 60-75 minutes of the DVD twice per week and were encouraged to do more if they were interested.
Following the initial baseline assessment and randomization telephone interview, participants in the yoga group completed weekly 15-minute telephone sessions for the first month and bi-weekly telephone sessions for the second and third for a total of eight sessions over the 12 weeks. The mindfulness telephone sessions were modified from the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction.</description>

    <description>The 12-week walking control condition included twice-weekly home practice with a 65-minute walking DVD (Sansone, 2008) and eight telephone sessions with the telephone counselor.
Participants were asked to complete 60 minutes of the DVD (or other walking) twice weekly and encouraged to do more if they were interested.
Participants received telephone sessions on the same schedule as the yoga condition. The education sessions covered a variety of health and wellness related topics.</description>
