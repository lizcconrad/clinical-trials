  <brief_title>Efficacy of CLR Compared to Fosfomycin Trometamol in Acute Lower uUTIs</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate non-inferiority of a non-antibiotic therapy with CLR versus an antibiotic
      treatment with fosfomycin trometamol in women suffering from acute lower uUTIs as measured by
      the proportion of patients who received an additional antibiotic treatment for acute lower
      uUTIs during the trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed as a comparison of two different modes of action in order to look for
      alternatives to antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. Treatment with CLR is a
      nonantibiotic therapy and is compared to an antibiotic treatment. Thus, the trial aim is to
      reduce antibiotics use and moreover to reduce the pressure of developing bacterial resistance
      against antibiotics due to widespread use, which is an additional advantage of the CLR
      therapy.

      The trial results are expected to demonstrate that antibiotic prescriptions in women for
      treatment of lower uUTIs can be reduced by an alternative and safe non-antibiotic treatment.

    <time_frame>within 38 days after Visit 1 (=day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>For patients with consistent or worsening of acute lower uUTI symptoms during the trial the investigator may offer an additional antibiotic therapy at any post-baseline visit. In this case, the patient will be considered a &quot;treatment failure&quot; due to lack of efficacy of the IMP. The alternative antibiotic therapy offered to the patient and the reason for the alternative therapy (i.e., persisting or recurrent symptoms) is to be documented.
The primary variable for the assessment of efficacy is the proportion of patients who received additional antibiotic treatment for acute lower uUTI between Visit 1 and Visit 4 (defined as AB-rate).</description>
