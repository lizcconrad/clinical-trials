    <textblock>
      Cure of leukemia after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is sustained by the
      anti-leukemic effect of the grafted cells (graft-versus-leukemia (GVL)). However, it is not
      known whether the tumor-immunity is affected by photochemotherapy (psoralene
      photosensitization and ultraviolet light radiation) administered to attenuate graft-versus
      host disease (GVHD).

      The present study aim to investigate what happens to the GVL after photochemotherapy of aGVHD
      in a predominantly retrospective setting with 10-years follow-up after HSCT

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 10-year follow-up of patients with Acute-myeloid-leukemia (AML) or
      acute-lymphatic-leukemia (ALL). AML is diagnosed by the French-American-British criteria
      (FAB-criteria) and ALL is separated into chief forms by immunohistological methods. All
      patients underwent myeloablative Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) between 1985
      and 2005 at the center for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (CAST) at Karolinska
      University Hospital. All patient receive GVHD-prophylaxis.

      The risk for relapse after HSCT is graded into low-risk if the disease is in first complete
      remission before HSCT, all other disease states are classified as high-risk.

      Eligible patients received photochemotherapy (Ultraviolet radiation type A on skin
      photosensitized by oral 8-methoxypsoralen) for acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD within
      100-days after HSCT). Photochemotherapy may be given as primary or later aGVHD therapy.
      Patients with aGVHD after booster doses of stem-cells or donor-lymphocyte-infusions are not
      included.

      Additional treatment are registered where present. Methotrexate is not considered as an
      additional GVHD treatment as intravenous methotrexate a part of the governing GVHD
      prophylaxis and as the effects of methotrexate as a secondary aGVHD treatment is weak.

      At the start, the end, at maximum and up until two weeks after end of PUVA-therapy the GVHD
      is diagnosed in accordance with Glucksberg and indexed by CIBMTR.

      Relapse is diagnosed when leukemic cells is present extra medullary or with a bone marrow
      biopsy with ≥ 30% blasts. Early relapse is diagnosed when the medulla contain 5 - 30% blasts

      The primary outcome is GVL i.e. abscence of relapse in malignant disease or minimal residual
      disease (MRD) i.e. threatening relapse in malignant disease demanding donor lymphocyte
      infusion (DLI).

      Primary predictor: Time-to-treatment by photochemotherapy at day 0 - 7 vs. start at day 8 ≤
      of aGVHD.

      Continuous secondary predictor: Time-to-treatment by photochemotherapy as a continuous
      variable (days after start of aGVHD).

      Binary secondary predictors: Risk (Low/High), Sibling donor-recipient (Yes/No), Mismatched
      related (Yes/No), Unrelated donor (Yes/No), (Male recipients of female grafts (Yes/No),
      T-cell depletion or Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (Yes/No).

      Categorical secondary predictors: AGVHD organ disease stage and disease grade; Skin (+, ++,
      +++, ++++), Liver (+, ++, +++, ++++), Gastro-intestinal (+, ++, +++, ++++), Center for
      International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research CIBMTR index (A, B, C, D) respectively.

      Statistical analysis:

      Cox proportional Hazards ratio is used to conduct a univariate data analysis of all adequate
      variables in patient characteristics and disease towards the primary outcome. In the
      analysis, death, DLI or retransplantation due to graft-failure was treated as a competing
      event. The primary predictor (binary) and all binary or categorical covariates identified
      from the patient and disease characteristics are to be included in a multivariate forward
      regression analysis, controlled for with backward regression based on the log-likelihood
      method. P=0.05 is considered as significant and p=0.10 as a trend. StatSoft, Inc. (2013).
      STATISTICA (data analysis software system), version 12. www.statsoft.com. are used for
      statistical computation.

    <description>Oral 8-Methoxypsoralene (8-MOP), (0.4-0.8 mg/kg), are given 1.5-2 hours before phototherapy. Ultraviolet light type A (UVA, 320−400 nm) is administered in a Waldmann UV1000 supine unit through 26 100-W fluorescent PUVA lamps (Waldmann F85), if needed, UVA is given in a half body unit with 15 100-W PUVA-lamps (Waldmann F85), (Waldmann UV3003K), (Waldmann, Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany). Eye protection is applied during 24 h after oral 8-MOP and the genital area are shielded in males during therapy.The UVA is initiated at 0.2−1.5 J/cm2 and is amplified by 0.25-0.5 J/cm2 after two treatments if photo toxicity is absent. PUVA is given to the patients 3−5 times each week.</description>
