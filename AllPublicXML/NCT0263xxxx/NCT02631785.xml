      The proposed research aims to isolate brain-based information-processing mechanisms
      implicated in perturbed fear learning and extinction characteristic of pediatric anxiety.

      The study will focus on the therapeutic relevance of dysfunction in fear learning and
      extinction for treatment by examining the associations between brain functioning and response
      to exposure intervention in anxious children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are the most common form of pediatric psychopathology, affecting 5 - 20% of
      children and adolescents. Despite therapeutic advances, treatment-resistance remains high,
      and progress towards early detection of at-risk populations and more effective treatments has
      stalled. Although some anxiety disorders are transient, recent studies suggest that pediatric
      anxiety disorders commonly persist into adulthood. Because anxiety disorders are costly and
      debilitating conditions that are very often associated with other severe psychopathology such
      as substance abuse, depression and suicidality, there is an imperative need to identify risk
      and resilience factors that moderate pediatric anxiety and improve treatment.

      Fear conditioning and resistance to extinction are two domains that have been implicated in
      the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders. Indeed, one of the most effective
      treatment for pediatric and adult anxiety disorders, exposure therapy, relies profoundly on
      extinction learning. The proposed research plan will investigate the neural correlates of
      aberrant fear conditioning and extinction processes in children and adolescents with anxiety
      disorders.

      The proposed research aims to isolate brain-based information-processing mechanisms
      implicated in perturbed fear learning and extinction characteristic of pediatric anxiety. A
      fMRI study using a novel age-appropriate fear conditioning-extinction paradigm are proposed.
      The study will delineate perturbed psychological and psychophysiological response to fear
      conditioning and isolate neuro-cognitive mechanisms mediating extinction recall in anxious
      and non-anxious children. Three weeks after completing fear conditioning and extinction task
      in the psychophysiology lab, participants will return to complete an fMRI extinction-recall
      task quantifying responses to extinguished CS blends. Two major hypotheses will be examined:
      a) anxious children will exhibit perturbations during extinction as measured by
      psychophysiology indexes and self-reported fear compared to non-anxious children; b) less
      activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is expected in anxious, relative to
      healthy, children during extinction-recall. Furthermore, the study will focus on the
      therapeutic relevance of dysfunction in fear learning and extinction for treatment by
      examining the associations between vmPFC function and response to exposure intervention in
      anxious children. Lower levels of vmPFC activation prior to exposure therapy and larger
      pre-to-post-treatment changes in vmPFC activity are expected to be associated with better
      response to exposure therapy.

    <description>â€¢ The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) - the SCARED is a self-report measure that assesses different types of anxiety based on criteria in the DSM-IV. Specifically, the SCARED was developed as a screening tool for generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social phobia, and school phobia. The SCARED has been reported to have robust reliability and validly (Birmaher et al., 1997).</description>

    <measure>Anxiety symptoms- ADIS</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule (ADIS) - is a well validated semi-structured diagnostic interview, suitable for measuring all anxiety disorders as listed in the DSM-IV as well as mood disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, in children from 7-17 years of age (Silverman &amp; Albano, 1996). The interview has two versions, one for children (ADIS-C) and one for parents (ADIS-P), and both have good inter-rater and high test-retest reliability (Silverman, Saavedra, &amp; Pina, 2001). In standard ADIS procedures, a child receive a diagnosis when a specified amount of criteria are met the child or parent reports substantial interference (4 or higher on a scale from 0 to 8). The combined diagnosis represents a sum of the diagnoses of the child and the parent interview</description>

    <measure>Anxiety symptoms- CGI</measure>

    <description>Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI). The CGI scale requires clinicians to rate the overall severity of their patient's illness at the time of assessment relative to the clinician's experience with patients having the same diagnosis. This scale yields three different measures: severity of illness, global improvement, and the efficacy index. The ratings range from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) (Busner &amp; Targum, 2007).</description>

    <description>Psychologists will deliver the &quot;COPING CAT&quot; treatment for reducing anxiety symptoms. It is a manualized treatment that was extensively used before. The treatment will include 10- 14 sessions, mostly individual but also two parents meetings. All the treatments will occur in the Department of Psychology in Haifa University as a part of a clinical trial. The treatment will take place in a room that was designed for this purpose fully equipped with cameras, microphone and double sided mirror. All sessions will be audio and video recorded and will be closely monitored by the PI. To increase protocol adherence and verify the adequacy of the treatment delivered, all clinicians will complete routine forms with the content of each session.</description>
