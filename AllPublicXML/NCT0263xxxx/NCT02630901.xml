             more than one occasion within 3 months prior to Baseline (Day 1/Visit 2)

          6. Uncontrolled hypertension as indicated by a resting systolic BP ≥150 mmHg or diastolic
             BP ≥95 mmHg at Screening (Visit 1) or Baseline (Day 1/Visit 2) predose or a known

             (Day 1/Visit 2), this does not need to be repeated during screening and the previous
             result can be carried forward and used in this study.

             with subsequent standard prophylactic treatment is allowed if recent (within ˂ 30

                  count of ˂1500/µL (with the exception of a documented history of a chronic benign
                  neutropenia), or platelet count of &lt;120,000/µL

         12. Use of an investigational product or device or participation in a drug research study
             within a period of 30 days (or 5 half-lives of the drug, whichever is longer) prior to
             Screening (Visit 1); for investigational products or drug research studies relating to
             psoriasis or arthritis, the duration will be extended to 12 weeks (or 5 half-lives of
             the drug, whichever is longer) prior to Screening (Visit 1)

             20

         14. Receipt of any vaccine (with the exception of seasonal influenza) within 30 days prior
             to Screening (Visit 1)
