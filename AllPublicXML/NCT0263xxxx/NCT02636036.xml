             medications, including cyclosporine, azathioprine, interferons in the 4 weeks before

             treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily prednisolone equivalent) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Splenectomy

          -  Prior allogeneic or autologous bone marrow or organ transplantation

          -  Subjects with active, known or suspected auto-immune disease or a syndrome that
             requires systemic or immunosuppressive agents; subjects with vitiligo, type I diabetes
             mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune disease only requiring hormone

             AIDS; testing is not required in the absence of history

          -  Use of the following antiviral agents: ribavirin, adefovir, lamivudine or cidofovir

             study treatment

          -  Major surgery or treatment with any chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biologics for
             cancer or investigational therapy in the 28 days before the first dose of study
             treatment (subjects with prior cytotoxic or investigational products &lt;3 weeks prior to
             study treatment might be eligible after discussion between the Investigator and
             Medical Monitor, if toxicities from the prior treatment have been resolved to NCI
             CTCAE Grade 1). All toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy other than
             alopecia and fatigue must have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline before the first dose
             of study treatment. Subjects with toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy
             which are not expected to resolve and result in long lasting sequelae, such as
             neuropathy after platinum based therapy, are permitted to enrol

          -  Other prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years except for local or organ
             confined early stage cancer that has been definitively treated with curative intent,
             does not require ongoing treatment, has no evidence of residual disease and has a
             negligible risk of recurrence and is therefore unlikely to interfere with the primary
             and secondary endpoints of the study, including response rate and safety

          -  Symptomatic brain metastases or any leptomeningeal metastasis that is symptomatic
             and/or requires treatment. Subjects with brain metastases are eligible if these have
             been locally treated (surgery, radiotherapy). There must also be no requirement for
             immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg/day prednisone equivalent)
             for at least 2 weeks before the first dose of study treatment

          -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator
             or the Medical Monitor, may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             study treatment administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol
             therapy or interfere with the interpretation of study results

          -  Known allergy to enadenotucirev, nivolumab or their excipients

          -  Any other medical or psychological condition that would preclude participation in the
             study or compromise ability to give informed consent

          -  Dependence on continuous supplemental oxygen use
