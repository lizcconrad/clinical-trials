      A randomized, open-label , positive drug controlled (Neurotropin,Japan organs Pharmaceutical
      Co., Ltd. ), multi-center study to evaluate Analgecine's efficacy and safety for the
      treatment of neuropathic pain.

    <textblock>
      The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Analgecine for the treatment of
      neuropathic pain for 2 weeks. It was a randomized, open-label , positive drug controlled,
      multi-center study phase III clinical trial. Patients were recruited with age between 18 and
      80 and visual analysis scale (VAS) between 3 and 8. After randomization, subjects were
      divided into 2 groups: 1) Treatment with Analgecine as experiment group; 2) Treatment with
      Neurotropin as positive control group. There are 3 measurement time points on day 0, 7, 14
      after treatment to score patients pain with VAS. The changes of the VAS score at day 14 were
      compared between groups.

    <description>Pain was scored by VAS 10 points (visual analog scale). The degree of pain gradually increases from 0 to 10. The subtraction mark rate of VAS value before and after treatment and the grade decrease of associated symptoms will be regarded as the main curative effects indexes.</description>
