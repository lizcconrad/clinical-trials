  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bispectral monitoring anesthesia with remifentanil-desflurane has a better post-operative
      recovery than remifentanil-propofol.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized, double blind study, involving 40 adult female patients submitted to
      general anesthesia. The patients were distributed into 2 groups: remifentanil-propofol-based
      anesthesia and remifentanil-desflurane-based anesthesia groups. Bispectral index (BIS)
      monitoring guided the anesthesia by setting target BIS range value between 40 and 60.
      Anesthetics were adjusted to reached that. Primary outcome was: extubation time (time from
      anesthetic discontinuation to endotracheal tube cuff). Secondary measured outcomes:
      intra-operative cardiovascular drug use; time to follow command before extubation; protective
      airway reflex recovery time after extubation. Protective airway reflex test recovery was
      performed at predetermined time intervals (2, 6, 14, 22 and 30 minutes) from the time to
      follow a standard command until the first demonstrated ability to swallow 20 ml of water in
      an upright position.Post-anesthesia care unit recovery data were also recorded: Ramsay
      sedation scale; vital signs, post-operative pain; morphine consumption.
