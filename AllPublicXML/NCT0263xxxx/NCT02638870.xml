  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder with recurrent abdominal pain
      and disordered defecation and is one of the most common gastrointestinal problems. In
      practice, IBS was frequently diagnosed as an exclusion diagnosis for patients with recurrent
      abdominal pain without an organic cause. Visceral hypersensitivity is the major contributing
      factor of abdominal pain in IBS. Accordingly, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are widely
      used for IBS, especially if abdominal pain is a prominent symptom. Indeed, meta-analysis also
      exhibits the clinically significant efficacy of low dose TCAs in IBS. Nevertheless, over 40%
      of IBS patients receiving TCAs had no improvement in symptoms after treatment. Theoretically,
      if TCAs are used for IBS patients with hypersensitivity, its efficacy could be increased.

      Although rectal distension test might be used to identify hypersensitive patients with IBS,
      it has been used only for clinical research because it is painful for the patient. On the
      contrary, colonoscopy is frequently performed in IBS patients to rule out organic disease and
      for the purpose of colorectal cancer screening. In a study by Kim and colleagues, IBS
      patients reported higher pain score after colonoscopy than non-IBS patients. This has
      prompted the hypothesis that pain scoring during/after colonoscopy could also segregate IBS
      patients with visceral hypersensitivity showing better treatment response of TCA than those
      without.

      The aims of the present study were to evaluate the colonoscopy-related pain perception and
      the treatment response of amitriptyline in IBS patients and to investigate the predictive
      values of the colonoscopy-related pain scale in identifying IBS patients with a response to
      amitriptyline treatment.

    <description>This was a prospective, observational study conducted at Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. Enrolled IBS patients underwent colonoscopy and colonoscopy-related pain score was evaluated. After colonoscopy, all patients received 5 mg amitriptyline once daily at bedtime for the first week and 10 mg for the subsequent 3 weeks. After the intervention period of 4 weeks, the treatment response was determined.</description>
