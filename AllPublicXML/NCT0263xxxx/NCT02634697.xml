  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an eight week multimodal Relaxation Response
      Resiliency Program (3RP) intervention can effectively improve symptom severity, frequency and
      quality of life (Q.O.L) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. This will be measured by a
      reduction in AF symptom score, perceived stress, anxiety, hostility and depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a very common cardiovascular disease. Symptoms include dizziness,
      palpitations, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, fatigue and exercise intolerance. AF is
      also associated with a high risk of complications like thrombo-embolism and stroke, heart
      failure, dementia. The presence and severity of these symptoms and complications adversely
      affect a patient's health related quality of life. Improvement in quality of life (QOL) is an
      important measure for evaluating response to treatment in AF patients. Depression and anxiety
      are significant part of the psychosocial burden faced by approximately one-third of AF
      patients, and are important components that effect QOL in these patients. In this study the
      investigators will apply the 3RP (Relaxation Response Resiliency Program - developed at the
      Benson Henry Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital) intervention among AF patients to
      assess the reduction in their stress, anxiety and depression levels and the reduction in AF
      symptom burden and severity.

    <description>AF Patients will undergo the 3RP intervention which will comprise of the following:
i. One-one-one session: each subject will spend an hour with a clinician to set specific goals for the intervention. They will also answer questionnaires.
ii. ECG monitoring: Enrolled subjects may be monitored with an ECG at some point after the time of consent up to the day of the one-on-one session, and again after completing the 8 weeks.
iii. Weeks 1 - 8: subjects will meet with the clinician/staff member as a group once a week for 1.5 hours each where they will be taught a variety of techniques to elicit the relaxation response as well as other cognitive skills.
At the end of the 4th (mid-point) and 8th (last) weekly session, subjects will answer questionnaires.
iv. 6 month follow up: 3 months after the final 3RP session to answer questionnaires.
v. Subjects will be asked to keep track of their AF episodes during the course of the study.</description>
