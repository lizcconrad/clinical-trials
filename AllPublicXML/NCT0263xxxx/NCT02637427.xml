  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate prophylactic fresh frozen plasma transfusion in
      patients with moderately elevated international normalized ratios (INR) prior to undergoing
      an invasive procedure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fresh frozen plasma is used very frequently in the US. Many plasma transfusions are given
      prior to a procedure in order to correct perceived bleeding risk, yet there is little
      evidence to support that use of plasma reduces bleeding. There has never been an adequately
      powered trial to establish the efficacy of plasma and document the risks. This pilot study
      will evaluate the feasibility of conducting a research protocol that will lead to a large
      scale clinical trial designed to evaluate the treatment effectiveness of prophylactic plasma
      transfusion in patients with moderately elevated INRs prior to undergoing an invasive
      procedure outside of the operating room.

      Study subjects will be randomly allocated to either receive either plasma transfusion prior
      to the procedure, or to no treatment. Study outcomes will be compared between the two study
      arms. Recruitment rates, protocol adherence, and rates of study outcomes will be assessed to
      determine the feasibility of the large scale trial.
