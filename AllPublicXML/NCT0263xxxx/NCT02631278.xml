  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and feasibility of a radiofrequency (RF)
      system employing RFITT (CelonProSurge) probes for the ablative treatment of uterine fibroids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      10 consecutive premenopausal women with symptomatic uterine fibroids not responsive to
      medical therapies (including progestins, oral contraceptives, and anti-inflammatory drugs)
      will be recruited at our hospital to be submitted to abdominal myomectomy. All patients will
      be counseled on the potential risks and benefits of the procedure before giving their own
      written consent.

      Procedures will be performed at the hospital and patients will be under general
      anesthesia.All patients will be submitted to abdominal myomectomy. Target leiomyomas will be
      intramural, 5-15 cm in diameter. Intra-operative RF ablation will be carried out followed by
      surgical removal of the treated leiomyoma. After the removing of the fibroid, it will be send
      to the pathologist. Specimens of fibroid will be fixed immediately in 10% neutral formaline
      solution for approximately 3h, then embedded in paraffin, cut into 4mm section and stained
      with along the direction of the RFA electrode. Pathologic confirmation of ablation will be
      assessed as follows: the specimens of leiomyoma will be examined grossly for the histologic
      leiomyoma subtype and for pathologic findings representing treatment, including necrosis,
      hemorrhage, or fibrosis, using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Treated areas will be measured
      for their largest orthogonal dimensions in the planar cut surface with the third dimension
      estimated by summing the affected 0.5-cm-thick sagittal planes. RF ablation volumes will be
      calculated using the prolate ellipsoid formula. The relationship between thermal dose
      estimates and pathology will be assessed using Bland-Altman analyses and intra-class
      correlations. The surgical procedure will be concluded as usual with the same steps of
      standard approach.
