      The SDH complex is involved in mitochondrial Krebs cycle and defects in the succinate
      dehydrogenase (SDH) complex have identified, as previously mentioned, in KIT/PDGFR WT. This
      complex, SDH, has 4 subunits (A-D) and SDH-A or SDH-B are involved in oxidization succinate
      to fumarate. Therefore, loss of function owing to mutational inactivation leads to the
      cytoplasmic accumulation of succinate which downregulates prolyl hydroxylase. This enzyme has
      a negative regulator role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) since promotes its
      proteasomal degradation. Increased levels of HIF1α can enter the nucleus and activate the
      transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR)24. In fact, the VEGFR expression
      is higher in KIT/PDGFR WT than in KIT mutant GISTs25.

      Approximately 50% of KIT/PDGFR WT show high expression of insulin-like growth factor 1
      receptor (IGFR1). This expression may correlate also with the loss of SDH due to IGF
      autocrine loop26. IGFR signals through both MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways. As previously
      mentioned, Regorafenib is able to block MAPK signaling pathway at different levels.
      Interestingly, early interstitial Cajal cell (ICC) progenitors have a phenotype of
      KITlowCD44+CD34+IGFR+ while committed lineage of progenitors have KIThighCD44+CD34-IGFR-.
      Unlike mature or more committed lineage of ICCs, the KITlowCD44+CD34+IGFR+ display resistance
      to Imatinib in spite of kit signaling pathway activation. Thus Regorafenib could gain
      advantage over Imatinib for treating KIT/PDGFR WT27,28.

      On the other hand, other subsets within of KIT/PDGFR WT as B-RAF mutants or NF1-associated
      GIST could also be sensitive to Regorafenib. In this later subset, protein expression of
      phospho-MAPK was seen in 92% of cases in a series of 25 patients29.

      Theoretically Regorafenib could also act blocking STAT3, which is activated by RET
      proto-oncogen, through RET inhibition. STAT3 is implicated as downstream pathway signal in
      GIST30.

      Taken together, the previous data suggests Regorafenib could play a relevant role as upfront
      treatment of metastatic or unresectable locally advanced KIT/PDGFR WT GIST.

             procedures or assessments and must be willing to comply with treatment and follow-up.
             Informed Consent must be obtained prior to start of the screening process. Procedures
             conducted as part of the patient´s routine clinical management (e.g. blood count,
             imaging tests, etc.) and obtained prior to signature of informed consent may be used
             for screening or baseline purposes as long as these procedures are conducted as
             specified in the protocol.

          2. Male or female subjects ≥18 years of age

          3. Histologically confirmed GIST KIT/PDGFR wild-type, unresectable or metastatic GIST
