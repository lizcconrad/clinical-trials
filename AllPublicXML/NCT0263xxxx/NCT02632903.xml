    <description>To assess the effect of zoledronic acid on preventing incident vertebral fractures as measured by lateral spine radiographs at 15 months post-diagnosis compared to baseline (with baseline occurring 3 months post-diagnosis). An incident vertebral fracture on lateral spine radiographs will be defined as a new fracture (Genant Grade 1 or more) in a previously normal vertebral body, or worsening of an existing fracture (increase in Genant Grade by at least 1) on the follow-up x-ray that takes place 12 months after the first dose.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject or subject's legally acceptable representative has provided informed consent.

          2. Children aged 8 to 16 years at the time of enrolment with a confirmed diagnosis of
             acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

          3. Children with vertebral fractures or osteonecrotic lesions according to the following
             criteria:

               1. children with vertebral fractures on lateral spine x-ray and/or osteonecrotic
                  lesions on MRI of the hips and/or knees identified through routine clinical
                  screening at least 8 weeks following chemotherapy initiation OR

               2. children with vertebral fractures on lateral spine x-ray and/or osteonecrotic
                  lesions of the hips and/or knees on MRI that are identified at any time in the
                  first 12 months after chemotherapy initiation following presentation with back
                  pain (in the case of vertebral fractures, identified by lateral spine x-rays)
                  and/or hip pain (in the case of osteonecrotic lesions, identified by MRI) and/or
                  knee pain (in the case of osteonecrotic lesions, identified by MRI).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any child for whom the treating physician feels participation is not advised.
