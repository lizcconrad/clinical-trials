  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to followup patients that have previously been treated for pituitary tumours with
      either photodynamic therapy or placebo in a previous trial. The study aims to determine
      whether photodynamic therapy has any long term effect on tumour size, visual fields or
      endocrinological function.

      No patients will receive any medical or procedural treatments in this study, since these have
      been administered in a previous trial. The previous trial participants will be contacted and
      asked to attend a clinic or to have a telephone interview, where they will answer a
      questionnaire. They will be assessed clinically for visual fields, as well as undergoing an
      MRI scan of their head to assess tumour size (unless they have had a scan anyway in the
      previous 12 months), these tests would ordinarily form part of the routine outpatient workup
      for patients with pituitary tumours. There is no significant risk to the physical well-being
      of the patients with any of the methods to be used.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who were previously included in the initial pituitary PDT trial, in addition
             to those who were randomised as part of the RCT arm of the study. These patients have
             already participated in phase I/II trials. Of note, these patients all have pituitary
             tumours.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who were not included in the above mentioned trials. Patients included in the
             original trials who have subsequently died (of any cause).
