      Background: Si-Wu-Tang (SWT) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and widely
      used for treating various gynecological disorders. The purpose of the current study was to
      check the physiological improvement of SWT on liver and skin and also the antioxidation in
      healthy adults.

      Methods: Sixty healthy voluntary subjects were recruited and assigned into two groups, who
      drank 125 mL of placebo (n=30) or SWT (n=30) for 6 continuous days per month during the
      following 6 months and vice versa with one month of washout period in between. During the
      initial, 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 13th months anthropometric measurements were performed as well
      as fasting blood samples were drawn for various biochemical assays. Abdominal ultrasonic and
      skin examination were performed at the initial, 6th and 13th months.
