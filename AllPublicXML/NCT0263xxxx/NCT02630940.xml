      Analysis of exhaled breath condensate biomarkers and cough severity in patients with
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

      This study will aim to investigate the levels of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      8-isoprostane in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients' exhaled breath condensate (EBC). EBC
      samples will be collected using RTube, prior to analysis for levels of 8-isoprostane. An
      acceptability assessment will be performed for this non-invasive method of EBC collection
      through a non-validated questionnaire.

      A regression analysis will then be performed for 8-isoprostane levels against the severity of
      the patient's cough, assessed through the use of the visual analogue scale for cough (VAS),
      the King's brief interstitial lung disease questionnaire (KBILD), the Medical Research
      Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale and the Leicester cough questionnaire. Alongside this an
      exploratory comparison of cough scores and 8 isoprostane concentration between patients with
      and without honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis.

    <description>Male or female idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) sufferers over the age of 40, with a confirmed diagnosis of IPF against international guidelines. Patients are devoid of significant other medical, surgical or psychiatric illnesses that may affect respiratory symptoms or disease progression.</description>

        Male or Female Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis sufferers over the age of 40, who have been
        diagnosed in accordance with either a multi-disciplinary review of their clinical history,
        thoracic high resolution computed tomography and/or surgical lung according to
        international guidelines

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female above the age of 40

          -  IPF diagnosed by a multi-disciplinary team meeting following review of clinical
             history, thoracic high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and/or surgical lung
             according to international guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A recognised significant co-existing respiratory disease, defined as a respiratory
             condition that exhibits a clinically relevant effect on respiratory symptoms and
             disease progression as determined by the principal investigator following
             multi-disciplinary discussion. For example, patients with bronchiectasis will only be
             included if the bronchiectasis is deemed to be traction bronchiectasis as a result of
             idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

          -  Airflow obstruction defined as a forced expiratory volume at one second over forced
             vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) &lt;60% predicted or a residual volume greater than 120%
             predicted

          -  Significant medical ,surgical or psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the
             patient's attending physician would exhibit a clinically relevant effect on the
             patient's health related quality of life

          -  The patient is unable to provide written informed consent
