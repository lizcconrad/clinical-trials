  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with
      NPC-12G gel (0.2% sirolimus gel) to angiofibroma and other skin lesions in patients with
      tuberous sclerosis complex in the open-label trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease that causes
      benign tumors on the almost whole body (including skin, brain, kidney, lung and heart),
      behavior disorder as autism, mental retardation and neurologic symptom as epilepsy.
      Angiofibroma is a TSC-specific facial skin lesion, and hamartoma caused by increase of the
      component of skin connective tissues and blood vessels. Other skin lesions due to TSC are
      white macule (hypomelanotic macule), plaque, shagreen patch and ungual fibromas. Current
      therapeutic methods for angiofibroma are laser and surgical treatments, but there are
      problems as many relapses, deficiency of evidence, change of pigment, scar and risk of
      infection.

      This is a multicenter and open-label trial. The trial consists of two phase. In the first
      trial phase for 52 weeks, the efficacy as well as the safety is evaluated. For the second
      trial phase the trial will be continued until the date of approval of NDA for NPC-12G. The
      safety is evaluated during the second trial phase, but not the efficacy. Patients who meet
      all entry criteria for the trial apply 0.2% NPC-12G gel twice a day. Patients will visit at 4
      to 5-week intervals for the first 6 months of the first trial phase, and then 3 months
      intervals thereafter.
