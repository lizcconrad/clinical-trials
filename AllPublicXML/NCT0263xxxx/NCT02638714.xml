      A single arm, single center trial to assess the safety and efficacy of restoring function in
      damaged optic nerves using autologous purified populations of bone-marrow derived stem cells
      (BM-SCs) through a 24 month follow up period.

      Optic nerve atrophy (ONA) is a condition defined as a damage to the optic nerve that
      harmfully affects central and peripheral vision. ONA may occur as a result of optic neuritis,
      compression by tumors or aneurysms, toxic and nutritional neuropathies, trauma, or as a
      secondary complication to other systemic diseases such as diabetes. Symptoms of ONA vary
      diversely, but mainly include blurred vision and a reduction in optic sharpness and color
      visualization. ONA is irreversible process, and current medical strategies focus on finding
      the underlying cause, and trying to prevent further vision loss and protect the other healthy
      eye. This is a Single arm, Single Center trial to assess the safety and efficacy of purified
      adult autologous bone marrow derived CD34+, CD133+, and CD271+ stem cells through a 24 month
      follow-up period. The combination of these three cell types was based on their diverse
      potentialities to differentiate into specific functional cell types to regenerate damaged
      optic nerves and supporting issues and vasculature, and the availability of clinical-grade
      purification system (CliniMACS) and Microbeads to purify the target cell populations in
      clinically-approved methods. Anticipated outcomes of this study are defined in an overall
      improvement of vision, restoration of functions to damaged optic nerves, and improvement in
      quality of life of patients.
