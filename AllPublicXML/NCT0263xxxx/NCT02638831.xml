      This is a Comparative evaluation of therapeutic efficacy and safety of use of drug Ketorolac
      tromethamine gel and drug Ketoprofen gel , as an agent of local symptomatic therapy in
      patients with diseases of musculoskeletal system with associated pain syndrome in outpatient
      conditions.

      The study includes patients with moderate pain syndrome in gonarthrosis and lower back pain
      (LBP).

      The sample size of 240 was calculated for the main efficacy variable - mean pain intensity
      according to the visual analogue scale (VAS) in 10 days of therapy.

      Patients who subjected to inclusion into the study and had signed informed consent will be
      distributed into the study groups depending on established diagnosis: Gonarthrosis group and
      LBP group.
