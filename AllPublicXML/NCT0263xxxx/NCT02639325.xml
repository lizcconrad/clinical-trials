      Background:

      Some people with brain tumors have seizures related to the tumor. This is called
      tumor-related epilepsy. Usually brain tumors are treated by removing as much of the brain
      tumor as possible without causing problems. Researchers think this may improve the outcome
      for people with brain tumors. It may completely relieve or greatly reduce the number of
      seizures they have.

      Objectives:

      To evaluate people with brain tumors that are associated with seizures and to offer surgical
      treatment. Also, to study how surgery affects seizures.

      Eligibility:

      People age 8 and older who have a brain tumor with associated seizures. They must be willing
      to have brain surgery to treat their epilepsy.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records.

      Participants will have a medical history and physical exam.

      Participants will be admitted to the hospital at NIH. They will have

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Neurological exam

      Tests of memory, attention, and thinking

      Questions about their symptoms and quality of life

      Blood drawn

      They may also have:

      MRI or CT scan. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of a machine that takes
      pictures. For part of the MRI, they will get a dye through an intravenous (IV) catheter.

      Video electroencephalography monitoring. Electrodes will be placed on the scalp. The
      participant s brain waves will be recorded while doing normal activities. Participants will
      be videotaped.

      Participants will keep a seizure diary before and after surgery.

      Participants will have surgery to remove their brain tumor and the brain area where their
      seizures start.

      They will stay in the hospital up to a week after surgery.

      Participants have for follow-up visits at NIH.

      Objective

      This protocol is being performed to 1) study the natural history and disease pathogenesis in
      patients with tumor related epilepsy, 2) provide standard surgical treatment of brain tumors
      with associated seizures, 3) follow the clinical course of patients after surgical resection
      of brain tumors with associated seizures, such as outcomes in seizure activity as they relate
      to type of tumor and extent of resection, 4) investigate neuropsychological outcomes as they
      relate to surgical and seizure outcomes, 5) evaluate patient reported outcomes such as
      symptom burden changes as a result of surgical resection in patients with tumor-related
      epilepsy, 6) examine changes in structural and, when available, functional imaging in the
      context of tumor related epilepsy before and after surgical resection, 8) investigate
      molecular markers of tumor-related seizures in tumor and peritumoral specimens and, when
      available, to compare them to electrophysiological markers of tumor-related seizure activity.

      Study Population

      Patients 8 years and older with brain tumors and associated seizures may participate in this
      study.

      Study Design

      Patients will be screened by study neurosurgeon or neuro-oncologists to verify their
      confirmed or likely diagnosis of brain tumor and associated seizures. Patients confirmed to
      have a brain tumor with associated seizures will be offered standard diagnostic and surgical
      procedures. Non-invasive diagnostic procedures include structural MRI and neuropsychological
      and outcome assessments. Some patients may receive functional MRI when clinically indicated,
      which will be performed under a separate protocol, 14-N-0061, Non-invasive pre-surgical
      evaluation of patients with focal epilepsy. Invasive procedures include surgical resection of
      the brain tumor and associated epileptogenic region. The ultimate goal of surgical resection
      is to safely remove tumor tissue and to remove or modify the associated epileptic focus.
      Prior to tumor resection, diagnostic invasive monitoring with intracranial electrodes for
      further localization of seizure focus and identification of eloquent cortex may be clinically
      required. In these cases, invasive monitoring will be performed under a separte protocol,
      11-N-0051 Epilepsy Surgery. Patients will be followed for three months after the surgical
      procedure and will receive standard neurological examinations and MRI evaluation of the brain
      as dictated by their care indicated for the brain tumor. Patients may also be seen at one
      year following surgery if medically stable and healthy. Participants in this protocol will
      not forego other standard treatments for their brain tumor, including chemotherapy and
      radiation treatment. Participation in this protocol will not preclude eligibility or
      participation in other NINDS or NCI clinical trials.

      Outcome Measures

      The primary outcome measure is the change in seizure frequency, as measured by the Engel
      scale before and 3 months after treatment. Secondary outcome measures include 1) mean Engel
      Class three months after surgery stratified by the type of brain tumor and location and Engel
      scale, seizure frequency, and mean Engel Class one year after surgery stratified by the type
      of brain tumor and location; 2) extent of tumor and peri-tumoral resection as seen on MRI
      imaging and correlation with seizure outcome; 3) changes in neuropsychological assessment
      following surgical resection stratified by location and type of tumor and extent of
      resection; 4) longitudinal changes in symptom burden and interference scores using
      established instruments in brain tumor patients; 5) changes in structural imaging following
      surgical resection; 6) change in the use of anti-epileptic medication; and 7) percentage of
      patients with permanent neurological side-effects from surgical treatment.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        To be eligible for entry into the study, a candidate must meet all the following criteria:

          -  Be 8 years of age or older.

          -  Have solitary primary or recurrent brain tumor with associated seizures. Brain tumor
             may be diagnosed radiologically. Associated seizures are defined as those with
             activity starting within three months of radiologic diagnosis of the primary or
             recurrent tumor. In cases when the timing of seizure activity is unclear with respect
             to the timing of diagnosis, seizures will be considered associated with the tumor if
             seizure semiology is consistent with that location. Ongoing seizures are not required.
             Patients can be included if they have had a single previous seizure. Patients who have
             not experienced seizures after institution of anti-convulsant therapy are not
             excluded.

          -  Agree to undergo brain surgery.

          -  Willing and able to appoint a durable power of attorney.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Candidates will be excluded if they:

          -  Have a bleeding disorder that cannot be corrected before invasive testing or surgery,
             or other medical conditions that would make surgery unsafe, such as lung or cardiac
             disease that would render them unable to tolerate the risk of general anesthesia, or
             severe immunodeficiency or systemic cancer not related to a brain lesion.

          -  Cannot have an MRI scan.

          -  Have multiple brain tumors, evidence of carcinomatous meningitis, gliomatosis cerebri,
             or primary CNS lymphoma. Patients with multiple metastatic lesions that for which
             surgery is not indicated will be exluded. Patients with peripheral neurological or
             systemic metabolic disorders that cause seizures will be excluded.

          -  Have an underlying seizure disorder that is unrelated to the brain tumor, or
             underlying neurological disorder that is unrelated to the brain tumor and that may
             contribute to seizure activity.

          -  At the time of enrollment, lack consent capacity due to cognitive impairment that
             would make them incapable of understanding the explanation of the procedures in this
             study. Cognitive capacity to consent will be determined at the time of enrollment.
             Patients with mental disorders or those patients who are cognitively impaired yet
             still retain consent capacity will not be excluded. Children may be enrolled if there
             is a parent or guardian able to consent on their behalf.
