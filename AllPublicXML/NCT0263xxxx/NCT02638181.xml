  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was to assess the distinct expression of matrix metalloproteinase 13,tissue
      inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3, and calcium-sensing receptor, in human trabecular meshwork
      between normal and glaucomatous eyes.The expressions of matrix metalloproteinase 13, tissue
      inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 and calcium-sensing receptor in the trabecular meshwork
      tissues were examined by streptavidin-peroxidase immunohistochemical staining method and
      western blot, and histological changes of trabecular meshwork were studied by Hematoxylin and
      Eosin staining.
