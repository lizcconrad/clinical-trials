  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2012, the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) issued guidance to clarify
      the principal benefit-risk factors FDA considers during the reviews for premarket approval
      applications and de novo classification requests. In addition to a detailed description of
      benefits and risks, CDRH listed &quot;patient tolerance for risk and perspective on benefit&quot; as a
      factor that CDRH may consider in regulatory reviews. It underlined the need for developing
      methods to measure patient preference and incorporate it into regulatory decision-making. The
      purpose of this study is to advance methods for patient and community engagement in
      patient-centered outcome research (PCOR) and has three objectives.

      First, demonstrate good practices for patient and community involvement in PCOR projects by
      applying principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR).

      Second, address methodological gaps pertaining to the use of stated-preference methods in
      studying priorities in PCOR. These include identifying the best methods for identifying
      patient priorities and strategies for analyzing variation in priorities. The investigators
      also seek to assess the relevance of stated-preference methods to patients and stakeholders
      using both qualitative and quantitative methods.

      Third, demonstrate good practices for applying stated-preference methods by studying the
      priorities of patients with type II diabetes. While type II diabetes provides an important
      case study, this research will advance approaches and methods that will be broadly
      generalizable to other diseases, and to diverse patient and stakeholder groups.

      Clinical Significance:

      This project will illustrate and advance methods for assessing the values of patients and
      stakeholders. It will demonstrate how CBPR methods apply to PCOR studies and the value of
      stated-preference methods in measuring the priorities of patients and stakeholders and
      directing health care.

      This study will apply the principles of CBPR to involve patients and stakeholders associated
      with a local community board and a national diabetes advisory board in key decisions in the
      project. During year 1, the investigators will utilize mixed methods to develop, pretest, and
      pilot the survey instruments to assess the priorities of patients with type II diabetes. In
      year 2, the investigators plan further engagement to finalize the survey instruments, and
      will implement a nationally representative, racially/ethnically diverse sample of patients
      with type II diabetes. Based on further consultation, the investigators will conduct
      statistical analysis, including stratified analyses and segmentation of patients with similar
      priorities. In year 3, mixed methods will be applied to assess beliefs of patients and other
      consumers about the relevance of this work and its generalizability to other PCOR topics.
      Finally, lay language reports will be developed to highlight patient and stakeholder
      engagement and the application of stated-preference methods to the study of the priorities of
      patients with type II diabetes.
