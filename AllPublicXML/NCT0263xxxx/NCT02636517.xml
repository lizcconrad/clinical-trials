      Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT) in pediatric patients with recurrent C. Difficile with or
      without Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

      The aims of this study are to determine the safety and efficacy of FMT treatment in pediatric
      patients with recurrent or moderate to severe C. Difficile without (through an observational
      study) and with (through a clinical trial) Inflammatory Bowel Disease and to determine the
      effect of FMT on the gut microbiota through the use of 454 pyrosequencing before and after
      transplantation in these patients.
