  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The available data indicate that Ceritinib has substantial anti-tumor activity in patients
      with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS1 rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
      This trial will investigate the potential of Ceritinib in patients with advanced
      gastrointestinal malignancies with ALK and ROA1 rearrangement, and for whom there is no
      available therapeutic option.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II study of ceritinib in adult patients
      with ALK- and ROS1 activated colorectal, cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic, hepatic, gastric, or
      esophageal adenocarcinoma. An estimated 500 patients will be screened for ALK and ROS1 by
      fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) per institutional
      standard of care (SOC), and/or ALK/ROS1 by next-generation sequencing (NGS). At least 30
      identified patients will be treated with ceritinib per protocol. Treatment with ceritinib
      will continue until patient experiences unacceptable toxicity that precludes further
      treatment, discontinues treatment at the discretion of the investigator or patient, starts a
      new anticancer therapy and/or dies.

      Male and female patients aged 18 or over that have colorectal adenocarcinoma,
      cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic, hepatocellular, gastric or esophageal adenocarcinoma that
      contain an activated ALK gene due to rearrangement, mutation, amplification, translocation or
      other mechanisms. Patients must have been pretreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy.

             study drug] to minimize the risk of pregnancy. If the partner is pregnant or
             breastfeeding, the subject must use a condom. A condom is required to be used also by
             vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

         15. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 12 weeks after the
             last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy. WOCBP must have a negative
             serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the start of the investigational
             product. Highly effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening) with the appropriate
                  post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. For female
                  subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner
                  for that subject.

               -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c or b+c):

               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other
                  forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;
                  1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

             Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault
             caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.

             In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill
             for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior
             to screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of
             the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered
             not of child bearing potential.
