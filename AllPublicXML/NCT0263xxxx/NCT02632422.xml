  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how the nervous system controls leg muscles is
      important for walking in subjects following a spinal cord injury (SCI) and how they may be
      affected by brief periods of low oxygen inhalation over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to determine whether repeatedly breathing low oxygen levels for
      brief periods (termed acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH)) improves recovery of walking after
      spinal cord injury. This idea stems from animal studies on respiration, in which
      investigators showed that mild AIH improves breathing in rats with spinal injuries. These
      studies showed that AIH induces plasticity, strengthening neural connections by increasing
      the production of key proteins and improving the sensitivity of spinal cord circuitry. The
      ultimate goal of this research is to assess the potential of mild AIH as a therapeutic
      approach not only in persons with chronic spinal cord injury but also in persons with
      subacute injury. By applying AIH during early stages of recovery, the investigators hope to
      expand the potential benefits of AIH to broader range of persons with spinal injury, thereby
      improving functional independence and quality of life for servicemen and civilians.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in walking recovery, assessed by timed up-and-go (TUG) test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-session 10 (up to two weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG test is used to assess the dynamic balance of an individual. It measures the amount of time (recorded in seconds) it takes for the individual to rise from a standard arm chair, walk a distance of 3 meters and return to the initial position resting against the back of the chair. Participants will perform two trials of the TUG test. Average speed across the two TUG trials will be used for analysis. Change is the difference between the end of session 10 and baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in walking recovery, assessed by 6 minute walk test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-session 10 (up to two weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants perform the 6MWT at their fastest, most comfortable walking speed sustainable for 6 minutes. Distances will be recorded at 2 and 6 minutes. The test will be based upon the participant's ability to finish each assessment without human assistance. Change is the difference between the end of session 10 and baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in walking recovery, assessed by 10 meter walk test (10MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-session 10 (up to two weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants walk ten meters without assistance at their fastest, but safest speed with a minimum of 1-minute of rest between two trials. Average speed across the two 10MWT trials will be used for analysis. Change is the difference between the end of session 10 and baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-session 10 (up to two weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report their pain level using the Wong-Baker FACES scale. The scale is from 0 to 5; 0 being no pain and 5 being extreme pain. Change is the difference between the end of session 10 and baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in spasticity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-session 10 (up to two weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Spasticity will be assessed using the Spinal Cord Assessment Tool for Spastic Reflexes (SCATS). The study team will quantify the total lower extremity spasticity score using the cumulative sum of 3 SCATS subscales: clonus (0=no spasticity; 3=severe), flexor (0=no spasticity; 3=severe), and extensor (0=no spasticity; 3=severe). Change is the difference between the end of session 10 and baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Systemic hypertension incidence rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-session 10 (up to two weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will have their systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured. A systemic hypertensive event is quantified as a systolic pressure exceeding 140mmHg and/or diastolic pressure exceeding 90mmHg. A hypertension incident rate is the number of hypertensive events divided by the total person-time. Person-time is in units of person-measures (the sum of the total number of BP measurements) taken for each person. Person-measures accounts for the total number of chances for detecting a hypertensive event and accounts for measurements not made due to drop-out or a disqualifying adverse event</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Autonomic dysreflexia incidence rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-session 10 (up to two weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of autonomic dysreflexia will be assessed. An autonomic dysreflexia event will constitute a participant having a systolic blood pressure (SBP) increase from baseline of 20mmHg or SBP greater than 150mmHg with complaints of headache, diaphoresis, and/or blurred vision and will be diagnosed by the study team clinicians.</description>
