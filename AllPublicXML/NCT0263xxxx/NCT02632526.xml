             conduction or morphology of the resting ECG and any clinically significant
             abnormalities in the 12-lead ECG, as considered by the investigator that may interfere
             with the interpretation of QTc interval changes, including abnormal ST-T-wave
             morphology, particularly in the protocol defined primary lead or left ventricular
             hypertrophy

          9. Prolonged QTcF (QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula) &gt; 450

             they have any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the screening period) minor medical
             complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered
             unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements
