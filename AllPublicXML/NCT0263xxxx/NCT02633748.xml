    <textblock>
      Mindfulness has been shown to help stress, fatigue, sleep complaints, and other symptoms but
      has not been extensively studied in cancer survivors. This study will enroll cancer survivors
      at the Greenville Health System Cancer Institute Center for Integrative Oncology and
      Survivorship to undergo the Mindfulness Based Cancer Survivorship (MBCS) four-week program,
      with assessments before, immediately after, and three months after the intervention. Results
      of the study will be used to develop new care models that improve cancer survivor stress and
      symptoms using mindfulness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer survivors suffer with stress, fatigue, sleep complaints, pain, and many other adverse
      health effects. Chronic stress is detrimental to quality of life and, potentially, length of
      survival among cancer survivors. Mindfulness-Based Cancer Survivorship (MBCS) is a four-week
      standardized mindfulness program, adapted for cancer survivors from Mindfulness-Based Stress
      Reduction (MBSR). MBCS teaches formal mindfulness practice (meditation) and informal
      mindfulness during daily activities. Mindfulness has been shown to help stress, fatigue,
      sleep complaints, and other symptoms but has not been extensively studied in cancer
      survivors. This study will enroll cancer survivors at the Greenville Health System Cancer
      Institute Center for Integrative Oncology and Survivorship to undergo the MBCS four-week
      mindfulness program, with assessments before, immediately after, and three months after the
      intervention. The assessments will include 1) questionnaires to measure lifestyle, stress,
      meditation habits, and sleep impairment, 2) blood tests to measure various biomarkers (e.g.,
      inflammatory cytokines), 3) using a BodyMedia's Sensewear® armband for a week to measure
      sleep and physical activity, and 4) salivary cortisol levels. The forty participants will be
      randomized to either the intervention arm, the four-week MBCS mindfulness program, or the
      control arm, a brief control/breathing course. After the three month post assessment,
      participants in the control arm will have the opportunity to take the MBCS course. Results of
      the study will be used to develop new care models that improve cancer survivor stress and
      symptoms using mindfulness.

    <measure>Change in physical activity as measured by a Body Sensewear actigraph wore by the participants for a week pre-intervention, post intervention, and at a three month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>All 40 participants will wear a BodyMedia's Sensewear® armband for a week at three different points in the study. The actigraphs collect data on physical activity by measuring, calories burned, minutes of vigorous activity, and hours of sleep. Data such as height and weight are collected before administering armband to measure data accurately. The data will be analyzed using SenseWear Pro 8.1 software and SAS v9.4.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in stress level measured by cortisol levels collected from self-administering saliva collection kits</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will collect six serial saliva samples pre-invention, post-intervention, and at the 3-month follow-up. The first four samples will be taken within the first hour of waking (first upon awakening, 15, 30, and 45 minutes after waking). Participants will collect the last two samples one hour before dinner and one right before they go to bed. All saliva samples will then be shipped to the University of Georgia for cortisol characterization.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in inflammation measured by analyzing blood samples collected pre and post intervention using inflammation markers</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Approximately 5ml of blood will be collected from each participant at the pre and post assessment. The samples will be collected in a yellow top serum separator tube (SST). Immediately following the blood draw, samples will be inverted gently 5 times and then stored upright to allow for clotting for a minimum of 30 minutes. For processing, after balancing the centerfigure, the samples will be spun at 3,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4⁰C. After spinning, 1 ml of serum will be transferred into a cryovials using a clean pipet. All cryovials will be stored at -80 in a freezer. All samples will then be transported to School of Medicine, University of South Carolina where they will be analyzed using inflammation markers.</description>

    <description>The twenty participants in the intervention arm will undergo a pre-assessment, post assessment, and a three month follow-up assessment. The pre and post assessments will ask participants to 1) fill out questionnaires to measure lifestyle, stress, meditations habits, and sleep impairment, 2) take a blood sample, 3) use a BodyMedia's Sensewear® armband for a week, and 4) provide salivary cortisol levels. The three month follow-up will repeat everything done if the first two assessments, excluding the blood sample. The intervention arm will also attend the weekly two and a half hour Mindfulness-Based Cancer Survivorship (MBSC) four-week program between the pre and post assessments.</description>
