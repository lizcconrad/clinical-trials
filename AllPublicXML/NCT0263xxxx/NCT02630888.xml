      The main goal of this study is evaluate the efficacy of memantine association on the
      treatment with a previous combination of two drugs, including quetiapine with lithium or
      quetiapine with aripiprazole in young patients with bipolar disorder type 1 non-responders or
      partial responders to that combination of drugs and evaluate the impact of this association
      at the cognitive functioning of the patients.

    <textblock>
      Current evidence suggests that deregulation of brain glutamatergic neurotransmission is
      involved in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder and that drugs that intervene in this
      transmission may be therapeutic weapons in addressing the symptoms and cognitive deficits of
      this pathology. Among these drugs, particularly memantine is a strong candidate in view of
      their efficacy in antagonizing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and their good safety
      and tolerability profile. The principal aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      memantine association with treatment with a combination of two drugs, including quetiapine
      with lithium and quetiapine with aripiprazole in young patients with bipolar disorder type 1
      non-responders or partial responders and evaluate the impact of this association cognitive
      functioning of patients. An experimental study, randomized, double-blind, bipolar patients
      with type 1, of both sexes, aged 18 to 40, ambulatory or hospitalized, at any stage of the
      disease, seeking treatment in the Mood Disorders Program (GRUDA) of Institute os Psychiatry
      (IPq) of Sao Paulo University (FMUSP). Patients will come from ARIQUELI Project (Missio, G.
      et al, 2013 submitted Trial registration - ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:. NCT01710163).

      The study will be conducted in two stages: I - initial administration of memantine or placebo
      for 8 weeks; II - Maintenance administration for more 4 months.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is to evaluate the memantine efficacy of the combination at 30 mg / day in stabilizing mood to therapy of young patients with Bipolar Disorder (type I) non-responders or partial responders to quetiapine combination with lithium or with aripiprazole from the ARIQUELI study. The definitions of the outcomes are:
Partial response: between 26% and 49% reduction from the baseline to the type of index episode (mania, mixed episode, depression), without further worsening of the opposite pole;
Response: â‰¥ 50% reduction from the baseline to the type of index episode (mania, mixed episode, depression) without further worsening of the opposite pole;
Remission: the used remission score is less than or equal to 9 of Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), equal or lower to 7 in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21) reduction equal to or greater than 75% the inclusion scores in the study.</description>
