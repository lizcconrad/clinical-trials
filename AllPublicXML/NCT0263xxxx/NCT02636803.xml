    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to provide data on the efficacy of oxfendazole against Trichuris
      trichiura at different doses in comparison to the standard single 400 mg dose of albendazole.
      In addition, the study will provide data on oxfendazole efficacy against other common
      nematodes encountered in man (Enterobius vermicularis, Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma
      duodenalis, Necator americanus).

      This is an open, comparative study in adult patients with proven intestinal infection with
      Trichuris trichiura. Patients meeting the study entry criteria will receive either 6mg/kg, or
      30 mg/kg of oxfendazole as a single oral dose or 6 mg/kg orally for three days or albendazole
      400mg as a single oral dose. Stool samples will be obtained and examined 7, 14 and 21 days
      after treatment.

      Two hundred clinically evaluable patients of either gender, 16 - 65 years of age, presenting
      with proven Trichuris trichiura infection, recruited from one centre, will be included in the
      study. there will be 15 patients in each treatment group. Duration of accrual will be
      determined in discussion with the clinical site in Iquitos, Peru.

             enrolment: The presence of other helminths: Enterobius vermicularis, Ascaris
             lumbricoides, Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenalis will not be a cause for
