  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Mozambique, early infant HIV diagnosis (EID, i.e. HIV screening of infants under 18 months
      of age) is conducted using molecular diagnostics at central laboratories in Maputo, Nampula,
      Beira and Quelimane. However, test volumes are growing and many parts of the country do not
      have close access to laboratories. Test samples are transported over large distances and this
      can introduce testing delays, especially for patients in rural and remote areas of the
      country. There are now new POC EID technologies becoming available that will enable diagnosis
      of HIV in infants within minutes or a couple of hours on site in the clinic, operated by non
      technical staff and without laboratory infrastructure. This protocol describes a plan to
      conduct an evaluation of a Point-Of-Care (POC) Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) testing
      technologies that are being considered for use in Mozambique, and to pilot those technologies
      in order to provide more effective diagnostics and clinical care to patients. During this
      implementation pilot, sites are randomized to use either conventional or POC EID testing only
      before the inclusion of the patients in the study. No consent will be asked to the parents or
      guardians. A written permission will be asked to the Direção Provincial de Saúde of both
      provinces to implement the POC device as routine in those intervention sites. All the
      information that will be analyzed will be collected from the routine care and it will be
      analyzed as a group.
