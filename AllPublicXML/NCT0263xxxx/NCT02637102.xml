  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CAVIAR is a multicentre prospective observational study. Centres for cardiac and vascular
      surgery assess and manage patients in different ways before surgery. Some centres have
      introduced the use of intravenous iron therapy for patients with anaemia in the preoperative
      setting. Consequently regional variation exists in the assessment and management of patients
      before cardiac and vascular surgery. We aim to observe and measure these differing pathways
      and observe if there is variation in iron deficiency and anaemia and the impact of these
      variables on patient cardiorespiratory function as well as post-operative outcomes.

      [Sub-Study] For patients who are receiving intravenous iron therapy as part of their routine
      clinical care, we wish to observe this effect in more detail. We will assess the impact of
      the treatment on well-being, blood count and fitness. Information will be collected through
      Quality of Life questionnaires, total haemoglobin mass test (via blood collection) and
      fitness testing.

        Patients requiring major cardiac or vascular surgery will be identified from routine
        clinical care. Most patients are routinely referred for pre-operative assessment, although
        local protocols vary between centres. Assesments at the pre-operative assessment clinic
        (PAC) may include (but not limited to) routine blood tests (full blood count, urea and
        electrolytes, etc.), history and examination, cardiorespiratory fitness assessment by 6
        minute walk test (6MWT) or cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). In some centres,
        patients with anaemia will receive intravenous iron at PAC or in a separate anaemia clinic.
