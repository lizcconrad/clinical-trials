      This study is a Multicenter, Randomized, Parallel and Prospective study to compare Ulcer
      healing rate of Ilaprazole 20mg or Rabeprazole 20mg in the patients undergone Endoscopic
      Submucosal Dissection for Gastric Adenoma or Early Gastric Cancer and to investigate
      Prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding.

      Participants are defined as persons who underwent a Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for
      Gastric Adenoma or Early Gastric Cancer. For 8 weeks, Participants treated as Ilaprazole 20mg
      or Rabeprazole 20mg once a day. After treatment, The ulcer healing rate was evaluated by
      Endoscopy at 4, 8 weeks.
