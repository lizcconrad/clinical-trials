    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a low carbohydrate diet on
      increasing dietary adherence and improving cardiometabolic risk factors among adults with
      spinal cord injury (SCI). Seventy overweight/obese adults with SCI will be randomized to one
      of two groups: 1) a reduced carbohydrate diet or 2): a &quot;standard&quot; diet (STD). Participants
      will take part in a 6-month behavioral lifestyle intervention implemented through a novel
      eHealth platform specially designed for individuals with SCI.

    <measure>Adherence to prescribed macronutrient composition as measured by multiple pass 24 hour dietary recall</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will record 3 days of food intake at each measurement time point. Calories and macronutrient values from the 3 days will be averaged. We will calculate an adherence score using methodology described by Alhassan et al. Adherence will be measured as the difference between recorded intake and prescribed intake of the macronutrient of interest for each group (i.e., carbohydrates for the low carbohydrate group, fat for the standard group). For example, if a participant in the low carbohydrate group is prescribed a limit of 50g of CHO/day, and recorded intake is 70g, the adherence score will be 20. A score of 0 indicates meeting recommended values, and higher scores indicate poorer adherence than lower scores.</description>
