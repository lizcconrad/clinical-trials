  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-label, single arm, single-stage study. A total of 23 evaluable
      patients will be enrolled. If total number of patients free of disease relapse at 1 year is
      less than or equal to 15, the drug would not be considered for further study in this setting.
      After six patients are treated with at least one dose of study drug, they will be observed
      for a minimum of 60 days. During the 60-day observation period, further accrual will be
      halted to evaluate &quot;unacceptable toxicities warranting early closure of the trial&quot; defined
      as:

        -  Any definitive durvalumab-related death. A durvalumab-related death will be continuously
           monitored throughout the trial and the trial will be suspended for re-evaluation
           whenever such an event is confirmed.

        -  Any unexpected and previously unreported grade 4 toxicities definitely related to
           durvalumab.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center trial.

      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

      Subjects will receive durvalumab 1500 mg IV every 4 weeks (1 cycle) for a maximum 13 doses
      (12 months), or until unacceptable toxicities or disease recurrence.

      The following baseline labs must be completed within 28 days prior to registration for
      protocol therapy:

      Hematopoietic:

        -  White blood cell count (WBC) &gt; 3 K/mm^3

        -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt; 9 g/dL. Transfusion is allowed, if needed, since patients are post
           esophagectomy.

        -  Platelets &gt; 100 K/mm^3

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 K/mm^3

      Renal:

        -  Calculated creatinine clearance of &gt;/= 40 cc/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula or by
           24-hour urine collection.

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN

        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN

             information obtained from the subject prior to performing any protocol-related
             procedures, including screening evaluations. NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included
             in the informed consent or obtained separately.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14
             days prior to registration for protocol therapy. NOTE: Female subjects are considered
             of child bearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a
             hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are ≥60

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study
             including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow
             up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the criteria below may not participate in the study:

             therapy.

          -  Evidence of active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within preceding 3
             months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome
             that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Exceptions to this rule
             include vitiligo, resolved childhood asthma/atopy, requirement of intermittent
             bronchodilators or local steroid injections, hypothyroidism stable on hormone
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment (within the past 2 years),
             Graves's disease and Sjogren's syndrome.

          -  Prior malignancy is not allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous
             cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, Gleason score ≤ 7 prostate cancers, or
             other cancer for which the subject has been disease-free for at least 3 years.

          -  Active or prior documented inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. Crohn's disease,
             ulcerative colitis).

          -  Presence of interstitial lung disease or history of pneumonitis requiring treatment
             with corticosteroids.

          -  Patients with diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency.

          -  Patients receiving chronic systemic corticosteroid therapy or other immunosuppressive
             therapy within 28 days prior to registration for protocol therapy. Exceptions include
             intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids at physiological
             doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone, or an equivalent
             corticosteroid.

          -  History of allogeneic organ or stem cell transplant.

          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to registration for protocol
             therapy.

          -  Known history of previous clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis.

             significant is defined as an active infection requiring IV antibiotics.

          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued. In
             addition, breast milk cannot be stored for future use while the mother is being
             treated on study.

          -  Treatment with any investigational agent within 28 days prior to registration for
             protocol therapy.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to durvalumab or any excipient.

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
             evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study results.

          -  Previous enrollment in the present study.
