  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized non-blinded comparison of dorsal vs. ventral approach
      for buccal mucosa graft urethroplasty in the bulbar urethra. Buccal mucosa graft is a common
      method of repairing the strictured urethra. Current evidence suggests the two approaches for
      placement of the graft are equally successful at correcting the stricture and the two
      approaches have similar risks of complications. The investigators propose to randomly assign
      appropriately selected patients to either a dorsally- or ventrally-placed graft. No
      additional procedures beyond normal care protocol will be required of the patients. Success
      will be assessed via objective and subjective methods; complications will be tallied in a
      standardized fashion. Outcomes will be measured at two years.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Screening for eligibility; Enrollment/baseline: Patients are referred to UCSF urology
           clinic for urethroplasty. Participants commonly come to the clinic having already had
           imaging of their stricture, completed the appropriate PROMs, uroflowmetry and post-void
           residual urine volume measurement. The patient usually leaves the initial clinic visit
           with a scheduled surgery. Thus, both screening and enrollment will be done at the
           initial clinic visit. If the patient agrees to enroll and signs the consent form, they
           will then be randomized.

        2. Randomization: The PI will contact the research assistant by email or telephone and
           communicate the random identification number of the subject and receive the random
           assignment to ventral or dorsal graft. This will usually occur after the initial clinic
           visit but certainly before the surgery date. Patients will not be blinded as to their
           assignment. Surgeons, out of necessity, will not be blinded as well.

        3. Treatment/intervention period: Patient will undergo urethroplasty using standard
           approach and graft will be placed ventrally or dorsally, as assigned. Most patients go
           home the same day after surgery. A catheter will be left in the urethra for 2-4 weeks as
           is standard approach for buccal graft urethroplasties.

        4. Follow-up (there will be no extra clinic visits, questionnaires, or tests beyond that
           which the investigators normally do for all patients undergoing urethroplasty):

             1. 2-4 weeks: urethral catheter removal and urethrogram to document well-healed suture
                line

             2. 3 and 12 months post-operative clinic visit:

           i. cystoscopy ii. PROMs and additional post-operative questionnaires iii. Uroflowmetry
           and post-void residual urine volume c. Annual visits after year 1: The investigators
           will typically follow patients annually with no end date after urethroplasty. For
           publication purposesits has been set to 1 year as the study end date but the
           investigators will continue to see the patients outside the study protocol after year 1
           (so that participants receive the same care as people not in the study) and will perform
           the following: i. Cystoscopy, if indicated based on abnormalities in ii or iii ii. PROMs
           and additional post-operative questionnaires iii. Uroflowmetry and post-void residual
           urine volume

        5. Data Safety and Monitoring Both ventral and dorsal buccal mucosa graft are standard of
           care and all surgeons in this study have performed at least 50-100 of each of these
           surgeries. Investigators do not anticipate adverse events that are not well known in the
           literature. Urethroplasty is generally a low risk surgery. Still, any AEs will be
           monitored by the surgeon and communicated to Dr. Jeremy Myers at The University of Utah,
           which serves as the coordinating center for this study.

    <intervention_name>Ventral buccal mucosa onlay urethroplasty</intervention_name>
    <description>Ventral buccal graft onlay involves a midline perineal incision and retraction of the bulbospongiosum muscle downward to expose the ventral urethral surface. The corpus spongiosum is incised longitudinally to expose the urethral lumen and the incision is extended proximal and distal to the established stricture. The buccal mucosa graft is harvested and trimmed to the length and width of the urethrotomy and the graft is sutured at the proximal and distal apices and a running suture at the lateral margins to establish a tight anastomosis. Ventral placement allows for limited urethral mobilization and easy access, but there is concern about higher likelihood of diverticulum formation and development of other associated complications - such as post void dribbling and ejaculatory dysfunction.</description>

    <intervention_name>Dorsal buccal mucosa onlay urethroplasty</intervention_name>
    <description>Dorsal buccal onlay also involves a midline perineal incision. The bulbo-cavernosum and corpora cavernosum are dissected from the bulbar urethra allowing for complete mobilization of the urethra. The urethra is rotated 180 degrees to allow for dorsal access and an incision is made on the dorsal urethra proximal and distal to the stricture location. The buccal graft is harvested and trimmed to the appropriate size of the urethrotomy and spread on the overlying tunica albuginea of the corporal bodies. The urethra is rotated back to allow for suturing of the left mucosal margin to the left margin of the buccal graft and corporal bodies, essentially covering the entire urethral plate. Dorsal placement has potential for a more stable vascular bed for graft sustainability and less spongiosal bleeding, but requires a greater urethral mobilization and longer operative times.</description>
