  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of RO7034067 (RG7916) in
      healthy people. The study will assess what the body does to RO7034067 (RG7916) and what
      RO7034067 (RG7916) does to the body. RO7034067 (RG7916) will be given by mouth in gradually
      increasing doses. The data from this study will help to define the dose to further explore
      RO7034067 (RG7916) in patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy.
