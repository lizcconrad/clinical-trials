  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a prospective analysis of the Alternative Payment
      Methodology (APM) demonstration project sites. The investigators' goal is to conduct a cross
      project analysis of findings. The investigators propose to use mixed methods to study
      processes and outcomes associated with the APM natural experiment in payment reform. The
      investigators hypothesize that Community Health Centers (CHCs) participating in the APM
      demonstration project will redesign their workflows to better focus on patient and population
      health needs, resulting in reallocation of financial resources, lower overall costs, changes
      in utilization patterns, and improved quality.

    <textblock>
      Led by the Oregon Primary Care Association, three community health center (CHC) organizations
      in Oregon developed an Alternative Payment Methodology (APM). Under this APM pilot
      participating CHCs will receive a prospective payment system (PPS) payment as a capitated
      equivalent in a per-member-per-month rate for all of their Medicaid patients. Oregon CHC
      organizations (several clinic sites) implemented Phase I of this demonstration project on
      March 1, 2013; Phase II A was implemented on July 1, 2014; Phase II B on October 1, 2014; and
      Phase III began July 1, 2015.

      We are a prospective analysis of the APM project sites. We propose to use mixed methods to
      study processes and outcomes associated with the APM natural experiment in payment reform. We
      hypothesize that CHCs participating in the APM demonstration project will redesign their
      workflows to better focus on patient and population health needs, resulting in reallocation
      of financial resources, lower overall costs, changes in utilization patterns, and improved
      quality.

      The study will include baseline qualitative data collection as clinics are transitioning to
      the APM methodology. We will conduct 2 site visits to each intervention clinic to observe
      practice changes that occurred post APM-implementation (first visit approximately 12-18
      months post-APM implementation; second visit approximately 30-36 months post-APM
      implementation). We will also assemble and analyze of pre-post quantitative and qualitative
      datasets, and interpretation and dissemination of study findings.
