  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasma half-life has routinely been used to establish the dosing schedule of antipsychotics;
      for example, it is recommended that agents with a short plasma half-life be administered
      multiple times per day. However, to date, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have
      shown no differences in clinical outcomes between once- and twice-daily dosing of various
      antipsychotics, suggesting that once-daily dosing of antipsychotics is a viable option
      regardless of plasma half-life. This would apply to clozapine as well; however, there have
      been no studies comparing once-daily vs. twice-daily dosing regimens of clozapine in terms of
      efficacy and tolerability. To address this gap in the literature, the investigators shall
      conduct a pilot, double-blind, RCT to examine efficacy and tolerability following a switch to
      once-daily dosing regimen of clozapine in patients with schizophrenia receiving clozapine
      twice a day.

      Plasma half-life has routinely been used to establish the dosing schedule of antipsychotics;
      for example, it is recommended that agents with a short plasma half-life be administered
      multiple times per day. To date, however, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have
      shown that once-daily dosing of antipsychotics including perphenazine, risperidone,
      olanzapine, quetiapine, and asenapine is comparable to twice-daily dosing in terms of
      efficacy and tolerability, suggesting that once-daily dosing of antipsychotics is a viable
      option regardless of plasma half-life.

      This issue applies to clozapine as well, in that it has a relatively short plasma half-life
      of 12-16 hours; of note, the product monographs recommends that clozapine be administered
      more than once daily if the dose exceeds 200 mg/day in Canada. Despite this, in clinical
      practice clozapine is frequently administered once daily because of convenience and side
      effects such as a daytime sedation or somnolence, In support of this, a cross-sectional
      survey done at the investigators' own centre has revealed that clozapine was prescribed once
      daily in 75.1% of 676 patients, even though &gt;200 mg/day was administered in 88.6%. However,
      there have been no studies comparing once-daily vs. twice-daily dosing regimens of clozapine
      in terms of efficacy and tolerability. To address this gap in the literature, the
      investigators shall conduct a pilot, double-blind, RCT to examine efficacy and tolerability
      following a switch to once-daily dosing regimen of clozapine in patients with schizophrenia
      receiving clozapine twice a day.

    <description>Participants will receive clozapine once daily at evening or bedtime throughout the study period. If a participant takes â‰¥200 mg of clozapine at a time other than evening/bedtime, half of this dose will be switched to an evening/bedtime regimen on day 0 (baseline), then another half dose will be switched on day 7 (week 1). Participants will receive placebo in place of the clozapine dose that was switched to evening/bedtime.</description>
