    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together
      with liposomal irinotecan in treating patients with solid tumors. Liposomal irinotecan and
      veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of liposomal irinotecan
      (MM-398) + veliparib combination.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the
      combination of MM-398 + veliparib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To characterize the preliminary efficacy of
      the combination using key efficacy indicators, such as objective response rate, clinical
      benefit rate defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD)
      at 24 weeks, and progression free survival (PFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES I. Imaging, tumor, and blood biomarkers to assess the sensitivity or
      resistance to each drug and/or correlation with clinical response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.

      Patients receive liposomal irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and
      veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 5-12 and 19-25 or 3-12 and 17-25. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within
      2-6 days prior to beginning liposomal irinotecan treatment, patients may optionally receive
      ferumoxytol (FMX) IV and undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline and 24 hours
      after FMX infusion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.

             evidence of iron overload, a known hypersensitivity to ferumoxytol or any other IV
             iron product, a documented history of multiple drug allergies, or those for whom MRI
             is otherwise contraindicated, including claustrophobia or anxiety related to
             undergoing MRI; this exclusion criterion applies only to patients enrolling at NCI and
             other selected sites; of note, the principal investigator (PI) will allow other
             centers to offer FMX MRI scans if the site in question is willing and the site PI can

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

             study requirements

             the mother is treated with any of these agents
