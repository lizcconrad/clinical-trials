        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female and male patients ≥ 18 years of age, diagnosed with CTEPH regardless of the
             current treatment

          -  Availability of a signed informed consent

          -  WHO Pulmonary Hypertension clinical classification Group IV (CTEPH):

               1. Right heart catheterization (RHC) results that are in line with both of the
                  following haemodynamic levels:

                    -  Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) ≥ 25 mmHg at rest

                    -  Pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP) ≤ 15 mmHg

               2. Confirmation of CTEPH diagnosis by one of the following as recommended by
                  standard guidelines:

                    -  At least 1 (segmental) perfusion defect(s) in ventilation/perfusion (V/Q)
                       scan or

                    -  Pulmonary artery obstruction seen by MDCT (multidetector computed
                       tomography) angiography or

                    -  Pulmonary artery obstruction seen by conventional pulmonary cineangiography
                       (In case of suspicion/diagnosis of 'sub-acute' Pulmonary Embolism: Patients
                       who are treated with anti-coagulation for at least 3 months before diagnosis
                       of CTEPH)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with an underlying medical disorder with an anticipated life expectancy less
             than 6 months

          -  Any medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, could jeopardize the
             safety of the patient or his/her compliance in the study, or otherwise make the
             patient inappropriate for study participation
