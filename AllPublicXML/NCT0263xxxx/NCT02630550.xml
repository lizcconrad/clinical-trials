  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Cheetah NICOM is a non-invasive cardiac output monitor that has been validated in various
      clinical contexts but not during the occlusion of major arteries, as takes place in vascular
      surgery. The present study will evaluate the precision and validity of the measures taken by
      the device during open vascular surgery procedures. The measurements will be compared to the
      those calculated by transesophageal echocardiography at various key points during the
      surgeries. The validity of the cardiac output, stroke volume and stroke volume variation
      measurements will be evaluated, as well as the device's ability to track rapid changes in
      cardiac output.
