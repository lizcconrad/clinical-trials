  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 10% of children in the United States are diagnosed with ADHD, and nearly half of these
      children have moderate to severe impairments in sleep, further exacerbating their already
      impaired academic, emotional and social functioning. In children with ADHD, 34% of prescribed
      sleep medications are antipsychotics that can cause marked weight gain and metabolic changes;
      alternate medications have either been found to be ineffective, difficult to tolerate or are
      largely unstudied in youth. Delayed sleep onset is strongly correlated with active symptoms
      of ADHD and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), suggesting that better control of disruptive
      behaviors could improve sleep patterns and this application will assess if the extension of
      the therapeutic effects of CNS stimulants into the early evening improves sleep onset.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this application is to assess the impact of safer treatment option
      Methylphenidate (MPH) on sleep and behavior problems in children with Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Behavioral Insomnia of Childhood (BIC). ADHD affects over
      11% of school-aged youth. Similarly, pediatric sleep disorders occur in over a third of
      children and impact multiple domains of the child's functioning as well as that of their
      parents. Children with ADHD are at an increased risk for sleep problems with a staggering
      comorbidity of up to 70%, while sleep deprivation worsens the already impaired social,
      emotional and academic functioning of children with ADHD. Therefore, improving sleep may
      translate into enhanced functioning in multiple realms. Delayed sleep onset latency (SOL) and
      bedtime resistance, the key component of the limit setting type of BIC, are particularly
      likely to occur in children with ADHD. Medications are commonly used for both conditions with
      over 6% of all school-aged children in the United States prescribed medication for ADHD and
      7% for sleep. In children with ADHD, 34% of prescribed sleep medications are antipsychotics
      that can cause marked weight gain and metabolic changes. Alternate medications for sleep have
      either been found to be ineffective, difficult to tolerate or are largely unstudied in youth.
      MPH has an extensive database supporting their safety and efficacy. Objective sleep studies
      of MPH have not found consistent results, with a few studies reporting delayed SOL and while
      others report improved quality of sleep. Therefore, this proposal will evaluate the impact of
      extending MPH treatment into the early evening on sleep onset using a 3-week with-in subjects
      randomized trial of .3mg/kg of immediate release (IR) MPH dosed 3 hours before bedtime vs.
      placebo in 38 children with ADHD and chronically delayed SOL who have a history of prolonged
      stimulant usage. The investigators will recruit 38 children ages 6-12 of any gender and
      racial/ethnic status with ADHD who have been treated with stable morning dose of extended
      release (ER) MPH for an extended time period (30 days or more) from the primary care and
      psychiatry clinics at Hershey Medical Center in Hershey, PA. Recruitment will be split into
      three waves (13, 13, 12 participants). Parents will be reminded to administer the blinded
      medication dose by text message each evening (or phone call by study staff) 3 hours prior to
      the desired bedtime. Sleep onset will be measured by actigraphy and sleep log, with parents
      also reporting on level of ODD and ADHD symptoms in the evening.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ages 6-12 (inclusive), and able to swallow capsule

          2. Children who have been treated with a stable morning dose of Extended Release
             Methylphenidate or twice daily dose of Immediate Release Methylphenidate for an
             extended period of time (30 days or longer).

          3. DSM V diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): Diagnosis will be
             assessed on the NIMH Computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (C-DISC),
             and parent and teacher rating scales.

          4. Children with any ADHD subtype meeting the above criteria will be eligible, although,
             it is expected that the majority will be of the combined subtype of ADHD given the
             associate between this subtype and ODD symptoms. A diagnosis of any of the two
             Behavioral Insomnia of Childhood (BIC) subtypes associated with delayed SOL (limit
             setting or combined type) will be required.

          5. Sex: male or female

          6. Fluent in written and spoken English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &lt; 6 years of age or &gt;12 years of age.

          2. Children who have not had Methylphenidate (Extended Release) treatment for an extended
             period of time (30 days or longer).

          3. A diagnosis or suspicion of sleep-disordered breathing will be exclusionary as it is
             not expected to be impacted by Immediate Release Methylphenidate treatment.

          4. Current psychotropics other than Methylphenidate (Extended Release or Immediate
             Release Methylphenidate). Children prescribed alpha agonists for adjunctive control of
             ADHD in combination with a MPH product will be allowed to enroll as long as they meet
             all other entry criteria (i.e. sleep must remained impaired with use of alpha
             agonist).

          5. Regular use of other medications that impact sleep within the last 14 days (i.e.:
             sedating antihistamines, melatonin).

          6. Active medical/psychiatric conditions that impact sleep (i.e.: severe asthma, Autism
             Spectrum Disorder diagnosis, marked developmental delay, or mood/anxiety disorder).
