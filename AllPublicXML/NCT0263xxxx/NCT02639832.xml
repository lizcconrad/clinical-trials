      The purpose of this research study is:

        -  To test blood for the presence of tumor derived circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or
           circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using an investigational medical device called the
           LiquidBiopsy®. Using the LiquidBiopsy® platform, recovered cells or DNA can also be
           investigated to obtain genetic information that may be useful to treating physicians in
           understanding disease.

        -  To test blood for natural killer cells (NK cells), which are part of the body's natural
           immune defense against tumors. A device called the NK VueTM Kit will be used for this
           test.

      The LiquidBiopsy® is a new investigational device. An investigational device is one that is
      not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The NK VueTM Kit is an
      investigational device in the United States but is approved in Canada and South Korea as a
      class II device.

      If a tumor is present, very tiny numbers of tumor cells or the contents of these tumor cells
      can get dislodged from the tumor and swept into the bloodstream. The LiquidBiopsy® device is
      able to purify the tiny numbers of tumor cells or ctDNA in the blood. Even if a tumor is too
      small to be found by other means such as an x-ray, it is possible that ctDNA or CTCs may be
      found in the blood. Genetic information can then be recovered from these cells or DNA to look
      for genetic changes that are related to the abnormal growth in a tumor. This will potentially
      allow researchers to study tumor cells or tumor DNA from a blood sample instead of a biopsy
      sample. This may influence cancer diagnosis, treatment and drug selection in the future.

      NK cells occur naturally in the body and kill tumor cells. This study will measure the
      activity of the NK cells in blood. A strong correlation between low NK cell activity and
      increased circulating tumor cells in blood has been reported.
