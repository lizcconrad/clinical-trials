  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, dentistry aims for conservative treatments with the goal of maintaining as much
      tooth structure as possible. Dental caries remains the most prevalent chronic disease
      worldwide; these lesions can progress rapidly and reach deeper areas of the tooth. The
      carious lesion is considered deep when it goes through the main tissues of the tooth, and it
      can affect the pulp tissue, where the nerve and nutrients of the tooth are located. There are
      many treatment options for deep carious lesions and they vary by the clinical scenario. Vital
      pulp therapy has become a fairly predictable alternative treatment to pulpectomy (root canal
      therapy). The goal of vital pulp capping therapies is to keep the pulp of the teeth vital to
      prevent further interventions such as root canal treatments and complex restorative work.
      There are two main clinical scenarios when treating these lesions, depending on the remaining
      dentin thickness between the carious lesion and the pulp: vital direct and indirect pulp
      capping. Direct and indirect vital pulp therapies are routinely performed using different
      clinical protocols. The clinical protocols are selected based on the remaining dentin
      (between the tooth preparation and pulp) and the restorative materials. There are few studies
      that evaluate pulp capping method in adult teeth (permanent dentition); many studies have
      investigated baby teeth (deciduous teeth). Routine therapies include the using of adhesive
      restorations with and without an intermediate layer of restorative material. Calcium
      hydroxide based cements have been used for pulp capping as an intermediate layer of
      restorative material. More recently a new intermediate layer of restorative material composed
      of resin-modified calcium silicate has been indicated for use on direct and indirect pulp
      capping. The aims of this study are to compare, over a period of 12 months, the
      post-operative sensitivity and pulp vitality of three indirect pulp capping protocols and two
      direct pulp capping protocol in vital teeth. This study will provide the necessary evidence
      to allow clinicians to select the best restorative protocol when treating deep carious
      lesions where indirect and direct pulp capping protocol are needed.
