  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent disorders characterized by intermittent
      obstructions of the upper airway during sleep. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) has
      been shown to be the most efficacious treatment for OSA. It consists of a small device that
      provides positive airway pressure delivered by a mask attached to the patients nose/mouth.

      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the multinight (MNT) algorithm on patients
      with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) over 45 nights while using a CPAP machine at home. The
      researchers are evaluating the performance of the existing algorithm as well as capturing the
      data to make enhancements.

      Two main stages of this algorithm will be assessed:

      i. Fast Track (FT) stage. In the FT stage the aim is to assess if the algorithm reliably and
      timely reaches approximate therapeutic pressure levels.

      ii. Slow Titration (ST). In the Slow Titration stage the aim is to assess if data samples
      have been appropriately collected in a pressure range so that the therapeutic pressure can be
      inferred according to the algorithm proposed.

    <description>The multinight (MNT) algorithm will be evaluated on patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) over multiple nights while using CPAP in the home for a total of 45 days. In particular the main goal is to assess the behavior of the two main stages of the algorithm:
Fast Track (FT) stage. Assesses if the algorithm reliably and timely reaches approximate therapeutic pressure levels.
Slow Titration (ST) stage.Assesses if data samples are appropriately collected in a pressure range so that the therapeutic pressure can be inferred according to the algorithm proposed.
Five days with standard auto titration.
MNT algorithm : 7 days (maximum) with Fast Track mode, 27 days (maximum) in Slow Titration mode. After PMNT is found, the device remains at PMNT for 5 sessions. Total approximately 45 days.</description>
