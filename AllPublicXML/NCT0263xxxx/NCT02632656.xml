      The primary objective is to measure the association between extracellular RNA (ex-RNA) levels
      in plasma in patients receiving aggressive outpatient therapy for CHF with (1) cardiac
      remodeling and (2) cardiovascular events. The investigators will follow patients during
      standard medical therapy for CHF to assess changes in ex-RNA levels in the plasma, and how
      these are associated with cardiac remodeling (by cardiac imaging) and outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 5 million people in the United States have congestive heart failure (CHF). Although
      medical therapy such as beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
      angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) and aldosterone antagonists has improved prognosis, the
      overall rate of hospital admissions has continued to rise in the last decade and the
      mortality for patients with symptomatic heart failure remains worse than the majority of
      cancers in this country. Accordingly, significant opportunities exist for the improvement in
      outcomes of patients with CHF, both from a morbidity and mortality standpoint. Such
      opportunities may lie in the outpatient medical management of patients with CHF.

      In this study, the primary objective is to measure the association between extracellular RNA
      (ex-RNA) levels in plasma in patients receiving aggressive outpatient therapy for CHF with
      (1) cardiac remodeling and (2) cardiovascular events. The investigators will follow patients
      during standard medical therapy for CHF to assess changes in ex-RNA levels in the plasma, and
      how these are associated with cardiac remodeling (by cardiac imaging) and outcomes.
