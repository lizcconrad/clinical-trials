  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this exploratory study is to use Electrogastrography (EGG) to measure and
      compare the gastric myoelectrical activity between persons with food addiction (FA) and a
      control group. Additionally, this study will explore if differences exist between perceived
      hunger and satiety and hormone levels related to hunger and satiety in both groups. The
      comparison of the EGG readings and hormone levels is the next step in furthering our
      understanding of food addiction and how the physiology - not simply the symptomatology - of
      FA does or does not relate to weight management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted over 2 days and will consist of psychological assessments as well
      as EGG measurement (similar to EGG) and blood draws to examine hunger and satiety hormones.

    <measure>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1-5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be measured using The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised , a 20-item measure of depression that measures nine different symptom groups of depression according to the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition. These symptom groups include Sadness, Loss of Interest, Appetite, Sleep, Thinking/Concentration, Guilt, Tired, Movement, and Suicidal Ideation. Responses regard frequency of symptoms and are given on 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (Not at all or less than one day) to 4 (Nearly every day for two weeks). Sample items include &quot;My appetite was poor&quot; and &quot;Nothing made me happy.&quot; Item responses are summed to calculate a total score of depression that can be used to classify depression severity. This assessment will take approximately 5-10 minutes.</description>

    <measure>GAD-7</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will be measured using the GAD-7 measure used to assess for generalized anxiety disorder and will take less than 5 minutes to complete. The GAD-7 measures anxiety using seven items to assess frequency of anxiety symptoms on which responses are given on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly every day). Sample items include &quot;Feeling anxious, nervous, or on edge&quot; and &quot;Becoming easily annoyed or irritable.&quot; All items are summed; and higher scores represent higher levels of anxiety and can be used to classify anxiety severity.</description>

    <measure>Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The YFAS is a 35-item measure developed to operationalize food addiction by assessing signs of substance-dependence symptoms (e.g., tolerance, withdrawal, loss of control) in eating behavior. The YFAS has shown internal consistency, as well as convergent and incremental validity. The YFAS provides 2 scoring options: a symptom count version and a diagnostic version. To receive a &quot;diagnosis&quot; of FA, it is necessary to report experiencing 3 or more symptoms in the past year and clinically significant impairment or distress. The version of the YFAS used in the current study will measure all items on a Likert scale. In line with YFAS scoring instructions, 5 of the Likert scale items were dichotomized, such that participants who indicated that they had never experienced the symptom were assigned a value of zero, and those reporting ever experiencing the symptom in the past year were assigned a value of 1.</description>

    <description>The Power of Food Scale (PFS) is a 15-item questionnaire on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (don't agree) to 5 (strongly agree), and it is designed to measure appetite drive towards highly palatable foods through examining appetite-related thoughts, feelings, and motivations</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire - Appearance Scales (MBSRQ-AS) is a 34 item measure on a five point Likert scale that is made up of five subscales: Appearance Evaluation, Appearance Orientation, Overweight Preoccupation, Self-Classified Weight, and the Body Areas Satisfaction Scale.</description>

    <measure>Trait and State Food Cravings Questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Trait and State Food Cravings Questionnaire is comprised of two questionnaires that measure state (FCQ-S) and trait (FCQ-T) of food cravings. The FCQ-S is comprised of 15 items, and the FCQ-T is comprised of 21 items.</description>
