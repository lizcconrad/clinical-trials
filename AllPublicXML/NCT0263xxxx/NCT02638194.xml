  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to examine the health effects of mainstream and
      secondhand hookah (i.e. water pipe) smoke on pulmonary and cardiovascular functions as well
      as serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers. Investigators would like to demonstrate that
      inhalation of both mainstream and secondhand smoke generated by hookah produces adverse
      pulmonary and cardiovascular effects and alterations in serum levels of inflammatory
      biomarkers.

      A total of 20 participants are going to be enrolled in this study; 10 participants smoke
      hookah and 10 participants are exposed to second hand hookah smoke for 2 hours in NYC hookah
      bars. Subjects in the control group will also be paired as they were for the hookah bar visit
      but will visit a control location, where they will be asked to consume a similar amount of
      food and drink at a wine bar. Pulmonary function, cardiovascular changes, and blood and urine
      markers of inflammatory mediators before, immediately after and 24 hours after the
      participants' visits to hookah bars and wine bars will be examined. Air quality monitoring
      will also be performed at the hookah bar and at the control location. Physiological changes
      will be assessed by measuring pulmonary function, blood pressure, heart rate, and blood
      oxygenation status. To determine the extent of tobacco exposure and associated inflammatory
      changes from secondhand hookah smoke, investigators will measure blood inflammatory
      biomarkers, oxidative stress, gene expression, tobacco-related carcinogenic metabolites, and
      exhaled carbon dioxide levels.
