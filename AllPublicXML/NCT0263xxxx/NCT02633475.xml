  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to assess the correlation between the interleukin-10 (IL-10)-1082A/G
      polymorphism and idiopathic recurrent miscarriage (IRM) of Chinese Han. A total of 100 women
      with IRM and 100 control women with a successful pregnancy will be included in this study.
      Then genotyping will be performed.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a common occurrence in early pregnancy, IRM has been associated with multiple causes,
      among which the disorders of immune homeostasis between the fetus and the maternal immune
      system, maintained by cytokines from the complex regulatory network, are considered one of
      the potential etiological factors underlying IRM.

      The IL-10 polymorphism -1082A/G (rs1800896), which is located in the promoter region of the
      IL-10 gene, was reported to be implicated in the abnormal expression of IL-10 in IRM by some
      studies.

      However, no such reports about the association between IL-10 polymorphism -1082A/G and IRM
      risk in Chinese Han.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. women with more than three consecutive unexplained pregnancy losses before the 20th
             week;

          2. Chinese Han Population;

          3. Patients who signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who had other high-risk factors which might relate with recurrent
             miscarriage, including: (1) Parental karyotype abnormalities: significant
             rearrangements (e.g. balanced translocations and mosaics) were considered abnormal. If
             either the patient (or her partner) had an abnormal karyotype, it was considered a
             parental karyotypic abnormality; (2) Genital tract abnormalities: Any congenital
             anatomical deformation of the genital tract was considered abnormal; intrauterine
             adhesions, endometriosis and hydrosalpinx were also considered abnormal; (3)
             alloimmune disorder; (4) Endocrine abnormalities: prolactin (PRL) level &gt;25 ng/ml,
             testosterone level &gt;2.6 nmol/L, thyroid-stimulating hormone level &lt;0.30 mU/L or &gt;4.5

             gonadotropin hormone antibody; (6) Hypercoagulation state: D-dimer levels &gt;260 ng/ml,
             fibrin degradation products (FDP) levels &gt;5 mg/L or anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I
             (anti-beta 2-GP1) levels &gt;15 U/ml; (7) Negative RH blood groups; (8) Abnormal semen
