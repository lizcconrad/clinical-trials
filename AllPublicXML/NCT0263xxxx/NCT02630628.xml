    <textblock>
      There is accumulating evidence that tacrolimus (TAC) could serve as an effective medication
      for the treatment of lupus nephritis (LN). TAC is a calcineurin inhibitor, which is a key
      component in first-line combination immunosuppressive regimens after kidney transplantation,
      based on its proven efficacy in the prevention and treatment of allograft rejection and
      acceptable tolerability profile. Although it primarily targets T lymphocyte activation, its
      immunosuppressive actions encompass multiple immune response pathways due to the complex
      interactions between different cellular and soluble immune mediators. Moreover, the effect of
      calcineurin inhibitors on podocyte morphology and function, independent of their
      immunosuppressive effect, has translated into therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of
      proteinuric glomerular diseases such as membranous nephropathy and focal segmental
      glomerulosclerosis. Recent data from short-term studies showed that combination
      immunosuppressive regimens that included TAC and corticosteroids with or without
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) appeared at least as effective as other standard-of-care
      treatments for Class III/IV±V LN, and the inclusion of TAC might lead to more effective
      suppression of proteinuria. There is also preliminary data on its favorable tolerability when
      used as long-term maintenance treatment. This study aims to examine the role of TAC combined
      with corticosteroids, in comparison with the most commonly used standard-of-care treatment
      MMF plus corticosteroids, in the management of lupus nephritis.
