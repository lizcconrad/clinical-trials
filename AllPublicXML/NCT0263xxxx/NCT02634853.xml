        Inclusion Criteria:

        Be at least 18 years of age Provided written informed consent Have a reported history of
        dry eye Have a history of use or desire to use eye drops for dry eye

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Be diagnosed with an ongoing ocular infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal), or active
        ocular inflammation (e.g. follicular conjunctivitis) at Visit 1, or have been diagnosed
        with ocular rosacea, or any viral or bacterial disease of the cornea or conjunctiva, within
        the last 12 months Have any planned ocular and/or lid surgeries over the study period Have
        corrected visual acuity greater than or equal to +0.7 as assessed by Early Treatment of
        Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale in both eyes at Visit 1 Have an uncontrolled
        systemic disease Be a woman who is pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy Be a woman of
        childbearing potential who is not using an acceptable means of birth control; acceptable
        methods of contraception include: hormonal - oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal

        or condom; IUD; or surgical sterilization of partner. For non-sexually active females,
        abstinence may be regarded as an adequate method of birth control; however, if the subject
        becomes sexually active during the study, she must agree to use adequate birth control as
        defined above for the remainder of the study Have a known allergy and/or sensitivity to the
        test article or its components Have a condition or be in a situation which the investigator
        feels may put the subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may
        interfere significantly with the subject's participation in the study Be currently enrolled
        in an investigational drug or device study or have used an investigational drug or device
        within 45 days of Visit 1 Be unable or unwilling to follow instructions, including
