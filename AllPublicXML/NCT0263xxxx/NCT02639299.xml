      Background:

      Malaria is a serious infection caused by a parasite. People get malaria when an infected
      mosquito bites them. Malaria can cause major health and social problems in places were
      malaria is common, such as Africa but can also affect travelers who have never been exposed
      to malaria. Researchers at the NIH want to find a safe and effective malaria vaccine,
      antimalarial drugs, or prevention regimen. To do this, healthy volunteers are recruited under
      a general screening study in order to see if are qualified to join a future malaria study.

      Objective:

      To screen healthy volunteers to see if they are eligible to join investigational malaria
      studies. The studies will be trials of investigational antimalarial drugs, malaria vaccines,
      or prevention regimens. They may also involve controlled human malaria infection trials.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy people ages 18 50

      Design:

      Participants will first be prescreened by phone.

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood and urine tests

      Participants may go more than 1 year without joining a clinical trial. If this happens, they
      may be re-contacted to see if they still want to be part of this screening protocol. Those
      who still want to participate and have had relevant medical changes will be rescreened.

      This is a screening protocol for healthy volunteers to participate in research studies
      conducted by Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology (LMIV).

      Malaria-related morbidity and mortality have a major economic impact in endemic regions and

      present a substantial health risk to non-immune travelers and people living in endemic areas.
      To stem the worldwide impact of this devastating disease, a safe and broadly effective
      malaria vaccine and improved antimalarial therapeutics are urgently required.

      This screening protocol is designed to continuously evaluate potential healthy volunteers to
      build a pool of volunteers who may participate in future and ongoing LMIV malaria drug,
      vaccine, or controlled human malaria infections (CHMI) trials. A complete medical history and
      blood and urine samples will be obtained to evaluate whether volunteers are eligible for
      study-specific screening.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All of the following criteria must be fulfilled for a subject to participate in this trial:

          1. Age greater than or equal to 18 and less than or equal to 50 years.

          2. In good general health and without clinically significant medical history

          3. Reliable access to the clinical trial center and available in the area for more than 1
             year

          4. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to undergo periodic pregnancy
             testing and use reliable contraception per protocol when enrolled into LMIV clinical
             trials (protocol-specific requirements)

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A subject will be excluded from participating in this trial if any one of the following
        criteria is

        fulfilled:

          1. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or planned pregnancy in the upcoming year.

          2. Hemoglobin, white blood cell (WBC), platelets, alanine transaminase (ALT), and
             creatinine (Cr) outside of local lab normal range (subjects may be included at the
             investigator s discretion for not clinically significant values outside of normal
             range).

          3. Abnormal urinalysis as defined by positive urine glucose, protein, and hemoglobin.
             Subject can be included if investigator determine the abnormality is not clinically
             significant.

          4. Anticipated use during the study period, or use within the following periods prior to
             enrollment:
