    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ibrutinib when given together
      with idarubicin and cytarabine in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has
      returned after a period of improvement or has not responded to previous treatment. Ibrutinib
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as idarubicin and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving ibrutinib together with idarubicin and cytarabine may
      kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Identify the safety and recommended phase 2 dose of ibrutinib in combination with
      idarubicin/cytarabine in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the induction response rate (complete remission [CR]/complete remission with
           incomplete count [CRi]) of ibrutinib in combination with idarubicin/cytarabine in
           relapsed/refractory AML.

        -  Assess overall survival of ibrutinib in combination with idarubicin/cytarabine in
           relapsed/refractory AML.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ibrutinib.

      INDUCTION: Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1 to 21, idarubicin
      intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on days 1 to 3 and cytarabine IV continuously on days 1 to
      4.

      CONSOLIDATION: Patients achieving CR or CRi may receive ibrutinib PO QD on days 1 to 21,
      idarubicin IV over 15 minutes on Days 1and 2 and cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-3.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients maintaining a CR/CRi may receive ibrutinib PO QD on days 1 to 28.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.
