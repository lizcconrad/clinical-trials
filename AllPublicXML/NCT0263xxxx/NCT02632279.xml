  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of tryptophan depletion on mood and
      behavior in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of
      the subthalamic nucleus (STN). By doing this, the investigators hope to be able to identify
      risk factors for and mechanisms underlying psychiatric side effects of STN DBS. The study
      will be an intervention study with a placebo controlled, randomized cross-over design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms such
      as tremor, rigidity and slowness of movement. In later stages of the disease, when
      pharmacological treatment becomes less efficient, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the
      subthalamic nucleus (STN) becomes a treatment option. Although motor symptoms improve
      significantly by DBS, a number of operated patients experience severe side effects, mostly
      related to mood, cognition or behavior. These adverse effects are most likely mediated
      through the serotonin (5-HT) system. Additionally, a dysfunction of the 5-HT system is
      implied in the pathophysiology of PD. PD patients are therefore regarded as 'vulnerable' to
      experiencing mood, cognitive and emotional problems due to changes in 5-HT activity.

      To elucidate whether STN DBS is indeed the trigger for psychiatric and cognitive problems to
      arise in the PD patient, the 5-HT levels in PD patients implanted with STN DBS will be
      manipulated. In order to do this, the investigators will make use of the tryptophan (TRP)
      depletion method, an established research paradigm. In TRP depletion, the brain is depleted
      of TRP, the precursor of 5-HT, which consequently leads to lowered 5-HT levels. In both the
      normal and 5-HT depleted condition, mood- and cognitive parameters of the PD patients both
      with the STN stimulation on (ON) and off (OFF) will be assessed.

      The goal is to get more insight into the effects of STN DBS in PD patients with a 5-HT
      vulnerabililty and the effects on 5-HT related mood and cognitive behaviour. This way,
      possible risk factors for and mechanisms underlying psychiatric side effects of STN DBS can
      be identified. The study is an intervention study with a placebo controlled, randomized
      cross-over design.
