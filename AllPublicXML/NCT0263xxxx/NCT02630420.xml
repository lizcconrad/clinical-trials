    <textblock>
      Two-part phase 1B clinical trial combining cextuximab and savolitinib for treating Ras
      wild-type colorectal cancer (CRC). Part 1 will assess the safety and tolerability of this
      drug combination and will include patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
      cancer, as well as patients with CRC. Part 2 of the study, the focus of this registration,
      will obtain further safety data for the combination of cextuximab and savolitinib and will
      look at the efficacy of cextuximab and savolitinib in Ras wild-type mCRC that was previously
      treated and relapsed on cetuximab or panitumumab.Correlative studies will examine tumor and
      blood specimens for mechanisms of anti-EGFR resistance and response to MET inhibition.
