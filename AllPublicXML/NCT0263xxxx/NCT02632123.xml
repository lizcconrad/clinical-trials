    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressing scarring disease of the lungs with an
      average survival of only 30-36 months since the time of diagnosis. The clinical course of IPF
      is highly variable, with some patients remaining stable for a prolonged period of time, even
      in the absence of medical treatment, while others experience rapid and relentless
      progression. In some cases, the clinical course consists of a stepwise rather than steady
      decline, with periods of stability alternating with acute respiratory worsening. The
      variability in clinical course makes it challenging to define prognosis in these patients
      and, importantly, to determine the right time window for lung transplantation (LTx) referral,
      listing and priority status on the waiting list.

      The risk stratification score (RISE) is a new staging system for IPF based on the MRC dyspnea
      score, on physiology variables (pulmonary function tests) captured in the Composite
      Physiologic Index (CPI), and on the 6-minute walk distance. RISE showed to predict survival
      in newly diagnosed patients with IPF better than any other individual clinical, functional or
      radiographic variable. RISE also predicted survival on the waiting list in patients assessed
      and listed for LTx.

      The objective of this study is to validate the RISE as a reliable tool to predict survival in
      patients newly diagnosed with IPF and prospectively followed for a period of 3 years, or
      until death or lung transplant.

      This is an observational, prospective cohort study.

      Inclusion criterion will be a new diagnosis of IPF based on the American Thoracic
      Society/European Respiratory Society criteria (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2011;183:788-824). A
      pattern consistent with IPF will be confirmed by expert radiologists, unless a surgical lung
      biopsy is available.

      Patients newly diagnosed with IPF will be included in the study. At each visit, typically
      every 4 months, the MRC dyspnea score (MRCDS), the pulmonary function tests (FEV1, FVC and
      DLCO), and the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) will be recorded. The RISE will be calculated ad
      described in Eur Respir J 2012;40:101-109.

      MRCDS, PFTs and 6MWD are part of the standard of care in IPF and are routinely obtained at
      each visit of IPF patients in the ILD clinic (typically every 4 months).

      Patients will be prospectively followed for a period of 3 years and mortality events will be
      recorded. Mortality will be the primary endpoint. Acute exacerbations (AEs) of IPF, as
      defined in AJR Am J Roentgenol 1997;168:79-83, will also be recorded. AEs will be the
      secondary endpoint. At the end of the study period, both baseline RISE and longitudinal
      changes of RISE will be tested as predictors of mortality. Other individual variables wil
      also be tested as predictors of mortality including age at the time of diagnosis, time
      between onset of symptoms and diagnosis (months), gender, body mass index, smoking history
      (pack-years), PFTs, 6MWD (meters and % predicted), and radiographic fibrosis score on high
      resolution chest CT scan (HRCT) at the time of diagnosis.

      Values will expressed as meanÂ±SD. Comparisons between survivors and non-survivors will be
      made with unpaired t-test or with the Mann-Whitney U-test, where appropriate. The optimal
      cut-off value for different variables to detect mortality or AE will assessed using receiver
      operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. Survival will evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves
      and the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis will used to identify
      significant variables predicting survival status. Results will be summarized as hazard
      ratios, representing the relative risk of dying as a result of a specific characteristic
      during the observation period. Variables selected via univariate analysis (p&lt;0.05) will
      evaluated in the multivariate Cox regression analysis. p-values &lt;0.05 will regarded as
      significant.
