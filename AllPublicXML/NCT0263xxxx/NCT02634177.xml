  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized clinical trial, subjects will be assigned to either an assay-guided
      treatment condition (AGT) or a treatment-as-usual condition (TAU). All subjects will provide
      a DNA sample at the Screening Visit for the Genecept Assay ™. In the AGT condition, assay
      results will be provided to the treating investigator, who will use the results to guide
      antidepressant pharmacotherapy. In the TAU condition, the investigator will treat the
      subjects without the knowledge of the pharmacogenetic testing results. Assay results for all
      subjects will be provided to the investigator once all Week 8 visit procedures have been
      completed. Raters of the primary endpoint assessment and subjects will remain blinded to
      treatment assignment.
