      The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an
      investigational version of the Cutera enlightenTM laser for benign pigmented lesion (BPL)
      removal. Currently, the enlightenTM laser offers two wavelengths: 532nm KTP and 1064nm
      Nd:YAG. The version of the laser under investigation allows the user to choose from a range
      of wavelengths.
