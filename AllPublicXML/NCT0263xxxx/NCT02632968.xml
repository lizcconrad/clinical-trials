  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pinhole surgical technique is a novel minimally invasive, predictable, efficient, time and
      cost-effective technique for treatment of multiple gingival recession. This procedure
      involves no releasing incision, suturing or sharp dissections. It has been shown that the
      greater post-operative displacement of gingival margin may cause greater root coverage. Based
      on this hypothesis, a split mouth randomized controlled clinical trial was planned to compare
      the clinical outcome of pinhole surgical technique with and without the use of orthodontic
      buttons and sutures in the treatment of multiple gingival recessions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To achieve multiple adjacent recession coverage and an optimal integration of the associated
      tissues is even more challenging and a complex endeavour in comparison to isolated gingival
      recessions. Treatment protocol and outcome with different surgical procedures depends on a
      variety of factors like recession, defect size, presence or absence of keratinized tissue
      adjacent to the defect, width and height of inter-dental soft tissue, depth of vestibule,
      presence of frenum, post-operative stabilization and final position of advanced gingival
      margin. The final position of the GM plays a critical role in achieving CRC. Based on this
      hypothesis, a split mouth clinical trial was planned to compare the clinical outcome of
      pinhole surgical technique with and without the use of orthodontic buttons and sutures in the
      treatment of multiple gingival recessions.

      METHOD The aim of this split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial was to clinically
      compare and evaluate the effectiveness and predictability of Pinhole surgical technique alone
      and its modification with orthodontic buttons and sutures in 80 sites for the treatment of
      multiple gingival recessions and to assess the influence of these surgical procedures on the
      gingival and periodontal health, in the maxillary arch for six months post surgically.
      Gingival recession depth (GRD), Gingival margin location post-surgery, Gingival recession
      width (GRW), Root coverage esthetic score (RES), Complete root coverage (CRC), Probing depth
      (PD), Clinical attachment level (CAL), Keratinized tissue width (KTW), Plaque index (PI),
      Gingival index (GI), Gingival bleeding index (GBI) will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 3
      months and 6 months after treatment.

    <description>Pinhole surgery with orthodontic buttons The selected participants were assigned in test and control. In the test group orthodontic buttons were cemented on the bid-buccal region of the crown with dual cure GIC. After administration of LA, 2 to 3 pinhole incisions were made and a full thickness muco-periosteal tunnel was raised and collagen membrane was tucked in through the pinhole incisions. The sling sutures 5-0 mersilk were placed to hold the tunnel in an advanced location using orthodontic buttons as anchoring units. Inter-dental sutures with 6-0 mersilk were also placed for stabilization of the advanced gingival tissue.</description>
