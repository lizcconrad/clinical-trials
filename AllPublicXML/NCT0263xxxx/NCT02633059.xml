      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of idasanutlin and ixazomib
      citrate when given together with dexamethasone in treating patients with multiple myeloma
      that has returned after a period of improvement. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      idasanutlin and dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Ixazomib citrate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving idasanutlin, ixazomib citrate, and dexamethasone
      together may work better in treating patients with multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of idasanutlin and ixazomib (ixazomib
      citrate) to be used in combination with dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory
      multiple myeloma with TP53 (17p) deletion. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the confirmed response
      rate of ixazomib and idasanutlin used in combination with dexamethasone in patients with
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with TP53 (17p) deletion. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicities and the confirmed response rate associated with the combination
      of idasanutlin, ixazomib and dexamethasone. (Phase I) II. To describe the toxicities
      associated with the combination of idasanutlin, ixazomib and dexamethasone. (Phase II) III.
      To describe the complete response (CR) and very good partial response (VGPR) rates. (Phase
      II) IV. To assess progression-free and overall survival. (Phase II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess murine double minute 2 (MDM2) inhibition in bone marrow plasma cells. II. Identify
      potential biomarkers associated with response. III. To explore the pharmacodynamic effects of
      idasanutlin.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of idasanutlin and ixazomib citrate
      followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15 and idasanutlin PO once
      daily (QD) on days 1-5 every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients also receive dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 28 days for
      12 courses at the discretion of the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 3 months,
      and then every 6 months.
