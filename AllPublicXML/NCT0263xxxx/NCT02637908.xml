  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A training module has been developed for parents to effectively address stressors and demands
      of parenting and promote positive and supportive parent-child interactions. The purpose of
      this study is to implement the parent training program and evaluate the effectiveness of the
      program. Depending on the results, investigators expect core aspects of this module to be
      adaptable and modified or extended for parents of older children in the future to meet the
      needs of families across the stages of childhood development.

      Parents of children enrolled in the Head Start program will be recruited to take part in a
      training module to learn and practice mindfulness techniques. Recruited participants will be
      randomly assigned to an intervention group or a wait-list control group. Parents in the
      intervention group will attend the training, which involves 6 weekly, group sessions. Data
      will be collected from both the intervention and wait-list control groups 1-3 weeks prior to
      the intervention period and 1-3 weeks following the end of the intervention period. This data
      will be collected through self-report questionnaires, in-home observations, hair sample from
      parents, an activity tracker for parents, and records on developmental assessments and
      attendance of the target child from Head Start. The wait-list control group will be offered a
      training after measures are completed. Intervention group participants may be invited to take
      part in focus groups after the training is complete. At these focus groups, they will engage
      in a discussion of their experiences and opinions about the class. Some participants may be
      invited to individual interviews to share their experiences and aid further revision of the
      program.
