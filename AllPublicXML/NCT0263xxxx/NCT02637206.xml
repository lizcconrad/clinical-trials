  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2894512 is a novel anti-inflammatory agent that is currently under development for the
      topical treatment of atopic dermatitis and chronic plaque psoriasis. This study will be a
      Phase I, single-center, randomized, partial-blinded (evaluator blinded) study which consists
      of two parts (Part 1 and 2). Part 1 of this study will assess skin irritation following a
      single application of GSK2894512 cream at 2 concentrations (e.g. 0.5% and 1%) and placebo by
      simple-patch test and photo-patch test under semi-occlusive conditions in 20 healthy Japanese
      volunteers. Part 2 of this study will assess skin irritation following repeat application at
      0.5% and 1% of GSK2894512 cream and placebo for 7 days under non-occlusive condition in 6
      healthy Japanese volunteers. The study will have Screening visit which will occur within 30
      days from the Day 1 visit of each part. Eligible subjects will be able to participate either
      of Part 1 or Part 2. Subjects will visit the site on Day -1, and hospitalized until the end
      of all assessments on Day 4 (Part 1) or Day 7 (Part 2). Subjects will re-visit the site on
      Day 8 (Part 1) or Day 15 (Part 2) for follow-up assessments. This study will be the first to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GSK2894512 cream after single and
      repeat application in Japanese subjects. Results from this study will enable further clinical
      investigation in the Japanese population.

    <measure>Part 1-Positive rate of skin irritability as assessed by simple-patch test following single application of GSK2894512 cream</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Each test site for the simple-patch test will be evaluated at 30 minutes (min) and 24 hours (hrs) after removal of medication (48.5 hr and 72 hrs after application, respectively) based on the following criteria proposed by the patch test study group in Japan: no reaction (-); weak erythema (+-); erythema (+); erythema + edema (++); erythema + edema + papules, or vesicles (+++); bullae (++++). Except no reaction (-) and weak erythema (+-), rest all findings from simple-patch test will be considered as positive.</description>

    <measure>Part 1-Positive rate of photo-urticaria reaction as assessed by photo patch test following single application of GSK2894512 cream</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>For the photo-patch test, 4 test patches (right back) will be removed 24 hrs after application and the test sites will be exposed to 6.0 joule per square centimeter of ultraviolet A. Each test site will be evaluated at 30 minutes from the irradiation to determine whether there is photo-urticaria or not (i.e positive or negative).</description>

    <measure>Part 1-Positive rate of photo-toxicity as assessed by photo patch test following single application of GSK2894512 cream</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Post photo-urticaria evaluation, the test sites will be re-covered with empty patches, that will be removed at 24 hrs after removal of medication. The test sites will be evaluated at 30 min and 24 hrs after empty patches removal (48.5 and 72 hrs after application, respectively). Assessment Criteria includes: no reaction or similar to the non irradiation site (-); Slightly stronger than the non irradiation site (+-);Definitely stronger than the non irradiation site (+); 2 ranks stronger than the non irradiation site according to the criteria in Japan (++); 3 ranks stronger than the non irradiation site according to the criteria in Japan (+++). Test results of more than or equal to +- will be considered as positive.</description>

Symptoms will be recorded as a score ranging from 0-4, where 0=Normal, no discomfort; 1=an awareness, but no discomfort and no intervention required; 2=a noticeable discomfort that causes intermittent awareness; 3=a noticeable discomfort that causes intermittent awareness and interferes occasionally with normal daily activities; 4=a definite continuous discomfort that interferes with normal daily activities.</description>
