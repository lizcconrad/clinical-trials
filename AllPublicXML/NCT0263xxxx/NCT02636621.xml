    <textblock>
      Introduction: The Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome (UARS) is a sleep disorder characterized
      by airway resistance to breathing during sleep that leads to arousals and daytime sleepiness.
      There are few studies about UARS treatment and there is not any gold standard treatment for
      it yet.

      Objective: Primary: To evaluate the efficacy of oral appliance on improving fatigue in
      patients with UARS. Secondary: Evaluate the effects of treatment with oral appliance (OA) in
      patients with UARS on sleepiness, mood, cognition, quality of life, metabolism and autonomic
      nervous system.

      Methods: Subjects with UARS (Apnea/Hypopnea Index - AHI - ≤ 5 events per hour of sleep and
      Respiratory Disturbance Index - RDI - &gt; 5 events per hour or more than 30% of total sleep
      time with inspiratory flow limitation and with excessive daytime somnolence and/or fatigue)
      of both genders, with body mass index (BMI) lower than 30Kg/m2 and between 25 to 50 years of
      age will be included. Subjects will be randomly distributed in OA group and placebo (without
      treatment). At baseline evaluation, 6 months and 1 year after subjects will be submitted to
      sleep questionnaires, physical exam, otolaryngological evaluation, baseline polysomnography,
      Epworth sleepiness scale, Multiple Sleep Latency Test, fatigue scale, neurocognitive testing,
      autonomic nervous system analysis (heart rate variability) and metabolic evaluation. Mean and
      standard deviation will be used for descriptive statistical analysis if normal distribution,
      and median and percentiles (25%, 75%) for variables not normally distributed. To compare
      treatment groups T test (parametric) and Mann Whitney (non parametric) will be used. For
      adjusted analysis, linear regression analysis will be used.
