    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the treatment
      including 1) Lenalidomide-RCHOP, 2) R-HIDAC, and 3) Lenalidomide-Rituximab maintenance has on
      the participant and their lymphoma.

      Patients will receive lenalidomide 15 mg orally daily on days 1-14 with standard-dose R-CHOP
      (375 mg/m^2 intravenous rituximab, 750 mg/m2 intravenous cyclophosphamide, 50 mg/m^2
      intravenous doxorubicin, and 1.4 mg/m2 intravenous vincristine on day 1, and 100 mg
      prednisone days 1-5 or days 2-6) every 21 days for four cycles.

      All patients will receive pegfilgrastim on day 2 of each cycle and aspirin 81 mg orally daily
      for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis throughout the four cycles.

      After four cycles of Len-RCHOP, the patients will undergo restaging PET/CT scans. Patients
      with evidence of disease progression will be treated off study.

      R-HIDAC After lenalidomide-RCHOP phase, patients without evidence of progressive disease will
      receive rituximab 375 mg/m^2 day 1 and then patients will be admitted for high-dose
      cytarabine (HIDAC). Recommended age-adjusted HIDAC doses are as follows: ≤65 years: 3 g/m2
      every12 hours X 4 doses; 65-70 years: 2 g/m^2 every12 hours X 4 doses; &gt;70 years: 1 g/m^2
      every12 hours X 4 doses. Physician discretion will dictate the choice of HIDAC dose, ranging
      from 1 g/m^2 - 3 g/m^2 every 12 hours X 4 doses.

      Patients will receive two cycles of rituximab-HIDAC every 3 weeks. After two cycles of
      R-HIDAC, the patients will undergo restaging PET/CT scans. Patients with evidence of disease
      progression will be treated off study.

      Len-Rituximab Maintenance After completion of induction chemotherapy with Len-RCHOP and
      R-HIDAC, patients will begin maintenance phase with lenalidomide and rituximab for 6 months.
      Lenalidomide will be administered at 15 mg orally daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle for a
      total of 6 cycles and rituximab maintenance every 8 weeks for a total of 3 treatments.
