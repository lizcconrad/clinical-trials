  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing the hypothesis that administering 2L of body temperature warmed
      lactated ringer's intravenously prior to surgery can optimize the postoperative and recovery
      of patients undergoing total hip and total knee arthroplasty.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip and knee arthroplasty are safe and reliable surgeries for the majority of patients, but a
      small percentage experience major complications such as myocardial infarction, deep vein
      thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). As these complications are related to local
      tissue hypoxemia and patient immobility, interventions that can improve the ability of the
      heart to deliver blood to the tissue and help patients mobilize earlier in their
      postoperative course may decrease these complications. Based on recent evidence, it has been
      shown that many patients are dehydrated before surgery, which can make them feel nauseous,
      tired, and increase their perception of pain making them less likely to mobilize. This
      predisposes them to DVTs, pulmonary embolism, nausea and vomiting. Peri-operative dehydration
      can also decrease the ability of the lungs to oxygenate the blood properly and can place
      additional stress on the heart, which can increase the risk of heart attacks. The specific
      aim is to determine if patients' peri-operative hemodynamics can be improved with
      preoperative administration of 2 L of lactated ringers, and consequently reduce postoperative
      complications and improve recovery in arthroplasty patients.
