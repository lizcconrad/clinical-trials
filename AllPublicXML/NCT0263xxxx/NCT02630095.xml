    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect and safety of anticoagulation after
      endoscopic therapy in cirrhotic patients with portal vein thrombosis and to explore its
      effect on long-term rebleeding rate and mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of cirrhotic patients with PVT (portal vein thrombosis) is clearly recommended
      in guideline now. Several published studies has confirm the effect and safety of
      anticoagulation therapy in cirrhotic patients with PVT.The present studies are most
      observation studies with small sample size and low quality. The investigators need more
      high-quality research such as randomized controlled trials. This is a Zelen-designed
      multicenter randomized controlled trial. Patients will randomly enter into two groups:the
      anticoagulation group or the control group and then the investigator will make sure wether
      their are fond of the group and make decision by themselves. The recanalization rate and
      complications will be analyzed
