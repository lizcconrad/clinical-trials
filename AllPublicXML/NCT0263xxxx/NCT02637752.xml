      Background: Childhood obesity imposes a great burden on the healthcare system. Given the
      increased frequency of dental compared to medical visits during childhood, dentists may be in
      an ideal position to recognize patients at risk of developing obesity. This randomized
      clinical trial explored the efficacy of a brief nutrition and physical activity counseling
      for healthy weight 6 to11 year-old children in a university-based pediatric dental clinic.

      Methods: 168 children, 6-11 year old, were allocated to test and control groups and their
      Body Mass index (BMI) were recorded. Their parents/caregivers completed a questionnaire
      regarding their child's nutrition, physical activity and screen time. The parents/caregivers
      of the test group then received a brief counseling session that encouraged an increase in
      children's physical activity, and a decrease in sugar-sweetened beverages and screen time.
      Data, collected at baseline and follow-up session (within 6-12 months) were analyzed using
      general linear regression, adjusting for age, gender, socio-demographic characteristics,
      education, labour force, income and awareness of school nutrition policy (Pâ‰¤ 0.05).

    <description>A brief (5-10 minute) counseling session for caregivers of the intervention group aimed to encourage an increase in the child's physical activity and decrease sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and screen time. Additionally, the caregivers of the intervention group were provided with the following handouts: five steps to a healthy body weight for teens; beverages; physical activity tips for children 5-11 years; Canadian physical activity guidelines for children 5-11; and Canadian sedentary behavior guidelines for children 5-11.</description>
