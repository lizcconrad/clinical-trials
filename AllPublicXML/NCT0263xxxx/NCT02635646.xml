      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of a family and interdisciplinary approach
      on individual and family insulin resistance and insulin secretion in patients with
      prediabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This a randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of the following
      treatments:

        1. Family and interdisciplinary approach that includes nutritional, physical activity and
           psychological counseling + metformin 850mg twice at day for 12 months

        2. Individual approach that includes nutritional and physical activity counseling +
           metformin 850mg twice at day for 12 months

      To improve individual and family insulin resistance and insulin secretion in patients with
      prediabetes.

      Patients will have a follow-up visit every month in the Metabolic Research Laboratory at the
      University of Guanajuato, Mexico, and will have a fasting measurement of lipids, glucose and
      insulin every 3 months, as well as 2h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at basal, 6 and 12
      months.
