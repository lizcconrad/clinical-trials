    <textblock>
      This study assesses if using the medication desmopressin will decrease nightime bedwetting in
      children with sickle cell disease. Half of the children will receive placebo and half of the
      children will receive desmopressin, with the option to prescribe desmopressin as soon as the
      study is completed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Night time bedwetting is a common complication of sickle cell disease, and affects up to 30 %
      of children . Desmopressin is an oral medication that increases water reabsorption in the
      kidneys. Studies have shown that it is effective in decreasing bedwetting episodes in
      children without sickle cell disease. Chronic sickling episodes causing damage to the kidneys
      could cause permanent damage and may make this treatment ineffective in sickle cell disease.
      The investigators designed this trial to definitively answer this question by randomizing the
      patients to give half of the children placebo and the other half titrated doses of
      desmopressin. This trial will inform pediatric sickle cell doctors if desmopressin is an
      appropriate treatment for bed wetting in the investigators patients.

    <description>To determine if patients with sickle cell disease and nocturnal enuresis receiving desmopressin will have an improved quality of life compared to the control group. The investigators will assess quality of life by administering the Promis Fatigue Scale prior to administering the study drug and 4 weeks after the intervention.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with Hemoglobin SS, SC, SB0thal or SB+thal

          2. Patients with at least two episodes of primary nocturnal enuresis per week or four
             episodes over the two weeks prior to enrollment.

          3. Patients with secondary enuresis who have been evaluated and cleared by a pediatric
             urologist as not having other etiologies of enuresis (e.g. overactive detrusor
             activity, a genitourinary anatomic abnormality)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with developmental delay or neurologic dysfunction secondary to stroke.

          2. Patients with hypertension or underlying renal disease.

          3. Patients with genitourinary anatomic abnormalities. Any prior renal ultrasound showing
             normal genitourinary anatomy is sufficient to clear a patient for the study.

          4. Patients with daytime urinary incontinence

          5. Patients with glucosuria on urinalysis.

          6. Patients with secondary nocturnal enuresis who have not been evaluated by a pediatric
             urologist to rule out other etiologies of enuresis.

          7. Patients who are pregnant.

          8. Patients receiving another medicine for nocturnal enuresis (e.g. imipramine).
