  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether the use of AMNIOEXCEL® improves healing and
      reduces the need to cut off all or part of a leg (amputation) in high-risk patients who have
      diabetes and foot sores (also sometimes called ulcers or wounds).

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of comprehensive,
      interdisciplinary approach (usual care) in combination with early application of advanced
      therapy; dehydrated human amniotic membrane allografts (AMNIOEXCEL®, Derma Science,
      Princeton, New Jersey) in healing and preventing amputation in high risk patients with
      diabetic foot ulcers.
