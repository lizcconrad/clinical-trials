  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assisted Reproduction Technologies (ART) are increasingly being used worldwide as a result of
      fertility decline likely caused by changes in both environment and social behaviour.
      Considering this large usage, it is important to evaluate the potential risk on the health of
      children conceived using ART.

      According to the literature, children born after ART are more likely to be at higher risk of
      health problems than spontaneously conceived ones. Interestingly, recent studies suggested an
      increase of asthma prevalence in children conceived using In Vitro Fertilization (IVF).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of asthma in school adolescents from
      a cohort of children born after In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), aged 11-15 years as compared to
      a control group composed of the same age range spontaneously conceived individuals.

      The expected outcome of this study will provide new information regarding these children to
      ART professionals of and to their own families, by focusing on an age range (between 11 and
      15 years) for which very little information is available to date.

      The methodology is a comparative epidemiological survey, between children from a historical
      cohort born after intraconjugal In Vitro Fertilization (singleton or twin) aged 11-15 years
      and a control group recruited in schools after the agreement of Academic Inspection.

      Parents of the two groups will be contacted either by phone calls or through written
      information given in the schools. They will receive the questionnaire and an information
      letter, once they give their agreement to be a part of the study.

      Data collection will be conducted using two anonymous questionnaires. The first questionnaire
      was built based on items proposed in the international Health Behaviour in School-aged
      Children (HBSC) survey of the World Health Organization (WHO). The second questionnaire will
      be sent to parents. It will focus on the pregnancy and it will be used to adjust the
      analysis.

      This study was submitted and approved by an Institutional Review Board in France (Comité de
      Protection des Personnes Sud-Méditerranée II) on 11th September 2015.

        The investigators will include children born after In Vitro Fertilization/Intracytoplasmic
        Sperm Injection treatment from a historic cohort and children born spontaneously (without
        ART), attending schools in the same geographic area as IVF/ICSI children. Parents will be
        contacted before to include children.
