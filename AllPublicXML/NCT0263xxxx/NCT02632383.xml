    <textblock>
      Young people with diabetes type 1, their parents and health care providers have participated
      in developing the mHealth app &quot;Young with Diabetes&quot;.

      The aim of the app is to support young people to self-manage their diabetes type 1.

      A test group of 70 young people with diabetes type 1 test the app for 12 months as a
      supplement to standard care and the control group receives standard care only.

      At baseline and after 2, 7 and 12 months HbA1c, problem areas in diabetes, perceived
      competences in diabetes and health care climate are measured.
