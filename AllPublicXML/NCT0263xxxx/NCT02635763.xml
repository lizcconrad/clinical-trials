  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the population ages, the frequency of surgery is increasing proportionally, bringing with
      it the challenge of managing older patients with frequent comorbid diseases and an increased
      risk of complications. Poor postoperative quality of recovery may result in patient and
      family suffering, a prolonged hospital stay, and a greater demand on health care
      resources.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ultrasound guided percutaneous
      femoral nerve+lateral cutaneous nerve versus lumbar plexus+sacral plexus nerve block
      composite laryngeal mask anesthesia in elderly hip fracture surgery, the application of
      assessing their impact on the postoperative recovery quality.

    <textblock>
      In this study, patients who were more than 65 years old with hip fracture were randomized to
      peripheral nerve blocks 1(PNBs1)- femoral nerve+lateral cutaneous nerve-with laryngeal mask
      anesthesia, or peripheral nerve blocks 2(PNBs2) - lumbar plexus and sciatic - with laryngeal
      mask anesthesia. Blocks were performed using ultrasound and 0.5% ropivacaine. All patients
      received postoperative multimodal analgesia. Postoperative recovery was assessed at 15
      minutes, 40 minutes,- 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days after surgery, with the Postoperative Quality
      of Recovery Scale, in physiological, nociceptive, emotive, modified activities of daily
      living, modified cognitive, and overall patient perspective domains.
