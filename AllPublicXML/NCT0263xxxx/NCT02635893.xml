  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, experimental study that examines the physiology of central nervous
      system pathways contributing to the control of bilateral movements in individuals with spinal
      cord injuries and promotes the recovery of lower-limb motor function through the use of
      stimulation and locomotor training.

      This study plans to examine plasticity in corticospinal synapses of lower-limb muscles. it
      has been demonstrated that plasticity elicited at corticospinal synapses in the spinal cord
      result in enhancements in electromyographic (EMG) and force activity in upper-limb muscles.
      The first step in this proposal is to determine if synaptic plasticity can be elicited in
      corticospinal projections targeting lower-limb muscles in humans with SC.

      We will also study methods to strengthen corticospinal plasticity to promote recovery of leg
      clearance during training. We will use two novel strategies to enhance plasticity in
      corticospinal synapses of lower-limb muscles after SCI: a). administration of an
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist (i.e. D-cycloserine), and b). Combine
      NMDA-induced corticospinal plasticity with training (2D lower limb training and locomotor
      training. Corticospinal synaptic plasticity is thought to depend on activation of NMDA
      receptors and D-cycloserine enhances motor skill behaviors in animals and humans will be
      enhanced by NMDA-induced corticospinal plasticity. An important strength of this aim is the
      combination of training and strategies that aimed at enhancing the synaptic efficacy of
      residual corticospinal projections. Training effects on physiological pathways will be
      explored and correlated with locomotor function
