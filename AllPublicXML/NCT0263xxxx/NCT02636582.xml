    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well nelipepimut-S plus GM-CSF vaccine therapy or
      sargramostim works in treating patients with breast cancer. Vaccines made from peptide or
      antigen and/or a person's white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins may help the body build
      an effective immune response to kill tumor cells that express breast cancer. It is not yet
      known whether nelipepimut-S plus GM-CSF vaccine or sargramostim is more effective in treating
      patients with breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate for nelipepimut-S-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL; cluster of
      differentiation [CD]8+ T cell) response in patients receiving NeuVax (nelipepimut-S plus
      GM-CSF [sargramostim]) compared to patients receiving GM-CSF alone (control).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Toxicity profile and frequency of adverse events in women with ductal carcinoma in situ
      (DCIS) of the breast receiving nelipepimut-S vaccine as compared to women receiving GM-CSF
      alone.

      II. Immune response to other tumor antigens (epitope spreading). III. Functional capacity of
      the immune response to vaccination. IV. Determine CTL functional capability using
      intracellular cytokine assays. V. Evaluate polyfunctional cytokine responses assessed by
      multiplex assay. VI. Presence of DCIS at resection. VII. Difference in human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression in the biopsy and the surgical specimen excised
      post-vaccination.

      VIII. Histologic responses: degree of lymphocyte infiltration determined on hematoxylin and
      eosin (H&amp;E) stained slides and by immunohistochemistry staining for CD3, CD4 and CD8.

      IX. Histologic responses: Ki67 in DCIS cells (proliferation). X. Cleaved caspase 3 in DCIS
      cells (apoptosis). XI. Immune infiltrates in normal tissue maximally distant from the tumor
      (in mastectomy samples).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive nelipepimut-S plus GM-CSF vaccine intradermally (ID) 2 vaccination 2
      weeks apart prior to surgery.

      ARM II: Patients receive sargramostim ID 2 vaccinations 2 weeks apart prior to surgery, and 3
      vaccinations 1 months apart post-surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 3 months.

    <description>Change of nelipepimut-S-specific CTL at the 1 month (+/- 7 days) after completion of the vaccination series timepoint from baseline will be estimated for each group using mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. Two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test, whichever appropriate, will be used to compare the change between the two groups. Nelipepimut-S-specific CTL will also be measured repeatedly through 6 months after the last vaccination. Repeated measures analysis including mixed effects model will be performed to analyze the effect of treatment on nelipepimut-S-specific CTL change over time.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-vaccination to up to surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Total number of positive cells for each immune cell marker in 10 high power fields in the DCIS samples from pre-treatment and post-treatment samples will be counted and a &quot;difference statistic&quot; for each participant will be calculated (the change in the total number of marker-positive infiltrating immune cells in the pre- and post-treatment samples for each participant). These biomarker data will be visualized by plotting each participant's pre- and post-treatment value (&quot;spaghetti plots&quot;). The average &quot;difference statistic&quot; will then be calculated for the HER2 vaccine-treated group and the GM-CSF alone-treated group, and the average difference statistic will be compared using both paired and two-sample t-tests to determine effect of the vaccine on DCIS cell proliferation.
