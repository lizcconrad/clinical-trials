  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) are rapidly growing problems. Individuals with the
      MetS are at risk for not only future chronic diseases, but they have a higher prevalence of
      neuropathy, including cardiac autonomic neuropathy, and have a higher incidence of falls.
      Currently there are no effective therapies to prevent or reverse the neuropathy seen in the
      MetS or to reduced the fall risk in this population. This research project will determine if
      a tailored balance exercise program will have functional benefits and result in a reduced
      fall risk in the growing population of patients with the MetS and neuropathy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      55 participants with evidence of the MetS and autonomic neuropathy will be assessed for fall
      risk with the Four Square Step Test (FSST), which is a measure of dynamic standing balance.
      Additional endpoints include the dynamic gait index. Measures of height, weight, and waist
      circumference will be taken and an oral glucose tolerance test as well as lipids and blood
      pressure will also be measured. Autonomic function will be measured using cardiac autonomic
      testing, quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test and tilt table testing. Participants will be
      randomized into either a standard care group that will receive fall risk education or a
      targeted balance exercise intervention group. Both groups will meet once a week. The
      intervention group will receive a 12 week balance program with personalized incremental
      increases in the amount and difficulty of each maneuver.

    <description>A measure of proactive dynamic standing balance. A participant steps over four canes that are laid on the ground at 90 degree angles to each other. The participants stands in one of the squares formed by the canes and they are instructed to step as quickly as possible into each square in a specified sequence.</description>

    <measure>Dynamic Gait Index (DGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An instrumented DGI will be performed on an instrumented gait mat. The DGI is a measure of functional balance during walking an it assesses an individual's ability to modify balance while walking in the presence of external demands (walking while changing speeds, head turns, stepping over and around obstacles, pivoting, and stair climbing).</description>
