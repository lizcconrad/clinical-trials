  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study mainly compared the response of the artificial carious enamel lesions to
      remineralisation in situ. The tested in vitro demineralising protocols were: MC gel, PA gel,
      MHDP and Buffer solutions.

      The lesions were then remineralised in an in situ model, with crossover and double blind
      design. Fifteen volunteers wore intra-oral appliances containing 2 bovine enamel samples of
      each demineralising protocol during 3 experimental phases (3 days each). The experimental
      phases/treatments were: Control (Placebo dentifrice, saliva effect only), Home-care (fluoride
      dentifrice, 1,100 ppm F, NaF), and Professional/Home-care (varnish- 22,600 ppm F and
      dentifrice- 1,100 ppm F, NaF).

      During the 3-day phase, the appliance was only removed during the main meals (four times a
      day, maximum 1 h duration each, interval between meals 2-3 h). Immediately after the meals,
      before replacing the appliance in the mouth, the subjects were advised to perform oral
      hygiene using a soft end-rounded toothbrush (Colgate® 360º Sensitive Pro-Relief TM) and
      dentifrice (non-fluoridated from IceFresh, Bauru, SP, Brazil or fluoridated dentifrice from
      Crest Procter &amp; Gamble, Cincinnati, OH, USA) according to the phase and dental floss
      (Sanifill, São Paulo, Brazil).

      The remineralising treatment with dentifrices was done ex vivo, 1 min twice a day (after the
      first and last oral hygiene of the day) using slurry of the dentifrice (1:3 water, 1 drop of
      solution/specimen). Thereafter, the appliance was replaced in the mouth and the subjects were
      advised to rinse with 10 ml of water for 5 s and to expectorate. In respect to
      Professional/Home-care phase, the varnish (Duraphat, Colgate, SP, Brazil) was applied before
      the in situ study for 6h and then removed.

      The enamel remineralization was quantified using transverse microradiography (% mineral
      recovery and lesion depth, TMR), surface and cross-sectional hardness. The data were
      submitted to statistical analysis (p&lt;0.05).
