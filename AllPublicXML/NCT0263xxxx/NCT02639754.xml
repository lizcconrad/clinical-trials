  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young men who have sex with men (MSM) in low- and middle-income countries often do not seek
      out HIV testing, are unaware of their HIV-positive status, and do not receive early medical
      care, compromising their health and contributing to downstream disease incidence. This
      situation is of great concern in post-socialist countries of Eastern Europe, where stigma
      about HIV/AIDS and same-sex behavior are great, HIV epidemics are still increasing, and the
      health needs of young MSM are rarely acknowledged or addressed. The planned research will be
      conducted in Sofia, Bulgaria, where MSM account for nearly half of HIV infections. The study
      will be conducted in two phases.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an initial qualitative phase, the investigators will conduct in-depth interviews with MSM
      ages 16 to 20 and other key informants to gain an understanding of factors related to HIV
      testing. The project's second phase is a trial of a network intervention to increase regular
      HIV testing and care linkage among young MSM. The investigators' prior studies in Bulgaria
      have shown that young MSM are clustered with other young MSM in social networks. The
      intervention trial will recruit 54 small social networks of MSM, each consisting of a young
      MSM &quot;seed&quot; between age 16 and 20 and also all close MSM friends surrounding the seed. All
      participants will complete baseline measures assessing recent HIV testing practices and
      testing history; attitudes, intentions, perceived norms, barriers, and understanding about
      HIV testing and medical care; sexual risk practices; and substance use. All participants will
      receive HIV risk reduction counseling. Networks will then be randomized to comparison and
      intervention conditions. Influence leaders of each experimental condition network will be
      identified, and network leaders will together attend a 5-session intervention, which will
      train, guide, and engage leaders to deliver theory-based, personally-tailored advice and
      counseling to their network members to correct misconceptions about HIV testing and care;
      strengthen friends' norms, attitudes, intentions, and perceived benefits of regular testing;
      and address barriers to testing. All members of intervention and comparison condition
      networks will be re-assessed at 6- and 12-month followup to determine the intervention's
      effects on HIV testing, regular testing, and testing- and care-related scale measures.
      Participants diagnosed with HIV infection at any point will be linked to medical care.
