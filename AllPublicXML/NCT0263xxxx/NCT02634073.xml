  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lamivudine (3TC) is a nucleoside analogue indicated in combination with other antiretroviral
      agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults
      and children. Documented literature elucidates that simultaneous administration of multiple
      sorbitol-containing products could increase the potential for a significant interaction and
      may contribute to the lower 3TC exposures.

      In this study several sorbitol doses (3.2 gram (g), 10.2 g, and 13.4 g solutions) will be
      administered with lamivudine to investigate dose dependency and mimic the situation where
      multiple sorbitol-containing antiretroviral medications may be co-administered with
      lamivudine. It will be open label, randomized, 4-way crossover (by William's design method)
      design at a single centre. Randomized participants will receive a single dose of each of four
      treatments after wash out period of minimum 7 days.

        <description>Serial blood sample were collected at Pre-dose; 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 hours post-dose in each treatment period. Time of the last measurable concentration (t) was 48 hours for all participants and all treatments. ANOVA, considering treatment and period as fixed effects and participant as random effect, was performed using Mixed Linear Models procedure to compare the plasma lamivudine PK parameters.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at Day -1, Day 3 of every treatment period and at follow-up. Change from Baseline for hemoglobin was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the value at Baseline, at Day 3 and Follow-up. Baseline value used in the analysis was the latest pre-dose values on Day 1 of each treatment/period. Day -1 presented the Baseline absolute values; Day 3 and Follow-Up presented the changes from Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Sodium, Potassium, Glucose, Calcium</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at Day -1, Day 3 of every treatment period and at follow-up. Change from Baseline for BUN, sodium, potassium, glucose, calcium were calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the value at Baseline, at Day 3 and Follow-up. Baseline value used in the analysis was the latest pre-dose values on Day 1 of each treatment/period. Day -1 presented the Baseline absolute values; Day 3 and Follow-Up presented the changes from Baseline.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at Day -1, Day 3 of every treatment period and at follow-up. Change from Baseline for AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase were calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the value at Baseline, at Day 3 and Follow-up. Baseline value used in the analysis was the latest pre-dose values on Day 1 of each treatment/period. Day -1 presented the Baseline absolute values; Day 3 and Follow-Up presented the changes from Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Albumin</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at Day -1, Day 3 of every treatment period and at follow-up. Change from Baseline for albumin was calculated as the post-dose Visit Value minus the value at Baseline, at Day 3 and Follow-up. Baseline value used in the analysis was the latest pre-dose values on Day 1 of each treatment/Period. Day -1 presented the Baseline absolute values; Day 3 and Follow-Up presented the changes from Baseline.</description>
