      This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of intra- arterial infusion of gemcitabine
      and oxaliplatin in locally advanced pancreatic cancer. This protocol is overseen by the Fudan
      University Institutional Review Board which has Federal Wide Assurance through the U.S.
      Department of Health &amp; Human Services (Approved: April 25, 2002).

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      To compare the overall survival (OS) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer
      treated with transcatheter arterial infusion (TAI) of chemotherapeutics or systemic delivered
      chemotherapy.

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      To compare the progression free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), quality of
      life (QoL), and adverse effects of treating locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients with
      TAI or systemic chemotherapy.

      Exploratory Outcome Measures:

      To evaluate the correlation between prognosis and expression of serum microRNAs of the
      patients.
