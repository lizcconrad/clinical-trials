      This is a multicenter, open label, Phase 1/2 study in pediatric patients with advanced solid
      or primary CNS tumors. LOXO‑101 (larotrectinib) will be administered orally (PO) twice daily
      (BID), with the dose adjusted by body surface area (BSA).

      Dose Escalation Phase has completed enrollment and it has been determined that the maximum
      dose for the Phase 1 Expansion and Phase 2 portions of the study will be no higher than the
      recommended Phase 2 dose of 100 mg BID in the adult Phase 2 trial, regardless of the
      patient's BSA.

      Phase 1 Expansion and Phase 2 portions of the study are currently enrolling.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pediatric patients ≥ 1 day old on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1)

          -  Phase 1: Birth through 21 years of age at C1D1 with a locally advanced or metastatic
             solid tumor or primary CNS tumor that has relapsed, progressed or was nonresponsive to
             available therapies and for which no standard or available systemic curative therapy
             exists, or infants from birth and older with a diagnosis of malignancy and with a
             documented NTRK fusion that has progressed or was nonresponsive to available
             therapies, and for which no standard or available curative therapy exists, or patients
             with locally advanced infantile fibrosarcoma who would require, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, disfiguring surgery or limb amputation to achieve a complete surgical
             resection. The Phase I dose escalation cohorts are closed to enrollment. In addition
             to the above stated Inclusion Criteria, patients eligible for enrollment into this
             cohort must have a malignancy with a documented NTRK gene fusion with the exception of
             patients with infantile fibrosarcoma, congenital mesoblastic nephroma or secretory
             breast cancer. Patients with infantile fibrosarcoma, congenital mesoblastic nephroma
             or secretory breast cancer may enroll into this cohort with documentation of an ETV6
             rearrangement by FISH or RT-PCR or a documented NTRK fusion by NGS.

          -  Phase 2 only: Infants from birth and older at C1D1 with a locally advanced or
             metastatic infantile fibrosarcoma, patients with locally advanced infantile
             fibrosarcoma who would require, in the opinion of the Investigator, disfiguring
             surgery or limb amputation to achieve a complete surgical resection or birth through
             21 years of age at C1D1 with a locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor or primary
             CNS tumor that has relapsed, progressed or was nonresponsive to available therapies
             and for which no standard or available systemic curative therapy exists with a
             documented NTRK gene fusion (or in the case of infantile fibrosarcoma, congenital
             medoblastic nephroma or secretory breast cancer with documented ETV6 rearrangement by
             FISH or RT-PCR or a documented NTRK fusion by NGS) (identified through molecular
             assays as routinely performed at CLIA or other similarly-certified laboratories) or
             (including Expansion Phase) potential patients older than 21 years of age with a tumor
             diagnosis with histology typical of a pediatric patient and an NTRK fusion may be
             considered for enrollment following discussion between the local site Investigator and
             the Sponsor's Medical Monitor. Patients with NTRK-fusion positive benign tumors are
             also eligible.

             count ≥ 100.0 109/L and hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL (patients with bone marrow involvement
             will not be evaluable for hematologic DLT and can enroll with ANC ≥ 0.75 109/L,
             platelet count ≥ 50.0 109/L and hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL)

          -  Adequate hepatic function: Bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) ≤ 2.5 upper
             limit of normal (ULN) for age (patients with documented Gilbert's Disease may be
             enrolled with Sponsor approval).

          -  Adequate renal function: Estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 30 mL/minute using the
             Cockroft-Gault formula or: a serum creatinine based on age/gender as outlined in the
             protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigational agent, anticancer therapy, or major surgery within 14 days (2 weeks)
             prior to C1D1

          -  Clinically significant active cardiovascular disease or history of prolonged QT
             interval corrected for heart rate (QTc)

          -  Current treatment with a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor or inducer (EIAEDs
             and dexamethasone for CNS tumors or metastases, on a stable dose, are allowed)

          -  Phase 2 Only: Prior progression while receiving approved or investigational tyrosine
             kinase inhibitors targeting TRK, including entrectinib, crizotinib and lestaurtanib.
             Patients who received a TRK inhibitor for less than 28 days of treatment and
             discontinued because of intolerance remain eligible.
