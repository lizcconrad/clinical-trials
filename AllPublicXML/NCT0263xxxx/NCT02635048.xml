  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) has been considered as the first-line choice for the
      management of &gt;20mm kidney stones. The traditional nephrostomy tract of PNL was dilated to
      24-30F, which is referred to as &quot;Standard-PCNL&quot;. Standard PNL has an ideal stones free rate
      (SFR), however, at the cost of severe morbidity. To decrease the disadvantages related to
      standard PNL, &quot;mini-perc&quot; or &quot;mini-PCNL&quot;, 20F or less, was first introduced to pediatric
      procedure in 1997, and subsequently implemented in adults with the expectation of similar SFR
      and low morbidity in the past twenty years. Although abundant efforts have been done, whether
      mini-perc outweigh standard-PNL for the treatment of &gt;20mm calculis in terms of efficiency
      and safety remains controversial.

      To solve this problem, we performed this multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      This study will be started at December,2015 and ended at November,2017.At least 1950 patients
      with 20-40mm renal calculi will be enrolled.By simple random sampling technique, patients
      will be assigned to two 975-patient groups (mini-PCNL group and standard-PCNL group).

      All the patients will be diagnosed definitely before operations with non-contrast CT, along
      with plain radiography (kidney ureter bladder, KUB), IVP and Ultrasound.

      Patients with positive preoperative urine culture should be treated with suitable antibiotics
      based on the culture sensitivity result for at least 72 h before standard PNL/mini-perc.
      Patients who have negative urine culture should receive a single dose of broad spectrum
      antibiotic prophylaxis just prior to the procedure.

      Surgical technique Under general or epidural anaesthesia, each patient is initially placed in
      the lithotomy position, and a 5 Fr or 6Fr ureteral catheter is inserted to the kidney and
      fixed with a 16 Fr Foley catheter. Then the patient is turned to the prone position.

      The choice of using C-arm fluoroscopic or ultrasonography guidance or a combination fashion
      for the percutaneous access was made at the discretion of the treating urologist. The length
      of the needle from skin to the collecting system is measured to ensure that the length of
      dilator is appropriate. No patient underwent bilateral simultaneous PCNL and patients with
      bilateral stones underwent surgery 4 weeks apart

      Mini-PCNL group: The access tract is dilated with a fascial dilator from 8F up to 18F. We
      defined access to the collecting system as gaining entry to the targeted urinary system and
      desired calix. For some complex cases, when indicated requiring multiple tracts, additional
      tracts were created in the same session. The stone was fragmented by pneumatic lithotripsy or
      Holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy through 8/9.8F semirigid ureteroscope (Richard Wolf, Germany).
      The large fragments were extracted with a forcept, and small fragments were flushed out with
      an endoscopic pulsed perfusion pump. A silastic nephrostomy tube was placed at the end of
      procedure and a 4-6Fr double pigtail ureteral stent was left for 2 weeks after operation.
      X-ray check for residual stone fragments is also performed at the end of the procedure.

      Standard-PCNL group: The access tract is dilated from 8F to a maximum 24 F using fascial
      dilator. Rigid nephroscope were used. Stones were fragmented by pneumatic lithotripsy,
      Holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy or EMS. The rest of the procedure is the same as described for
      patients in mini-perc group.

      Patients were candidates for the tubeless procedure only when the following strict conditions
      were met: single percutaneous tract, absence of major perforation of collecting system and
      bleeding, complete stone clearance assessed by intraoperative nephroscopy and fluoroscopy at
      the end of the procedure. For a tubeless procedure, the flank was compressed for 5 min.
      Patient was monitored for postoperative complications.

      Data collection

      Data for the 2 groups -demographic characteristics, site of target calix, site of access,
      S.T.O.N.E score, hemoglobin drop, postoperative pain, duration of procedure, hospital stay,
      cases of tubeless, complications (modified Clavien system), stone clearance (SFR of
      postoperative day 1 and 1 month follow-up), serum levels of markers of the systemic response
      to surgery-induced tissue trauma (CRP) and the need for auxiliary treatment (for example,
      re-miniperc, RIRS and ESWL) - are compared.

      Main study endpoints: The endpoint is SFR of postoperative day 1 and 1 month follow-up. The
      other endpoints include complications, cases of tubeless and hospital stays.

      Initial SFR is assessed by KUB at day 1 after operation. Non-contrast CT is obtained for all
      patients at 1 month after the operation to evaluate the final SFR, allowing time for the
      spontaneous passage of stone fragments. Any information concerning needs for auxiliary
      treatment (for example, re-miniperc, RIRS and ESWL) will be recorded.

      Stone-free status are defined as either the absence of any residual stone fragments or the
      presence of clinically insignificant residual stone fragments in the kidney which were
      defined as ≦ 4mm, asymptomatic, non-obstructive and non-infectious stone particles.

      The stone size was defined as the largest diameter of single stone on plain abdominal
      radiograph of the kidneys ureters and bladder (KUB) and/or non-contrast CT. In the case of
      multiple stones, the summation of the largest diameters of the stones was used.

      Demographic characteristics include age, sex, BMI, stone size and location, etc.

      Operation time is defined as the time from puncture to the placement of the nephrostomy tube.
      Hospital stay was defined as days between the surgery date and discharge date.

      Postoperative pain (visual analogue scale [VAS], use of analgesics) will be recorded.

      The rate of hemoglobin drop is assessed by comparing the preoperative Hb level with 24-hour
      postoperative Hb level.

      If the procedure is considered as successful, the pigtail stent is removed as outpatient
      after 2weeks. Follow-up including non-contrast CT will be generally scheduled in 1 month.

      Bleeding severity is judged by the treating surgeon, and transfusions are administered
      according to local practice guideline.

      Complications of all patients are recorded according to modified Clavien classification
      system.
