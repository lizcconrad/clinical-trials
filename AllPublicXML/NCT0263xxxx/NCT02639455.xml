    <textblock>
      Poor oral health can greatly impact quality of life and can also impact overall health. For
      instance, research suggests that poor oral health may be associated with systemic diseases
      such as diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the
      causes of poor oral health.

      The idea that athletes may have a propensity for dental caries has been gaining traction.
      There have been recent reports of high levels of dental caries, dental erosion and
      periodontal diseases among elite soccer players compared to the general public and in
      athletes from a wide range of sports. However, to date, no studies have investigated the oral
      microbiome of athletes.

      Many factors affect the development of dental caries, including host factors, diet, and the
      microorganisms present in the oral cavity. More than 700 types of bacterial species have been
      detected in the oral cavity, and some have been identified to play a significant role in the
      development of oral disease. Streptococcus mutans is the main species involved in dental
      decay with various lactobacilli also involved in the disease process. Treponema denticola,
      Porphyromonas ginigivalis, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans are the main species
      involved in periodontal disease. It is not currently known if changes in the collective oral
      microbiome foster or impede the development of these pathogens.

      Complex microbe-host interactions occur to allow for the progression of oral disease, with
      host nutrition and hygiene playing a significant role. Endurance athletes widely consume a
      variety of sport drinks, gels, and energy bars for supplementation of electrolytes and
      carbohydrates. The consumption of these foods leads to pH drops in the oral cavity and may
      contribute to tooth erosion and demineralization. Oral disease may also be exacerbated by the
      fluid and electrolyte deficit that impedes saliva flow during exercise. However, several
      studies have failed to demonstrate a clear link between sports drinks and an increased risk
      of dental caries among athletes.

      Dental caries are caused by microorganisms in the oral cavity. These microbes may be affected
      by host factors or nutrition in the progression of oral disease. Due to the documented
      prevalence of dental caries in athletes and the lack of clear connection between sports
      drinks and dental caries, the investigators propose to investigate any correlation that may
      exist between exercise and the oral microbiome.
