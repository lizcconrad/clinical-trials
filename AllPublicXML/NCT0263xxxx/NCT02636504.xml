      The objectives of this study are to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive
      predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of laser Doppler flowmetry in
      determining the vitality of teeth and comparing with those of electric pulp testing and cold
      testing.

      Prior to starting any endodontic treatment, it is essential to determine the vitality of the
      tooth in question. Vitality of a tooth is defined as the presence of blood flow into the
      tooth. The vitality status of a tooth will affect the success of endodontic treatment, and
      therefore plays an important role in treatment planning. Two established methods of
      determining vitality are electric pulp tests and cold tests. However, both these methods have
      drawbacks. Both methods use the presence of sensory feedback in the tooth as a predictor of
      tooth vitality. This can lead to errors because blood flow and nerves in the tooth may be
      lost at different times, resulting in false-positive and false-negative responses. Both are
      subjective and patient-dependent, relying on the patient to indicate when pain is felt. In
      addition, studies have suggested that electric pulp testing and cold tests are not as
      reliable in immature teeth, teeth undergoing orthodontic movement, traumatized teeth, and
      teeth with significant secondary dentin. Laser Doppler flowmetry is a technique that utilizes
      the Doppler principle to determine blood flow. It has been used widely in the medical field
      to measure blood flow in the skin. Some studies have also shown good results in measuring
      blood flow in the pulp of teeth. The objectives of this study are to determine the
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy
      of laser Doppler flowmetry in determining the vitality of teeth and comparing with those of
      electric pulp testing and cold testing.

    <measure>The number of teeth showing the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative after pulp vitality testing</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who present to the endodontic clinic for a consultation visit prior to treatment. The patient will have three types of pulp vitality tests done on the tooth that is to receive endodontic treatment. The number of teeth that show the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative after pulp vitality testing will be measured. For example, a tooth that is diagnosed nonvital based on the pulp vitality testing will be confirmed when endodontic treatment is performed. If there is a discrepancy, it can be counted as false negative. When a tooth is diagnosed vital based on the pulp testing and confirmed to be vital, it can be counted as true positive. When a tooth is diagnosed vital based on the pulp testing and confirmed to be nonvital, it can be counted as false positive. When a tooth is diagnosed nonvital and confirmed novital, it is counted as true negative.</description>

        Patients that need endodontic treatment will have a consultation visit first. In most
        cases, the endodontic treatment will be provided at a subsequent visit. In some cases the
        endodontic treatment will be provided at the same visit. Patients who present to the
        endodontic clinic for a consultation visit for endodontic treatment. The patient will have
        three types of pulp vitality tests done on the tooth that is to receive endodontic
        treatment.
