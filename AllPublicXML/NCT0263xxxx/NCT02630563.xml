  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is planned to be conducted in 2 parts. The first part (open label, multi-center,
      non-controlled) of the study will estimate a dose that would provide a mycophenolic acid
      (MPA) exposure in pediatric participant that is comparable to that achieved in adult liver
      transplant participants receiving the approved dose of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, CellCept).
      The second part (open-label, multi-center, single-arm Phase IV study) of the study will
      provide the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety profile of the proposed dose in the
      immediate post-transplant period. This study will be conducted at two centers based in the
      United States of America. Twelve pediatric transplant participants receiving a first liver
      allograft from a cadaveric or living donor will be enrolled in this study. Stable pediatric
      liver transplant participants who are at least 6 months post-transplant and who were already
      receiving stable dose of MMF in combination with cyclosporine will be enrolled into the
      study. Participants should have received stable MMF dose according to center practice for at
      least seven days in order to get steady state pharmacokinetics (PK). Participants also should
      have received stable concomitant doses of cyclosporine (for at least 2 days) and
      corticosteroids per center practice. Participants will be aged between 9 months and 12 years,
      with at least 6 participants greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 9 months and less than (&lt;) 36
      months, of whom at least 2 will be &lt;24 months.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to extremely slow recruitment, infrequent use of combination triple therapy (MMF,
    cyclosporine, steroids), study was discontinued; Part 2 was not conducted.

    <description>The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to twelve hours (AUC [0-12h]) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero through 12 hours. AUC (0-12) hours was computed using the linear trapezoidal rule. For the calculations of AUC (0-12h), concentrations below the limit of quantification were assigned a value of zero if they occurred at the beginning of a profile. When such values appeared at the end of a profile they were assigned as missing data. AUC0-12h was normalized to 600 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) and 1.5 gram. AUC was reported in microgram hour per milliliter (mcg*h/mL).</description>

          <title>Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time Curve From 0-12 Hours for Mycophenolic Acid and Mycophenolic Acid Glucuronide Phenolic Glucuronide of Mycophenolic Acid</title>
          <description>The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to twelve hours (AUC [0-12h]) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero through 12 hours. AUC (0-12) hours was computed using the linear trapezoidal rule. For the calculations of AUC (0-12h), concentrations below the limit of quantification were assigned a value of zero if they occurred at the beginning of a profile. When such values appeared at the end of a profile they were assigned as missing data. AUC was reported in microgram hour per milliliter (mcg*h/mL).</description>
