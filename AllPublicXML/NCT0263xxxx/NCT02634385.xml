  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) is often reserved for patients with a small peripheral
      tumour, in the hands of an experienced surgeon since it demands a high degree of endoscopic
      skill. Renal vessel clamp for vascular control is a required step during standard LPN.
      However, this creates a time limiting step for the surgeon and induces renal injury via warm
      ischemia and reperfusion injury. This novel approach can substantially reduce renal injury
      during LPN via superselective embolization of level II renal arteries pre-operatively. This
      technique facilitates the performance of a clamp-less, zero-ischemia LPN, significantly
      simplifying the procedure by remove time thresholds within which to perform tumor excision.
      The preliminary results are promising; however, there is a need for further corroboration of
      their results, in addition to a randomized controlled trial comparing this modified, zero
      ischemia technique with standard LPN.

    <textblock>
      The potential utility of a zero ischemia, laparoscopic, partial nephrectomy portends
      significant implications for both the surgeon and patient. Firstly, the technical difficulty
      of a partial nephrectomy will be reduced to a more achievable level owing mainly to the
      removal of a time limit on surgical resection. With the blood flow halted to downstream
      tissue containing the renal neoplasm from preoperative embolization, resection can be made to
      the tumor without clamping of the main renal arteries. This minimizes the ischemic time to
      non-neoplastic renal tissue, allowing for a renal protective effect. Without the need for
      clamping, the overall surgical operative time is drastically reduced. With excision made at
      the ischemic tissue, intra-operative bleeding and ease can be achieved. More surgeons can
      ultimately attempt at LPN by removing the single most limiting surgical factor, warm ischemic
      time.
