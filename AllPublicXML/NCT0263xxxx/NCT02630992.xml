  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety profile of amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium containing a reduced
      concentration of clavulanate potassium, 600 mg/21.5 mg/5 mL (a ratio of 28:1), administered
      at 90/3.2 mg/kg/day (formulation 1) or at 80/2.85 mg/kg/day (formulation 2) in two divided
      doses for 10 days. Investigators will focus on the proportion of subjects who develop
      protocol-defined diarrhea and proportion who develop diaper dermatitis that occasions the
      prescription of antifungal medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium has been shown to be efficacious in eradicating causative
      pathogens in acute otitis media (AOM) with resulting high clinical cure rates at
      end-of-treatment (85%). However, relatively high rates (~25%) of clinically significant
      diarrhea have been reported, the occurrence of which has been directly related to the
      clavulanate potassium component of the drug combination. A reduced concentration of
      clavulanate potassium in the drug formulation would be expected to have an improved safety
      profile regarding the occurrence of diarrhea. This study will examine whether the
      concentration of the clavulanate potassium component of amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium
      could be reduced in the treatment of children 6 months through 23 months of age diagnosed
      with AOM using stringent criteria. A total of 75 participants (n=75) with AOM will receive
      amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium (600 mg/21.5 mg/5 mL; 28:1) administered at 90/3.2
      mg/kg/day (formulation 1) or at 80/2.85 mg/kg/day (formulation 2) in two divided doses for 10
      days.

      The primary outcome measure will be rates of clinically significant diarrhea and diaper
      dermatitis. These rates will be compared with the rate observed in our previous studies of
      AOM in children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium (600 mg/42.9 mg/5 mL; 14:1)
      administered at 90/6.4 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for 10 days.

      A subset of this group will have pharmacokinetic studies performed. Each participant that
      agrees will have a single blood draw (n=50). Investigators will analyze amoxicillin and
      clavulanate potassium in the blood samples using validated methods.

Treatment failure is defined as substantial persistence or worsening of symptoms specifically attributable to AOM or of otoscopic signs of acute inflammation (bulging of the TM or intense erythema) after 72 hours from the initial AOM, such that additional antimicrobial therapy is deemed advisable. Clinical success is defined as complete or substantial resolution of symptoms specifically attributable to AOM for 48 hours and of otoscopic signs of acute inflammation (bulging of the TM or intense erythema), with or without persistence of middle-ear effusion, such that no additional antibiotic therapy is deemed advisable.</description>

    <measure>The Distribution of Participants Receiving Formulation 1 Demonstrating Resolution of Acute Otitis Media (AOM) and Substantial Improvement of Symptoms That Would Allow Discontinuing Therapy at the Day 7 Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of administration of amoxicillin-clavulanate until the day 7 visit. The mean day for this visit was 7.5.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants receiving formulation 1 were administered amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium containing a reduced concentration of clavulanate potassium, 600 mg/21.5 mg/5 mL (a ratio of 28:1), administered at 90/3.2 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for 10 days.
An assessment of participants was conducted at the day 7 visit using the AOM-SOS scale.
The AOM-SOS scale measures five discrete items: tugging of ears, crying, irritability, difficulty sleeping, and fever. Parents are asked to rate these symptoms in comparison with the child's usual state, as &quot;none,&quot; &quot;a little,&quot; or &quot;a lot,&quot; with corresponding scores of 0, 1, and 2. Thus, total scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>

          <description>The AOM-SOS scale measures five discrete items: tugging of ears, crying, irritability, difficulty sleeping, and fever. Parents are asked to rate these symptoms in comparison with the child's usual state, as &quot;none,&quot; &quot;a little,&quot; or &quot;a lot,&quot; with corresponding scores of 0, 1, and 2. Thus, total scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>

        <title>The Distribution of Participants Receiving Formulation 1 Demonstrating Resolution of Acute Otitis Media (AOM) and Substantial Improvement of Symptoms That Would Allow Discontinuing Therapy at the Day 7 Visit</title>
        <description>Participants receiving formulation 1 were administered amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium containing a reduced concentration of clavulanate potassium, 600 mg/21.5 mg/5 mL (a ratio of 28:1), administered at 90/3.2 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for 10 days.
An assessment of participants was conducted at the day 7 visit using the AOM-SOS scale.
The AOM-SOS scale measures five discrete items: tugging of ears, crying, irritability, difficulty sleeping, and fever. Parents are asked to rate these symptoms in comparison with the child's usual state, as &quot;none,&quot; &quot;a little,&quot; or &quot;a lot,&quot; with corresponding scores of 0, 1, and 2. Thus, total scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>

          <description>Participants receiving formulation 1 were administered amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium containing a reduced concentration of clavulanate potassium, 600 mg/21.5 mg/5 mL (a ratio of 28:1), administered at 90/3.2 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for 10 days.
An assessment of participants was conducted at the day 7 visit using the AOM-SOS scale.
The AOM-SOS scale measures five discrete items: tugging of ears, crying, irritability, difficulty sleeping, and fever.
