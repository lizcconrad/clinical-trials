  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and in particular T cells play a critical role in the rejection
      of transplanted organs. Thus, in transplant recipients a life-long and individualized
      immunosuppressive medication is required to avoid graft rejection. However, a too weak
      suppression of CMI causes acute and chronic graft damage leading to transplant loss, whereas
      a too potent suppression of CMI supports opportunistic infections and reactivation of
      persistent viruses.

      One of the biggest challenges in the field of transplantation is to provide a personalized
      immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy based on reliable assessment and monitoring of CMI.
      This could lead to a reduction of graft rejections and virus reactivations in transplant
      recipients.

      With the development of both assays T-Track® CMV and T-Track® EBV, Lophius Biosciences GmbH
      has implemented its novel proprietary T-activation technology for an improved assessment of
      the functionality of CMI in cytomegalovirus (CMV)- and/or Epstein-Barr virus
      (EBV)-seropositive individuals. In contrast to other existing systems the Lophius assays open
      up the opportunity to characterize the functionality of CMI as an entire network.

      The planned clinical multicenter study aims to verify the suitability of the two assays for a
      reliable assessment of the functionality of CMI.

      Hemodialysis patients have been identified as an appropriate patient cohort for investigating
      the clinical sensitivity of the Lophius assays as these patients closely resemble kidney
      transplant recipients prior to an immunosuppressive therapy.

      The determination of the functional CMI in the course of an immunosuppressive treatment may
      in future enable physicians to optimize the individual immunosuppressive and antiviral
      therapy in transplant recipients to reduce the risk of rejection as well as virus
      reactivations and associated diseases.

    <description>Determination of the clinical sensitivity of T-Track® CMV and T-Track® EBV. T-Track® assays are based on the stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with preselected immunodominant T-activated proteins derived from the human Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and the Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV) and the subsequent quantification of IFN-gamma producing blood leucocytes (Lophius biomarker for assessing the functionality of CMI) applying ELISpot technology.</description>
