  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 10% of early pregnancies can not be visualized by transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) on
      first visit and are classified as pregnancy of unknown location (PUL). The etiology includes
      ongoing intra-uterine pregnancy, failing pregnancy, or ectopic pregnancy. Early diagnosis of
      ectopic pregnancy is important because it allows conservative treatment. Serum β-hCG, D&amp;C,
      and laparoscopy are routinely used as diagnostic methods. The purpose of the study is to
      evaluate if the less invasive office hysteroscopy (HSC) can help diagnose PUL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If TVU showed no evidence of intra-uterine and extra-uterine pregnancy, a blood test for
      β-hCG was done. If β-hCG was &lt; 1000 IU/L, the woman was followed with β-hCG 2 days later.
      Women with β-hCG &gt; 1000 IU/L or abnormal β-hCG trend (increase &lt; 66% or decrease &lt; 15%) were
      offered HSC. If gestational tissues were visualized, ectopic pregnancy was ruled out.
      Otherwise, the tentative diagnosis was ectopic pregnancy.
