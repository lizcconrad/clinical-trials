  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of ertugliflozin to
      metformin monotherapy in Asian participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitis (T2DM) who have
      inadequate glycemic control on metformin monotherapy. The primary hypothesis is that the mean
      reduction from baseline in hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) for both 15 mg and 5 mg ertugliflozin is
      greater than for placebo.

      This study includes a 1-week screening period, an 8-week (or greater) antihyperglycemic agent
      (AHA) wash-off and/or metformin dose stable period, a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in
      period, a 26-week double-blind treatment period, and a post-treatment telephone contact 14
      days after the last dose of study drug.
