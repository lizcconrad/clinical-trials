      Clinical evaluation of stenfilcon A compared with narafilcon A and delefilcon A

      This is a total 120 subject, randomized, open label, bilateral wear, two week crossover study
      (each lens for 1 week) evaluating the clinical performance of stenfilcon A spherical lenses
      compared to narafilcon A or delefilcon A spherical lenses.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of stenfilcon A compared with
      narafilcon A and delefilcon A.

      The study participants will be allocated to two parallel groups (Group 1 and Group 2), 60
      subjects each, based on the control lenses, narafilcon A and delefilcon A spherical lenses.

      Study groups:

      Group 1: stenfilcon A vs. narafilcon A

      Group 2: stenfilcon A vs. delefilcon A
