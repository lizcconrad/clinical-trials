  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial phase I in healthy volunteers is intended to describe the oral
      bioavailability of the silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex by calculating the area under the
      curve (AUC0-? and AUC0-12) after administration of the same dose of oral silybin (AUCo) and
      intravenous silybin (AUC iv).

    <description>Patient will be hospitalized in the clinical trial unit in order to obtain plasma concentrations previous to the administration of the corresponding dose and at the following times post-administration: : 20min, 40min, 1h, 1h20min, 1h40min 2h, 2h30min, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h and 12h. Two more plasma concentrations will be obtained at 5 min and 10 mins post- administration of the iv dose. These measures will be calculated in order to describe the bioavailability of oral sylibinobtained in the different treatment groups.</description>
