      This phase 0 trial studies ixazomib citrate in treating patients with glioblastoma that has
      spread or returned after period of improvement who are planning to undergo surgery. When
      given by mouth, ixazomib may be able to reach tumor cells in the brain. Studying samples of
      tissue, blood, and plasma in the laboratory from patients receiving ixazomib may help doctors
      learn more about the effects of ixazomib on the cells. It may also help doctors understand
      how well patients will respond to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measurement of tissue concentration of ixazomib (ixazomib citrate) in a glioblastoma after
      preoperative administration.

      II. Measurement of blood and plasma concentration of ixazomib during surgical sampling after
      preoperative administration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assessment of the safety of ixazomib after single dose administration in glioblastoma
      patients undergoing surgery for tissue concentration assessment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ixazomib orally (PO) 3 hours before surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days and then periodically
      thereafter.

    <description>The relationship between patient's demographic, tumor and drug concentration results will be assessed with Pearson's correlation coefficient and tested with Wald's test. In addition, the mean and standard error of the concentrations will be estimated using a random-effects model to account for the within-patient correlation of the tumor biopsy samples. Given the limited number of observations, a relatively simple covariance matrix (e.g. compound symmetry) will be assumed.</description>
