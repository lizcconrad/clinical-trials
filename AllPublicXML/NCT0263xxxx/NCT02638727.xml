  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of oral L-Citrulline on endothelial
      function and vasodilation in patients with coronary artery disease(CAD) by evaluating the
      brachial artery diameter in the antecubital area by ultrasonography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before prescribing the drug or placebo, the patients were evaluated via the ultrasound
      machine equipped. The brachial artery diameter in the antecubital area was measured by the
      ultrasound and was recorded. Then blood pressure cuff was attached on the arm and dilated
      50mmhg above the systolic pressure and for 5 minutes remained the same level to induce
      ischemia at distal tissues until the occurrence of compensatory vasodilatation. Then the
      brachial artery diameter (as an estimation of FMD) was measured and recorded. After 4 minutes
      of administration of 2 puffs of nitroglycerin spray, the brachial artery diameter (as an
      estimation of NMD) was measured.

      After 15 days treatment with the L-Citrulline or the placebo, the patients underwent the
      ultrasonography again and the above assessments were done.

      Improvement of FMD to NMD ratio (before L-Citrulline prescription) to FMD to NMD ratio (after
      L-Citrulline prescription) is determined as &quot;improvement of flow mediated dilation to
      nitroglycerin dependent vasodilation&quot; evaluate.
