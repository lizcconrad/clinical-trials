  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the response of the immune system to
      bacterial components differs between patients with severe COPD compared to those with less
      severe COPD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The airways of COPD patients are often colonized with bacteria leading to increased airway
      inflammation. This study sought to determine whether systemic cytokine responses to microbial
      pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are increased among subjects with severe COPD.

      In an observational cross-sectional study of COPD subjects, PAMP-induced cytokine responses
      were measured in whole blood ex vivo. We used PAMPs derived from microbial products
      recognized by TLR 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Patterns of cytokine response to PAMPs were
      assessed using hierarchical clustering. One-sided t-tests were used to compare PAMP-induced
      cytokine levels in blood from patients with and without severe COPD, and for subjects with
      and without chronic bronchitis.

    <time_frame>This is a cross-sectional study with no follow-up period. Therefore the study outcomes were measured at the baseline visit (Time = day 0)</time_frame>
    <description>A whole blood stimulation assay was performed on blood samples from study participants. The whole blood was stimulated using several pathogen-associated molecular patterns that were agonists to seven different TLR receptors: 1) Pam3SCK4, 2) Zymosan, 3) FSL-1, 4) LPS, 5) flagellin, 6) R848. After stimulation with the PAMP, the cytokine levels (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1RA, G-CSF, IL-1B, and MCP-1) were measured and the cytokine level results are in picograms per liter. Note, there is no treatment in this observational non-interventional trial. Therefore the multiple cytokine levels for each patient will not be aggregated or summarized into one measure. This study was a small pilot study and the results are exploratory.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt;0.7

          -  FEV1 &lt; 80%

          -  &gt; 10 pack-years tobacco smoking

          -  no respiratory illnesses or prednisone or antibiotics in the last 4 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary diagnosis of asthma

          -  &gt; 15% change in FEV1

          -  Chronic inflammatory or infectious disease

          -  Cancer

          -  Autoimmune disease

          -  Chronic renal failure with a creatinine &gt; 1.5

          -  Chronic liver disease

          -  Chronic antibiotic use

        Note: Due to difficulty recruiting patients after 6 participants were enrolled, the
        exclusion criteria were modified to allow patients with &gt; 15% change in FEV1. The exclusion
        criteria were also changed to allow chronic renal failure not requiring dialysis, and
        non-metastatic cancer provided there was no diagnosis of lung cancer.
