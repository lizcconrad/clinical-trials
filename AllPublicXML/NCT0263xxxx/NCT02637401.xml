  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar Disorders (BD) typically involve repeated episodes of both depression and excessively
      high mood or irritability (hypomania or mania). BD presents considerable challenges for the
      individual, his or her supporters, and society more generally. Medication is generally
      considered to be the mainstay treatment, however a substantial number of individuals with BD
      continue to experience episodes despite use of medication. Furthermore, ongoing mood
      instability either outside of episodes, or as the main feature of their BD, is a significant
      difficulty experienced by many. Whilst studies suggest that certain psychological therapies
      can be helpful for people experiencing full bipolar episodes, or to reduce risk of future
      episodes, there are no evidencebased psychological therapies available for individuals
      experiencing ongoing mood instability. Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) was developed
      several decades ago as an approach for people with Borderline Personality Disorder. DBT aims
      to give individuals who experience rapid and intense shifts in affect skills for managing
      this. Despite the many similarities in the symptoms experienced by individuals with
      Borderline Personality Disorder and those with Bipolar Disorder only a small number of
      studies have tested DBT for BD, and no studies to date have specifically investigated DBT as
      a means to help individuals with ongoing mood instability. We have developed a version of
      groupbased DBT that draws upon our own research to adapt standard DBT for this client group
      (DBTBD).

      The group is designed to be delivered efficiently within the U.K. healthcare system whilst
      meeting the needs of individual participants through use of additional individual sessions
      and a mobile phone application. The current study investigates how acceptable DBTBD is to
      clinicians and patients, and whether - for the small number of individuals in the study
      -changes in symptoms and key ways of thinking and behaving appear to take place across the
      period of treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria for patient participants are: i) aged 18 or over; i) meets DSMV criteria
        for Bipolar Spectrum Disorder; iii) current bipolar mood instability (over the past two
        years numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic
        episode and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a
        depressive episode, continuing into the past month); iv) client wishes to engage in
        psychological therapy that focusses primarily on ongoing mood instability and its
        consequences.

        Exclusion criteria are: i) current substance dependence disorder; ii) currently receiving
        other psychological therapy; iii) the patient is currently actively suicidal; iv)
        presenting difficulties that are characteristic of Borderline Personality Disorder rather
        than Bipolar Disorder and that would be an early treatment target in standard DBT (frequent
        and serious deliberate selfharm, marked disturbance in ability to form or maintain
        interpersonal relationships); v) presence of another area of difficulty that the therapist
        and client believe should be the primary focus of intervention (for example panic disorder
        with agoraphobia, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder); vi) the information available suggests
        that the person may present a significant risk to other group members (such as aggression,
        likelihood of carrying out sexual or other exploitation); vii) the person lacks capacity to
        consent to treatment or research participation; viii) currently experiencing an episode of
        mania.
