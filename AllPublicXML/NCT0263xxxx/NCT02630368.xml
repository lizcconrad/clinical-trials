      Assessment of the efficacy and safety of JX-594 and metronomic cyclophosphamide in patients
      with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma and advanced breast cancer, once the Maximum Tolerated Dose
      have been determined (phase I trial).

      Phase I study: this is a prospective open-labeled phase I trial based on a dose escalating
      study design assessing two dose levels of JX594 when prescribed in combination with
      metronomic cyclophosphamide.

      Phase II study sarcoma: this is a monocentric, randomized two-arm non comparative phase 2
      study assessing efficacy and safety of JX-594 in association with metronomic cyclophosphamide
      in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma.

      Phase II study breast cancer: this is a monocentric, single-arm phase II study, assessing
      efficacy and safety of JX-594 in association with metronomic cyclophosphamide in patients
      with advanced breast cancer.

      For the phase I study, this is a prospective open-label phase I trial based on a dose
      escalating study design assessing two dose level of JX-594 when associated to metronomic
      cyclophosphamide.

      For the phase II study, stratum soft-tissue sarcoma, this is a monocenter, randomized non
      comparative phase II clinical trial. This phase II trial was based on an optimal 2-stage
      Simon's design. Randomization 2:1 with 2 patients randomized in experimental arm n°1
      (association of metronomic cyclophosphamide and JX-594) and 1 patient randomized in control
      arm n°2 (treatment by metronomic cyclophosphamide alone).

      For the phase II study, stratum breast cancer, this is a monocenter, one-arm phase II
      clinical trial, based on two-stage optimal Simon's design (association of metronomic
      cyclophosphamide and JX-594).
