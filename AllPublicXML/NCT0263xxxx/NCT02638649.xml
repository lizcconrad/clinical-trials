    <textblock>
      This is a pilot observational feasibility study of the ability of paramedics to assess
      thoracic ultrasound findings in the prehospital environment. The primary goal of the study is
      to determine whether paramedics are able to accurately assess for sonographic B-lines in
      patients with undifferentiated shortness of breath at least 80% of the time in the
      prehospital environment using a portable ultrasound (U/S) device.

      In the first phase of the study, a cohort of senior and supervisory paramedics will be
      recruited into the study. These paramedics would undergo didactic and hands-on training to
      learn how to operate the U/S machine, and obtain and interpret basic U/S images. The
      paramedics will then participate in video review sessions and spend time in the emergency
      department (ED) with the U/S team to get hands-on experience with patients. In the second
      phase of the study, paramedics will be staffing ambulances or fly cars in and around the
      greater New Haven region and will respond to dyspnea calls. At each call, the paramedic will
      initially evaluate the patient clinically conducting a standard history and physical exam.
      The paramedic will then use the portable U/S machine to look for the presence of either
      unilateral or bilateral B-lines indicating possible pneumonia (in the case of unilateral
      B-lines) or pulmonary edema (in the case of bilateral B-lines). The paramedic will then
      document the presence or absence of B-lines for each lung on the prehospital study sheet. The
      paramedic will then use the U/S to evaluate for the presence of pleural effusions, lung
      sliding and pericardial effusion.

    <measure>Accuracy of Paramedics' assessments of ultrasound for unilateral or bilateral B-lines</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The paramedic will use the portable U/S machine to look for the presence of either unilateral/bilateral B-lines indicating possible pneumonia (unilateral B-lines) or pulmonary edema (bilateral B-lines). The paramedic will document the presence or absence of B-lines for each lung on the prehospital study sheet. The attending ED physician will be notified of the enrolled patient and, blinded to the paramedic's interpretation, will then conduct the same U/S study and document their findings and the final diagnosis of the patient using the patient's name, birthdate and MRN (Medical Record Number) on the ED study sheet. An U/S expert, blinded to the patient's diagnosis, the U/S operator, and confirmatory imaging, will review the recorded images obtained in the prehospital setting. The expert's interpretation of the images will be confirmed by a second expert for at least 15 % of the cases. The goal is 80% accuracy. The accuracy will be evaluated up to 12 months after the U/S is taken.</description>

    <measure>Accuracy of Paramedics' assessments of ultrasound for interpretation of lung sliding, pleural effusions, and pericardial effusions.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The paramedic will use the U/S to evaluate for the presence of pleural effusions, lung sliding and pericardial effusion. The attending ED physician will be notified of the enrolled patient and, without knowing the paramedic's interpretation, will then conduct the same U/S study and document his or her findings and the final diagnosis of the patient using the patient's name, birthdate and MRN on the ED study sheet. An U/S expert, blinded to the patient's diagnosis, the U/S operator, and confirmatory imaging, will review the recorded images obtained in the prehospital setting. The expert's interpretation of the images will be confirmed by a second expert for at least 15 % of the cases. The goal is 80% accuracy. The accuracy will be evaluated up to 12 months after the ultrasound has been taken.</description>
