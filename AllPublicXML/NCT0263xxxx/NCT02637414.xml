      This protocol proposes a well-being program, delivered through an application for mobile
      devices, based on meditation and positive psychology principles such as human development,
      the improvement of virtues, quality of life and well-being. The investigators hypothesize
      that this program offered in mobile application may promote well-being and reduce stress
      related problems in the participants.

      Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a well-being program delivered through an
      application for mobile devices in a sample of employees who work in a company (Natura
      Inovação/Cosméticos) and in a hospital (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein).

      Methods: Two hundred and fifty employees from Natura Inovação/Cosméticos and 250 employees
      from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein will be recruited. The participants will be
      randomized in two groups of 125 participants each one, half of them in the control group (GC)
      and the other half to the intervention group (GI), by institution.

      Introduction: Stress related disorders may result in absenteeism and less productivity in
      companies. This protocol proposes a well-being program, delivered through an application for
      mobile devices, based on meditation and positive psychology principles such as human
      development, the improvement of virtues, quality of life and well-being. In the modern world
      not all people are willing to attend classroom training for several reasons. In this sense,
      the investigators hypothesize that this program offered in mobile application may promote
      well-being and reduce stress related problems in the participants.

      Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a well-being program delivered through an
      application for mobile devices in a sample of employees who work in a company (Natura
      Inovação/Cosméticos) and in a hospital (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein).

      Methods: Two hundred and fifty employees from Natura Inovação/Cosméticos and 250 employees
      from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein will be recruited. The participants will be
      randomized in two groups of 125 participants each one, half of them in the control group (GC)
      and the other half to the intervention group (GI), by institution. The GI will participate in
      the Flourishing App Program, for eight weeks, while the GC will have access to a Control App.
      Then, after the evaluations, the GC will receive the intervention (Flourishing App Program),
      while the first group will not receive any intervention. Questions will be applied to
      evaluate the levels of stress and well-being of participants before and after the program and
      before and after each training period.
