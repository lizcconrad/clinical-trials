  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of rituximab,
      lenalidomide, and ibrutinib, when given alone and with standard chemotherapy (called either
      &quot;EPOCH&quot; - Etoposide, Prednisone, Oncovin [vincristine], Cyclophosphamide, and
      Hydrodaunorubicin [doxorubicin]; or &quot;R-CHOP&quot; - Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Hydrodaunorubicin
      [doxorubicin], Oncovin [vincristine], and Prednisone), can help to control diffuse large B
      cell lymphoma. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Ibrutinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of certain types of patients (patients with mantle cell lymphoma [MCL] or
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] who have received at least 1 earlier therapy, CLL patients
      with certain genetic mutations, and patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia [WM]).

      Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of MCL in patients
      who have received 2 therapies before, multiple myeloma (MM), and myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS). Rituximab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and certain types of leukemia. EPOCH and R-CHOP are FDA approved and
      commercially available for their use on this study. The use of all these drugs in combination
      is investigational.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle will be 21 days.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive up to 2 cycles
      of rituximab, ibrutinib, and lenalidomide. In each of these cycles, you will receive
      rituximab by vein over about 4-6 hours on Day 1. You will take ibrutinib (up to four [4]
      capsules) by mouth 1 time every day. You will take lenalidomide by mouth 1 time every day on
      Days 1-10 of each cycle. You should take the capsules at about the same time each day, with
      about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water. You should swallow the capsules whole; do not open, break,
      or chew them.

      At the end of each cycle, you should bring your pill bottle(s) to the clinic so the study
      staff can count the number of pills, if any, that are leftover.

      After the first 2 cycles, you will begin to receive either EPOCH or R-CHOP. The doctor will
      decide which of these standard treatments you will receive, based on what he/she thinks is in
      your best interest.

      If you receive EPOCH, in these cycles, you will continue to receive rituximab, ibrutinib, and
      lenalidomide as described above, as well as:

        -  Etoposide by vein over 24 hours on Days 1-4 of each cycle.

        -  Prednisone by mouth 1 time each day on Days 1-5 of each cycle.

        -  Oncovin (vincristine) by vein over 24 hours on Days 1-4 of each cycle.

        -  Cyclophosphamide by vein over about 1 hour on Day 5 of each cycle.

        -  Hydrodaunorubicin (doxorubicin) by vein over 24 hours on Days 1-4 of each cycle.

      If you receive R-CHOP, in these cycles, you will continue to receive rituximab, ibrutinib,
      and lenalidomide as described above, as well as:

        -  Cyclophosphamide by vein over about 1 hour on Day 1 of each cycle.

        -  Doxorubicin by vein over about 1 hour on Day 1 of each cycle.

        -  Vincristine by vein over about 1 hour on Day 1 of each cycle.

        -  Prednisone by mouth on Days 1-5 of each cycle.

      Study Visits

      Within 3 days before the beginning of each cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. If you can
           become pregnant, part of this sample will be used for a pregnancy test.

      Before Cycles 2 and 3, blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn to test for a fungal
      infection.

      At the end of Cycles 2 and 4, you will have an FDG-PET/CT scan to check the status of the
      disease. This may be performed earlier if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

      During Cycles 3-8, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn 2 times every week for routine
      tests.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive the study drugs for up to a total of 8 cycles. You will no longer be able to
      take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you
      are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 3-4 weeks after you start the last cycle, you will have an End-of-Treatment visit. The
      following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an FDG-PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy to check the
           status of the disease.

      Follow-Up:

      Every 3 months for 1 year after the End-of-Treatment visit, and then every 4 months for 1
      year after that:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a CT scan or an FDG-PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.
