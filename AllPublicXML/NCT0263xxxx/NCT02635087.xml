  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators discover the investigators' miRNA tool can be a useful tool to predict the
      patients with stage II colon who can benefit from chemotherapy.Then the investigators plan to
      make an observation study that may validation this tool.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observation study. The investigators recruit patients who agree to use their
      postoperative specimen for miRNA tool examination and receive the investigators' follow
      up.Their receiving chemotherapy or not will decided by their doctors. The investigators just
      see whether the stratifying tool could predict prognosis.

    <description>patients to be assessed by the miRNA tool. MicroRNA tool contains miRNA of miR-21、miR-20a-5p、miR-103a-3p、miR-106b-5p、miR-143-5p and miR-215. Investigators evaluate these miRNA status of surgical specimens using qRT-PCR and calculate their risk score(risk score =(0.108×status of miR-21-5p)+(0.086×status of miR-20a-5p)+(0.240×status of miR-103a-3p)+(0.095×status of miR-106b-5p)- (0.238×status of miR-143-5p)-(0.237×status of miR-215),low expression status equals 0 and high expression status equals 1.Then we determine the patients who with a score higher than 1 as exposed patient.</description>
