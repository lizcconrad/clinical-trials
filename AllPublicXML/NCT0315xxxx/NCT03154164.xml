  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims at analyzing the learning curve for fundus first with the ultrasonic
      tissue coagulation dissection technique in elective cholecystectomy. Patients included in the
      study are planned for an elective cholecystectomy, on the basis of the gallstone disease. All
      participating surgeons have experience of the traditional approach with electrocautery. The
      operation time as well as the surgeons own evaluation of difficulty and performance are
      noted. Selected films are analyzed by independent surgeons with experience of the fundus
      first technique. The Swedish registry of gallstone surgery and ERCP (GallRiks) are used to
      record the intra and postoperative complication rate.

      The present study aims at analyzing the learning curve for fundus first with the ultrasonic
      tissue coagulation dissection technique in elective cholecystectomy. Patients included in the
      study are planned for an elective cholecystectomy, on the basis of the gallstone disease. All
      participating surgeons have experience of the traditional approach with electrocautery, but
      limited experience from gallstone surgery with ultrasonic tissue coagulation dissection.

      The operation time as well as the surgeons own evaluation of difficulty and performance are
      noted. Selected video recordings are analyzed by independent surgeons with experience of the
      fundus first technique. The Swedish registry of gallstone surgery and ERCP (GallRiks) are
      used to record the intra and postoperative complication rate. The study is intended to serve
      as a pilot study for a subsequent randomised controlled trial, comparing surgery with
      electrocautery and ultrasonic tissue coagulation dissection.
