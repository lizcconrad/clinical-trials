      The objective of my study will be to assess and compare between two different approaches for
      placement of self- inflating osmotic tissue expanders used as preparatory surgery before
      alveolar ridge augmentation using autogenous onlay block bone graft.

      The assessment and comparison will be based on:

        1. Change in edentulous alveolar ridge in bucco-lingual dimension after alveolar

           ridge augmentation.

        2. Quantity of the soft tissue obtained after soft tissue expansion.

      -  Sixteen patients will be selected from the outpatient clinic of the department of, Oral
           medicine Periodontology, and oral diagnosis, Faculty of Dentistry, Ain Shams University.

        -  Three surgeries will be carried out for each patient; the first is placement of soft
           tissue expander, the second surgery is bone grafting and placement of collagen membrane
           for ridge augmentation while the third (re-entry surgery) is implant placement in a
           routine fashion.

        -  Measurements and evaluation of edentulous ridge will be done by CBCT

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients should have partially edentulous ridge (missing upper one or two
             neighboring anterior teeth or premolars) of the maxilla. The edentulous area should
             require horizontal bone augmentation procedures owing to lack of sufficient residual
             bone.

          -  All patients should not have any particular medical history (medically free) according
             to Burket health medical history questionnaire (Glick et al.2008).

          -  All patients should not have any known contraindication to oral surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Smokers will be excluded from our study.

          -  Patients with poor oral hygiene or not willing to perform oral hygiene measures.

          -  Patients who showed residual infections in the edentulous area or apparent infection
             in a neighboring tooth.

          -  Patients with systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and hemorrhagic disorders,
             patients receiving intravenous bisphosphonate therapy or systemic corticosteroid
             treatment.

          -  Patients with occlusal discrepancies will be excluded.

          -  Vulnerable groups (as pregnant and lactating females, and decisionaly impaired
             individuals) will be excluded from the study.
