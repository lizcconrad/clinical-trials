    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate whether a simple intervention improves the physical
      functioning and reduce mortality after surgery for elderly hip fracture patients in a period
      of one year follow up. We hypothesized that the postoperative intervention program decreases
      the mortality in one year and improves mobility.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial designed as a prospective intervention and a
      historical control group from the previous three months admitted operated hip fracture
      patients from another study and with bone mineral density and measurement of weight and
      height done. The study will include patients of both sexes, 50 years and older, after their
      approval to participate and applying exclusion criteria. A baseline assessment will be done
      for the included hip fracture patients, who will be admitted to Trauma Unit of Assiut
      University Hospitals and will be surgically treated for a period of 1 year. The exclusion
      criteria include patients with major accidents, polytrauma, pathological fractures and
      bilateral hip fractures. Also patients with thyroid malfunctions, renal diseases, cardiac
      diseases, long term immobilization, liver diseases and musculoskeletal disorders. Two
      well-trained nurses will carry out the personal interviews in the Trauma Unit ward with each
      patient and/or patients 'relatives using a structured questionnaire. Data collection will be
      done after providing informed consent.

      Bone mineral density, weight and height for every patient will be done. The follow up phone
      calls will be done for every patient at 3 months, 6 months and one year postoperative.

      Intervention group:

      Patients in the intervention Group will be provided with postoperative health education
      intervention program, which includes nutrition education for improving general and bone
      health and physical exercise training for the patient and his relative before discharge.

      This group will receive the usual care prior to the start of intervention and participating
      in the study.

      The phone calls will include questions about: if the patient is alive or not. If not,
      subsequent detailed questions about causes and timing of death will be filled in.

      If the patient is alive, subsequent questions about nutrition, commodities and physical
      activity will be filled in. Assessment of physical activity will be done by the Western
      Ontario And McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC).

      The aim of the study is to investigate whether a simple intervention improves the physical
      functioning and reduce mortality after surgery for elderly hip fracture patients in a period
      of one year follow up. We hypothesized that the postoperative intervention program decreases
      the mortality in one year and improves mobility.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial designed as a prospective intervention and a
      historical control group from the previous three months admitted operated hip fracture
      patients from another study and with bone mineral density and measurement of weight and
      height done.

      The study will include patients of both sexes, 50 years and older, after their approval to
      participate and applying exclusion criteria. A baseline assessment will be done for the
      included hip fracture patients, who will be admitted to Trauma Unit of Assiut University
      Hospitals and will be surgically treated for a period of 1 year. We aim to minimize other
      factors that affect the intervention program compliance and could increase the mortality. The
      exclusion criteria include patients with major accidents, polytrauma, pathological fractures
      and bilateral hip fractures. Also patients with thyroid malfunctions, renal diseases, cardiac
      diseases, long term immobilization, liver diseases and musculoskeletal disorders.

      Two well-trained nurses will carry out the personal interviews in the Trauma Unit ward with
      each patient and/or patients 'relatives using a structured questionnaire. Data collection
      will be done after providing informed consent. The questionnaire for baseline data includes
      sociodemographic characteristics such as name, sex, and age, associated comorbidities and
      some nutrition habits. The nutrition habits in pre and post intervention will be evaluated by
      the dietary history qualitative subjective method using closed ended questions [1].

      Bone mineral density (BMD) evaluation and anthropometric measurements:

      BMD measurements will be assessed as soon as possible postoperative for all participants by
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan of the femoral neck, using GE Lunar, GE
      Healthcare, USA.

      From the measured BMD, sex-specific T scores will be calculated. All DEXA measurements will
      be carried out by one machine and the interpretations by the same radiologist. The criteria
      recommended by the International Osteoporosis Foundation and the World Health Organization
      were used to assess BMD and to determine the prevalence of osteoporosis. BMD will be assessed
      according to T score and classified to three groups as normal (T score ≥ −1 SD), osteopenic
      (T score from −1 to −2.5 SD), or osteoporotic (T score ≤ −2.5SD) [2]. Height while lying down
      without shoes and weight will be measured while the patients were dressed in light clothes.
      Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from the height and weight will be recorded while
      performing the DEXA scan. The BMI will be calculated based on the formula: weight
      (kg)/[height (m)]2. The standard categorization of BMI by Center for Disease Control and
      Prevention (CDC) indicates less than 18.5 as underweight, 18.5-24.9 as normal, 25.0-29.9 as
      overweight, and 30.0 and above as obese [3].

      The data collectors will include patients from the prior three months that their DEXA and
      anthropometric measurements in addition to their telephone numbers were available, while the
      equal number of patients will be prospectively included in the intervention group during the
      period of the study.

      An independent investigator, who will not involved with recruitment or data collection, a
      trained another team on the intervention program to conduct it for every selected patient.

      The follow up phone calls will be done for every patient at 3 months, 6 months and one year
      postoperative. All calls will be done by one assessor; who will not be blinded to group
      allocation as the patients mentioned the intervention program during phone calls.

      Intervention group:

      Patients in the intervention Group (IG) will be provided with postoperative health education
      intervention program, which includes nutrition education for improving general and bone
      health and physical exercise training for the patient and his relative before discharge.

      The Intervention Protocol:

      Each patient and a family member will receive a 10-minute explanation about postoperative
      nutrition and physical exercise during their postoperative hospital stay. In addition, the
      patients will receive an explanatory leaflet of the health education messages to assure their
      continuity to follow the instructions after hospital discharge. Nutrition instructions
      includes instructions about habits and foods that augment calcium and vitamin D requirements
      and general health. All foods are public and inexpensive. For example increase the intake of
      milk products and eggs. Increase the duration of exposure to sun light will be advised. They
      will receive education messages about factors decreasing the calcium absorption as drinks
      with excess caffeine and carbonated soft.

      Control group:

      This group will receive the usual care prior to the start of intervention and participating
      in the study. Usual care is what the patient receives as part of the hospital standard care.
      Prescription of calcium and vitamin D will be done for all patients. No specific personal
      communication regarding nutrition or physical activity will be provided.

      Follow up phone calls after intervention:

      The phone calls with both groups will be done at 3 months, 6 months and one year
      postoperative by one assessor, A follow up questionnaire will be filled in by the assessor
      from the patient or his relative, who is responsible for the patient's care. The
      questionnaire consists of three sections, the first one is asking about the patient if she/he
      is alive or not. If she/he died, reason for death and duration from the operation till death
      will be inquired. The second section will be about the preoperative conditions as duration
      between the fracture and the index surgery and postoperative hospital stay. Also questions
      about the postoperative complications and health problems (pulmonary, cardiac,
      cerebrovascular stoke, urinary tract infections, depression and others). The third section is
      about applying the nutrition guides as stop smoking and drinking milk, eating cheese, yogurt
      and eggs. Regular intake of calcium and vitamin D supplements will be asked about.
      Maintenance and regularity of physical activity as in the provided instructions of the
      intervention postoperative care program.

      Assessment of physical activity will be done by the Western Ontario And McMaster Universities
      Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). The WOMAC has been validated for telephone assessment [4]. The
      WOMAC is available in over 65 alternate language forms, including Arabic [5], to assess pain,
      stiffness, and physical function in patients with hip and / or knee osteoarthritis (OA). The
      WOMAC consists of 24 items divided into 3 sub scales: 1- Pain (5 items): during walking,
      using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing. 2- Stiffness (2 items): morning
      stiffness after waking up and later in the day. 3- Physical Function includes 17 items. A
      total WOMAC score is created by summing the items for all three sub scales. Higher scores on
      the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations. Each item score ranged
      from 0-4 with total score of 96 (100%). Time to score was 10-15 minutes.

      Statistical analysis will be carried out using the Statistical Package for the Social
      Sciences version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, US).
