  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonstandard time-schedules work are widespread in the world of work. Shift and night work
      have been shown to be responsible for a desynchronization of biological rhythms, associated
      with melatonin secretion impairment and sleep disturbances. However, while health
      consequences of night and shift work are widely recognized and represent a major public
      health concern (High Authority of Health 2012 Recommendations and National Agency for Public
      Health Food, Environment and Work 2016 Report), the mechanisms by which the circadian system
      is affected by shift work remain poorly understood. Indeed most of the studies in the fields
      are cross-sectional, based on few blood or urinary samples in a single work position, in
      workers whose shift work patterns are often misidentified and heterogeneous. Moreover, few
      studies have assessed melatonin secretion alterations in relation to objective sleep
      measurement (actigraphy). The aim of this study is to assess the dynamics of melatonin
      secretion adaptation in 12-hour shift work and to correlate these data to sleep-wake cycle
      recording.

    <description>The study will take place over 15 days during which the nurses will wear an actigraphic wristband and will fulfill a sleep log. During 3 periods of 24 hours selected during these 15 days, including a 12h day shift (Day 2), a 12h night shift (Day 8) and a rest (Day 13), the participants will collect their urine by 4 to 8 hour periods, note the corresponding urine volumes and for each period, sample a 5 mL tube which will be analyzed later (6-sulfatoxymelatonin and urinary cortisol assays). The subjects will complete questionnaires at the beginning of the study (Horne and Ostberg, Insomnia Severity Index, Epworth, Pichot, Hospital Anxiety and Depression) and the days corresponding to the urine sampling (Karolinska and St Mary Hospital).</description>
