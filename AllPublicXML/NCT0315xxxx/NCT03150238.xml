  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project will consist of a multicentre, prospective, observational study with a total
      duration of 24 months. Clinical, endoscopic and ultrasound data will be collected in a
      dedicated database (on IG-IBD Register), which will be used to identify potential clinical,
      endoscopic and ultrasound risk factors of re-operation. These data could be merged into a
      shared score, to stratify patients according to the risk of post-surgical re- operation and
      to define an optimal therapeutic management in the post- operative period. Approximately 220
      adult patients, with a defined diagnosis of CD, who underwent a surgery for CD in the
      previous 6 months will be enrolled.

      Patients will be consecutively enrolled in this prospective cross-sectional study, during the
      first 12 months, and then followed for 12 (minimum) up to 24(maximum) months, depending on
      date of patients' enrolment (total study length: 2 years). Patients will be stratified
      according to risk factors and type of treatment carried out in that year
