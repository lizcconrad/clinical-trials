  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Foot ulceration is a common and costly complication of diabetes. GSK1278863 is a topical
      drug, which is being developed to treat wounds associated with DFU. The aim of this study is
      to explore the symptoms and impacts of DFU from the subject perspective and to elicit
      in-depth information about DFU signs and symptoms, impacts on functioning and health-related
      quality of life (HRQoL). Adult DFU subjects with current or recent (within last six months)
      neuropathic foot ulcers will be eligible to participate in this prospective, cross-sectional
      interview study. Approximately 20 DFU subjects will be recruited from up to three clinical
      sites. Potential subjects will be pre-screened and then contacted to gauge interest in the
      study. Interested subjects will be screened and eligible subjects will consent to release
      contact information to research staff. Research staff will contact the subject to schedule
      interviews. This study will include concept elicitation interviews over the telephone or
      in-person by trained and experienced interviewers. In-person interviews will be conducted in
      a private room at the clinical site. All interviews will be conducted in English and will be
      guided by semi-structured interview guides. All subjects will provide written consent prior
      to the start of the interview.

    <description>An iterative and thematic analytic approach will be applied to the concept elicitation data in order to identify key concepts related to DFU signs and symptoms, impacts on functioning and HRQoL. Concepts that emerge from the analysis will be tracked using a saturation matrix and will be recorded until saturation is attained, or at the point when no new concepts have emerged from the data. Transcripts produced from the subject and expert interview audio recordings will be analyzed using qualitative analysis software in order to identify themes emerging from the data while accounting for information gleaned from the review of literature.</description>
