  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. 17.5 million people died
      in 2012 due to a cerebrovascular disease (31% of all causes of death). In Europe more than
      50% of deaths are due to cardiovascular disease. The mortality rate for cardiovascular
      disease is higher in the lower socio-economic levels. Three-quarters of deaths from
      cardiovascular disease occur in developing countries. According to estimates in 2030,
      cardiovascular disease will be responsible for more deaths than the sum of infectious,
      nutritional, maternal and perinatal diseases in developing countries.

      Measures to prevent cardiovascular risk factors have been shown to be effective.

      The lack of an adequate primary care network in developing countries limits the screening and
      treatment of patients with cardiovascular risk factors. As a result, these patients do not
      benefit from adequate prevention, are diagnosed late and remain disabled or die at a young
      age, resulting in significant additional costs for families but also at the macroeconomic
      level.

      Interventions are possible on a large scale (policies against tobacco and adverse dietary
      behavior, promote physical activity, etc.). Actions are possible on an individual level, both
      in primary prevention (control of cardiovascular risk factors) and secondary prevention,
      where many treatments have proved their effectiveness. These interventions are effective and
      cost-effective from a macroeconomic perspective. It was estimated that the cost of such
      interventions would not exceed 4% of health expenditure in developing countries and 1-2% in
      rich countries.

      The World Health Organization insists on the importance of the triad composed by the patient
      and his family, community and health professionals. Results are possible only when these
      three components work together for the same purpose. Numerous studies show the benefit of the
      involvement of patients in their care in the rich countries and in the developing countries.

    <textblock>
      This project builds on advances in the treatment of HIV / AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa and in
      chronic disease management through the WHO Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions Framework.

      These projects emerged from the observation that the rich country model of care
      (patient-centered, hospital-centered and specialist approach with regular clinical and
      paraclinic follow-up) was not transferable to developing countries, The limitation of human,
      technical and financial resources.

      A paradigm shift is needed to improve cardiovascular disease control in a more cost-effective
      manner.

      The SPICES project plans to integrate the current knowledge of new studies to improve the
      prevention and control of cardiovascular disease in high-, middle-, and low-income countries.

      Rich countries and developing countries will therefore be involved in the study: the selected
      sites are France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, South Africa and Uganda.

      This study is a stage of observation in the different countries which will make it possible
      to make an inventory of the places and to target the most adapted interventions.

      The main objective is to define the representations on cardiovascular prevention and the
      follow up of patients with cardiovascular disease or FDRCV.

      The secondary objectives are to identify:

        -  the brakes in the management of patients with CVD or FDRCV

        -  the institutional care network for these patients

        -  Identify the &quot;informal&quot; care network, that is, family and community caregivers and
           within them the potential barriers and facilitators to their care.
