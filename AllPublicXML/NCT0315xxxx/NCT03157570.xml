  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies with exercise intervention aimed to improve the bone health and muscle functions in
      patients with AIS were lacking. Evidence suggested that low bone mass and low muscle mass
      were associated with curve severity and occurrence of AIS. Weight-bearing exercise that aimed
      to improve musculoskeletal and metabolic health could enhance bone health and muscle mass,
      and could provide a feasible alternative conservative treatment to prevent curve progression
      as well as the quality of life in AIS girls. This is a pilot feasibility study for future
      large randomized controlled trial (RCT) aiming at determining the effects of home based
      exercise program on improving bone mineral density (BMD), muscle mass and functions, quality
      of life (QoL), and prevent curve progression in skeletally immature girls with adolescent
      idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).

    <description>Aerobic fitness (estimated VO2max) of the subjects will be measured using sing-stage cycle ergometer sub-maximal test. Participants will be asked to sit on a cycle ergometer with 3-5 min warm up cycling at 150 kgm/min (25 Watt) workload, then workload will increase to 450-600 kgm/min (75-100 Watt) for another 6 minutes, in order to stimulate a submaximal exercise heart rate between 125-170 bpm. Estimated VO2max is then computed from the Astrand formula: VO2max = (workload x 2 + 300) * (200 - 73) / (exercise heart rate - 73)&quot;. Safety guidelines and procedures recommended by the ACSM will be followed.</description>

    <description>Evaluation of habitual dietary intake will be based on retrospective means of assessment. A modified Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) based on data obtained in the Hong Kong Adult Dietary Survey in 1995 will be used. The FFQ had been validated with the basal metabolic rate calculation and the 24-hour sodium/creatinine and potassium/creatinine analysis. Subjects will be asked about their usual frequency and consumption in the past twelve months from the food list. Standard portion size will be listed and a food photo album is provided to assist assessment. Any use of supplements will also be recorded. Daily nutrient intake is calculated by the Food Processor Nutrition analysis and Fitness software version 8.0 (Esha Research, Salem, USA), with addition of composition of some local foods based on food composition table from China.</description>
