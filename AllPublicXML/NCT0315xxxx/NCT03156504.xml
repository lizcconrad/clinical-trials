  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if the medication known as ketamine can
      help the symptoms of depression. This drug is approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) but the investigators will use it for a non-FDA approved reason (depression).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll 100 adults with treatment-resistant unipolar or bipolar major
      depression (TRD) across 7 clinical sites and provide three IV ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg,
      infused over 100 minutes) and measure their depressive symptom responses. Biomarkers will be
      developed using blood samples from study subjects, taken prior to (predictive biomarkers) and
      following ketamine treatment (change biomarkers). The investigators will begin by studying
      the predictive value of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) target engagement by ketamine
      using a white blood cell (WBC) assay for antidepressive response to ketamine (Aim 1);
      however, samples will be used to develop multiple blood-based biomarkers for ketamine
      antidepressive effects (Aim 2). The investigators will also examine the effect of combining
      multiple blood-based biomarkers for predicting antidepressive response to ketamine in adults
      with TRD (Aim 3).

      Baseline WBC markers of impaired cellular energy regulation will be associated with measures
      of clinical response to ketamine (predictive biomarker). Changes in WBC markers of impaired
      cellular energy regulation will be associated with clinical response to ketamine (change
      biomarker).

    <description>The Montgomery Åsberg Depression Scale (MÅDRS) is a 10-item observer rating scale assessing symptoms of depression. The score ranges from 0 (no depression) to 60 (very depressed). For this study a score of less than or equal to 9 was considered clinical remission of depression.</description>
