      To investigate the frequency and clinical significance of Homologous Recombination Deficiency
      (HRD) in Japanese patients with ovarian cancer (including Fallopian tube cancer and primary
      peritoneal cancer).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators plan to clarify the frequency of Homologous Recombination
      Deficiency (HRD) in Japanese patients with ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube cancer
      and primary peritoneal cancer).

      And investigators will also investigate whether HRD-positive ovarian cancer patients show the
      clinical characteristics of highly platinum-sensitivity and good prognosis, comparing to
      HRD-negative ovarian cancer patients.

      In addition, it is planned to investigate any association between Progression Free Survival
      (PFS) / Platinum-Sensitivity and germline mutation in Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene
      (BRCA1/2 gene) in ovarian cancer patients who can provide the patients' gBRCA1/2 gene
      information for this study.

    <description>When all tumor samples are stored at ToMMo after the term of registration, DNA are extracted from frozen tumor tissue. These extracted tumor DNA, after confirmed at inspection body that it has constant qualities, are examined for HRD by DNA target sequencing.</description>

    <measure>Association between Progression Free Survival (PFS) / Response Rate and HRD in patients with ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer)</measure>

    <description>PFS is calculated from registration date to the date diagnosed as progression or the date of death from any cause, whichever comes earlier. Response rate(RR) is determined the rate of patients who are evaluated of best overall response as CR(complete response) or PR(partial response) from those with measurable disease (based on Guidelines to Evaluate the Response to Treatment in Solid Tumors, RESIST).
Association between PFS/RR and HRD which is clarified as primary outcome is assessed.</description>

    <time_frame>48 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is calculated from registration date diagnosed as having progression or the date of death from any cause, whichever comes earlier. Response rate(RR) is determined the rate of patients who are evaluated of best overall response as CR(complete response) or PR(partial response) from those with measurable disease (based on Guidelines to Evaluate the Response to Treatment in Solid Tumors, RESIST).
Association between PFS/RR and gBRCA1/2 gene information from patients who can provide their gBCRA1/2 gene information with their informed consent, is evaluated.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who can approve informed consent and sign it. Patients who show their will to
             participate in this study and can sign the informed consent forms by themselves.

          2. Patients who are clinically diagnosed as having ovarian cancer and can provide written
             informed consent before the surgery.

          3. Patients who can provide tumor tissue specimens. (except ascites cytology and cell
             block specimens)

          4. Patients who are 20 years old and over at the enrollment.

          5. Patients with ECOG Performance status (PS): 0-2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with active concomitant malignancy* except breast cancer.

             *Includes synchronous multiple cancer and metachronous multiple cancer with less than
             5 years of disease free survival. However, excludes skin basal cell carcinoma, skin
             squamous cell carcinoma, and any other curable lesions with local therapy such as
             carcinoma in situ or intramucosal carcinoma.

          2. Patients who are diagnosed as any other acute/chronic, physically/mentally severe
             diseases and judged by the primary physician as inappropriate to enroll this study
             because of safety reasons or any influence to study outcomes.

          3. Any other cases that are inappropriate to enroll this study, judged by study principal
             investigator.
