  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for extended use of ModraDoc006/r in patients with advanced solid tumours,
      available after completed treatment in one of the phase I trials with ModraDoc006/r. The
      primary goal is to explore the safety of extended use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label extended use programme, designed to make extended use treatment with
      weekly ModraDoc006/r available for patients who completed treatment in one of the phase I
      trials with ModraDoc006/r, who might have clinical benefit of continued treatment with the
      oral docetaxel formulation.

      Patients will receive oral docetaxel (as ModraDoc006 10 mg tablets) and ritonavir (100 mg
      tablet) once- or bi-daily, once a week in a fasted condition. Treatment can be continued
      weekly as long as the patient experiences clinical benefit from the treatment as judged by
      the treating oncologist, unless unacceptable toxicity despite dose modifications and
      supportive measures occurs.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histological or cytological proof of cancer

          2. Patients who might benefit from a weekly (oral) docetaxel regime as judged by the
             treating oncologist.

          3. Patients who received treatment with ModraDoc006/r with acceptable safety (as judged
             by the PI; for criteria see below in section 3 of exclusion criteria) in phase I
             trials with ModraDoc006/r, including (but not limited to) the N15FED (food-interaction
             study), N16AED (absorption-excretion study), N16DOL (normal or impaired liver
             function). A maximum delay of 21 days between the last dose in the previous phase I
             trial and the first dose in the N17DEX is allowed.

          4. Age ≥ 18 years

          5. WHO performance status of 0, 1 or 2;

          6. Minimal acceptable laboratory values defined as:

               1. ANC of ≥ 1.5 x 109 /L

               2. Platelet count of ≥ 100 x 109 /L

               3. Renal function as defined by serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance
                  ≥ 50 ml/min (by Cockcroft-Gault formula)

               4. Hepatic function as defined by serum bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN, ALAT and ASAT ≤ 5.0 x
                  ULN, except for patients who have been treated in the N16DOL study.

          7. Negative pregnancy test (urine/serum) for female patients with childbearing potential,
             assessed at the screening visit of the previous phase I trial with ModraDoc006/r.

          8. Able and willing to swallow oral medication

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concomitant use of MDR and CYP3A modulating drugs such as Ca+-entry blockers
             (verapamil, dihydropyridines), cyclosporine, quinidine, quinine, tamoxifen, megestrol
             and grapefruit juice, concomitant use of HIV medications; other protease inhibitors,
             (non) nucleoside analogs, St. John's wort or macrolide antibiotics.

          2. Symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Patients with brain
             metastases are allowed if they received adequate treatment, are asymptomatic in the
             absence of corticosteroid therapy and anticonvulsant therapy for at least 6 weeks.
             Radiotherapy for brain metastases must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to
             start of study treatment.

          3. Clinically significant safety issues during previous therapy with ModraDoc006/r as
             judged by the PI, which cannot be solved by dose reduction and/or treatment delay.

          4. Unreliable contraceptive methods. Both men and women using ModraDoc006/r must agree to
             use a reliable contraceptive method throughout the study (adequate contraceptive
             methods are: condom, sterilization, other barrier contraceptive measures preferably in
             combination with condoms).

          5. Anti-cancer therapy or any treatment with investigational drugs other than
             ModraDoc006/r between the completion of the phase I trial with ModraDoc006/r and the
             start of extended use of ModraDoc006/r Palliative radiation on limited field is
             allowed.

          6. Uncontrolled infectious disease or known Human Immunodeficiency Virus HIV-1 or HIV-2
             type patients. Patients with a known history of hepatitis B or C.

             judged by the treating physician.

          8. Patients with known alcoholism, drug addiction and/or psychiatric of physiological
             condition which in the opinion of the investigator would impair study compliance;
             Evidence of any other disease, neurological or metabolic dysfunction, physical
             examination finding or laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or
             condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or puts the patient
             at high risk for treatment-related complications.
