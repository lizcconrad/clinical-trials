  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of a combination of investigational new
      drug called BL-8040 and atezolizumab to find out what effects, good or bad, this treatment
      has on medical condition. Atezolizumab is manufactured by Roche and is approved by FDA for
      other indications while BL-8040 is in late stages of clinical development. This is an
      investigational study. Approximately 60 patients will take part at multiple centers
      worldwide. It is an open-label study, which means that both subjects and the doctors will
      know which treatment you are receiving. All participants in the study will receive the
      investigational drug, BL-8040, both alone and in combination with atezolizumab. In other
      words, there will be no placebo (dummy drug).

      The duration of the treatment period of the study will be up to 2 years and will be followed
      by one year safety follow up. The study will consist of:

        -  a screening period of 21 days to allow your doctor to assess your suitability for
           enrollment into the study

        -  a treatment period of combination regimen of 21 day cycles for up to 2 years

        -  a follow-up period of up to 30 days after completion of combined treatment with BL-8040
           + Atezolizumab

        -  an additional follow up period for up to one year after the completion of the treatment
