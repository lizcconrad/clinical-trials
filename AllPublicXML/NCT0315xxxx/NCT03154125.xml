  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and
      acceptability of Sayana® Press when injected every 4 months (17-18 weeks) for 3 treatment
      cycles (12 months) of use.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, partially-blinded, multi-center, parallel-group study to evaluate the
      effectiveness, PK, safety, and acceptability of Sayana® Press when injected every 4 months
      (17-18 weeks) rather than the currently prescribed 3-month (12-14 weeks) regimen.

      A total of 750 healthy, sexually active women aged 18 to 35 years with regular menstrual
      cycles and no DMPA use in the previous 12 months will be enrolled and followed for pregnancy.
      Among all enrolled, 710 will be randomized to receive injections in the abdomen or upper
      thigh in accordance with the PATH Sayana® injection instructions, which are consistent with
      prescribing information, for the primary effectiveness analysis. An additional 40 women will
      be randomized to receive injections subcutaneously in the back of the upper arm to assess
      whether differences in PK may exist which could impact the grace period for reinjections for
      that injection site.

      A single MPA serum sample will be collected from all participants at baseline. All
      participants will receive re-injections at month 4 and month 8, and complete their scheduled
      follow-up at month 12. There will be a plus 7-day grace period for re-injections, but women
      who are up to 28 days late may continue treatment if they have a negative urine pregnancy
      test. Urine pregnancy testing will be performed at month 4, at study exit and at any other
      time during the study if clinically indicated. Participants will be evaluated for injection
      site reactions and asked to provide information on adverse events, prohibited concomitant
      medication and other contraceptive use, vaginal bleeding, and method acceptability at all
      regular follow-up visits (i.e., not including the PK visits at Months 2 and 3). Serious
      adverse events and adverse events leading to product withdrawal, will be recorded throughout
      the study.

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will receive the same study drug, Sayana® Press. However, women will be randomized to receive their injections in the abdomen, back of the upper arm, or upper thigh to control for potential confounding when assessing relationships between SC injection site, efficacy, and PK. One cohort of N=630 women will be randomized 1:1 to receive their injections in the abdomen or thigh, and a separate PK cohort of N=120 women agreeing to MPA testing will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive their injections in the abdomen, upper thigh, or back of the upper arm. Randomization will be stratified by cohort and site using appropriate randomly permuted block sizes.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Neither participants nor site staff will be blinded to SC injection sites. However, laboratory staff analyzing serum MPA specimens and staff at FHI 360 responsible for adjudicating pregnancy outcomes and coding adverse events will be blinded to individual participant injection site assignments for the duration of each participant's follow up.</masking_description>

    <description>Pregnancy is defined as having a positive urine pregnancy test. Positive urine tests will be confirmed by ultrasound and/or serum hCG testing whenever possible. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the pregnancy Pearl Index, computed as the number of pregnancies that occur during the treatment period multiplied by 100 and divided by the number of WY of treatment contributed to the Treated Analysis Set among women receiving injections in the abdomen or thigh.</description>

    <ipd_description>Study sites will collect baseline and longitudinal data among 750 women in Brazil, Chile and the Dominican Republic relevant to the protocol objectives including demographics; sexual, reproductive and medical history; acceptability; serious adverse events; concomitant medication use and laboratory data (including serum blood medroxyprogesterone acetate concentrations in a subset of women).
FHI 360 will submit the study dataset using the platform-independent and non-proprietary comma separated values (also known as [CSV]) format. The study dataset will be submitted to USAID's Data Development Library within 30 calendar days after the dataset is first used to produce an Intellectual Work.
A code book defining all variables, a data dictionary describing the relationships among the files within the dataset, and a document describing the methodology used to collect the data will be shared with the study dataset.</ipd_description>
