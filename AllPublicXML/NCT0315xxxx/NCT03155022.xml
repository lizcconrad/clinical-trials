  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infarct size is a major determinant of prognosis after AMI. Evidence indicates that the
      combination of intracoronary ischemic conditioning (ICIC) and remote ischemic conditioning
      (RIC) can significantly reduce infarct size in STEMI patients. Whether the combination of
      these two interventions may improve clinical outcome after STEMI remains unknown. The
      objective of the present study is to determine whether combination of ICIC and RIC can
      improve STEMI patients clinical outcome at 6 months.

ICIC: Four cycles of [1 min balloon inflation followed by 1 min balloon deflation] started as soon as possible after reopening of the culprit coronary artery (maximum within 3 minutes after reflow). The balloon will be placed carefully above the culprit lesion so as to minimize potential micro-embolization.</description>
