  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies in female .To the younger patients,
      radical hysterectomy which is a standard operation during the earlier and middle therapy
      stage as well as more effective technique like radiotherapy and chemotherapy give them a
      longer life expectancy. However, the operation destroys patients' normal pelvic anatomy,
      nutrient supplements and internal secretion so that postoperative pelvic floor functional
      dysfunction has a destructive effect for their life. There are tremendous studies on clinical
      symptoms while few on anatomical changes and the relationship between pelvic floor symptoms
      and the dysfunction. Two-dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI), transperineal
      ultrasonography， Urodynamic examination and anorectal manometry are frequently used in the
      fine-structure varies and pelvic floor function. Now three-dimensional MRI has more
      advantages in fine change of Pelvic anatomical and space position，as well as clearly showing
      the relationships between the change and space with the pelvic floor function. Based on an
      eight-year-study on three-dimensional MRI, we can analyze the postoperational anatomical
      changes and the relationship between the changes and the dysfunction by combined anatomic
      parameters which are measured on static-dynamic three- dimensional model with clinical
      symptoms, transperineal ultrasonography,urodynamic examination and anorectal manometry. We
      expect our study could provide scientific basis for on protective and repaired measures of
      pelvic floor.

    <description>A standard radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed. Static and dynamic MRI were performed. A suggested urodynamic examination was done according to the ICS. A 3D reconstruction technique was used to construct the 3D model of the pelvis, pelvic floor muscle, pelvic organ such as bladder and urethral.</description>

        This is a study comparing 70 cases (cervical cancer patients before RH surgery) to 70
        controls (Same group cervical cancer patients before RH surgery) exams.All recruits will
        undergo the MRI evaluation,transperineal ultrasonography, urodynamic examination and
        anorectal manometryand the basic information of them will be recorded.
