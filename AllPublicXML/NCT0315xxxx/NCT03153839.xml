    <textblock>
      Introduction: physical activity in infants through aquatic therapy is widely known for the
      later development of sensory ,cognitive and motor areas. In this way, babies will have a
      greater sense of freedom, pleasure and memory of the maternal uterus. In addition, the margin
      therapeutic safety in the water is very broad, which allows an optimal development of aquatic
      early stimulation programs.

      Objective: To determine the relationship between aquatic physical activity in infants and the
      development of their psychomotor skills in their first year.

      Methods: A prospective case-control study will take place for 12 months. Participating
      infants will be divided in two groups: an experimental group, which will be integrated by 74
      babies who will participate with their parents in the aquatic physical activity programme in
      a heated pool (34-35ºC) and a control group with 71 babies who will not participate in the
      activities. The aquatic activity will consist on 20 minutes sessions twice a week.
