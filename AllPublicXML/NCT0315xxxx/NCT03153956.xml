  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, interventional, randomized, double-arm clinical evaluation study to examine
      the efficacy of AposTherapy® versus a control group, in the short-term at 6 months and in the
      long-term at 12 months post-treatment, with the primary efficacy assessment based on
      improvement in knee pain score and improvement in function in patients following diagnosis of
      knee osteoarthritis (OA).

    <intervention_model_description>Phase I - A prospective, interventional, randomized, double-arm clinical evaluation of patients who have been diagnosed with OA of the knee. The active treatment arm (personally calibrated biomechanical device) will be compared to a control arm (sham-placebo device) (similar shoes without biomechanical elements).
Phase II - Open-label, cross-over study design. After the completion of phase one patients will be un-blinded to their group allocation. Patients that were allocated to the sham-placebo control group will cross to the active group and will receive the AposTherapy treatment. Patients that were allocated to the active group will continue with treatment.</intervention_model_description>
