      A feasibility study to provide 'proof of concept' of Elemental Diet (ED) as an acceptable/
      useful feeding option for patient with inoperable malignant bowel obstruction and to examine
      the impact of ED on quality of life

      The aim of this study is to determine whether Elemental Diet (a type of drink that contains
      an elemental protein source known as amino acids) can be tolerated by patients with
      inoperable bowel blockage who can no longer eat and are only able to swallow small amount of
      fluid. The objective is to find out whether elemental diet (ED) can be used as an acceptable
      nutrition and whether it improves the quality of life. Bowel blockage is a common
      complication in patients with ovarian cancer. Unfortunately when the cancer is advanced, this
      blockage can occur in many parts of the bowel therefore surgery is not possible. Every year
      in the UK some publications report the rate as high as 50% . One way to feed patients with
      bowel blockage is through the veinsÍ¾ this is known as parenteral nutrition (PN) however PN is
      rarely used in United Kingdom. Patients with malignant bowel blockage are often able to
      swallow small amounts of liquid but if they have no PN they are only able to survive for 2-3
      weeks and the psychological as well as physical impact on patients and the family are very
      distressing. ED is a type of a drink which contains an elemental protein source known as
      amino acids. ED drinks are almost totally absorbed in the upper part of the bowel and
      therefore could be absorbed even in patients who have bowel blockage which usually develops
      lower down in the gut. If this study is successful and proves that ED can be tolerated and
      provide nutrition to patients with inoperable bowel blockage it will be a big step towards
      improving the quality of life at the final stage of cancer.

    <description>All patients will be assessed and given an individual plan for Elemental Diet (ED) introduction. The actual amount of ED prescribed will depend on the tolerance and palatability and not nutritional status. The recommendation of a minimum of 2 cartons of ED will be drunk orally by patients, along with other clear fluids only. Following introduction of ED, patients will be discharged from hospital (if applicable) and followed up for 2 weeks. They will have a telephone follow-up assessment once a week for 2 weeks. All other assessments will follow the standard of care. During the follow-up patients will be assessed using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) and will be asked to complete a nutritional diary every day and a quality of life questionnaire at several time points.</description>
