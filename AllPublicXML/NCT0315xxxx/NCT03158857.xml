  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C is an important health problem in Myanmar affecting around 3% of the population.
      New drugs have been developed which have transformed the treatment of this disease around the
      world with very high success rates. Two of these drugs are now registered for use in Myanmar.
      In this study 200 patients with chronic hepatitis C(100 with HIV co-infection) will be
      assessed and started on the new treatment. We will observe them and measure treatment
      effectiveness and tolerability. In 24 patients extra blood samples will be taken for drug
      measurements to describe the effect of the drugs on patients in Myanmar in more detail.

    <textblock>
      Data concerning Hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence in Myanmar is scarce. Preliminary results
      of a survey, conducted in 2015 in different areas in Myanmar estimated a seroprevalence of
      HCV of around 2.65 %, which represents 1.3 million infected patients. Genotype 6 was mostly
      found in the northern cities and genotype 3 in the southern and western cities of Myanmar.
      However, treatment options for HCV in Myanmar remain limited currently, including for
      patients with HIV co-infection who are generally considered high priority given their
      increased risk for liver disease.

      New direct acting antiviral therapies which can achieve high rates of sustained virological
      response (SVR) (&gt;90%), defined as complete suppression of the virus 12 weeks after completion
      of antiviral therapy, are becoming increasingly available worldwide.

      In Myanmar, in mid-2015, the guideline for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection of
      the Myanmar GI and Liver Society was revised in line with the recent development of Directly
      Acting Antiviral (DAA) drugs. This observational study will follow the recommendations for
      patient care presented in this guideline. Two hundred patients with chronic hepatitis C (100
      with HIV co-infection) will be recruited in this observational study of routine care with two
      newly available antiviral drugs (sofosbuvir+ daclatasvir) in two different groups of patients
      (with and without HIV coinfection) at two centres in Yangon, Myanmar. Their response to
      treatment will be monitored. In addition a pharmacokinetic study is planned in a subset of
      patients to characterise any determinants of treatment response or tolerability in patients
      in Myanmar. This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and the
      applicable regulatory requirements
