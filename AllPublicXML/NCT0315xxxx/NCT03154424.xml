  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single center, parallel group, prospective, randomized clinical trial was conducted at the
      department of Hand Surgery, ABC (Andre, Bernardo, Caetano) Foundation University Hospital,
      Santo Andre, Brazil. Two implants used for fixation in closed reduction of distal radius
      fractures were compared: the bridging dynamic Galaxy Wrist external fixator (Orthofix®,
      Verona) and the non-bridging Galaxy wrist external fixator system (Orthofix®, Verona).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dynamic external fixator in the ETC (Early Total Care) of unstable DRFs (distal radius
      fractures) may be a good choice of treatment. Because it's fast, safe, minimally invasive and
      easily performed method, it could help in the inflammatory systemic response to trauma,
      unable earlier functional recovery and shorten the hospitalization time of these patients
      (elderly and polytrauma). From this, in this study to obtain relevant information about each
      type of treatment, avoid possible selection bias, information and confusion. Choose a
      reproducible and effective method (external fixator), which presents a cost / benefit
      compatible with our reality, but that generates doubt the best way to apply this &quot;bridging&quot;
      which is already used and that will be our control group and &quot;non-bridging&quot;, which will be
      the group to be tested.

      Rather than establishing the actual value of each of these procedures, is necessary to
      optimize and improve the quality of life of these patients in order to return to your
      personal and professional activities as soon as possible.
