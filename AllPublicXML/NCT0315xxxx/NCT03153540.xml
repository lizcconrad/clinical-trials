  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (nf/avPPA) is a fatal
      neurodegenerative disease that begins with isolated language deficits. There is currently no
      cure or treatment for this disease. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), a
      noninvasive neuromodulatory technique, is effective in major depression, and studied in many
      other conditions including nf/avPPA. Here the investigators propose to study the feasibility
      and change in language and brain function of a newer rTMS protocol (intermittent theta-burst
      stimulation, iTBS) using a randomized, blinded crossover design: participants will receive
      active or sham iTBS for two weeks and then switch groups without them or clinicians knowing
      their group. The investigators hypothesize that brain function and performance with language
      tasks will change after active iTBS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled blinded cross-over treatment trial that involves 20
      iTBS treatment sessions (10 active treatment sessions; 10 sham treatment sessions) and the
      study will last between 6 weeks. There will be 20 treatment visits (Monday-Friday) each
      lasting 10-40 minutes. Whether the participant is randomly assigned to active or sham
      treatment, the participant will receive daily 10 minute session of iTBS treatment. Some
      sessions will include behavioral and neurophysiological measures.

      In addition, participants will complete cognitive testing, and neuro-imaging, including
      functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and
      electroencephalography (EEG) prior to the commencement of iTBS/sham treatment and at
      post-treatment. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated during daily iTBS treatments.

      After 10 iTBS treatment visits over 2 weeks, a clinical assessment will be done to see if the
      participants are responding to the iTBS treatment with a targeted language assessment and
      neuro-imaging as described above. After 2 weeks of &quot;wash-out&quot;, where the subjects do not
      receive any treatments, the participants will undergo another 2 weeks of iTBS treatment. On
      the first iTBS session after the 2-week washout period, participants will undergo a targeted
      language assessment and EEG/fNIRS. At the final iTBS session at 6 weeks, subjects will again
      undergo a targeted language assessment, EEG/fNIRS, and fMRI. At that point, after 6 weeks,
      the cross-over study is finished.

    <description>Tolerability will be measured by daily Comfort Rating Questionnaire (CRQ) between sham and active interventions and compared using Chi-square. A mean score across all treatment sessions above 6 on more than 2 items on the CRQ will be considered as severe. A mean score across all treatment sessions between 4 and 6 on more than 2 items on the CRQ will be considered as moderate tolerability. A mean score across all treatment sessions below 4 on the majority of items will be considered as mild tolerability.</description>
