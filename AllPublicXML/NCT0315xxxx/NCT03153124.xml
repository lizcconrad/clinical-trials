  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease in hemodialysis have complex syndrome with diverse
      effects on cardiovascular, nervous, respiratory, musculoskeletal, immune and
      endocrine-metabolic systems. With regard to the musculoskeletal structure, there is
      progressive muscular loss with consequent increase in muscle weakness, limited resistance,
      exercise intolerance and fatigue, as well as functional and morphological abnormalities
      characteristic of uremic myopathy. Respiratory muscles are also affected as a result of
      uremic myopathy, with decreased strength and resistance. Objective: to analyze the impact of
      respiratory muscle training on muscle strength, functional capacity and quality of life of
      patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. Method: This is a prospective,
      randomized study involving 46 patients followed by the dialysis unit of a university
      hospital, over 18 years old, of both genders who underwent hemodialysis for more than six
      months and who signed the informed consent form. Patients will be allocated into two groups:
      respiratory muscle training with PowerBreath and control. All will be evaluated for
      demographic data, respiratory muscle strength, lung function, functional capacity and quality
      of life. The intervention group will perform three months of intradialytic training of a
      physical therapy protocol with PowerBreath. Both groups will be reevaluated after three
      months.
