  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of emergency management of acute ischemic stroke has improved considerably
      in recent years with thrombolysis and more recently thrombectomy. This improvement is
      accompanied by an increase in the number of stroke survivors. One of the major issues for
      these ever-increasing survivors is the prevention of recurrence. According to data from the 3
      French registries, more than 20% of patients have at least one recurrence. Secondary
      prevention treatment has demonstrated his efficacy to prevent stroke recurrence.

      This evolution justifies identifying factors associated with adherence to secondary
      prevention treatment, measured at 1 year post-stroke / transient ischemic attack (TIA), in
      patients included in the STROKE 69 cohort.

    <description>The overall medication possession ratio is the average of the medication possession ratio calculated for each therapeutic class (antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, antihypertensives, hypolipidemic agents and oral antidiabetics).
The medication possession ratio will be calculated from dispensing data from regional health insurance database and prescription data from the STROKE 69 study. For each patient, a medication possession ratio (CMA7 index) will be obtained by the ratio of the quantity of medication units dispensed to the quantity of medication units prescribed.</description>

    <description>A phone call will be made to patients 1 year post a stroke or transient ischemic attack.
The following determinants will be studied in the 5 dimensions defined by World Health Organization:
Socio-economic: level of education, profession, health insurance
Patient and family-social environment: age, sex, marital status, lifestyle, level of patient support in the management of their treatment, representation of the disease and beliefs about medication
Care pathway: management of stroke / TIA in emergency or neurovascular unit, admission to rehabilitation unit, medical consumption and therapeutics acts in the year following stroke / TIA
Pathology: TIA or ischemic stroke, duration of hospitalization in acute phase and type of hospital, history of stroke or TIA, disability and autonomy, fatigue, anxiety and depression, comorbidities
Treatments: therapeutic class and number of treatments / polymedication.</description>
