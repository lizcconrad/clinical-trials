  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This FTIH study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) of
      escalating single and repeat oral doses of GSK3352589 in normal healthy volunteers. This is a
      randomized, double-blind (sponsor unblinded), placebo controlled, dose escalation study that
      will have two parts; Part A and Part B. A total of 64 subjects will be randomized (8
      subjects/cohort) to GSK3352589 or matching placebo.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect or any other situation according to medical or scientific judgement will be categorized as SAE</description>

    <description>Eligible subject will be assigned to four single dose, crossover dosing periods, 1 placebo and 3 escalating dosing (GSK3352589-2 to 400 mg) periods.
