  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), characterized by persistent airflow limitation,
      associated with an progressive chronic inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles
      or gases, can lead to dyspnea and limited mobility and influence the life quality of patients
      severely. Type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM), as a common complication of COPD, has got more
      attention in comprehensive control of COPD. Stress response and metabolic disorder are more
      likely to happen in COPD patients with T2DM in high level inflammation status, which decrease
      the drug efficacy, increase the risk of acute exacerbation of COPD, complications and
      mortality.

      Both COPD and T2DM are chronic inflammatory disease with long term, there is close
      relationship in occurrence and development of each other, and the patients with severe COPD
      are more likely to develop T2DM. Monitoring the acute inflammation maker of C reactive
      protein (CRP) and IL-6(interleukin-6) is the most useable way to predict the inflammatory
      status and condition of COPD patient with T2DM, however the chronic inflammation maker is
      lacking. Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio(NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and
      lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) , the new, cheap and easy-tested chronic inflammatory
      markers, have got great research in early predicting the tumor such as nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma and small-cell lung cancer,among them, NLR has manifest
      promising application in predicting insulin-resistance. However the value about NLR,PLR and
      LMR to predict the T2DM in COPD patients remain unknown and many articles related to NLR and
      COPD are retrospective.

      The investigators attempt to analyze the risk factors and predict value of NLR,PLR and LMR
      about developing T2DM in COPD patients with prospective method.

      All the subjects will experience the follow-up every six months, accompanying the monitoring
      of fast blood glucose (FBG). The complete follow-up will span three years. The follow-up for
      one patient will stop early when its FBG≥7.0mmol/L which indicates the patient has developed
      new T2DM.

      The subjects will be divided into two groups according to whether patients develop T2DM at
      the end of each follow-up, namely, COPD patients with T2DM and COPD patients without T2DM
