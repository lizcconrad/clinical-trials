  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of present study was to compare the keratinized gingival tissue measurements, degree
      of subjective complaints, and functional complications of using an 980 nm diode laser versus
      a scalpel for frenectomies. Thirty-six patients requiring frenectomies, between 18 and 51
      years old, were randomly assigned to either scalpel or diode laser treatments. The soft
      tissue measurements, including the keratinized gingiva width (KGW), attached gingiva
      width(AGW), and attached gingiva thickness (AGT), were recorded before surgery, immediately
      after, one week later, and one, three, and six months after surgery. In addition, the
      functional complications and the morbidity (level of pain, swelling, and redness) were
      evaluated during the first postoperative week using a visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS
      scores indicated that the patients treated with a diode laser had less discomfort and
      functional complications compare with scalpel surgery.

      The whole mouth records of each participant served as a basis for the clinical periodontal
      diagnoses. Prior to the frenectomy, the same investigator recorded the following parameters:
      plaque index (PLI), gingival index (GI), pocket probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level
      (CAL), and bleeding on probing (BOP). All of the clinical parameters were measured at six
      sites per tooth (mesio, mid, and distobuccal, and mesio, mid, and distopalatal) using a
      Williams periodontal probe (Nordent Manufacturing Inc., Elk Grove Village, IL, USA)
      calibrated in millimeters.

      The patients were instructed to record the postoperative degrees of pain, redness, swelling,
      and functional complications, including chewing and speech, on a 10 cm horizontal visual
      analog scale (VAS), by placing a vertical mark between the two endpoints, from the first
      through seventh days. The scale was graded from left to right with values ranging from &quot;0&quot;
      (no pain, functional complications, discomfort, swelling, or redness) to &quot;10&quot; (worst pain,
      extreme functional complications, extreme discomfort, extreme swelling, and extreme redness).
      The keratinized gingiva width (KGW), attached gingiva width (AGW), and attached gingiva
      thickness (AGT) were also recorded before the surgery. Postoperative analyses were performed
      at four separate times: immediately, at the first week, and at the first and third months
      after surgery. The patients in each group were also asked if they required anesthesia during
      the operation and analgesics after the operation.

    <description>A 2.8 W, 980 nm diode laser(Sirona Advanced) in continuous wave mode with an air cooling handpiece was used in the alternative frenectomy technique. The frenulum was held with a hemostat, and a repeated continuous wave mode was applied for the excision. It was also used to remove the periosteal adhesion. The remnants of the ablated tissue were removed with saline, and no sutures were placed after the diode laser treatment.</description>
