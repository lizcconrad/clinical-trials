    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to establish a continuous nurse-led integrated support program
      and to exam its impact on preterm infant neurodevelopment.

      Research hypotheses include:1. The continuous nurse-led integrated support will have
      significant impact on preterm infant neurodevelopment; 2.The support program will also have
      positive effect on parent psychological well-being.

      The objective of the study is to establish the continuous nurse-led integrated support
      program as well as exam its impact on neurodevelopmental health of preterm infants.

      Research hypotheses:

        1. Compared to control group, the preterm infants in the interventional group will
           experience significantly better performance on neuromotor, cognitive and
           social-emotional function at corrected age of 3 month;

        2. In comparison with those receiving routine support, parents receiving nurse-led
           continuous support will have significantly higher parental self-efficacy and exhibited
           better psychological well-being;

        3. Maternal parenting self-efficacy will mediate the relationship between nurse-led support
           and preterm infant neurodevelopment.

    <description>continuous care group (CCG): This is the experimental group where continuous care supported would be offered by the nurse coordinated integrative health care team. which is, parents in this group receive support during infant hospitalization. The support covers both hospitalization phase and after-discharge phase. In-hospital support include educational support and promoting mother-infant attachment. Nurses will be responsible for home visits after infant discharge.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Routine Care Group (RCG): This is the comparison group of preterm infants. the routine care interventions generally include telephone reminding about follow-up care of the infants and hotline for parents to call when needed.</description>

    <intervention_name>Nurse-led Continuous Support</intervention_name>
    <description>The Nurse-Led Continuous Support was provided by a integrative care team. In-hospital support included(1) Promoting early parental-infant interaction;(2) Instruct the mother and/or father to use sensory stimulation activities to promote infant neuro-development in the NICU;(3) Parental educational support. The integrative care team will teach infant care skills, prepare them for successful transition from hospital to home setting.
After infant discharge support will consist of regular home visits by the nurses. Home visits will be offered every other week until children reaching 3 Months of corrected age.</description>
