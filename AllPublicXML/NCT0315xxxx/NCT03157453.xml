    <textblock>
      Prospective cohort study. Any patient with potential cerebral injured (medical or traumatic)
      will be included in the study, regardless of its severity, history, the presence of
      anticoagulant or antiagrégant.

      The collection should be done as soon as possible, in the reception of vital emergencies or
      in the urgencies. The collection consists of the realization of a Glasgow score and a scale
      of Kremlin-Bicêtre for all patients by completing a standardized collection sheet. The
      collection of GCS and Kremlin-Bicêtre must be did at the same time. The collection sheet is
      filled by medical personnel trained.

      The future of the patient is informed at 6 months using the Glasgow Outcome Scale- Extended,
      which will be made during a following consultation or by phone. Additional data will be
      collected on the folder (ventilation time, days of hospitalization, mortality).
