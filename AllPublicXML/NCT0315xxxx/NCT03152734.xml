  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The POSE study will predict critical stages and outcome in a large sample of all surgical and
      non-surgical interventional patients ≥80 years of age in Europe.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elderly population (≥80 years) will increase from 5.3% of the total population in 2015 to 9%
      in 2040. This implies an increasing number and variety of surgical and non-surgical
      interventional procedures. Little is known about the in-hospital mortality rates in the
      overall elderly interventional population. Compared with younger interventional patients, the
      elderly are at greater risk of peri-interventional mortality and morbidity, because of
      decline in physiological and cognitive reserve, and frequent comorbidities. Previous data are
      mostly limited to specific populations, like the elderly hip fracture patient.

      The investigators aim to recruit as many as possible centers throughout Europe, to
      participate in this study. A total sample size of 7500 patients will provide reasonable and
      valid results for the study aims. The primary endpoint will be analysed by fitting a
      COX-Regression model to the data of the post-interventional mortality until day 30.
