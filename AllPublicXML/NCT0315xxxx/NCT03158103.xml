      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of the combination of
      pexidartinib and MEK162. This study tests different doses of pexidartinib in combination with
      different doses of MEK162 to see which dose combination of these drugs is safe and best
      tolerated in people.

MEK162 wiIl be administered orally on a twice daily basis throughout the treatment cycle. MEK162 is available in 15mg tablets. In this phase I study all patients will have a 2-week lead in of pexidartinib therapy alone. Thereafter, pexidartinib will be administered in combination with MEK162 on a consecutive daily basis. A treatment cycle consists of 28 days. In the dose escalation portion the dose of pexidartinib and MEK 162 will depend on the dose level cohort onto which the patient is enrolled.</description>
