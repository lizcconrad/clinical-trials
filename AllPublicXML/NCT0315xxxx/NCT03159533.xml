  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study &quot;Project IMPACT: CHW Intervention&quot; is part of a larger study examining the
      efficacy, adoption, and impact of integrated EHR-based decision-support and physician
      feedback interventions with community health worker (CHW)-led self-management and coaching
      support for South Asian patients with uncontrolled hypertension. This is a randomized control
      intervention utilizing community health worker (CHW)-led self-management and coaching support
      for South Asian patients with uncontrolled hypertension at PCP clinics in New York City.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Goal of this study is that:

        1. EHR-based decision support and performance feedback interventions will be more effective
           in improving hypertension control for South Asian patients than standard care;

        2. A combined EHR-CHW intervention will be more effective in improving hypertension control
           for South Asian patients compared to standard care and the EHR-based intervention

      Investigators hope to implement and assess the efficacy of CHW-led coaching through promotion
      of team-based care and use of culturally tailored education to improve hypertension control
      and mitigate risk factors related to CVD among South Asian patients with uncontrolled
      hypertension. Study findings can provide translatable and scalable models for other limited
      English proficient communities.

At these follow-up meetings, CHWs will engage in goal-setting activities regarding changes to health behaviors, medication adherence, or other issues related to hypertension control as identified jointly by the patient and CHW. CHWs will also collect height, weight, and blood pressure measurements at initial and in-person follow-up visits. The CHW will make necessary referrals to other services available in the community (i.e. exercise classes, social services, mental health, tobacco cessation, etc.).</description>
