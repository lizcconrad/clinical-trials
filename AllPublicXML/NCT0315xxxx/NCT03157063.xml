  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to quantify energy metabolism using indirect calorimetry at rest,
      in the presence of excess energy following a meal, and in response to the demand for energy
      during exercise. The investigators also will examine the individual and joint associations of
      activity and obesity status on neurocognitive domains of appetite control. Participants will
      include adolescent males and females (N=80) using a 2 x 2 cross-sectional study design,
      stratified by body weight (normal vs overweight/obese) and physical activity level (sedentary
      vs. active).

      The investigators hypothesize that low levels of fitness and MVPA result in impaired
      metabolic function in adolescents. For this pilot study, the investigators will quantify
      variations in metabolic characteristics using a 2 x 2 cross-sectional study design,
      stratified by body weight (normal vs overweight/obese) and physical activity (sedentary vs.
      active). The goal is to identify metabolic factors that influence the energy balance system
      to directly inform interventions designed to prevent or reduce the prevalence of pediatric
      obesity.
