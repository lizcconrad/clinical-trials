  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensity is a &quot;qualitative&quot; variable of a muscle stretching protocol, which is very little
      studied due to its inherent characteristic of the individual being stretched. However, it was
      pointed out as an important factor for ADM gain. To verify the effects of different
      intensities of static passive stretching on flexibility, neuromuscular and functional
      performance in soccer athletes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized, controlled, clinical trial, composed of male subjects, soccer players,
      randomly divided into 4 groups: Control Group (CG), Experimental Group 1 (GE1), Experimental
      Group 2 (GE2) And Experimental Group 3 (GE3). Initially, the measurements of flexibility
      (passive and active), neuromuscular (muscular passive torque, electromyographic activity),
      and functional (vertical jump and shuttle run test) of non-dominant lower limbs, performed
      before and immediately after the 1st And 48 hours after the last session. The GC will only be
      submitted for initial evaluation and final re-evaluation. The experimental groups will
      undergo a protocol of static passive stretching containing 10 sessions, divided into 3 weekly
      sessions, with 3 maneuvers of 30 s, but with different intensities (Tolerable Maximum Pain,
      Maximum No Pain Discomfort, and Stretching Sensation Without Discomfort) Established from a
      PERFLEX-modified visual scale. Groups with higher static passive stretching intensities
      (Maximum Tolerable Pain and Maximum Painless Discomfort) are expected to have greater gains
      in flexibility, with no change in muscle passive torque, electromyographic activity and
      functional performance, while the intensity of Feeling of Stretching without Discomfort (in a
      comfort zone) provides a greater decrease of the muscular passive torque, without significant
      change of the flexibility, in individual athletes of soccer. This work may contribute to the
      clinical practice of health professionals, since it seeks to improve the elaboration of the
      clinical prescription of protocols of static passive stretching (whether performed by the
      individual or not), establishing optimal levels of intensity for a given muscle group.

    <masking_description>The randomization process of the sample will be carried out through the electronic website http://www.randomization.com, carried out by a subject external to the experimental and evaluation procedures. With this data, the site will generate a specific coding for each group and will randomly distribute the subjects into four groups: Control Group (GC), Experiment Group 1 (GE1), Experiment Group (GE2) and Experiment Group 3 (GE3).
The distribution will be kept in an opaque and sealed envelope, being revealed only to P2 only at the time of intervention. The P1, who will carry out the measurements, will not know to which group the individual belongs. To maintain the &quot;blinding&quot; procedure of the study, each individual at the time of intervention will spend 10 minutes in the intervention room (being 4 minutes for preparation and 6 minutes for intervention) and each group will have a corresponding color for the convenience of P2 White, blue, green and yellow).</masking_description>
