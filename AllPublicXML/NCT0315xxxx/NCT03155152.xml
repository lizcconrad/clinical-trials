    <textblock>
      Different types of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) sessions are used by athletes in
      order to improve their physical performance, but innovative approaches to training are
      lacking. Therefore, in Part A of this study the physiological response to a standard HIIT and
      a new decremental exercise training (DECT) will be compared in runners and cyclists. Next, in
      Part B the training effects of a 4-week block of the HIIT and DECT will be compared.
