  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to confirm the efficacy and safety of transdermal penis enlargement
      for 24 weeks after CMDHA0101 injection in subjects who wanted penile enlargement in male
      patients with small-penis syndrome *.

      *Small-penis syndrome is the anxiety of thinking one's penis is too small - even though it
      isn't.

      This study was designed as a 24-week, randomized, blinded, active control trial.

      If a subject signing a clinical trial agreement and satisfying the selection / exclusion
      criteria is enrolled in this clinical trial, he / she will receive the medical device for
      clinical testing at the baseline time, return to his / her home after the training . At 4
      weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after the application of the medical device for clinical
      testing at baseline, the safety, penile girth, length, and satisfaction of the subject were
      evaluated. 24 weeks after application, the clinical trial sponsor (or trustee) retrieves the
      data necessary for the analysis of results, such as case records, for the purpose of validity
      and safety evaluation
