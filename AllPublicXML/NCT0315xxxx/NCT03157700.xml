  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II STTR will evaluate an interactive, self-paced, e-learning media literacy
      intervention, REAL media, to prevent youth substance use among youth in the 4-H organization.
      Participating 4-H clubs will be randomly assigned to use the curriculum or continue current
      practices with the option for delivery at the end of the study. 4-H members (ages 13-15) will
      complete a pretest, immediate posttest and follow-up posttests at 3 and 9 months to assess
      effects.

    <textblock>
      REAL media is an interactive, self-paced, e-learning media literacy curriculum that prevents
      adolescent substance use among 13-15-year-old teens. The program consists of 5 levels. Levels
      1 to 4 are 15-25 minutes; level 5 allots time for message production done offline. Activities
      lead students to engage in critique and analysis of arguments present/absent from pro-ATOD
      and other popular product messages and to begin the process of refuting and counter-arguing
      these messages. These skills are reinforced in level 5 using an active involvement strategy
      in which youth plan and produce anti-ATOD messages. Users first plan their message via an
      online worksheet, which requires engagement with and application of media literacy concepts
      rather than focus exclusively on technology and/or production features. Next, participants
      design their posters/videos and upload their messages to a social media site as part of a
      contest, where they recruit peers and family to like or comment on their message.
