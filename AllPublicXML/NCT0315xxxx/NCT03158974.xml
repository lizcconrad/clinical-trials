      This trial will be a phase 2, open-label, study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of VIR007 when administered topically for up to 60 days to adults between the ages
      of 18 to 65 years with a clinical diagnosis of external condylomata acuminata.

      Subjects will enter the Screening Period once the informed consent process has been
      completed. Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of external condylomata acuminata and who meet
      all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled.

      Once subject eligibility is confirmed and the screening procedures completed, the subject
      will start the Treatment Period of the study. All enrolled subjects will receive VIR007
      (cream containing 10% EISO) with the first dose applied topically during Visit 1 (Day 1).
      Subjects will be instructed on how to apply the study medication twice daily for up to 60
      days or until the Investigator determines the lesions have cleared. Subjects will return to
      the clinic for study-related assessments on Study Days 7, 14, 28, 42 and a Final Study Visit
      on Day 60. 30 days following complete resolution, as determined by the study investigator,
      or, on Study Day 90, subjects will receive a follow-up telephone call and be queried
      regarding condition status since study completion.
