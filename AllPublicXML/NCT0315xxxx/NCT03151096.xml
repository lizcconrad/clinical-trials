  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension, which results from a combination of multiple lifestyle and genetic factors, is
      a global public health problem affecting 1 billion people worldwide. The identification of
      cheap treatment interventions without adverse side effects would be hugely advantageous
      particularly in low-income settings with high prevalence of hypertension such as sub-Saharan
      Africa where up to 46% of adults are affected.

      Emerging evidence links a functional polymorphism in the MTHFR gene (rs1801133 C677T),
      encoding the folate-metabolising enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase to high blood
      pressure in adults. Variation at rs1801133 is relatively common and has 3 genotypes;
      homozygous &quot;normal&quot; CC, heterozygous CT and homozygous &quot;variant&quot; TT genotypes. Of these
      genotypes, the homozygous &quot;variant&quot; TT is more strongly associated with a higher BP. The
      precise mechanism by which MTHFR is associated with BP remains unclear. It has been recently
      shown in 3 separate randomized controlled trials that BP is highly responsive to riboflavin
      and that this response is differential by MTHFR rs1801133 genotype. In all these clinical
      trials, significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed in
      the homozygous variant TT genotype and an intermediate effect seen in those with the
      heterozygous CT genotype. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of riboflavin
      supplementation on blood pressure in a riboflavin-deplete population as well as comparing
      plasma riboflavin status before and after supplementation. This will be achieved by
      conducting a randomized single-blind placebo controlled trial over a period of 16 weeks.

      The Investigators will use the Keneba biobank to invite about 100 adults with the CT genotype
      and a similar number of age-, sex and village-matched CC homozygotes. Participants within
      each of the groups will be randomized to receive either riboflavin (5mg/d) or a matching
      placebo which would be supplied on a weekly basis. Blood sample, blood pressure measurement,
      socio-demographic data and their anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist and hip
      circumference and body composition by BIA) will be taken during the initial visit. An
      additional blood sample will be taken at the end of the study whilst additional BP
      measurements will be taken respectively at 8 weeks and at the end of the intervention. The
      possibility that riboflavin deficiency represents a new, easily-correctible causal factor in
      hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa would require further large-scale interventions if this
      pilot study yields encouraging results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a recall-by-genotype randomized single-blind placebo-controlled micronutrient
      supplementation trial. The Keneba biobank will be used to identify all potential participants
      i.e. individuals genotyped for MTHFR C677T for this pilot study.

      The Investigators will invite all 163 adults with the CT genotype in the Keneba biobank and a
      similar number of age- sex- and village-matched CC homozygotes to participate in the study.
      Field assistants will visit the homes of potentially eligible participants, to provide full
      information about the purpose and methods of the study, potential risks and benefits, and
      participants' rights. Participants will then provide written informed consent. The field
      assistant will ensure that the conversation and consent process occurs in a private area or
      room, to maintain privacy and confidentiality. After exclusions and non-consenters the
      investigators anticipate at least 102 subjects per group. Using standard deviation estimates
      from our own and published literature (14mmHg for SBP and 10mmHg for DBP) the investigators
      will have 95% confidence (at p&lt;0.05) of detecting differences of 3.88mmHg for SBP and
      2.76mmHg for DBP.

      Participants within each of the groups will be randomized to riboflavin or placebo in a 1:1
      ratio according to a computer generated randomization scheme. This will be done by randomly
      assigning study numbers within the CT carriers to a treatment group and enrolling
      participants sequentially from lowest to highest study identification number. The subjects
      will be randomized upon dispensing the study drug associated with the subject pair's study
      identification number. Field, clinical, laboratory and data entry staff will be blinded to
      the genotype of the study participants and to the identity of the treatment arm to which a
      participant is assigned from the time of randomization to the time of unblinding. The
      placebos are designed to be indistinguishable from the active drugs. Double-blinding is not
      possible because subjects randomized to the riboflavin will have yellow urine (a harmless
      outcome that will be explained to them).

      Eligible participants will then be invited for a visit to the MRC Keneba field station. At
      the initial visit, socio-demographic data and anthropometric measurements (height, weight,
      waist and hip circumference and body composition by BIA) will be taken. Thereafter, BP will
      be measured with an automated device in triplicate using a standard protocol by the same
      investigator who will be blinded to genotype and treatment group. The investigators will also
      collect 10ml sample of blood for laboratory assessment of vitamin B status. During the
      intervention phase of the trial, the investigators will supplement participants with 5mg/day
      of riboflavin or a matching placebo for 16 weeks. The pills will be supplied on a weekly
      basis with instructions to return any unused pills. Another BP measurement following similar
      protocol as before will be taken at 8 weeks as well as at 16 weeks after the start of the
      intervention. Finally, a 10ml blood sample will be collected at 16 weeks. Blood samples will
      be analysed for riboflavin, homocysteine, red cell folate, cobalamin and pyridoxine.
      Participants who were randomized to receive placebo will be offered riboflavin
      supplementation at the end of the study.

      The investigators will use multilevel modeling test for a main effect of intervention on
      delta BP from baseline to 16wk (and repeated at 8wk) adjusted for sex and age. Chi-squared
      test will be used to test for changes in frequency of raised BP (&gt;140/90). Then the
      investigators will test for effect modification according to MTHFR variant.
