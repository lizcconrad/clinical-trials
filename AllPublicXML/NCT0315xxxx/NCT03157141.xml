  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankle osteoarthritis is a progressive degenerative joint disease that is characterized by
      severe pain, loss of autonomy, diminished health-related quality of life, functional
      disability and diminished physical ability to fulfill occupational duties of life in its
      end-stage. Current surgical treatments for ankle osteoarthritis are ankle arthrodesis and
      total ankle replacement. Despite the good pain relief provided by these procedures, patients
      are still experiencing post-operatively important functional limitations in their activities
      of the daily living which affect their independency and quality of life. In order to remain
      capable of performing primary activities of the daily living, those patients have to make
      functional compensatory adaptations in the ipsilateral adjacent joints that will cause
      additional degenerative joint disease in those joints.

      Currently, the outcome of foot and ankle surgery is primarily based on clinical, radiographic
      and questionnaire outcomes. However, these outcome measures have been criticized for not
      being sensitive enough to detect clinically meaningful change in foot function. To tackle
      these shortcomings, an advanced clinical examination platform integrating
      pressure-force-kinematic measurement devices was developed and showed its clinical value for
      the detection of intrinsic foot mobility impairments. Surprisingly, up-to-now, no study has
      included this integrated use of three-dimensional multi-segment foot models, plantar pressure
      platform and a force platform to report on the functional outcome of an ankle arthrodesis or
      a total ankle replacement.

      Therefore, a multi-centre study will be conducted with two foot &amp; ankle surgery centres. Both
      centres are equipped with the same advanced clinical examination platform. It is believed
      that proposed approach has the potential to provide further insight in the true functional
      changes related to ankle arthrodesis and total ankle replacement. This may in turn result in
      improved rehabilitation, less risk for post-operative complications, earlier discharge and
      quicker resumption of normal activities of the daily living, which would make ankle
      arthrodesis and total ankle replacement more cost-efficient and could potentially affect
      thousands of patients each year. Therefore, the hypotheses of the present study are:

        -  Hypothesis (H1): Subjects with an ankle arthrodesis require a greater reorganization of
           foot and lower limb kinematic and kinetic patterns to respond to mechanical requirements
           of level walking compared to subjects with a total ankle replacement.

        -  Null hypothesis (H0): Subjects with an ankle arthrodesis do not require a greater
           reorganization of foot and lower limb kinematic and kinetic patterns to respond to
           mechanical requirements of level walking compared to subjects with a total ankle
           replacement.

    <description>Ankle arthrodesis consists of fusioning the joint surfaces of the ankle. The procedure will consist of removing the diseased cartilage and subchondral bone until bleeding of the cancellous bone surfaces is revealed. The bone ends will be opposed in the most appropriate and stable position and stabilized with screws or plates.</description>
