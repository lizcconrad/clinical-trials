  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African Americans (AA) are at higher risk to develop and go blind from glaucoma than
      Caucasians. While glaucoma medications can help delay disease progression and possible
      blindness, problems with poor adherence have been documented for both racial groups, with a
      greater prevalence among AA. Of the very few interventions targeting glaucoma medication
      adherence studied to date, several methodological limitations persist. For example, few have
      been subjected to rigorous randomized clinical trial (RCT) designs, the intervention itself
      was designed and studied predominantly among Caucasians and thereby limiting
      generalizability, the effects on adherence have been short-term, most have been evaluated on
      small sample sizes, and/or the focus of the intervention was solely on providing patient
      education regarding eye disease and management. Needed in this important yet understudied
      area are culturally-relevant, health promotion-based approaches which are 1) targeted to high
      risk populations, 2) theoretically driven, 3) relevant to the beliefs, language, and values
      of underserved populations as well as challenges related to glaucoma medication adherence, 4)
      designed to promote preparation and readiness to engage in healthy behaviors, and 5) train
      patients in skills to use in order to more effectively problem-solve ongoing obstacles
      related to adherence.

      The investigators published a paper in the Journal of Glaucoma investigating determinants
      related to objective medication adherence as measured by an electronic dosing aid (DA).
      Findings revealed poorer rates of adherence among AA patients with glaucoma compared to
      Caucasian patients with glaucoma. Evidence for racial differences in adherence have also been
      increasingly documented in the glaucoma literature. In a follow-up study with focus groups of
      AA's with glaucoma that was published in Optometry and Vision Sciences, the goal was to
      identify the specific barriers and facilitators related to glaucoma medication adherence
      among this high-risk group. Several key themes emerged such as patient, provider, and
      socioeconomic factors, along with barriers in views of health, perceived harm from treatment,
      costs, avoidant coping styles, forgetfulness, and in eyedrop administration/scheduling. The
      investigators used these results along with guidance from a consumer advisory board
      consisting of AA patients with glaucoma in order to develop and pilot test the resulting
      culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention. The pilot data demonstrated
      feasibility and favorable preliminary efficacy for the intervention to significantly improve
      medication adherence to further pursue in a clinical trial.

      Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of a culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention
      to increase rates of glaucoma medication adherence among AA patients with glaucoma as
      compared to usual care.

      Aim 2: To longitudinally examine the associations between medical, demographic, cultural,
      socioeconomic, and ocular factors and objective medication adherence rates among AA's with
      glaucoma in the usual care only group. This aim will explore what factors are associated with
      glaucoma medication adherence, as defined by objective adherence measures, during usual care.
      This information will facilitate hypothesis generation and testing for future studies.

      Aim 3: To longitudinally examine the associations between medical, demographic, cultural,
      socioeconomic, and ocular factors and objective medication adherence rates among AA's with
      glaucoma in the treatment arm (those receiving the treatment intervention). This aim will
      explore what patient-related factors are more or less likely to relate to the effectiveness
      of the intervention as defined by objective adherence. This information is useful for
      understanding which patients may ultimately most responsive to the intervention.

    <description>The investigators will use the Glaucoma Symptom Scale to assess visual and nonvisual symptoms which developed from a modified version of a checklist used in the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study. It has 10 items that ask respondents whether they have experienced certain symptoms (e.g., dryness) in the prior 4 weeks and to what extent they were bothered by these symptoms.</description>

    <description>The 18-item Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) will be used to assess patients' concerns about present/potential future adverse effects from their medications and their beliefs regarding the necessity of their medications. Scores are summed within each scale to create an overall scale score (range: 8-40 for a 'necessity scale' and 10-50 for a 'concerns scale'.</description>
