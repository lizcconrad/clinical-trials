  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
      bronchiectasis (BE) or pulmonary fibrosis (PF) are usually not curable with damaged pulmonary
      structure and function. Bronchial basal cells are proved to regenerate bronchus and alveoli
      to repair the pulmonary injuries. In this study, we intend to perform an open, single-armed
      phase I clinical trial by transplantation of autologous bronchial basal cells on patients
      suffered from COPD, BE or PF. During the treatment, autologous bronchial basal cells, which
      were isolated from fiberoptic bronchoscopy and expanded in vitro, will be injected directly
      into lesions by fiberoptic bronchoscopy after careful characterization. In the following 6
      months, the safety and efficacy of the treatment will be monitored by measuring the key
      clinical indicators.
