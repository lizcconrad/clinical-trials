  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The validation study is intended to provide comparative data on the diagnosis of vaginal
      infections as performed in primary care settings versus the diagnosis provided through
      standard diagnostic testing performed in a reference laboratory. The clinician and lab
      diagnoses will be compared to those obtained using the BD MAX Vaginal Panel on the BD MAX
      System.

      The primary goals of this study are to:

        1. Compare the level of agreement of clinician diagnosed bacterial vaginosis (BV) to
           vaginal swab samples evaluated for BV using Nugent's criteria and the BD MAX Vaginal
           Panel

        2. Compare the level of agreement of clinician diagnosed trichomonas vaginalis (TV) to the
           laboratory diagnosis of TV identified by quantitative PCR using the GeneXpert system by
           Cepheid and the BD MAX Vaginal Panel.

        3. Compare the level of agreement of clinician diagnosed yeast vaginitis to laboratory
           diagnosis of yeast identified with culture and the BD MAX Vaginal Panel.

      The secondary goals of this study include:

        1. Being able to describe the patterns of testing among clinicians in community practices
           providing routine care for women presenting with symptoms of vaginitis.

        2. Describe the treatments prescribed for women presenting with vaginitis and how these
           prescribed treatments are distributed in women with laboratory-confirmed diagnoses.

          2. Presenting with symptoms of vaginitis; vaginal discharge, vaginal odor, vulvar or
             vaginal itch, vulvar or vaginal discomfort (i.e. irritation, burning pain or vulvar

        Exclusion:

        Women who meet any of the following criteria by participant report will be excluded from
        the study:

        1.) Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude provision of
        consent, make participation in the study unsafe, complicate interpretation of study outcome
        data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives.
