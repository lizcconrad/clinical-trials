  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age,
      with a prevalence of approximately 5-10%. Polycystic ovary syndrome is diagnosed according to
      Rotterdam criteria by at least two of the following three key features: oligomenorrhea or
      amenorrhea; clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism; the presence of polycystic
      ovaries on ultrasound and exclusion of other endocrine disorders including
      hyperprolactinemia, thyroid dysfunction and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Polycystic ovary
      syndrome is also associated with insulin resistance, obesity and disorders of lipid
      metabolism, as well as infertility, although these findings have not been addressed in the
      Rotterdam criteria. Polycystic ovary syndrome is the major cause of anovulatory infertility.
      The recent studies suggest that anovulation resulting from ovarian follicle abnormalities in
      Polycystic ovary syndrome patients are 2-fold of normal ovaries. Firstly, early follicular
      growth is excessive, thus women with Polycystic ovary syndrome are characterized by an
      excessive number of small antral follicles (2- to 3-fold of normal ovaries). Secondly, the
      selection of one follicle from the increased pool of selectable follicles and its further
      maturation to a dominant follicle does not occur. This second abnormality in the
      folliculogenesis can cause menstrual dysfunction presented as oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea.
      Historically, Polycystic ovary syndrome treatment has not been curative in nature, instead
      treatments focus on resolution of clinical manifestations of the disease.
