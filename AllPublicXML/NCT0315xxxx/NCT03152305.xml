  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) during migraine attacks is possible and could
      contribute to pain initiation and maintenance. From now on, it was not possible to measure
      ICP in a non-invasive way. The development of a new tool allows non-invasive self-measures of
      ICP variations. Thus, it is possible for the first time to look for such ICP variations
      during migraine attacks and to conclude if this mechanism is implied in the pathophysiology
      of migraine.

      Womens presenting with regular menstrual migraine treated with triptans will be included in
      the study. Self-measure of ICP will be performed outside and during menstrual migraine
      attacks. The potential variations will be compared to the measures done on matched healthy
      women outside and during menses.
