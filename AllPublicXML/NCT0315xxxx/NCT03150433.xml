      This is a study testing the effects of behavioral sleep interventions on pain and brain
      function in sickle cell disease.

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to examine whether changes in sleep alter pain and pain-related
      outcomes in adults with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). As many as 70% of adults with SCD
      experience various sleep disturbances. Pain and sleep are inter-related, such that pain
      disturbs sleep and disturbed sleep amplifies pain and increases risk for developing chronic
      pain. Pain processing occurs in the central nervous system, where nociceptive input can be
      inhibited or facilitated and which can undergo both functional and structural plasticity.
      When plasticity results in amplification of pain, this central sensitization (CS) manifests
      as hyperalgesia, allodynia, and spreading of pain and is an important treatment target in its
      own right. A growing literature implicates central sensitization in SCD, and the
      investigators find a strong association between laboratory-evoked CS and sleep disturbance in
      SCD. The neural substrates involved in pain modulation are often disrupted in chronic pain,
      likely due to the demands pain places on cognitive resources, and similar effects are seen
      with chronic insomnia. It remains unclear whether these changes occur in SCD and if improving
      sleep improves central modulation of pain. The potential for improved sleep to reduce pain
      and CS requires additional investigation, particularly given the significance of sleep
      disturbance as a mutable risk factor. The investigators will conduct a randomized trial in
      which it will be determined whether improvements in sleep reduce pain and alter brain
      processing of pain and cognitive stimuli. The aims are to determine whether treatment of
      sleep improves pain outcomes in SCD and to determine whether treatment of sleep alters
      functional connectivity of cognitive and pain modulatory networks using brain imaging in SCD.
