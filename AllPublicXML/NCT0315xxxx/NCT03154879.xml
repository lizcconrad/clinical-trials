  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators examine the prognostic value of continuous electroencephalography on
      frontal area of brain according to time by performing amplitude-integrated
      electroencephalography (aEEG) on cardiac arrest patients receiving therapeutic hypothermia.

    <measure>Comparison of time to normal trace to good neurological outcome evaluated by cerebral performance category (CPC) score 1 to 2</measure>
    <time_frame>at day 180</time_frame>
    <description>Time to normal trace is defined as time to regained normal trace on aEEG after return of spontaneous circulation.
The normal trace is defined as continuous cortical activity on the raw EEG scan; in addition, the upper margin of the aEEG scan, referred to as the aEEG maximum, was &gt;10 uV, and the lower margin of the aEEG scan, referred to as the aEEG minimum, was &gt;5 uV.</description>

The normal trace is defined as continuous cortical activity on the raw EEG scan; in addition, the upper margin of the aEEG scan, referred to as the aEEG maximum, was &gt;10 uV, and the lower margin of the aEEG scan, referred to as the aEEG minimum, was &gt;5 uV.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of unfavorable aEEG patterns to poor neurological outcome evaluated by CPC score 3 to 5</measure>
    <time_frame>at day 180</time_frame>
    <description>Unfavorable aEEG patterns include flat trace (FT), burst-suppression (BS) and status epilepticus (SE).
FT is defined as isoelectric activity. BS is defined as the virtual absence of activity (&lt;2uV) between bursts of high voltage (&gt;25 uV).
SE was defined as repetitive epileptiform discharges with amplitudes &gt;50 uV and a median frequency 1 Hz for &gt;30 min.</description>
