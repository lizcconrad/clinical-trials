  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if TBI-1401(HF10) in combination with ipilimumab is
      effective in Japanese patients with stages IIIB, IIIC, or IV unresectable or metastatic
      melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess efficacy and safety with repeated administration of
      intratumoral injections of TBI-1401(HF10) at 1x10^7 TCID50/mL in combination with intravenous
      infusions of 3mg/kg ipilimumab in Japanese patients.

      This is a single arm, open label Phase II study, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      TBI-1401(HF10) treatment in combination with the immunologic checkpoint inhibitor, ipilimumab
      (anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody). The study population will include patients with Stage
      IIIB, IIIC or IV unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma who are ipilimumab-eligible.

      Patients will receive the dose of 1x10^7 TCID50/mL TBI-1401(HF10) (for a total of 6
      injections; the first 4 injections at 1-week intervals; the remaining 2 injections at 3-week
      intervals) + ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg (for a total of 4 intravenous infusions, each administered
      at 3-week intervals).

      Following combination therapy, patients may continue to receive the 1x10^7 TCID50/mL
      TBI-1401(HF10) alone for up to an additional 13 injections (total of 19 injections = 1 year)
      if they have tolerated the study treatment, are responding, have stable disease, or have
      progressive disease that is not clinically significant in the judgment of the Investigator.
