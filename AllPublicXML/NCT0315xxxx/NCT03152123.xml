    <measure>Maximum effect (Emax) on Drug Liking visual analog scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Drug liking VAS is one of the measures of balance of effects that assesses the degree that a participant likes a drug effect at the time the question is being asked (that is, at the moment). It is scored using a 100 millimeter (mm) bipolar visual analogue scale (VAS) anchored in the center with a neutral anchor of &quot;neither like nor dislike&quot; (score of 50 mm), on the left with &quot;strong disliking&quot; (score of 0 mm) and on the right with &quot;strong liking&quot; (score of 100 mm).</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Drug Liking VAS (minimum effect [Emin] and time-averaged area under the effect curve to 24 hours after study drug administration [TA_AUE])</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Drug liking VAS is one of the measures of balance of effects that assesses the degree that a participant likes a drug effect at the time the question is being asked (that is, at the moment). It is scored using a 100 millimeter (mm) bipolar visual analogue scale (VAS) anchored in the center with a neutral anchor of &quot;neither like nor dislike&quot; (score of 50 mm), on the left with &quot;strong disliking&quot; (score of 0 mm) and on the right with &quot;strong liking&quot; (score of 100 mm).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Drug Liking VAS (Emax/Emin)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Overall drug liking VAS is one of the measures of balance of effects that assesses the participant's global perception of drug liking (that is, effects over the whole course of the drug experience including any carryover effects). A 100 mm bipolar VAS is used to assess response based on a score ranging from 0 mm to 100 mm (0 mm = &quot;strong disliking&quot;, 50 mm= &quot;neither like nor dislike&quot;, and 100 mm= &quot;strong liking&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Take Drug Again VAS (Emax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Take drug again VAS is one of the measures of balance of effects. It is a subjective assessment of the degree to which a participant would desire to take the drug again if given the opportunity. It is presented on a 100 mm bipolar VAS with score ranging from 0 mm to 100 mm (score of 0 mm = &quot;definitely not&quot;, 50 mm = &quot;do not care&quot;, and 100 mm = &quot;definitely so&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Good Effects VAS (Emax and TA_AUE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Good drug effects VAS is one of the measures of positive effects that assesses the effect experienced by the participant on a 100 mm unipolar VAS, where responses are unidirectional and range from a response of 'none' (score of 0 mm= definitely not) to 'extremely' (score of 100 mm= definitely so).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bad Effects VAS (Emax and TA_AUE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Bad effects VAS is one of the measures of negative effects that assesses the effect experienced by the participant on a 100 mm unipolar VAS, where responses are unidirectional and range from a response of 'none' (score of 0 mm= definitely not) to 'extremely' (score of 100 mm= definitely so).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ARCI-A scale (Emax and TA_AUE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>ARCI-A is measure of other stimulant effects. It is a set of 13 questions in which each question contributes to total score. Participants select 'False' / 'True' for response. One point given for each response that agrees with scoring direction, true items receive score of 1 if answer 'True', false items receive score of 1 if answer 'False'. No points if answer is opposite to scoring direction. Score range: 0 to 13, higher score indicated higher other subjective effects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ARCI-BG scale (Emax and TA_AUE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>ARCI-BG is measure of other subjective effects. It is a set of 13 questions in which each question contributes to total score. Participants select 'False' / 'True' for response. One point given for each response that agrees with scoring direction, true items receive score of 1 if answer 'True', false items receive score of 1 if answer 'False'. No points if answer is opposite to scoring direction. Score range: 0 to 13, higher score indicated higher other subjective effects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Agitation/Relaxation VAS (Emax and TA_AUE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Agitation/Relaxation VAS assesses the effect experienced by the participant on a 100 mm unipolar VAS, where responses are unidirectional and range from a response of 'none' (score of 0 mm) to 'extremely' (score of 100 mm).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Drug Similarity VAS (score at 24 hours after study drug administration)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Drug similarity VAS is one of the measures of other subjective effects. It assesses the similarity of the drug recently received by the participant on a 100 mm unipolar VAS, where responses are unidirectional and range from a response of 'none' (score of 0 mm= not at all similar) to 'extremely' (score of 100 mm= very similar).</description>
