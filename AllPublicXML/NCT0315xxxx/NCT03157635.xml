  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, first-in-human study consisting of 3 sequential parts and an open-label
      extension (OLE) in which the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of single-doses of RO7112689 will be evaluated in healthy volunteers
      (HV) during Part I, and safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of RO7112689 will be evaluated in
      participants with PNH during Parts 2, 3, and OLE of the study. Efficacy of RO7112689 will be
      evaluated in Parts 2 and 3.
