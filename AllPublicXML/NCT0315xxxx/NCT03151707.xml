  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effects of exogenously administered
      nicotinamide riboside (NR) on brain NAD+/NADH ratio and bioenergetics functions in healthy
      individuals using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS) imaging.

      The secondary aim is to investigate the effects of NR on brain structure and neurotransmitter
      functions using other neuroimaging methods.
