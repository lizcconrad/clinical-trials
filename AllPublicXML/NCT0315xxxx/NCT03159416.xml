  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I, single-dose, open-label trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of inclisiran subcutaneous (SC)
      injection in participants with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment compared to
      participants with normal renal function.
