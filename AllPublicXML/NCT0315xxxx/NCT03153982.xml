  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib in patients
      with operable Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who are planned for definitive
      surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will take ruxolitinib twice daily during the pre-operative window for 14-21 days, or
      up to 28 days for delays in planned surgery. Ruxolitinib will be dispensed in 5 mg tablets.
      Participants will either take three tablets (15 mg) in the morning and evening, or four
      tablets in the morning and evening (20 mg). Participants will be asked to fill out a drug
      diary indicating when doses of study drug are taken and any side effects they experience.

      Dose will be assigned based on participant platelet count at baseline:

        1. Patients with a platelet count of 200,000 or greater will take 20 mg twice daily (four
           5mg tablets in the morning and four 5mg tablets in the evening);

        2. Patients with a platelet count between150,000 and 200,000 will take 15 mg twice daily
           (three 5 mg tablets in the morning and three 5 mg tablets in the evening).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed, primary or recurrent, head and neck
             squamous cell carcinoma, including variants. Patients must have at least one
             measureable lesion in accordance with RECIST 1.1 (tumor diameter ≥ 1 cm; short-axis
             lymph node diameter ≥ 1.5 cm) OR by caliper measurement (tumor diameter ≥ 1 cm). Any
             diagnostic pretreatment biopsy sample is acceptable including FNA.

          2. Primary tumors of any head and neck (oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx)
             site will be included.

          3. Surgical resection of head and neck must be planned, either as primary treatment or
             salvage. Patients must undergo research biopsy prior to receiving drug.

          4. Age ≥ 18 years.

          5. ECOG performance status 0-2 (See Appendix 1).

          6. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             (sensitivity ≤ 25IU HCG/L) within 4 weeks prior to registration and will be repeated
             within 72 hours prior to the start of study drug administration.

          7. Persons of reproductive potential must agree to use and utilize an adequate method of
             contraception throughout treatment and for at least 12 weeks after study drug is
             stopped. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential must be advised of
             the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk
             factors for an unintentional pregnancy.

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/ul, platelets ≥ 150,000/ul.

               2. Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who fail to meet the above criteria.

          2. Prior therapy for head and neck cancer is allowed, and the number of treatments is not
             limited. However, any systemic therapy should have been completed at least 30 days
             prior to study enrollment. Any radiation to the head and neck should have been
             completed at least 30 days prior to study enrollment. Palliative radiation outside of
             the head and neck does not require a washout.

          3. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Women (patients or partners of male patients) of
             childbearing potential (WOCBP) must practice acceptable methods of birth control to
             prevent pregnancy. All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test within 4 weeks prior
             to registration, and this must be repeated within 72 hours prior to first receiving
             ruxolitinib. If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive
             ruxolitinib and must not be enrolled in the study.

          4. Any unresolved chronic toxicity ≥ grade 2 from previous anticancer therapy (except
             alopecia and anemia), according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0
             (CTCAE).

             with warfarin (coumadin). Patients who are treated with low molecular weight heparin
             or fondaparinux are eligible.

         10. History of significant bleeding disorder unrelated to cancer, including: diagnosed
             congenital bleeding disorders (e.g., von Willebrand's disease, diagnosed acquired
