  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the investigators propose to carry out a prospective study consisting of a systematic
      research of digestive symptoms in patients with SGSp with the validated Global symptom score
      (GSS) questionnaire, which allowed to grades severity of 10 digestive symptoms (absent, mild,
      moderate, or severe), asthenia and fever.

    <textblock>
      Primary Sjögren syndrome (SGSp) is an autoimmune disease defined by the association of sicca
      syndrome in the absence of other connective tissues (ie rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
      erythematosus, scleroderma, dermatopolymyositis). SGSp is complicated by several visceral
      involvements (pulmonary, renal, neurological, systemic vasculitis ...) and by a chronic
      alteration of the quality of life related to asthenia, chronic pain and sicca syndrome. Two
      European-validated scales are currently used in daily clinical practice to assess these two
      facets of the disease, respectively EUSSAR Sjogren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI)
      and ESSDAI (EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index). Neither of these two scores
      evaluate the digestive impairment. Indeed, digestive complaints have been evaluated in a few
      studies, with a prevalence of 30 to 65%. The precise etiopathogeny of such digestive
      involvements remains unknown.
