    <textblock>
      Prostate biopsies are the gold standard for prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis. They are
      performed according to the results of the measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in
      the serum of patients with PCa suspicion. More than half of the prostate biopsies reveal
      eventually negative because of the poor specificity of prostate-specific antigen assay. The
      Prostate Health Index (PHI) is a new diagnostic tool that has been described as a good
      predictor of prostate biopsy outcome. No large study has been performed so far in France.
      This study aim to evaluate Prostate Health Index diagnostic performances in a large
      multicentric French cohort of patients undergoing prostate biopsies because of clinical
      and/or biological suspicion of prostate cancer.

      Prostate Health Index will be measured in patients directed to prostate biopsies according to
      usual practices. Inclusion of 400 patients within 6 months in 12 French centers is expected.
      The ability of Prostate Health Index to predict prostate cancer at biopsy will be evaluated
      in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic diagnostic performances including sensitivity,
      specificity, predictive values, diagnostic accuracy, area under receiver operating curves and
      decision curve analyses.
