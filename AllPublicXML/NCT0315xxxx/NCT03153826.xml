    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent airway
      obstruction and inflammatory response of the lungs and bronchi. Episodes of exacerbations
      contribute to increase the severity and prognosis of the disease. Muscle dysfunction (loss of
      strength and muscle mass) is one of comorbidities affecting 30% to 60% of patients and
      playing a key role in their prognosis. Indeed, several studies have shown muscle weakness
      during hospitalization for exacerbation of COPD by measure of maximal voluntary contraction
      of quadriceps (MVCQ), but the results are variable from one patient to another. Moreover, no
      study was interested in the change of muscle mass in patients hospitalized for an
      exacerbation of COPD. Several mechanisms have been mentioned but not demonstrated: systemics
      factors (initial amyotrophy, inflammation, oxidative stress, corticotherapy, hypoxia…) but
      also physical inactivity. In this context, identifying factors associated with the onset of
      muscle weakness during hospitalization for exacerbation of COPD is a necessary step to better
      understand the mechanisms and consider a personalized therapeutic approach that can improve
      the functional and clinical prognosis of disease.

      The primary outcome is to identify the clinical and biological determinants associated with
      the onset of amyotrophy (Measure by ultrasound of sectional area of the Rectus Femoris,
      CSARF), during hospitalization for exacerbation of COPD. The secondary outcome is to identify
      the clinical and biological determinants associated with the onset of MVCQ decrease, during
      hospitalization for exacerbation of COPD.

      120 patients hospitalized for exacerbation of COPD will be recruited in two hospitals (CHU
      Montpellier - CHU Grenoble, FRANCE). The measures of CSARF and MVCQ are carried out on the
      second, fifth, eighth day of hospitalization, on discharge and on the sixtieth day after
      hospitalization. A blood test will be performed on the second day of hospitalization to
      explore different markers of inflammation and oxydative stress. Moreover, to quantify the
      level of physical activity (number of steps), each patient will carry a pedometer throughout
      the duration of hospitalization.

      At the end of protocol, two groups will be made from the median of CSARF : patients with a
      small reduction in CSARF compared to patients with a greater reduction in SSRF between the
      second and eighth days of hospitalization (or between the second day of hospitalization and
      discharge). Then clinical (comorbidities, severity disease, initial weakness, initial
      amyotrophy, usual physical activity before hospitalization, treatment, exacerbation number in
      the previous year…) and biological (markers of inflammation and oxydative stress)
      determinants were compared between the two groups.

      Thus, the identification of the determinants associated with the onset of amyotrophy induced
      during exacerbation of COPD will guide research for exploration of physiopathological
      mechanisms of this muscular dysfunction in the exacerbation of COPD as well as to identify a
      personalized support.
