  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Internet-based self-help programs are personalized, self-guided interventions delivered over
      a computer, mobile device, or other Internet platform and focused on improving knowledge,
      awareness, or behavior change for a mental or physical health problem. Through previous and
      on-going projects at VACT, the investigators are developing a general strategy for
      implementing Internet-based Self-help programs in VA primary care, specifically among Patient
      Aligned Care Teams (PACT) and Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI) providers. An
      implementation strategy is defined as a systematic intervention to integrate evidence-based
      health innovations into usual care. The strategy the investigators propose to test consists
      of four core components: (1) a clinical intermediary for patient support, (2) provider/staff
      facilitation and education, (3) patient education, and (4) stepped-care for those requiring
      additional treatment. In the proposed study, the investigators will compare this strategy to
      a low intensity (control) strategy with respect to the implementation related outcomes of
      patent engagement, provider adoption through referral to the program, and patient completion,
      over a six-month active implementation period. The investigators will target the very common
      clinical problem of insomnia and use the SHUTiTM program, a 6-week self-guided program
      utilizing standard cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques for the treatment of chronic
      insomnia. The program has been shown to improve insomnia severity and other sleep related
      outcomes in a number of controlled trials. The clinical effectiveness of SHUTiTM will be
      evaluated using clinical insomnia outcomes obtained on all patients enrolled over the 6-month
      active implementation periods. The purpose this study is to evaluate the preliminary (1)
      effectiveness of an implementation strategy for Internet-based Self-help Interventions and
      (2) clinical outcomes of a specific Internet-based self-help program for insomnia, SHUTiTM,
      in VA Connecticut outpatient primary care. The primary hypothesis is that the experimental
      implementation strategy the investigators are developing, relative to a control strategy,
      will result in higher rates of program engagement by patients, greater provider adoption
      through referral to the program, greater program completion, and improved patient insomnia
      outcomes.

      Objective: The purpose this study is to evaluate the preliminary (1) effectiveness of an
      implementation strategy for Internet-based Self-help Interventions and (2) clinical outcomes
      of a specific Internet-based self-help program for insomnia, SHUTiTM, in VA Connecticut
      outpatient primary care. The primary hypothesis is that the experimental implementation
      strategy the investigators are developing, relative to a control strategy, will result in
      higher rates of program engagement by patients, greater provider adoption through referral to
      the program, greater program completion, and improved patient insomnia outcomes.

      Research Design: The investigators will employ a hybrid implementation-effectiveness study
      design through which the investigators will primarily test the effectiveness of the
      implementation strategy, while secondarily evaluating the clinical effectiveness of the
      SHUTiTM program. The investigators will use a quasi-experimental pre-/post-cohort design
      whereby SHUTiTM will initially be implemented using a low-intensity (control) strategy,
      followed by implementation using the experimental strategy. The SHUTiTM program's association
      with clinical response will be evaluated in an uncontrolled pre-/post-format.

      Methodology: Internet-based self-help programs are personalized, self-guided interventions
      delivered over a computer, mobile device, or other Internet platform and focused on improving
      knowledge, awareness, or behavior change for a mental or physical health problem. Through
      previous and on-going projects at VACT, the investigators are developing a general strategy
      for implementing Internet-based Self-help programs in VA primary care, specifically among
      Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) and Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI)
      providers. An implementation strategy is defined as a systematic intervention to integrate
      evidence-based health innovations into usual care. The strategy the investigators propose to
      test consists of four core components: (1) a clinical intermediary for patient support, (2)
      provider/staff facilitation and education, (3) patient education, and (4) stepped-care for
      those requiring additional treatment. The investigators' currently approved protocol (#0002)
      involves interviewing VA providers, administrators, and staff in order to expand and modify
      the components of this strategy. In the proposed study, the investigators will compare this
      strategy to a low intensity (control) strategy with respect to the implementation related
      outcomes of patent engagement, provider adoption through referral to the program, and patient
      completion, over a six-month active implementation period. Use of the program will continue
      and implementation outcomes will be gathered over an additional one-year sustainment phase.
      The investigators will target the very common clinical problem of insomnia and use the
      SHUTiTM program, a 6-week self-guided program utilizing standard cognitive-behavioral therapy
      (CBT) techniques for the treatment of chronic insomnia. The program has been shown to improve
      insomnia severity and other sleep related outcomes in a number of controlled trials. The
      clinical effectiveness of SHUTiTM will be evaluated using clinical insomnia outcomes obtained
      on all patients enrolled over the 6-month active implementation periods.

      Impact/Significance: The development and testing of evidence-based implementation strategies
      for Internet-based self-help programs in VA outpatient care is essential given that (1) there
      is an increasing number of Internet-based self-help programs providing evidence-based
      treatment for a variety of mental and behavioral health disorders, (2) VA has committed to
      improving access to care, especially evidence-based and self-care resources, and (3) there is
      a Congressional mandate that VA implement Internet-based care. This will be first controlled
      trial of an implementation strategy for Internet-based self-help programs in a VA primary
      care (PACT/PCMHI) context.

    <description>The investigators will use the program, SHUTiTM for the treatment of insomnia. The intervention is a CBT-based 6-week, self-administered course accessed via the Internet on mobile, desk-top, and other devices. The program is split into six modules, completed weekly, which include instruction on psycho-education, stimulus control, relaxation training, sleep restriction, medication tapering, and addressing cognitive distortions. The content is delivered via text, video vignettes, case histories, interactive learning tools, interactive skills assessments, symptom assessments, and a sleep log. Homework is assigned after each module. Providers and support staff can follow treatment progress via access to a dashboard of patient information collected by the program. Such information includes progress through the modules, date of last engagement, symptom assessment outcomes, and sleep log data abstracted into commonly used sleep indices such as sleep onset latency and sleep efficiency.</description>
