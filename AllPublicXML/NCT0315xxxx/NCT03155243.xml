  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at evaluating real life effectiveness of originator adalimumab (Humira®)
      participants with active non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis (NIIPPU)
      despite high-dose corticosteroid therapy; including effect on ocular inflammation,
      health-related quality of life, health resource utilization, work ability and medication
      burden, as well as describe the characteristics of NIIPPU participants treated with Humira®
      in the real-life setting.
