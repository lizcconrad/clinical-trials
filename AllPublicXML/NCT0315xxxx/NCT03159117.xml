  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the safety and effectiveness of the
      study drug, PF-06688992. Before this study, PF-06688992 has never been given to people.

      PF-06688992 is a targeted therapy for people with cancer. The investigators linked a
      chemotherapy drug to an antibody (protein found in the blood). The antibody will connect to
      GD3 which is found on most melanomas but on very few other cells in the body. The
      investigators hope that in this way, it will deliver this chemotherapy directly to the
      melanoma and not to normal tissues.

    <description>This clinical study will include two parts. Part 1 will be a dose-finding phase in which patients will be treated with various doses of Pfizer PF-06688992. (PF 06688992) will be administered by the intravenous route over approximately 60 minutes every 21 days. The dose expansion phase will include a single cohort of up to 20 evaluable patients treated at the recommend dose.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological diagnosis of melanoma confirmed at MSKCC

          -  Measurable unresectable Stage III or IV Malignant Melanoma and Response Criteria in
             Solid Tumors [RECIST], Version 1.1.

          -  Patients must have progressed on prior approved checkpoint inhibitor therapy, not
             tolerated approved checkpoint inhibitor therapy, or have a contraindication to
             approved checkpoint inhibitors. Patients with stable disease after approved checkpoint
             inhibitor therapy will also be eligible.

          -  Patients whose melanomas harbor a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation must have progressed on
             a RAF inhibitor. Patients who had to discontinue RAF inhibitor therapy because of
             toxicity but who did not progress will be eligible unless they responded to therapy.
             In that case, they will not be eligible unless they progress.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1.

          -  Adequate Bone Marrow Function as defined by:

             °≥1,500/mm^3 or ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L;

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 or ≥ 100 x 109/L;

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL.

          -  Adequate Renal Function as defined by:

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); or

               -  Estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min as calculated using the method
                  standard for the institution.

          -  Adequate Liver Function as defined by:

               -  Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless the patient has documented Gilbert
                  syndrome;

               -  Aspartate and Alanine Aminotransferase (AST &amp; ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN; ≤ 5.0 x ULN if
                  there is liver involvement secondary to tumor;

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN; (≤ 5 x ULN in case of bone metastasis).

          -  QTc interval &lt; 470 msec.

          -  Recovery from all prior surgical or adjuvant treatment-related toxicities, to Baseline
             status, or a CTCAE Grade of 0 or 1, except for toxicities not considered a safety
             risk, such as alopecia. Post-surgical pain will not be considered a basis for
             exclusion.

          -  Negative serum/urine pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential).

          -  Male and female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly
             effective method of contraception throughout the study and for at least 28 days after
             the last dose of assigned treatment. A patient is of childbearing potential if, in the
             opinion of the investigator, he/she is biologically capable of having children and is
             sexually active.

          -  Evidence of a signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient
             has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with the study scheduled visits, treatment plans,
             laboratory tests and other procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids in part 1 or part

          -  For part 1 (dose escalation) only, patients with previously diagnosed brain metastases
             are eligible if they have completed their treatment and have recovered from the acute
             effects of radiation therapy or surgery prior to the start of study medication, have
             discontinued corticosteroid treatment for these metastases for at least 4 weeks and
             are neurologically stable. Patients with brain metastases are excluded from part 2
             (dose expansion).

          -  Patients with uveal melanoma will not be eligible as these tumors show low expression
             of GD3.

          -  Major surgery, radiation therapy or systemic anti-cancer therapy within 2 weeks of
             starting study treatment.

                  judgment.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding; males and females of childbearing potential who are
             unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as outlined in
             this protocol for the duration of the study and for at least 28 days after last dose
             of investigational product.

          -  Patients currently receiving active treatment for melanoma.

          -  Any of the following in the previous 6 months: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable
             angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack.

          -  Any ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE Grade &gt;2, NCI CTCAE Grade 4 atrial
             fibrillation, or QTcF interval &gt;470 msec, except for documented Right Bundle Branch
             Block, at screening.

          -  Chronic Bronchitis or Emphysema requiring oxygen therapy within the last 6 months.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, including recent
             (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, or laboratory
             abnormality or uncontrolled hypertension that may increase the risk associated with
             study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with
             the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would
             make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
