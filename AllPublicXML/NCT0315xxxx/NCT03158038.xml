  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective annual release study is designed to evaluate the safety of 1 new influenza
      virus vaccine strain to be included in FluMist Quadrivalent for the 2017-2018 influenza
      season.

    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled release study will enroll
      approximately 300 healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age (not yet reached their 50th birthday).
      Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 4:1 fashion to receive a single dose of
      monovalent vaccine or placebo by intranasal spray. Randomization will be stratified by site.
      This study will be conducted at 2 sites in the United States of America. Each subject will
      receive 1 dose of investigational product on Day 1. The duration of study participation for
      each subject is the time from study vaccination through 180 days after study vaccination.

    <description>Solicited symptoms are predefined symptoms or events to be specifically inquired about and assessed daily after vaccine administration up to 14 days after vaccination. The solicited symptoms include fever greater than (&gt;) 100.0 degrees F (37.8 degrees Celsius), runny nose, sore throat, cough, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, decreased activity and headache. Results will be reported for all solicited symptoms except fever &gt;= 101 degrees F (reported as primary outcome) within 7 days after vaccination and all solicited symptoms within 14 days after vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent AEs are events between administration of study drug and up to 14 days after vaccination that are absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. Results will be given for AEs reported within 7 days and 14 days after vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs) and New Onset Chronic Diseases (NOCDs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 28 and 180 days after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason; death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent SAEs are serious events between administration of study drug and up to 180 days after the dose that are absent before treatment or that worsen relative to pretreatment state. An NOCD is a newly diagnosed medical condition that is of a chronic, ongoing nature and is assessed by the investigator as medically significant. Results will be given for TESAEs and NOCDs reported within 28 days and 180 days after vaccination.</description>
