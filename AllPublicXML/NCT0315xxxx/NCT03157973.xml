      This study evaluates the effects of an eHealth tool and psychosocial support on anxiety,
      depression and health-related quality of life in patients undergoing surgical treatment for
      abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Participants in the intervention group will receive access
      to the eHealth tool and structured follow-up with a contact nurse, the control group will
      receive standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic anuerysm (AAA) is associated with a decreased health-related quality of life
      (HRQoL) both at diagnosis and during surgical treatment, although recent studies report
      somewhat contradictory results. In qualitative research, it has been shown that the health
      care system fails to meet the patients' information need, as well as their need for
      psychosocial support during the care process. The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate
      the effects of an intervention comprising an eHealth tool with individualized information in
      combination with structured follow-up with a contact nurse on anxiety, depression and HRQoL
      in patients undergoing surgical treatment for AAA.

      Patients who are planned for elective surgical treatment, fulfil the inclusion criteria and
      none of the exclusion criteria will fill out questionnaires. The control group will receive
      information and follow-up per institution's standard of care. The intervention group will be
      given access to the eHealth tool, containing individualized information about the condition,
      surgical procedure and self-care. They will also receive structured follow-up by a contact
      nurse at discharge, 3 and 12 months postoperatively.
