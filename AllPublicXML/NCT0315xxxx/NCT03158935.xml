  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b study for patients with metastatic (cancer has spread to various parts of
      the body) melanoma and ovarian cancer. The main purpose is to examine the safety and efficacy
      of administering pembrolizumab after receiving chemotherapy, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
      (TIL) and low dose interleukin 2 (IL-2).

      Patients will first receive either cyclophosphamide, or cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.
      These are chemotherapy agents that prepare the body to receive TILs.

      Patients are then infused with autologous TILs, a type of white blood cell that recognizes
      tumor cells and enters them, thereby causing tumor cells to break down.

      Following TILs infusion, patients will receive low-dose IL-2 therapy. This is a type of
      protein that is intended to activate and stimulate the growth of cells in the patient's
      immune system.

      If the patient meets the required criteria, they will be given pembrolizumab, a monoclonal
      antibody (drug made up of cloned immune cells) that is designed to block a protein called
      programed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) which will allow the body's immune system to kill the
      cancer cells.

      This study will involve treatment with chemotherapy, TILs, IL-2, pembrolizumab, tests and
      procedures done for safety, and the collection of archival tumor tissue, fresh tumor
      biopsies, and blood samples for biomarker research.

          3. Resolution of TIL protocol related adverse events to grade 2 or less. Otherwise,
             patients may proceed with pembrolizumab therapy if the treating investigator, after
             discussion with the Sponsor, determines that residual TIL therapy related adverse
             events are not clinically significant.

        Cohort 1 and 2 Post-TIL (pembrolizumab) exclusion criteria:

          1. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy. (Prophylactic antibiotics and

             trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial,
             or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the
             treating investigator.

          3. Development of a condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would be a
             contraindication for initiating pembrolizumab therapy.
