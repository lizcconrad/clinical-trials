    <textblock>
      The methodology is a feasibility study to determine the feasibility of assessing people in
      the community with a neurological condition before proceeding towards a full powered
      community trial evaluating the influence of intrathecal baclofen.

      The purpose of this proposed research will evaluate a feasible method to assess the
      respiratory status of people with neurological conditions receiving or scheduled to receive
      Intrathecal Baclofen. The use of Intrathecal Baclofen to manage severe spasticity is a
      developing treatment option with a limited research base, particularly when evaluating the
      influence of intrathecal baclofen on the respiratory system. The proposed research is derived
      from clinical practice and involves joint collaboration between clinical team, research
      professionals and patients.

      In order for the study to evaluate the influence of Intrathecal baclofen has on the
      respiratory system, the proposed research will need to develop and evaluate a method of
      assessing people in the community ensuring it's feasible for people with neurological
      conditions. Prior to implementing a full powered community trial to evaluate the influence of
      intrathecal baclofen on people with neurological conditions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  -Adults over the age of 18

          -  A person who is able to provide consent or a family member/ close friend who is able
             to assent on behalf of the participant

          -  A person or a family member/ close friend who is able to understand English
             (understand written English and spoken instructions)

          -  A person currently receiving Intrathecal Baclofen or is scheduled to receive
             Intrathecal Baclofen (awaiting fitting of pump) therapy to manage spasticity

          -  A patient of the Solent/ University Hospitals Southampton NHS Foundation Trust
             Intrathecal baclofen service

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  -Pre-existing use of overnight non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and is compliant with
             NIV treatment

          -  A person who is unable to consent to the study and does not have a family/ close
             person to assent

          -  The study will exclude a person who is unable to independently remove the
             polysomnography and is also without supervision from another person (carer or partner)
             during the night. This ensures the participant is able to take off the polysomnography
             (or assisted by a carer) if it becomes uncomfortable and/or causes distress.
