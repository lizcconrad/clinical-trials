      The purposes of these studies are to investigate:

      Differences in abductor hallucis muscles'EMG activities during different postural tasks
      between individuals with normal foot alignment and functional flat foot. Differences in
      abductor hallucis muscles'H-reflex amplitudes between individuals with normal foot alignment
      and functional flat foot. Changes in abductor hallucis muscles'EMG activities during
      different postural tasks after a 3-week short foot exercises training regimen in individuals
      with functional flat foot. Changes in abductor hallucis muscles'H-reflex amplitudes after a
      3-week short foot exercises training regimen in individuals with functional flat foot.
      hypotheses: Peak-to-peak amplitudes and ratios of abductor hallucis muscles and tibialis
      anterior muscles during different postural tasks were significantly lower in individual with
      functional flat foot when compared to those with normal foot alignments. H-reflex amplitudes
      of abductor hallucis muscles were significantly lower in individual with functional flat foot
      when compared to those with normal foot alignments. Changes of peak-to-peak amplitudes and
      ratios of abductor hallucis muscles and tibialis anterior muscles during different postural
      tasks were significantly different in individuals with functional flat foot after a 3-week
      short foot exercise training regimen. Changes of H-reflex amplitudes of abductor hallucis
      muscles were significantly different in individuals with functional flat foot after a 3-week
      short foot exercise training regimen
