  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quality of life (QoL) is an important factor for successful aging. Telomere length is an
      indicator of cellular aging and cumulative biological stress and is thus related to health
      status and survival. However, the relationship between QoL and telomere length has not yet
      been examined. In this study we investigated the relationship between leukocyte telomere
      length (LTL) and QoL.

      However, the relationship between overall QoL and LTL has not previously been investigated.
      Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the relationship between LTL and QoL. QoL was
      measured by the Korean version of the 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36), which is a
      multidimensional scale consisting of subjective evaluation.
