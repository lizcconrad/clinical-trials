  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30,000 adults in Quebec over the age of 50 suffer a fragility fracture each
      year. Fractures can affect a person's health, well-being and autonomy. Personal costs of
      these fractures are high, with as many as 50% of hip fracture patients being unable to return
      their pre-fracture level of autonomy.

      Homecare and community services provide customary rehabilitation support immediately
      following discharge from acute-care, though this contribution can be limited by lack of
      resources. For those patients at risk of negative outcomes, we have demonstrated clinically
      important benefits of extended exercise rehabilitation programs offered beyond the regular
      rehabilitation period on improving physical function.

      Through advances in sensor and telecommunication technology, eHealth solutions incorporated
      within homecare services as an integral part of the continuum of care can lead to better
      patient and health professional experience, improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs to the
      healthcare system.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the implementation of a 4-month community-based
      extended-rehabilitation e-Monitoring and Coaching support program is more effective at
      improving mobility in community-dwelling elderly patients who have sustained a fracture than
      a printed material support program, and if these effects persist 6 months after
      discontinuation.

    <description>Measured as an ordinal mobility response variable quantified by the number of minimal clinically important changes (MIC) a participant attains using the gait speed and 30 second Sit to Stand tests. A person making no MIC in either measure is given a response category of 0, the lowest. A person changing by 1 MIC on only of the measures (either one) will be given a value of 1; a MIC gain on both measures would be assigned a value of 2, and so forth.</description>
