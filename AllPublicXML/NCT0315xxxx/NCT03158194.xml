      This is a study to develop a protocol on Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for asthma-related
      anxiety that in a consecutive study can be translated to internet-delivered CBT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases around the world, with a high prevalence of
      anxiety disorders. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been shown to increase psychological
      well-being for anxiety-related asthma. Our primary aim is to develop a standardized CBT
      protocol for asthma-related anxiety that can be transferred to internet-delivered CBT. Ten
      participants will be included in a single-subject multiple baseline design. They will all
      receive 10-12 sessions of CBT.
