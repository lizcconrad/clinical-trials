    <textblock>
      This is a 3-arm cluster randomized controlled study that compares a trained lay provided
      weight loss program vs. the same program plus community-based weight management strategies
      vs. general cancer prevention education on weight loss and other clinical outcomes (primary
      outcomes) and healthy behaviors, and psychosocial functioning (secondary outcomes).

    <description>Participants will attend in-person weekly sessions (about 1.5 hours each) for 6 months and then twice a month for 3 months and monthly for 3 months. Sessions focus on behavioral techniques supporting healthy diet (including calorie restriction for weight loss) and achieving recommended amounts of physical activity per week. During 1-year weight loss maintenance, participants receive monthly motivational phone calls.</description>
