  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy of beta glucan products, and specifically TR 987, in the treatment of
      chronic venous insufficiency ulcers has been established. This study is designed to determine
      the most efficient method of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      effectiveness of TR 987 gel. It is a two-arm, design: One group will receive twice-weekly
      applications of 0.1% TR 987 in a gel base plus SoC for the first 4 weeks. The other group
      will receive twice-weekly applications of placebo gel base plus SoC for the same period of
      time. After 4 weeks, both groups will receive once weekly applications of their assigned
      treatment for the remaining 8 weeks of the trial. The Standard of Care therapy in this study
      is multi-layer compression therapy.

          3. Study ulcer has been present for at least one month and has undergone more than 2
             weeks, but less than 12 months of continuous high-strength compression with less than
             40% healing.

          4. Study ulcer is a minimum of 2.0 cm2 and a maximum of 20.0 cm2, extending through the
             full thickness of the skin, but not down to muscle, tendon, or bone at the
             randomization visit.

             randomization visit.

          6. If more than one ulcer is present on the same leg, they must be more than 2 cm apart
             and only the larger ulcer will be included in the study.

          7. Adequate arterial flow, as measured by an Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABI) of
             greater than 0.75. (Calculations will be made using measurements from both posterior
             tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries, as well as both arms) and/or Skin Perfusion

          8. Study ulcer has been treated with tissue engineered material (e.g., Apligraf® or
             Dermagraft®) or other scaffold materials (e.g., Oasis or Matristem) within 30 days
             prior to the TV1 Randomization visit.

          9. Study ulcer requiring negative pressure wound therapy or hyperbaric oxygen during the
             course of the trial.

         10. History of radiation at the study ulcer site.

             known history of poor adherence with medical treatment.
