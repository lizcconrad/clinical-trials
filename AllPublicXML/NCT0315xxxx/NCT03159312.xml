  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a multifactorial disorder resulting from multivariate etiopathogenic factors. The
      current lifestyle, causes a gradual increase in weight both in the adult population and in
      the child population. Among their treatments is bariatric surgery. About which there is
      little evidence in the literature regarding the health condition developed by patients
      operated on the same. Objective: To know the influence of a moderate exercise program on
      health status in patients operated on with bariatric surgery. Methodology: A controlled
      clinical trial, the population will consist of 52 women and 18 men. Coming from the
      consultations of bariatric surgery of the Clinic of the Maule - Talca. In the period between
      March 2017 and March 2018. It will be selected following a non-probabilistic sampling and for
      convenience. Results Analysis: The variables used in this study will be: cardiovascular
      function, respiratory function, strength, health perception, anthropometric measures and
      functional capacity to perform exercises. The Shapiro-Wilk normality test will be performed
      to determine the distribution of the data to be analyzed. The t-student test or its
      nonparametric counterpart will be applied to compare two variables. To compare three or more
      variables, the ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test will be used depending on the results of the
      normality test.

    <description>A controlled clinical trial study, there will be an experimental group that will undergo a moderate physical exercise program and another group that will not be operated and used as a control. The sample will be selected following a non-probabilistic sampling and for convenience. The sample will consist of 20 subjects in each group. In the experimental group, anthropometry, 6-minute walk test (T6M), strength assessment and follow-up during the stipulated time period for the development of the research will be performed, total four months, three times a week for the Intervention group, as opposed to the control group that will continue to be cited only to the assessments established for the study.</description>
