    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to construct hypertension specialized cohort using uniform
      standards and specifications. This study timely collected multi-dimensional clinical
      information through electronic medical records, mobile health, data integration, informatics
      and computer modern techniques, linking self-reported data and big data platforms from
      different sources to timely obtain the incidence and mortality data, and integrating
      hypertension cohort samples and the associated clinical records systematically, in order to
      build a 30-thousand hypertension specialized cohort with fine phenotypic data and blood/urine
      samples, thus far to provide support for the development of precise medicine research and
      related industries.
