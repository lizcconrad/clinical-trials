    <textblock>
      A pilot study testing the effect of an in-visit English and Spanish language decision aid for
      Hispanic-Latino men using best practices of cultural tailoring to be used in urology
      practice. Subjects will be followed for approximately 1 year during standard care in-clinic
      office visits. Study results and subject surveys will be analyzed to determine clinical
      utility of the tool.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to determine the effect of a culturally tailored decision
      aid tool on the cancer treatment decisions of Hispanic-Latino patients.

      The specific aims are:

      i. To develop and pilot test in an uncontrolled fashion an in-visit English and Spanish
      language decision aid for Hispanic-Latino men using best practices of cultural tailoring to
      be used in urology practice ii. To pilot and test the impact of a culturally tailored,
      English and Spanish language version of the Prostate Choice in-visit decision aid on decision
      quality, knowledge, and quality of life in low-income Hispanic/Latino patients diagnosed with
      localized prostate cancer iii. To assess the barriers and facilitators of decision aid use
      including the relative contribution of language-concordance on 1-year practice implementation
      parameters.

    <description>Subjects will be asked to complete baseline surveys. Once the surveys are completed, subjects will review the Decision Aid tool with a study team member. Once the subjects have gone through the tool, study team members will answer any additional questions he may have regarding the tool. The subjects will then discuss with the investigator various cancer management options, quality of life implications, and any questions the subjects may have regarding cancer management options. Subjects that are ready may make a cancer management decision at this time, or choose to wait until their next scheduled visit. Subjects will be followed at subsequent urology clinic visits for up to 6 months. Subjects will complete follow-up surveys at the 3, 6, 9 and 12 month visits.</description>
