  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to establish a new model of acute febrile disease by mimicking the
      conditions seen in hospitalized patients in regards to inflammation, immobilisation and
      fasting. In this new model of disease, healthy young adults will be given lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS) to induce endotoxemia and inflammation/fever and then fast and bedrest for 36 hours.
      Glucose, fat and protein metabolism will be investigated using clamp technique and tracer
      methodology together with intracellular signalling pathway activation in muscle and fat
      biopsies. This new model of disease will later be used in another study to investigate
      different protein supplement´s effect on muscle waste during acute febrile disease.

    <description>Interventions:
Test subjects undergo 48 hour exercise restriction and overnight fast.
Study day 1:
- LPS (1 ng/kg) will be administered. Test subjects will fast and bedrest for the rest of the study period.
Study day 2:
3 hour Basal period: Continued fast and bedrest. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, carbamide, glucose and palmitate tracers are infused. Muscle and fat biopsies are taken from m. vastus lateralis and stomach.
3 hour hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp period with muscle and fat biopsies.
