  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our intent is to establish the International Registry to Improve Outcomes in Men with
      Advanced Prostate Cancer (IRONMAN) as a prospective, international cohort of minimum 5,000
      men with advanced cancer, including men with mHSPC and M0/M1 CRPC. The goal is to establish a
      population-based registry and recruit patients across academic and community practices from
      Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom (UK), and the US.
      Target accrual number and number of participating sites are subject to change based on
      accrual, funding, and interest in participation by other international sites. This cohort
      study will facilitate a better understanding of the variation in care and treatment of
      advanced prostate cancer across countries and across academia and community based practices.

      Detailed data will be collected from patients at study enrollment and then during follow-up,
      for a minimum of three years. Patients will be followed prospectively for overall survival,
      clinically significant adverse events, comorbidities, changes in cancer treatments, and
      PROMs.

      PROMs questionnaires will be collected at enrollment, every three months for the first and
      second year then every six months.

      Physician Questionnaires will be collected from all participating sites at patient
      enrollment, time of first change in treatment and/or one year follow-up, at each subsequent
      change of treatment, and discontinuation of treatment.

      As such, this registry will help identify the treatment sequences or combinations that
      optimize overall survival and PROMs for men with mHSPC and M0/M1 CRPC. By collecting blood at
      enrollment, time of first change in treatment and/or one year follow-up (plasma, cell free
      DNA, buffy coat / RNA), this registry will further identify and validate molecular phenotypes
      of disease that predict response and resistance to specific therapeutics. Additionally, every
      effort will be made to collect blood specimen at each subsequent change in treatment. When
      feasible, existing tumor tissue may be collected for correlation with described blood based
      studies. All samples will be used for future research. This cohort study will provide the
      research community with a unique biorepository to identify biomarkers of treatment response
      and resistance.

        Metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC): Prostate cancer patients diagnosed
        with histologically confirmed cancer with radiological evidence of metastatic disease and
        on ADT for no more than 90 days.

        Castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC): Prostate cancer patients (with or without
        radiological evidence of metastatic disease) with a confirmed rising PSA (at least two
        measures) while on ADT or orchiectomy or castrate level of testosterone as determined by
        investigator.

        Prostate cancer patients with mixed histological types may participate in this Registry.
