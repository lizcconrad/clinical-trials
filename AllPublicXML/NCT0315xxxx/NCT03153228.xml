  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electronical cigarettes, also known as &quot;e-cigarettes&quot; are a new phenomenon, which steadily
      wins more aprobation among smokers. However, there exists no much data concerning the effects
      of acute exposure to electronic cigarettes vapour on the respiratory system.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate and compare the acute response to electronic and
      traditional cigarettes in healthy smokers.

      The aim of the study is:

        -  to evaluate the acute response to traditional cigarettes on the respiratory system

        -  to evaluate the acute response to electronic cigarettes on the respiratory system

        -  to assess the relationship between the type of smoked cigarettes (traditional vs.
           electronic) and concentration of markers of airway inflammation released in healthy
           smokers

      Material and methods:

        -  29 healthy smokers of traditional cigarettes

        -  29 healthy smokers of electronic cigarettes

        -  29 healthy, nonsmoking volunteers

      After 8 hours of smoking abstinence:

        -  the spirometry test

        -  the first collection of the exhaled breath condensate (EBC I)

        -  smoking a traditional / electronic cigarette

        -  the second collection of the exhaled breath condensate (EBC II) - one hour after smoking

        -  the third collection of the exhaled breath condensate (EBC III) - six hours after
           smoking

        -  the measurement of biomarkers of oxidative stress in the EBC (isoprostane-8,
           malondialdehyde MDA, IL-8) and pH of the EBC
