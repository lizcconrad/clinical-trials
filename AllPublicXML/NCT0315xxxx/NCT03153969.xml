      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a new composite
      resin (SHOFU Beautifil II LS) vs a control (3M/ESPE Filtek Supreme) for use in restoring non
      carious cervical lesions Class V lesions.

      3M ESPE FiltekTM Supreme is one of the composite resin materials that will be used in this
      study (Group 1). This is a light-activated, flowable restorative composite.

      Shofu Beautifil II LS (SI R21204) is a new type of filling material called a Giomer. This is
      the second composite that will be used in this study (Group 2) Giomer is a collective term
      for dental materials that will release ions, such as fluoride. Results from previous studies
      show that the released ions may have beneficial effects on the tooth, including strengthening
      the tooth.

      In each participant, one tooth with a class V lesion will be randomized to group 1, and a
      second tooth with a class V lesion will be randomized to group 2. The restorations will be
      observed over 18 months to determine clinical acceptability.

      This is a single-center, non-blinded, controlled, split mouth, clinical trial 18 months in
      duration.

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new Giomer
      restorative system (Shofu Beautifil LS) for use in restoring non carious Class V lesions by
      comparing it to 3M ESPE FiltekTM Supreme in the following categories:

      Clinical Assessments (Documentation at baseline, 6months and 18months):

        -  Surface Luster

        -  Surface Staining

        -  Marginal Staining

        -  Color Match

        -  Anatomical Form

        -  Marginal Adaptation

        -  Fracture of Material and Retention

        -  Radiographic Examination

        -  Patient's View

        -  Postoperative Hypersensitivity

        -  Recurrence of Caries

        -  Tooth Integrity

        -  Adjacent Mucosa

      Sensitivity interview- assessed preoperatively (prior to anesthesia, if needed) at baseline
      and after restoration placement

      Dentin Sclerosis Rating- assessed at baseline
