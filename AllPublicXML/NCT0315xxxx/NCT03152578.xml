  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial with
      open label extension evaluating a topical natural health cream containing ÃŸ-caryophyllene
      alone and in combination with 0.025% capsicum oleoresin against placebo. At the end of the
      randomized controlled phase of the trial all participants will be given open-label
      combination cream to be administered over the subsequent 3 weeks.

      Primary Endpoint: Evaluation of improvement in pain interference as measured by the BPI in
      individuals who are experiencing pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee.

      Secondary Endpoints: Secondary endpoints are: Confirmation of safety of the topical cream
      when used daily over 10 weeks.

      Further evaluation will include overall patient satisfaction with the products tested.
