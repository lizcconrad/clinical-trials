  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This survey intends to collect information on key aspects of life with epidermolysis bullosa
      (EB), including diagnostic journey, treatment, management, daily living challenges, and
      overall psycho-social, socio-economic, academic and family impact.

      Objectives:

        -  To understand the unmet needs for people living with EB in the US

        -  To assess the differences/similarities in the management/treatment of EB patients
           (including wound care, symptom management and other issues)

        -  To assess the EB patients' and caregivers' perceptions of current management/treatment

        -  To assess the challenges and the burden of daily living with EB

        -  To understand EB diagnostic journey (the time to diagnosis and by what type of
           healthcare provider)

        -  To identify professional disciplines involved in the diagnosis and management of EB

        -  To understand the psycho-social, socio-economic, academic, and family impact of EB

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a rare, often severe genetic disorder characterized by
      mechanical fragility and blistering or erosion of the skin, mucosa, or epithelial lining of
      other organs, in response to little or no apparent trauma.

      EB is chronic, potentially disfiguring, and in some cases fatal. Patients with EB have
      painful wounds and blisters that can lead to infection and scarring. There are many genetic
      and symptomatic variations of EB, but all forms share the common symptom of fragile skin that
      blisters and tears, sometimes from the slightest friction or trauma. There is currently no
      approved treatment for EB. Current standard of care consists of pain management and the
      bandaging and cleaning of open wounds to prevent infection.

      While there are a number of publications/guidance/consensus statements related to the
      diagnosis and management of EB from the point of view of the health-care provider/disease
      expert, there is a need for more research to define the key aspects of life with EB (i.e.
      diagnostic journey, treatment, management, daily living challenges, and overall disease
      burden) from the perspective of the patient.
