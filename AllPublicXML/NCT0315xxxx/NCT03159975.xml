      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in
      patients with pulmonary tuberculosis of an investigational DNA vaccine being developed for
      the prevention of relapse of tuberculosis.

    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis still matters in domestic as well as global public health. According to WHO,
      8,700,000 cases of tuberculosis occured in 2011, and 1,400,000 of them resulted dead.
      Tuberculosis patients with the cavity and positive on AFB show high rate of relapse and
      treatment failure. Those with high risk of relapse and treatment failure may need more
      effective treatment before acquiring resistance and infecting others. GX-70, which consists
      of the four-antigen plasmids from MTB together with recombinant Flt3 ligand is an
      investigational DNA vaccine designed to prevent relapse or treatment failure.

      The purpose of this study is to assess safety of GX-70, in pulmonary TB patients with high
      risk factors for treatment failure or relapse.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who voluntarily consented, after listening enough explanation for this study
             and investigational product.

          2. Adults between 19 and 65 years.

          3. TB patients without a history of TB diagnosis, who show positive on both AFB smear and
             TB-PCR

          4. TB patients who satisfy following conditions: cavity spotted from chest imaging before
             TB therapy, positive on AFB smear 2 months after TB therapy.
