  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to determine the incidence of thrombosis on central venous catheters in
      patients hospitalized in a surgical critical care unit, in the immediate postoperative period
      of urological or digestive carcinological surgery, and receiving parenteral nutrition.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The post operative period, wich is a critically ill condition, and history of cancer are
      related to a high risk of venous thrombosis. Catheter is one of the most common complication
      of parenteral nutrition and is also related to thrombosis.

      The combination of theses conditions increases the risk of venous catheter thrombosis. ,
      Since, there is no data evaluating this risk nowadays, the objective of this study is to
      determine the incidence of thrombosis on central venous catheters in patients hospitalized in
      a surgical critical care unit, in the immediate postoperative period of urological or
      digestive carcinological surgery, and receiving parenteral nutrition.

    <description>Patients will undergo an examination by a specialist in vascular medicine just before removal of the catheter.This specialist also is specialist in vascular doppler ultrasonography.
The specialist would search symptoms and signs of deep vein thrombosis : local pain, swelling, redness, warmth. Clinical examinated would be completed by doppler ultrasound : thrombus is detected during a compression test, while cruor is evaluated in B-mode (gray-scale) imaging. This method is very sensitive with regard to detection of the thrombus.</description>

    <description>During the intensive care unit stay, the investigator would prospectively collected data, including :
potential risk factors : age, history of venous thrombosis, type of cancer...
details of surgery : type and operating time
details of critically ill period : number and type of organs failures, first mobilisation..
details of the clinical course : occurence of a situation requiring curative anticoagulation..</description>
