  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The population of inpatients is large in Zambia; however, because of poor linkages between
      hospitals and community HIV care, there are few data to analyze their engagement in HIV care
      before and after hospitalization. The goal of the study is to learn more about Zambian adults
      who are HIV-infected and get hospitalized. The purpose of this study is to gather formative,
      preliminary data, to be used in future grant applications to improve linkage and engagement
      in HIV care in Zambia.

      The main objective of this study is to generate preliminary data on the outcomes of Zambian
      HIV-infected individuals after discharge from University Teaching Hospital (UTH) Internal
      Medicine wards which can inform development of a linkage intervention. Our central hypothesis
      is that in Sub-Saharan African settings like Zambia hospitalizations among HIV-infected
      individuals are driven by suboptimal linkage and initiation of ART following HIV diagnosis.
      Specific Aims: (a) Characterize the distribution of hospitalized 300 HIV-infected adults
      across the HIV care continuum. (b) Identify structural, psychosocial, clinic, and medical
      factors that predict suboptimal linkage to care and ART initiation after 90 days of hospital
      discharge among HIV-infected Zambians.

      Blood will be drawn via phlebotomy for patients for whom CD4 and HIV viral load results are
      not available at baseline. For participants that have initiated ART treatment, we will
      collect a dried blood spot card using 5 drops of blood from finger prick to measure viral
      load 90 days after discharge.

        In part 1, people will be recruited in a random fashion from HIV-infected patients
        hospitalized at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) as documented in their UTH medical
        file regardless of their HIV treatment status. The bed spaces in the wards will be
        enumerated and using a random number generator the team will select patients for screening
        for study inclusion.
