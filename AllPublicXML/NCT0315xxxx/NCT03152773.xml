      Background:

      Right heart catheterization tests heart pressures and flows. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      fluoroscopy shows pictures of the heart that doctors can watch while they work. Researchers
      want to test this procedure with a tool called a guidewire. This will help position the heart
      catheter into different heart chambers. Guidewires are usually considered unsafe during MRI
      because MRI can make them hot inside the body. Researchers have created special MRI settings
      that stop one guidewire from getting hot. Using this guidewire during MRI may make improve
      catheterization.

      Objectives:

      To test if certain MRI settings make it safe to use a guidewire during MRI fluoroscopy.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 18 and older whose doctors have recommended right heart catheterization.

      Design:

      Researchers will screen participants by reviewing their lab results and questionnaire
      answers.

      Participants will give 4 blood samples.

      Participants will be sedated. They will have a tube (catheter) placed in the groin, arm, or
      neck if they don t already have one.

      Patches on the skin will monitor heart rhythm. Special antennas, covered in pads, will be
      placed against the body.

      Participants will lie flat on a table that slides in and out of the MRI scanner as it makes
      pictures. Participants will get earplugs for the loud knocking noise. They can talk on an
      intercom. They will be inside the scanner for up to 2 hours. They can ask to stop at any
      time.

      For right heart catheterization, catheters will be inserted through the tubes already in
      place. The catheters are guided by MRI fluoroscopy into the chambers of the heart and
      vessels. The guidewire will help position the catheter.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart catheterization is a minimally invasive procedure to measure pressure into specific
      heart cavities. Heart catheterization usually uses X-ray guidance, which involves radiation
      exposure and which fails to visualize soft tissue. For several years, real-time magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) fluoroscopy has been the standard technique to guide right heart
      catheterization at the NIH clinical center. Guidewires are standard tools used to steer
      catheters through the body and heart.

      Guidewires have not been used during MRI fluoroscopy catheterization because of the risk of
      heating. We have developed MRI techniques that do not risk heating using one specific
      commercial guidewire. In this protocol we will use this new lowenergy real-time MRI
      fluoroscopy technique to enable use of guidewires during otherwise standard MRI
      catheterization of the right side of the heart through veins.

      If the initial phases of the protocol prove successful, in subsequent amendments we will use
      this technique to position catheters in the left ventricle through arteries.

      If successful, this will enable future testing of devices for adult and pediatric
      MRI-fluoroscopy catheterization, which may lead to new non-surgical treatments of
      cardiovascular disease.

    <description>To conduct right heart guidewire catheterization using real-time MRI fluroscopy in human research subjects already undergoing medically necessary right heart catheterization. We will use only passive MRI -compatible catheters and a specific guidewire shown to be safe under specific conditions. Under the conditions of use, the guidewire is not susceptible to heating.</description>
