  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of physical exercise through a protocol of
      concurrent training in the psychological, physical, hormonal and sexual aspects in middle
      aged men with androgen deficiency in the aging male (ADAM). The study design with randomized
      clinical trial, comprising men in middle age (40 to 59 years) with ADAM, should be divided
      into two groups: 1) Control group (CG); 2) Experimental group (EG). Information related to
      sociodemographic and clinical profile will be collected; Psychological aspects (depressive
      and anxiety symptoms - Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ; stress - Perceived Stress
      Scale); Physical acpects (IMC; Percentage of body fat; Abdominal obesity - waist
      circumference in cm; Muscle strength - Biodex System 4 PRO isokinetic dynamometer;
      cardiorespiratory Fitness - Cycle-ergometer - CASE ECG Stress Testing System, General
      Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI); Hormonal aspects (total and free testosterone -
      blood collection); Sexual Aspect (Sexual satisfaction- International Index of Erectile
      Function); DAEM (scale of symptoms of aging). Apply a physical exercise protocol using the
      functional training method over a six-month period. All information will be collected before
      and after the intervention period. For statistical analysis, use the SPSS statistical
      package, version 20.0. (Kolmogorov-Smirnov or Shapiro-Wilk test) for the selection of
      statistical tests.

      In this protocol the participants will perform aerobic and resistance training according to
      published evidence for middle-aged men; Characterized as concurrent training.

      The protocol will last six months and will be divided into two quarters. In the first
      trimester, initial 30 minutes will be assigned to resistance training, followed by 30 minutes
      of aerobic training; Already in the second trimester will be 20 initial minutes for the
      aerobic training and later 40 minutes for the resistance training; Aiming to obtain benefits
      in the levels of muscular strength, aerobic capacity, body composition, besides positive
      results in relation to the hormonal adaptations of testosterone, as well as in the
      psychological well being of the participants.

      Classes will occur at a frequency of three times weekly, lasting 60 minutes a session.

      For the elaboration of this protocol will be followed the guidelines of the American College
      of Sports Medicine of resistance training for healthy adults The aerobic training of this
      protocol will follow the American College of Sports Medicine's prescription prescription
      guidelines for the health of healthy adult subjects,

    <description>It will be composed of participants randomly assigned to this group, reinforcing the importance of attendance in classes (minimum of 75% of frequency) for significant health benefits. The evaluation measures will be made through a self-administered questionnaire and physical evaluations (cardiorespiratory fitness, body mass index, percentage of fat, waist circumference and muscular strength). The intervention with the concurrent training will be carried out in a gymnasium in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina. After all the evaluation procedures have been performed, the intervention period will begin, being three times a week, lasting 60 minutes, according to the study protocol.</description>
