    <textblock>
      A huge number of children suffer from anxiety during their dental treatment especially those
      who did not receive any type of behavior management during their first dental visit. This
      will result in a more complicated treatment sessions for the children, dentist and the
      parents. Fear and anxiety control is the key to change the resistant nature of the anxious
      patients and also allow them to receive the proper treatment they require. From the point of
      view that there is no difference between the techniques effectiveness, evaluation of two
      modelling techniques (live modelling and filmed modelling versus no modelling) for children
      anxious behavior management during the dental treatment will be performed.

      i. Diagnosis:

        1. History taking [personal, medical and dental].

        2. Clinical examination using mirror and probe.

        3. Radiographic examination to make sure that the caries is simple.

        4. Preoperative photograph is taken.

      ii. Interventions to each group

        1. Group A: Live modelling technique

             1. In the 1st dental visit the operator will start by measuring the behavior of the
                child by Frankl behavior rating scale.

             2. A cooperative patient will be the model for the child.

             3. In the 2nd dental visit the pulse oximetry device will be installed on the child's
                finger and another form of Frankl behavior rating scale is filled.

             4. The treatment is performed as follows:

           i. Place topical anesthesia. ii. Place anesthetic injection. iii. Cavity preparation.
           iv. Filling material placement. v. Finishing of the filling. e. The child will be asked
           to complete a facial image scale

        2. Group B: video modelling technique (1) In the 1st dental visit the operator will start
           by measuring the behavior of the child by Frankl behavior rating scale.

             1. A recorded film will be shown to the child.

             2. In the 2nd dental visit the pulse oximetry device will be installed on the child's
                finger and another form of Frankl behavior rating scale is filled.

             3. The treatment is performed as follows:

           i. Place topical anesthesia. ii. Place anesthetic injection. iii. Cavity preparation.
           iv. Filling material placement. v. Finishing of the filling. d. The child will be asked
           to complete a facial image scale.

        3. Group C: No modelling

             1. In the 1st dental visit the operator will start by measuring the behavior of the
                child by Frankl behavior rating scale.

             2. In the 2nd dental visit the pulse oximetry device will be installed on the child's
                finger and another form to Frankl behavior rating scale.

             3. The treatment is performed as follows:

           i. Place topical anesthesia. ii. Place anesthetic injection. iii. Cavity preparation.
           iv. Filling material places. v. Finishing of the filling. d. The child will be asked to
           complete a facial image scale.

    <description>Direct observation is the term used to describe both the filmed and live modelling technique. These techniques depend on familiarizing the patient with the dental environment and allowing the patient to ask the questions he/she wants to ask. The patients are shown a film or are permitted to directly observe a cooperative patient undergoing dental treatment. These techniques have no contra indications they simply may be used with any patient.</description>
