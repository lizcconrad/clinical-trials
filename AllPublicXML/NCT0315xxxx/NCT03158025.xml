  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the abuse potential of lemborexant (E2006)
      in comparison to placebo and 2 controls with known abuse potential (ie, zolpidem and
      suvorexant) with similar indications (zolpidem and suvorexant) or mechanisms of action
      (suvorexant).

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single oral dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      6-way crossover study in healthy, non-dependent recreational sedative users.

    <description>The CRT task is a classic test of reaction time used to measure psychomotor performance. During this test, the participant is presented with an onscreen equivalent of the numeric keypad. The participant must quickly press the buttons on a separate keypad that corresponds with the keys illuminated on the screen. The CRT task comprises 3 outcome variables: RRT, MRT, and TRT. RRT is the time it takes for a participant to notice the light (i.e., the time between stimulus onset and the participant lifting his or her finger from the start button). MRT indexes the movement component of this task and is the time between the participant lifting his or her finger from the start button and touching the response button. TRT is the sum of RRT and MRT.</description>

    <description>The CRT task is a classic test of reaction time used to measure psychomotor performance. During this test, the participant is presented with an onscreen equivalent of the numeric keypad. The participant must quickly press the buttons on a separate keypad that corresponds with the keys illuminated on the screen. The CRT task comprises 3 outcome variables: RRT, MRT, and TRT. RRT is the time it takes for a participant to notice the light (i.e., the time between stimulus onset and the participant lifting his or her finger from the start button). MRT indexes the movement component of this task and is the time between the participant lifting his or her finger from the start button and touching the response button. TRT is the sum of RRT and MRT.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered an investigational product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (Baseline) or: re-emerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (Baseline) but stopped before treatment; or worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous.</description>

An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a participant who was exposed to the study drug).</description>

             consent

          -  Current sedative users who have used sedatives (e.g., zolpidem, benzodiazepines) for
             recreational (non-therapeutic) purposes (i.e., for psychoactive effects) at least five
             times in the past year and used sedatives for recreational (non-therapeutic) purposes
             (i.e., for psychoactive effects) at least once in the 12 weeks before Screening.

          -  A body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 to 33.0 kilograms per meters squared (kg/m^2),
             inclusive, and a minimum weight of 50.0 kg at Screening

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential with male sexual partners must be using
             and willing to continue using highly effective contraception for at least 1 month
             prior to Screening and for at least 1 month after the last study drug administration

          -  Female participants of non-childbearing potential must meet specified criteria.

          -  Male participants with female sexual partners of childbearing potential must be using
             and willing to continue using highly effective contraception from Screening and for at
             least 1 month after the last study drug administration.

          -  Participants who are using hormonal contraceptives must be on a stable dose of the
             same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 1 month before dosing and agree to
             use the same contraceptive during the study and for at least 1 month after the last
             study drug discontinuation

          -  Demonstrate the following in the Qualification Period:

               1. Ability to distinguish orally administered zolpidem 30 mg and suvorexant 40 mg
                  from placebo on the bipolar Drug Liking (at this moment) Visual analog scale
                  (VAS), defined as a ≥15 point peak increase for Drug Liking in response to
                  zolpidem and suvorexant relative to placebo following drug administration. A peak
                  score of ≥65 must be indicated on the bipolar measure of Drug Liking (at this
                  moment) in response to zolpidem and suvorexant

               2. Display an acceptable placebo response, defined as a VAS response between 40 to
                  60 inclusive, for peak (Emax) Drug Liking (at this moment)

               3. Demonstrate responses to zolpidem and suvorexant that are consistent with
                  discrimination relative to placebo on other subjective measures, as judged by the
                  study center staff

               4. Tolerate study treatment (eg, no episodes of vomiting within the first 3 hours
