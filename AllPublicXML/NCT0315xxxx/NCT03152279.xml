  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased intestinal permeability can represent compromise of the epithelium's integrity and
      is thought to be the primary mechanism in patients who develop Celiac Disease (CeD) and
      non-celiac gluten sensitivity when gluten peptides cross the barrier and trigger an immune
      response. In this study, the investigators propose to use a novel, minimally invasive
      technology to detect mucosal damage (i.e. barrier dysfunction) in the duodenal epithelium.
      The primary aim of this study is to identify if there is a difference in duodenal mucosal
      impedance between CeD and control patients.

        Celiac disease patients will be identified in the Celiac Disease Clinic at Vanderbilt.
        Patients will be asked if they would like to participate in the study during their clinic
        visit and will undergo consent for the study at the time of procedure. Control subjects
        will be asked about participation at the time of routine endoscopy.
