      The HILT study is a prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial comparing a
      high-intensity exercise training intervention with usual care among adult lung transplant
      recipients. Patients randomized to the training intervention arm will undergo individually
      tailored high-intensity exercise training (80-95% of maximum heart rate) three hours per week
      for 20 weeks. Training will be conducted at local fitness centers on a one-on-one basis.

    <description>The exercise program will include a cardiovascular warm-up, high intensity interval training and progressive resistance training (PRT). The intervention will focus on high-intensity training, mainly by uphill walking on a treadmill at 80-95 % of the maximal heart rate and PRT in three series at 6-12 RM by leg press, chest press, back extension, seat row, and front raises. During the first four weeks, the patients will be introduced to the program while focusing on safety, techniques and familiarization. The endurance intensity and strength load will then continuously increase based on the patients' improvement, tolerance of dyspnea, and feelings of well-being or fatigue on each exercise day.</description>
