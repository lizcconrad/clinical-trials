      This is a three-year project funded by a Cancer Research UK Multidisciplinary Award and
      brings together a team from UCL Division of Medicine, Computer Science and University College
      London Hospital. The aim is to develop Magnetic Resonance (MR) sequences and mathematical
      algorithms to reduce the distortions in MR images, especially of the prostate. Current NICE
      guidelines include a type of MR imaging called Diffusion Weighted MRI for the detection of
      tumour within the prostate, and for active surveillance of low risk confirmed disease.
      However, approximately 40% of prostate diffusion images suffer from severe localised
      distortions and this is most marked in the peripheral zone of the prostate where 75% of
      prostate cancers occur. The source of these distortions is magnetic field imperfections due
      to the presence of rectal gas or metallic hip implants.

      The research study will ask both healthy volunteers and patients to undergo research MR scans
      and use the acquired data for analysis. For patients, the scans may be either additional
      sequences acquired during an extended clinical session, or a separate additional session
      entirely for research.

      The output from the research will be modified ways to run an MR scanner and compute the final
      images.

      The work should lead to improved diagnostic accuracy and a reduced number of non-diagnostic
      studies. It will have broader impact through application to diffusion imaging of other body
      sites, including whole-body diffusion MRI and non-cancer applications. If successful, the
      results would provide evidence for a larger trial with the eventual outcome being
      manufacturers incorporating modified MR sequences and data processing into clinical systems
      worldwide.

        This study will recruit patients within the UCLH imaging pathway and healthy participants
        for research Magnetic Resonance imaging. There is no requirement for participants to be
        imaged more than once for this study. Following the MR scan, no further involvement is
        required from the participants. This is a single-centre study and all imaging will take
        place at UCLH. The de-identified data will be processed by members of the study team within
        UCL.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For the development and testing phases, there are no specific inclusion criteria.
             Assessment of the primary outcome measure (reduced distortions) also does not require
             specific inclusion criteria. The intended application of our methods is to prostate
             cancer and this is reflected in some of the secondary outcome measures. Recruitment
             will come from the UCLH imaging bookings system. This list will include many men
             having prostate scans and many of these will subsequently be found to have at least a
             suspicion of cancer. Note there is no requirement for a suspicion of cancer to be
             recruited for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects unable to have an MRI scan due to contraindications for MRI, for example,
             pacemaker and certain other implants, severe claustrophobia.

          -  Subjects unable to give informed consent.

          -  Children and vulnerable populations.
