    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (disease of the heart and blood vessels) is one of the leading
      causes of death and disability in Canada today. The majority of CVD cases are caused by
      factors that can be controlled. These factors include tobacco use, obesity, high blood
      pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and physical inactivity. Such factors are common and
      not well controlled. Inflammatory arthritis (IA) (Inflammation of the joints and other
      tissues) is considered another risk factor or CVD. As such, people who have IA and any of the
      previously mentioned risk factors would be at high risk for developing CVD. Controlling these
      factors will bring down the risk of having cardiovascular disease and make the quality of the
      individuals' life better. Pharmacists work with patients and their family doctors to provide
      cardiovascular care. Having a pharmacist involved in the care process may help patients with
      IA reduce their CV risk. Pharmacists are easier to reach and may have more opportunities to
      educate people about medications. This might lead to better prevention and control of
      cardiovascular diseases.

      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide and in Canada accounting for nearly one third of the total deaths in both
      instances.1-2 The majority of CVD cases are caused by modifiable risk factors such as tobacco
      use, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and physical inactivity.3 Inflammatory
      arthritis, inclusive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ankylosing
      spondylitis (AS), is also recognized as an independent risk factor for CVD.4-7

      It has been reported that the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF) and CV
      death among patients with IA is 2-3-fold greater than in the general population.8-10 This
      increased CV risk reflects the combined impact of systemic inflammation, burden of
      traditional CVD risk factors and impact of certain medications (e.g. steroids, non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatories [NSAIDs]).5,6 An elevated risk of CVD can be identified early after IA
      diagnosis, emphasizing the need for early efforts in CV risk screening.11

      Despite being recommended by international IA management guidelines,7 CV risk assessment has
      not been incorporated into clinicians' daily routine.7 Indeed, it has been reported that such
      assessments generally only exist in larger centers for non-rheumatology patients.12-14
      Moreover, Keeling and colleagues reported that most rheumatologists, who are the main care
      givers for IA patients, conducted suboptimal CV risk assessments. 15 This gap in care for
      patients with IA is not consistently absorbed by family physicians due to lack of recognition
      of CV risk in these patients and competing demands of other healthcare needs (e.g. other
      chronic diseases, cancer, diabetes). 7

      Special considerations need to be taken into account when calculating CV risk in patients
      with IA, as the 'classic' risk engines (such as Framingham16) might underestimate the overall
      risk,17 since they have not been adequately evaluated in this patient population.18,5 For
      example, IA patients who might benefit from lipid-lowering agents may be categorized &quot;low
      risk&quot; when using the Framingham risk engine.17 As such it has been recommended to use a
      modified Framingham risk engine (multiply the overall risk with 1.5) in patients with IA. 19

      CV risk screening and management in patients with IA takes time and effort, but can be
      performed by other trained health professionals. As such, it has been recommended to utilize
      a multidisciplinary approach (integration of rheumatology, cardiology and primary care) to
      support the care of IA patients.6,20-23 Pharmacists are front line, accessible, primary
      healthcare professionals who see patients more frequently than any other healthcare
      provider.24 The efficacy of their interventions in managing chronic diseases including
      osteoarthritis,25, diabetes,7, 26 dyslipidemia,27 hypertension,28,29 heart failure,30 and CVD
      31-34 has been well demonstrated in the literature. Pharmacists can systematically identify
      patients at high risk of CVD,35 improve their medication use,36 and help them achieve their
      treatment targets.27,28 In addition to clinical outcomes, pharmacist involvement in patient
      care is associated with improved patient satisfaction and adherence to therapy.28,35,36 This
      evidence, coupled with their advanced scope of practice, ideally position pharmacists to
      conduct CV risk screening and management. In addition, Canadian pharmacists have access to
      practice guidelines for management and prevention of cardiovascular disease in the general
      population.37 They also have access to the RxEACH CV risk calculator, an interactive CV
      screening and management tool, which will help them determine CV risk, simply communicate
      contributing risks to patients, and show patients the impact of modifying their risks. 34
