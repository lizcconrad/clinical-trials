      Evaluate the safety (P-I), pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor effect of immunotherapy of
      autologous T cells genetically modified to express anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)
      (TBI-1501) for relapsed or refractory CD19+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      Enroll patients after confirming eligibility. Following enrollment, peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells and blood plasma will be obtained from each subject by apheresis to start
      the manufacturing of TBI-1501.

      Before TBI-1501 administration, it is necessary to pass the quality tests. Subject will be
      hospitalized from Day -3 to Day 28, and administered Cyclophosphamide (1,000 mg/m2/day×2
      days) on Day -3 and Day -2.

    <intervention_model_description>Peripheral blood will be collected from a subject after obtaining a written informed consent. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma are obtained from the blood, and T cells contained in the PBMCs are transduced with anti-CD19 CAR gene by using retroviral vector.
Cyclophosphamide will be administered after obtaining a written informed consent and completing registration.
CD19-CAR-T will be administered in the split dose. Phase 2 recommended dose will be applied for phase 1 portion. The investigator assesses efficacy of CD19-CAR-T in accordance with study-specific criteria, at 8 week after the infusion of CD19-CAR-T (or at the time of termination). The investigator also assesses the safety during the follow-up period. Long-term follow-up study is conducted at frequency of once a year for 15 years after the infusion of CD19-CAR-T in reference to guidelines of FDA.</intervention_model_description>
