  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-controlled, single-arm, open-label clinical trial to describe the PK, PD,
      immunogenicity and safety of ASNase. All subjects enrolled will receive the IP recombinant
      ASNase (Spectrila®). Since Spectrila is already approved in the European Economic Area for
      first-line treatment of ALL patients of all age groups and showed similar efficacy and safety
      in comparison to Asparaginase medac no blinding or control groups are necessary. As
      underlying treatment protocol the BRALL 2014 treatment protocol will be used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BRALL (Brazilian Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia) treatment protocol was developed to
      standardise adult ALL treatment in Brazil since previously each centre used a different
      protocol. As in other treatment regimens of study groups, ASNase is an important component of
      ALL therapy. The rationale of the BRALL protocol was to use less myelotoxic drugs as
      daunorubicin, etoposide and cyclophosphamide and focus on more specific ALL directed
      therapies as asparaginase and methotrexate. The higher asparaginase dose regimen was chosen
      in BRALL 2014 to strengthen ASNase as major component of the treatment protocol while
      etoposide administration is reduced. Native ASNase is widely used and the data investigating
      non-inferiority, safety and tolerability of Asparaginase medac vs. Spectrila received a
      positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Nevertheless, data on efficacy and
      safety of Spectrila in adults are limited. Therefore, robust data on PK, pharmacodynamics
      (PD), safety and immunogenicity of Spectrila will be investigated in this trial in subjects
      with de novo ALL. The measurement of ASNase activity is considered to correlate with clinical
      effectiveness and therefore chosen as primary objective.

      Subjects eligible for participation in this clinical trial will be treated with 3 intravenous
      doses of Spectrila of 10 000 U/m² BSA each during induction phase I of the underlying BRALL
      2014 treatment protocol. Spectrila will be administered on Days 21, 23 and 25. Additionally,
      the subjects (standard risk subjects only) will receive doses of 10 000 U/m² BSA Spectrila
      each on Days 2, 4, 6, 9, 11 and 13 of the consolidation phase II, III and VI of BRALL 2014
      treatment protocol. One final Analysis is planned.

             leukaemia

          2. Female or male subjects ≥ 18 years of age

             data has been explained to the subject

          5. The subject expresses his/her understanding of the trial procedures and willingness to
