    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus is the most common disorder seen. The impact of this disease on the quality
      of life, and on morbidity and mortality through the complications that affect the small and
      large vessels resulting in retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and ischemic heart disease
      has been emphasized by the findings of the national commission (USA) on diabetes .

      So, there was curiosity to understand and learn the association of this disorder with another
      common endocrine gland function that is thyroid gland . The association between these two
      disorders has long been recognized although the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in diabetic
      population varies widely between studies. With insulin and thyroid hormone being intimately
      involved in cellular metabolism and thus excess or deficit of these hormones result in
      functional derangement of the other .

      Diabetic patients have higher prevalence of thyroid disorder when compared with the normal
      population. Diabetic women are more frequently affected than men and hypothyroidism is more
      common than thyrotoxicosis.

      As Hyperthyroidism impairs glycemic control in diabetic subjects, while hypothyroidism may
      increase susceptibility to hypoglycemia thus complicating diabetes management so Severe
      diabetic complications where noted in patients with sub- clinical hypothyroidism .
      Sub-clinical hypothyroidism is an independent risk factor for development of diabetic
      nephropathy.

      Recognition and treatment of thyroid dysfunction in diabetic patients will benefit glycemic
      control and improve general well-being Diabetic nephropathy, a major microvascular
      complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus, is an important cause of chronic kidney disease. It
      results from interactions between hemodynamic and metabolic factors.
