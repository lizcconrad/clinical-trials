  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous and genital warts are common dermatological conditions caused by Human Papilloma
      Virus. Although it is a benign condition it causes disfigurement, has tendency to collect,
      can be transmitted to others, this makes adequate and timely treatment important, while many
      warts are resolve spontaneously over several years, most patients seek treatment because the
      warts are unsightly and often tender or painful.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Genital warts are highly contagious sexually transmitted diseases (STD) caused by infection
      of Human Papilloma Virus and, as the most common STD in developed countries, can currently be
      considered to be globally epidemic.

      It is estimated that the frequency of Human Papilloma Virus infection among women in the
      world ranges from 2% to 44%.

      The conventional modalities in treatment of warts include destructive therapies such as
      salicylic acid, trichloroacetic acid, cryotherapy, silver nitrate, phenol, cantharidin,
      surgical interventions and laser, antiproliferative agents such as bleomycin, vitamin D
      analogs, podophyllin, 5 fluorouracil and antiviral agents such as cidofovir and retinoids.

      There are different mechanisms have been proposed for the resolution of warts with skin test
      antigens such as mumps, candida, trichophyton both at the injected as well as distant sites.

      Tuberculin:

      Purified protein derivative or tuberculin stimulates the cell mediated immunity non
      specifically by activating T helper 1 cells, Natural Killer cells, and cytokine production an
      increase in interleukin-12 as a process in boosting the cell-mediated immunity contributes to
      the mechanism of action.
