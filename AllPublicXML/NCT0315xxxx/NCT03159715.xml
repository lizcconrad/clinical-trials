  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present project is to study the differential effectiveness of three
      brief self-applied via the Internet interventions for mild to moderate depression: a global
      protocol composed of several therapeutic components (psychoeducation, cognitive
      restructuring, behavioral activation, positive psychology, and relapse prevention), a
      protocol just based on behavioral activation (BA), and a protocol just based on positive
      psychology (PP). The purpose is to know the specific contribution of each therapeutic
      components in the treatment of depression.

    <textblock>
      Depression is one of the most important health problems worldwide, which generates important
      costs, both from the economic point of view as from the social and personal one. If not
      properly treated, it may become chronic and therefore interferes significantly in all areas
      of operation. Hence, one of the most important challenges within this scope is the design of
      new ways to apply treatments in a way that maximizes its therapeutic efficiency. Information
      and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have proven their utility as they are very useful in
      order to provide help to all those in need. It is a field of study very novel which will
      become more important in the short term. Several internationally renowned research groups
      have launched self-applied treatment programs through the Internet in order to address this
      issue. Results obtained so far are consistent and promising, and show these treatments as
      effective. However, these treatments have different therapeutic components and it is
      important to identify the specific contribution of each of them. Therefore, the objective of
      the present project is to study the differential effectiveness of three brief self-applied
      via the Internet interventions for mild to moderate depression: a global protocol composed of
      several therapeutic components (psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, behavioral
      activation, positive psychology, and relapse prevention), a protocol just based on behavioral
      activation (BA), and a protocol just based on positive psychology (PP). A minimum of 102
      participants diagnosed with mild to moderate depression symptoms will be randomly assigned to
      one of the three experimental conditions: an Internet-based global protocol composed of
      several therapeutic components (n=34); a Internet-based protocol based on BA (n=34), and an
      Internet-based program based on PP (n=34). Our hypothesis is that it is possible to progress
      and improve in the treatment of depression through intervention strategies applied through
      the Internet.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) (Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996) at pre, post intervention and at 3 and 12 months follow-ups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is one of the most widely used questionnaires to evaluate the severity of depression in pharmacological and psychotherapy trials. It consists of 21 items about the different symptoms characterizing the major depression disorder, summed to obtain the total score, which can be a maximum of 63 points. The instrument has good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.76 to 0.95) and a test-retest reliability of around 0.8.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) (Watson, Clark y Tellegen, 1988; Sandín et al., 1999) at pre, post intervention and at 3 and 12 months follow-ups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PANAS consists of 20 items that evaluate two independent dimensions: positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA). The range for each scale (10 items on each) is from 10 to 50. The Spanish version has demonstrated high internal consistency (α = 0.89 and 0.91 for PA and NA in women, respectively, and α = 0.87 and 0.89 for PA and NA in men, respectively) in college students.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale (ODSIS) at pre, post intervention and at 3 and 12 months follow-ups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>OASIS consists of 5 items that measure the frequency and severity of anxiety, as well as the level of avoidance, work/ school/home interference, and social interference associated to anxiety. A psychometric analysis of the OASIS scale found good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.80), test-retest reliability (k = 5.82) and convergent validity for this scale.</description>

    <measure>Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale (ODSIS) at pre, post intervention and at 3 and 12 months follow-ups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>ODSIS is a self-report measure which consists of 5 items, evaluating experiences related to depression. ODSIS measures the frequency and severity of depression, as well as the level of avoidance, work/school/home interference, and social interference associated to depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multicultural Quality of Life Index (MQLI) at pre, post intervention and at 3 and 12 months follow-ups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-administered questionnaire that uses 10 items to assess global perception of quality of life in addition to physical and emotional well-being, self-care, occupational, and interpersonal functioning, community and services support, and personal and spiritual fulfilment. The homogeneity of the questionnaire proved to be good, yielding a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.79 and has applicability, reliability, and validity.</description>

    <description>Internet-based Global Protocol is an Internet-based treatment which includes therapeutic components of evidence-based treatments for depression: Motivation, Psychoeducation, Cognitive Therapy, and Relapse Prevention. Furthermore, it incorporates a Behavioural Activation component (BA). The whole protocol stresses the importance and benefits of being active and remaining involved in life, values and goals. The program also includes a component of Positive Psychology (PP). It allows the individual to learn and practice adaptive ways to cope with depressive and anxiety symptoms and confront daily problems. It is a multimedia (video, image, etc.) interactive program designed for optimal use on the computer, but it can also be used on a tablet.</description>
