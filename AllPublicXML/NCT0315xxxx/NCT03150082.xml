    <textblock>
      This two-period cross-over study will evaluate bioequivalence of GR37547 (ciprofloxacin 500
      mg) tablet versus ciprofloxacin 500 mg reference tablet in healthy adult subjects under
      fasting conditions. Subjects will receive Treatment A (GR37547 tablet) and Treatment B
      (ciprofloxacin reference tablet) in crossover manner, separated by a washout period of at
      least 7 days and not more than 14 days. The total duration of study for each subject will be
      approximately 5-7 weeks. This study will enroll approximately 26 healthy adult subjects at a
      single center.
