  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study to examine the links among stress, craving for marijuana,
      and marijuana reminders, or &quot;cues&quot;.

      In this study, an agent called yohimbine will be used to produce stress-like responses.
      Yohimbine is known to cause stress response in studies of alcohol and other substance use
      disorders. This study intends to show it can be used to cause stress in marijuana users as
      well.

      Part of this study will be conducted on a residential unit where participants will live for 7
      nights over a 2-week period (4 consecutive nights the 1st week and 3 consecutive nights the
      2nd week).

      During that time, participants can't leave the unit unescorted or have visitors.

      During the inpatient stay participants will participant in experimental sessions where they
      will be asked to smoke cigarettes containing either marijuana or placebo (a blank).

      Participants will be asked to take capsules that could contain yohimbine or placebo (blank).

      Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and will have their vital signs (blood
      pressure, heart rate) monitored throughout each session.
