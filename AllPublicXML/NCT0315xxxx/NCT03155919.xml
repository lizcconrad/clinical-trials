      Taurine is a nitrogenous compound, naturally present in heart, leukocytes, retina, central
      nervous system, especially in muscles. It has several beneficial physiological effects like
      antioxidant action, and could increase muscle force contraction and insulin sensibility.
      Triathlon is a sport of medium to high intensity, that can causes an increase in the rate of
      oxygen consumption during intense exercise and consequently increases free radicals
      production and oxidative stress, which may compromise an athlete's performance. Due to the
      weekly intense training, triathletes need nutritional care ranging from calories and
      nutrients adequacy to the use of specific nutrients that can help to maintain health. Thus,
      it is believed that the use of taurine associated with chocolate milk after exercise can
      promote general metabolic insulin action in order to favor carbohydrates metabolism
      regulation, assist muscle recover and prevent oxidative damage and thus promote triathletes
      performance and muscle mass gain. Thus, the aim of this project is to evaluate the effects of
      taurine and chocolate milk supplementation in body composition, athletic performance and
      oxidative stress in triathletes.

      BACKGROUND: Taurine is a nitrogenous compound, naturally present in heart, leukocytes,
      retina, central nervous system, especially in muscles. It has several beneficial
      physiological effects like antioxidant action, and could increase muscle force contraction
      and insulin sensibility. Triathlon is a sport of medium to high intensity, that can causes an
      increase in the rate of oxygen consumption during intense exercise and consequently increases
      free radicals production and oxidative stress, which may compromise an athlete's performance.
      Due to the weekly intense training, triathletes need nutritional care ranging from calories
      and nutrients adequacy to the use of specific nutrients that can help to maintain health.
      Thus, it is believed that the use of taurine associated with chocolate milk after exercise
      can promote general metabolic insulin action in order to favor carbohydrates metabolism
      regulation, assist muscle recover and prevent oxidative damage and thus promote triathletes
      performance and muscle mass gain.

      OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effects of taurine and chocolate milk supplementation in body
      composition, athletic performance and oxidative stress in triathletes MÉTHODS: A
      double-blind, crossover, 2-week washout study will be conducted with 20 male triathletes,
      aged 30 to 45 years, which will be offered during eight weeks capsules containing three grams
      of taurine or placebo and 400 ml of chocolate milk ready to drink. In order to assess the
      effects of supplementation, concentrations of serum and urinary taurine, lactate, insulin,
      insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR), markers of protein metabolism (urinary nitrogen, creatinine
      and urea) and oxidative stress markers (MDA, GSH and vitamin E) will be quantified. Body
      composition will be measured by the method of deuterium labeled water. The evaluations will
      occur in four stages: 1o - before starting the training season; 2o - after 8 weeks of
      training; 3o- before starting the second training season; and 4o- after 8 weeks of training
      and supplementation completion. Data will be organized according to the study groups on
      average and standard deviation with application of analysis of variance test for verifying
      significant differences
