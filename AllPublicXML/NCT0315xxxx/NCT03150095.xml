    <textblock>
      Ability to adhere to complex medical regimens is critical to achieving successful transplant
      outcomes, as non-adherent patients suffer graft failure and death following transplantation.
      Since potential recipients greatly exceed organ availability, identification of candidates
      who will adhere to complex post-transplant regimens is critically important and emphasized by
      practice guidelines. When selecting candidates for transplant, physicians try to subjectively
      predict post-transplant adherence because, although tools exist to measure current adherence,
      tools that reliably predict future adherence are lacking. Despite rigorous medical and
      psychosocial screening pretransplant, non-adherence rates are high following transplant.
      Therefore, the current approach for predicting future non-adherence is suboptimal,
      subjective, and greatly needs strategies for improvement.

      Pre-transplant self-management abilities represent a marker of future adherence
      post-transplant. Assessing self-management as a means for predicting future adherence has
      been largely overlooked. Self-management is defined as &quot;taking responsibility for one's own
      behavior and well-being&quot; and consists of three management tasks: medical condition, emotions,
      and social roles. Self-management ability can be measured. However, self-management has not
      been systematically studied in heart and lung transplant patients. Fostering self-management
      abilities may improve post-transplant outcomes by optimizing not only adherence, but also
      proven pretransplant risk factors (e.g. frailty and obesity).Self-management abilities may be
      improved via behavioral interventions such as health coaching.Self-management represents a
      measurable criterion that could be utilized in pre-transplant screening and serve as a point
      of intervention for optimizing adherence and pre-transplant risk factors.The overall
      objective of the proposed research is to improve the knowledge gap regarding self-management
      (and thereby adherence) in transplant by qualitatively and quantitatively studying patient
      factors associated with self-management and testing an intervention that may improve
      self-management.

      The investigators hypothesize: Individualized health coaching including strategies to address
      poor resilience, coping with uncertainty, frailty, and/or negative affect will be an
      effective therapeutic strategy at improving self-management while in the pre-transplant
      state.

      Specific Aim: To test whether transplant candidates who receive pre transplant health
      coaching have greater improvement in self-management abilities.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized, controlled pilot trial testing the effectiveness
      of health coaching versus usual care in a heart and lung transplant cohort on self-management
      abilities (SMAS-30).

      PROPOSED RESEARCH: Patients will be identified from the Mayo Clinic MN, heart and lung
      transplant waiting lists and approached for recruitment in the Transplant Clinic at one of
      their routine clinical (every 1 to 3 month) follow-up appointments. Inclusion criteria:
      Patients aged 18 to 75 years, consenting to research, and listed for lung or heart
      transplantation. Exclusion criteria: Patients will be excluded if ineligible for transplant.

      RESEARCH STRATEGY: This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, pilot study
      comparing the effect of a phone-based, health coaching intervention versus usual care on
      self-management. Methods: Initial encounter: Consented patients will be randomized using a
      random number generator. Intervention patients will complete a one-hour meeting in-person
      with a health coach to build rapport, introduce the intervention, and schedule the first
      phone meeting. Both intervention and control patients will undergo baseline assessments (see
      &quot;data&quot; below). Subsequent Coaching Intervention patients will be assigned a coach trained in
      motivational interviewing who will call the patient weekly for 12 weeks for a 15-30 minute
      intervention (based on the primary mentor's previous research). Briefly a health coaching
      protocol will be utilized to guide training and the delivery of intervention using open-ended
      questions, affirmations, reflections, and summaries (O.A.R.S.) and Elicit-Provide-Elicit
      (E-P-E) techniques. Coaching sessions will be recorded and externally monitored by an
      independent expert to assure treatment fidelity. A coaching intervention protocol will
      include collaborative goal setting and confidence rating regarding the patient's desired
      behavior change (and assessed risks). The control group will receive usual care. Both
      intervention and control patients will complete follow-up questionnaires and physiologic
      assessments at 12-16 weeks. Data: Baseline demographic, comorbidities, and transplant details
      will be abstracted. Daily physical activity measure by a gold standard activity monitor
      (Sensewear Armband, Body media, Pittsburgh,PA) will quantify daily steps, as well as total
      and active energy expenditure. Grip Strength: will be measured using a Jamar Digital Hand
      Held Dynamometer. Three serial measurements will be taken (using the dominant hand),
      averaged, and adjusted by gender and BMI using normative table. Gait Speed: self-selected
      walking speed will be timed over a distance of 15 ft (average of 3 adjusted for gender and
      height). Body composition scan: will determine fat-free mass (body composition). Height and
      weight will be recorded. Questionnaires: RISC-10, PANAS, MUIS, KCCQ, CRQ, FDI, CES-D, PHQ-2,
      GAD-2, SMAS-30, and SMAQ will be collected to assess hypothesized predictors of
      self-management. The primary outcome of the study is the effect of health coaching on
      self-management abilities SMAS-30 (sentinel of post- transplant adherence).

      ANALYSIS PLAN: Sample size: This is a pilot and feasibility study. However, to inform our
      enrollment we have made the following calculations. Change in SMAS-30. A sample size of 25 in
      each group will have 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.81 using a two-group t-test with
      a 0.05 two-sided significance level, where effect size is the end of study difference in
      means between the two groups relative to the SD of the end of study measures, after adjusting
      for baseline and other factors. From the literature, we estimate an unadjusted end of study
      SD for SMAS-30 of 8.5.50 Whereas we do expect our intervention to impact SMAS-30, it is our
      clinical impression that without intervention, patients tend to exhibit similar patterns over
      time. Therefore, we expect the between-person variability in SMAS-30 to be at least as large
      as the variability in assessing SMAS-30 for the same person at different time points. If
      these two sources of variability were the same then they would both have a SD of 6.0, in
      particular the end of study SD for SMAS-30 would be 6.0 or less. With this SD, we would have
      power to detect a difference of 0.81x6.0=4.9. Thus, this pilot study is reasonably powered.
      Allowing for a 20% withdrawal rate (primarily due to transplantation during intervention), we
      will aim for a sample size of 30 per arm. Analysis plan: Demographic characteristics will be
      summarized by mean, median, SD and range (continuous variables) and counts and percents
      (categorical variables). Our primary variable will be end of study SMAS-30 (adjusting for
      baseline), which we will analyze using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), estimating between
      group differences. Subgroup analysis will be performed by sex, ethnicity, and race as
      feasible. A similar procedure to that described above will be employed to impute data if
      necessary. Missing data and end of study SDs for SMAS-30, adjusting for baseline, will guide
      analysis and power calculations for future R01 studies. Secondary Outcomes will examine
      between group differences of changes in gait speed, activity levels, body composition,
      weights, and RISC-10, PANAS, MUIS, FDI, SMAQ, and KCCQ or CRQ measures to inform future R01
      planning. A two-tailed p&lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Postintervention
      focus groups/interviews of 5-7 participants will be conducted by the candidate to obtain
      patient feedback to refine the intervention for future R01.

    <description>The SMAS-30 is a 30-item patient-reported outcome measurement tool. There are six sub-scales, in sequence: Items 1 to 5: Take initiative, Items 6 to 10: Self-efficacy, Items 11 through 15: Investing, Items 16 to 20: Perspective, Items 21 to 25: Multifunctionality, Items 26 to 30: Variety. The total score of the whole scale is calculated as the average of the totals scores of the 6 sub-scales. The possible range of the total score of the whole SMA scale ranges from 0 (never) to 100 (very often).</description>
