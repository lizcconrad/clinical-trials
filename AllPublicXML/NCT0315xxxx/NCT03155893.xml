  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a single supratherapeutic dose of
      AL-335 administered on top of multiple doses of odalasvir (ODV) and simeprevir (SMV) versus
      placebo on QT/QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) interval changes, using
      intersection-union test (IUT) analysis (Panel 1); to assess the effect of ODV on QT/QTc and
      PR interval changes after multiple supratherapeutic doses of ODV using an exposure-response
      (ER) approach (Panel 2); and to assess the effect of multiple supratherapeutic doses of ODV
      on echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (Panel 2) in healthy
      participants.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must sign and date an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he or
             she understands the purpose of, and the procedures required for, the study and is
             willing to participate in the study

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history,
             vital signs, and laboratory tests performed at screening

          -  Participant must have a blood pressure (supine after at least 5 minutes rest) between
             90 and 140 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 90
             mmHg diastolic

          -  Participant must have a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (based on the mean value of
             triplicate ECG parameters) consistent with normal cardiac conduction and function at
             screening

          -  Participant must have an echocardiogram at screening with left ventricular ejection
             fraction (LVEF) greater than or equal to (&gt;=)55 percent (%). Participant should not
             have any other echocardiogram finding suggestive of clinically relevant cardiomyopathy

          -  Female participant must have a negative highly sensitive urine pregnancy test at Day
             -2 (Panel 1) or Day -4 (Panel 2)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has a history of liver or renal insufficiency, significant cardiac,
             vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal (such as significant diarrhea, gastric stasis,
             constipation, or gastrointestinal surgery that in the investigator's opinion could
             influence drug absorption or bioavailability), endocrine, neurologic, hematologic,
             rheumatologic, psychiatric, neoplastic, or metabolic disturbances

          -  Participant with a history of clinically relevant heart rhythm disturbances including
             atrial, junctional, re-entry, and ventricular tachycardia, and heart blocks

          -  Participant with unusual T-wave morphology (such as bifid T-wave) likely to interfere
             with corrected QT (QTc) measurements

          -  Participant with a past history of sick sinus syndrome, heart arrhythmias (example,
             extrasystolic rhythms or tachycardia at rest). Isolated extrasystolic beats are not
             exclusionary; risk factors associated with Torsade de Pointes (TdP) such as
             hypokalemia; family history of short/long QT syndrome; sudden unexplained death
             (including sudden infant death syndrome in a first-degree relative [that is, sibling,
             offspring, or biological parent])

          -  Participant with any skin condition likely to interfere with electrocardiogram (ECG)
             electrode placement or adhesion

          -  Participant with a breast implant or a history of thoracic surgery likely to cause
             abnormality of the electrical conduction through thoracic tissues
