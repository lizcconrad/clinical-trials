  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Police officers, correctional service officers, and 911-operators are at increased risk for
      suffering from trauma-related disorders due to their direct and indirect exposure to
      life-threatening events, such as shootings, violent assaults, or car accidents, among others.
      Typical treatments for post-traumatic stress disorders include psychotherapy and
      pharmacological therapies (i.e., antidepressants). Although these interventions are effective
      for many sufferers, they all have limitations. Thus, the investigators propose to explore the
      usefulness of a new therapeutic technique, reconsolidation blockade, which involves
      reactivating the trauma memory while under the influence of propranolol. Objectives and
      hypotheses: To explore the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of reconsolidation blockade
      therapy as an adjunct treatment for trauma- and stressor-related disorders as defined in the
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Mental Disorders-5. The investigators hypothesize that,
      compared to the control group, 5 weekly trauma-memory reactivations under propranolol
      treatment will confer a significant reduction in trauma-related symptoms and significantly
      more health-related economic benefits. Stress symptoms and health-related costs will be
      assessed at 7, 26 and 52 weeks after study inclusion. In this study, the investigators will
      also explore the effects of reconsolidation blockade with propranolol on various
      neuropsychological functions.
