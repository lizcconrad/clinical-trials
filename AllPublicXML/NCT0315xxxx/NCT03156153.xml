  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are going to carry out a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to study the
      efficiency and mechanism of bumetanide on the treatment of children with Autism Spectrum
      Disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In consideration of the increasing number of autistic children and poor intervention effect
      in China, it is an urgent for us to find some effective medicine. Some studies have reported
      bumetanide, a classic diuretic, could improve autistic behaviors in both animal model and
      humans; while the efficiency of bumetanide on Chinese autistic chilren are unkonwn and the
      underlying mechanisms remain unfolding. We aim at investigating whether bumetanide would
      improve the clinical symptoms in Chinese children with autism within a safe dosage and
      further study the physiological mechanism beneath.We will regularly assess their
      autism-related symptoms during medication, as well as the adverse effects of each patient. We
      will carry out genome-wide association analysis (GWAS), related metabolites in nervous system
      and compare the concentration of the neurotransmitter in autistic brain before and after 3
      months' treatmeat. And we will collect the EEG signal in autistic chilldren when they
      performing certain tasks before and after 3 months' treatmeat.
