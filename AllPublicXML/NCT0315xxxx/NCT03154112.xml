  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The measurement of how much oxygen a baby consumes provides important information about the
      health of the baby, and of how much energy they are consuming. Currently, there is no device
      which measures either oxygen consumption, or another variable that depends on oxygen
      consumption - resting energy expenditure - in neonates or infants. Our group has developed a
      new device which can attach to any ventilator and measures these two variables with accuracy
      in the preclinical setting, including in rodents as small as severely preterm infants. The
      purpose of this study is to compare measurements of oxygen consumption and energy expenditure
      in neonates using this device and comparing it with a gold standard which is rarely used, a
      Douglas bag method in which expired gas is collected and later analyzed.

    <description>This study will involve an ~1 hour, single point in time measurement of oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, resting energy expenditure, and respiratory quotient using two methods while patients are breathing an FiO2 of 40%. These measurements will be measured using the novel, responsive device and compared with gas collected simultaneously collected from a Douglas bag.</description>
