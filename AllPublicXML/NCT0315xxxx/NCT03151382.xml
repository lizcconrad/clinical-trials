      Objective: Evaluation the improvement of the cognitive function of tandospirone add-on
      treatment on patients with AD comorbid anxiety.

      Number of Patients: 30

      Methodology: Randomized, open-label, parallel-group

      Assigned Interventions: Experimental: Tandospirone, 30-60 mg/d + Donepezil, 10 mg/d; Control
      group: Donepezil, 10 mg/d.

      Effect Evaluation: Primary Outcome: Change from baseline in ADAS-cog total score at week 12;
      NPI scale total score at week 12;
