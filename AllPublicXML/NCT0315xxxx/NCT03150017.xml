      To establish the effectiveness of an internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy pain
      management programme (CBT-PMP) on people with spinal cord injury pain compared with usual
      care.

      A pilot prospective, single blinded, randomised controlled trial with two arms an
      internet-delivered CBT-PMP for chronic pain post spinal cord injury (SCI) and usual care.

      The CBT-PMP will contain 8 sessions over 8 weeks, with outcomes assessed at baseline, post
      intervention, and 6 months follow-up.

      Participants will be adults with chronic pain (pain &gt; 3 months), regular internet access and
      not undergoing any other psychological treatments.

      Following the study those in the intervention strand will be invited to complete a focus
      group to explore the subjects' overall experience of the online CBT-PMP.

    <description>SPIRE The programme consists of six modules over six weeks and is based on cognitive behavioural principles. It comprises psychology sessions using cognitive techniques to identify unhelpful and unrealistic thoughts and beliefs related to pain and to challenge and change them and weekly relaxation audios and a home exercise session. Goal setting by participants is used encouraged throughout the programme to aid the implementation of learned CBT techniques into daily life. Educational sessions are delivered across a range of topics including mechanisms of pain after SCI, explanations of the pain gate control theory and how CBT strategies employed can impact on the perception of pain, discussion of medication use, stress management and pacing strategies for activities of daily living.</description>
