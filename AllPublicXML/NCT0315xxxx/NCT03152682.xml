  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A crossover design to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GoodIdea TM (trademark) on glucose
      homeostasis in a healthy population. Eligible participants will be given either the GoodIdea
      drink or placebo and a standardized meal and will consume both in approximately 15 minutes.
      Blood will be drawn at several time points over a 3 hour period to determine the study
      objectives. After a 7-day washout, the participants will come back to the clinic and and
      complete the visit consuming the opposite product given at the previous visit. The primary
      objective is to see the difference of the two-hour iAUC for intravenous blood glucose between
      the active product (GoodIdea) and the placebo following a standardized meal.
