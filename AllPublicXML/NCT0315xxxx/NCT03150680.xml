  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research project is to investigate the potential association of 207
      genetic polymorphisms with the complexity and the severity of coronary artery disease (SYNTAX
      score), along with the patients' response to clopidogrel and statin therapy. The aim of the
      study is to combine genetic, pharmacogenetic, clinical and laboratory data in order to create
      an algorithm (GEnetic Syntax Score-GESS) that will enable an individualized therapeutic
      patient approach.

      Regarding Greece, this is the first prospectively enrolling medical database of this
      magnitude. Clinical and genetic patient information are systematically collected in a fashion
      that will enable also future retrospective evaluation of clinical and genetic details from
      each patient. This study is a discrete arm of a series of research projects that focus on the
      development of personalized medical therapy and share a common purpose: predicting future
      risk of cardiovascular events, assessing the severity and complexity of coronary artery
      disease by incorporating genetic information into the SYNTAX score and providing personalized
      therapeutic guidance to patients. The ultimate goal of the study would be to identify, design
      and develop a panel of genetic markers that in combination with clinical and angiographic
      information will be a reliable tool for predicting cardiovascular risk for future adverse
      events.

    <description>A multilocus Genetic Risk Score will be calculated as the weighted sum of alleles of 207 single nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with CAD [The investigators will construct a multilocus genetic risk score for each individual by summing the number of risk alleles (0/1/2) for each of the 207 SNPs weighted by their estimated effect sizes].
SYNTAX score is a coronary lesion complexity scoring system and represented by a single number.
Clinical variables include:
Major CV risk factors as defined according to ESC Guidelines [as dichotomous variables-yes or no]
Ankle-Brachial Index: a tool for diagnosing peripheral artery disease but also an indicator of systemic atherosclerosis [measurement according to ESC Guidelines-represented by a single number]
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF%) using echocardiography.</description>

        Patients between 18 years to 90 years at entry, of both genders, who are admitted in the
        Department of Cardiology in the AHEPA University General Hospital of Thessaloniki and
        undergo coronary angiography for clinical purposes will be studied. Patients with a
        previous history of coronary artery disease will be excluded. The study includes subjects
        who 1) have suspected CAD and undergo a scheduled diagnostic angiogram for clinical
        reasons, and 2) are hospitalized because of an acute coronary syndrome and thus undergo
        diagnostic angiography (without previous history of CAD).
