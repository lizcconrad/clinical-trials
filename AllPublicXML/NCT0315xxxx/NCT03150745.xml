  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endocervix (cervical canal) is the cavity of the cervix and connects the external os with the
      internal os. It is fusiform in shape and has posterior and anterior oblique longitudinal
      ridges, the plicae palmatae. These are not exactly apposed but inter-lock like a zipper so
      that the canal is kept closed.

      The original squamous epithelium is clearly identified as a smooth, usually featureless
      covering of the cervix; its uniform pink color contrasts with the redness of the original
      columnar epithelium. It joins the latter at the original squamocolumnar junction.

      Many clinicians encounter cervical lesions that may or may not be associated with cytologic
      abnormalities. Such abnormalities as ectropion, Nabothian cysts, and small cervical polyps
      are quite benign and need not generate concern for patient or clinician, whereas others,
      including those associated with a history of exposure to diethylstilbestrol, cervical
      inflammation, abnormal cervical cytology, and postcoital bleeding, should prompt additional
      evaluation. Further, in some patients, the cervix may be difficult to visualize. Several
      useful clinical suggestions for the optimal examination of the cervix are presented.

    <intervention_name>3- Cervical Pap smears</intervention_name>
    <description>Cervical Pap smears will be obtained using the long tip of an Ayre's spatula that will be placed in the endocervical canal with the proximal bulge resting on the ectocervix. The spatula will be carefully rotated around the cervix so that a representative sample of the whole cervix will be obtained. An additional endocervical sample will be obtained by placing a cytobrush or by the other end of the Ayer's spatula in the endocervical canal and gently rotated through 360 degrees as previously described. The samples will be then immediately plated on a slide, fixed by immersing the slide in 95% ethyl alcohol fixative for 15 to 20 minutes and stained by modified Papanicolaou stain using a hand staining procedure</description>
