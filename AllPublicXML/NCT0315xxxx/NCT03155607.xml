  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burn wounds cause intense, complex pain, and subsequent burn wound care causes further
      intense, episodic pain that is often unrelieved by opioid and non-opioid medications,
      resulting in under-treatment of pain. Further, opioid analgesics can have untoward side
      effects including respiratory depression, nausea, constipation, pruritus, drowsiness,
      lethargy, dependence, and induced hyperalgesia. As one of the most severe types of pain, burn
      wound care pain adds to the trauma pediatric patients already experience from the burn itself
      impacting quality of life with subsequent behavioral and maladaptive responses, such as
      agitation, anger, anxiety, hyperactivity, uncooperativeness, aggression, and dissociation.
      Lack of control over the procedure, pain memory, anxiety in anticipation of the repeated
      painful nature of the procedure, and transmission of clinician distress associated with
      inflicting procedural pain on the child contribute to the pain perceived.

      Virtual reality (VR) shows great promise as an engaging, interactive, effective
      non-pharmacologic intervention for various painful healthcare procedures, including burn
      wound care, therapies, and chronic pain conditions, despite equivocal findings, perhaps due
      to methodological issues. Designs of many studies of VR during burn wound care have been case
      studies or carefully controlled within-subject designs; sample sizes have been small.
      Recommendations for ongoing research include conducting more rigorous studies including
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs), repeat design studies, testing VR throughout the
      healthcare procedure, comparing VR to other distraction interventions; and using larger
      sample sizes.

      Primary Aim 1: Compare the effectiveness of age-appropriate, consumer available, high
      technology, interactive VR with standard care (SC) on adolescents' acute procedural pain
      intensity perception during burn wound care treatment in the ambulatory outpatient clinic
      setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Undergoing burn wound care

          -  First visit to the outpatient Arkansas Children's Hospital (ACH) Burn Clinic or first
             wound care procedure in the Burn Clinic without sedation

          -  Ages 10 through 21 years (based on a developmental framework of early adolescence:
             10-13 years, middle-adolescence: 14-17 years, and late adolescence: 18-21 years)

          -  English speaking (Note: Not all data collection tools are available in languages other
             than English)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any wounds that may interfere with study procedures (Previously, we did not have to
             exclude facial, head, neck or hand burns but were able to adapt the VR equipment.)

          -  History of motion sickness, seizure disorder, dizziness, or migraine headaches
             precipitated by visual auras

          -  Incarcerated minors

          -  Minors in foster care

          -  Presence of a cognitive developmental disability determined on prescreening by
             presence of a Section 504 accommodation plan or Title VIII individualized educational
             plan (IEP) in school. If IEP or 504 plan is unrelated to a cognitive delay, then the
             adolescent will be included in the study.
