  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, noninteractive, observational, and longitudinal study aimed at
      assessing the treatment pattern and clinical outcome of acromegaly in China.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to answer some of the most important questions about the treatment
      modalities of acromegaly, the relevance of these treatment modalities to patients' clinical
      outcomes and the economic impact of treatment programs on patients. These answers may be of
      great help to the treatment of these populations and may also help to make treatment and
      related health decisions in the future.

      This study only collects the patient's medical information during the study and does not
      interfere with the patient's treatment. Each patient will be assigned a unique patient
      identification number for the study. The sites will maintain a confidential decode list that
      enables the study staff at the site to link the assigned patient identification number with
      the patient's medical records for extraction of study-required data. These registries will be
      maintained following International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice
      (GCP) and the respective local privacy laws and requirements.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be able and willing to sign the informed consent form (ICF)

          2. Male, female, age 18-75 years old (including 18 years old and 75 years old).

          3. Compliance with acromegaly diagnostic criteria:

               -  At least one laboratory or medical record shows that the patient is random GH ≥
                  2.5 μg / L

               -  At least one checklist or medical record shows radiographic evidence that the
                  patient has a pituitary tumor

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ectopic secretion of GH or pituitary cancer

          2. The patient is diagnosed with other complicated malignancies, or has previously been
             diagnosed with another malignancy, and there is currently evidence of lesion residue.

          3. Have a diagnosis of other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions
             that may increase the risk associated with study participation or may interfere with
             the interpretation of the study results and, in the judgement of the Investigator,
             would make the patient inappropriate for enrollment in this study.

          4. Be a patient who, in the judgement of the Investigator, would be inappropriate for
             enrollment in this study
