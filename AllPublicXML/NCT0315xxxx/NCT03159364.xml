    <textblock>
      Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) result in significant morbidity and
      mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients in China. Antiviral
      drugs are usually used for prophylactic purposes and treatment after early detectable viral
      load. Unfortunately, some patients may develop resistance to antivirals. In addition to
      patient with HSCT, immune compromised patients may also been the targets for these
      opportunistic viruses. Thus in this study, the safety and efficacy of CMV and EBV specific
      cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) will be determined.

      Background:

      Opportunistic infection virus related diseases are major causes of transplant-related
      morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed patients, especially in the early post-transplant
      period. CMV, EBV, adenovirus (ADV), BK virus (BKV) and other viruses after transplantation,
      which may lead to life-threatening infections.

      Adoptive immunotherapy with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) reactive with specific viral
      antigens has proven to be effective without stimulating acute graft-versus-host disease
      (GVHD) owing to the significantly reduced nonspecific alloreactivity. Here, the investigators
      aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple infusions of mix opportunistic infection
      virus peptide cytotoxic T lymphocytes cells in patients.

      Objective:

      Primary study objectives: Infusion of autologous or allogenic Virus-CTL to patients by I.V.,
      to evaluate the safety.

      Secondary study objectives: To evaluate the antiviral efficacy of IV-infused autologous or
      allogenic Virus-CTL cells.

      Design:

      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be obtained through apheresis. T cells from
      PBMC will be activated and enriched by dendritic cells with virus specific peptides. Cell
      preparation time is approximately 12-17 days. Subject will receive infusions of 1x105~4x106
      cells/kg body weight of virus-CTL via IV infusion at 4 times. Patients are followed 1 week
      after the final infusion, monthly for 3 months, and then every 3 months until the trial ends.
