    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, single center, open-label study to examine the ORR, safety, and toxicity of
      avelumab in combination with SAR in non-responding and progressing NSCLC patients previously
      treated with a PD-1 Inhibitor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. More than half of lung cancer
      patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis, with a median survival of only 10-12
      months. In recent years the development of more efficacious therapies for metastatic
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based upon an improved understanding of the underlying
      tumor biology has resulted in an improvement in median overall survival by several months.
      However, survival remains poor for most patients and there remains an urgent unmet need for
      novel treatment strategies to improve survival for these patients.

      Avelumab is a fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody. In phase I studies, avelumab
      was well-tolerated at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV Q2 weeks with the most frequently observed
      treatment related adverse events including fatigue, infusion-related reactions, nausea,
      chills, diarrhea, and pyrexia. However, many patients will not respond to checkpoint
      inhibition, and developing strategies to further improve the efficacy and extend the benefit
      of these treatments to non-responding and progressing patients is an area of substantial
      need. Among NSCLC patients, approximately 80% of patients will not respond to a checkpoint
      inhibitor as monotherapy.

      Combinatorial strategies may increase response rates. Radiotherapy is an intriguing partner
      therapy, with preclinical and clinical studies confirming the immunomodulatory effects of
      radiotherapy. There is particularly interest in the use of radiotherapy in patients who have
      failed a checkpoint inhibitor as monotherapy as this approach will isolate the effects of
      radiation in enhancing response rates.

      Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SAR) (also known as stereotactic body radiotherapy or
      SBRT) has emerged as a potentially curative treatment option for patients with early stage,
      medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer and as a safe and effective local treatment
      for metastatic lesions.

      The investigators hypothesize that local radiotherapy can augment the systemic effects of
      avelumab in NSCLC patients previously refractory to a checkpoint inhibitor previously used as
      standard-of-care treatment. This proposal seeks to gain insight into the clinical and
      biological efficacy of this combination.

    <description>Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.</description>

    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>

    <measure>Duration of Stable Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization to end of study, assessed up to 90 days follow-up</time_frame>

    <measure>Duration of Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization to end of study, assessed up to 90 days follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence or PD is objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Confirmation</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization to end of study, assessed up to 90 days follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating the response rate observed. In cases where confirmation of response is not feasible, it should be made clear when reporting the outcome of such studies that the responses are not confirmed.</description>

    <time_frame>From date of randomization to end of study, assessed up to 90 days follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A growing body of literature indicates that radiographic responses to immunotherapy may have different patterns and kinetics than what would be expected with traditional cytotoxic therapies. To account for these differences we will also characterize radiographic outcomes using the immune related response criteria outlined by Wolchok and colleagues [37] as an exploratory outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of Best Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization to end of study, assessed up to 90 days follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). In general, the patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.</description>
