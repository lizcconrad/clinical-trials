  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be proposed consecutively to any patient who angiomammography examination was
      requested by the clinician in charge of patient. A randomization will be performed between an
      angiomammography examination Standard (SenoBright速) and an optimized angiomammography
      examination.

      A blinded central re-reading of the acquisition technique will be carried out by 3
      radiologists (2 seniors and 1 junior) who will evaluate:

        -  The intensity of lesion enhancement

        -  The presence and type of artefacts on the recombined images.

        -  The quality of low-energy images according to recognized criteria for mammography.

      The gold standard will be histology (biopsies or surgery) or follow-up to 1 year for
      non-biopsied benign lesions
