  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two standard methods of pain control management used
      at Spectrum Health for patients undergoing breast surgery. The two methods being compared are
      the paravertebral block and the pectoral nerve block. Postoperative pain control is essential
      following any major operative procedure. A variety of methods have been utilized to ensure
      adequate analgesia, each with its own advantages and risks. Increasingly, attention has
      focused on regional methods of analgesia, which may allow for reduction in systemic narcotic
      use and their associated complications. Proposed benefits of regional analgesia and a
      resultant reduction in narcotic use include decreased risk of cancer progression, decreased
      length of stay, and decreased risk of ileus.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical profiles of two currently acceptable
      analgesia techniques. The most common regional block used to achieve postoperative analgesia
      following mastectomy is the paravertebral block, during which local anesthetic is injected
      into the paravertebral space which contains the thoracic spinal nerves, between the
      costotransverse ligament and the pleura. At our institution there has been recent interest in
      an alternative regional block. The pectoral nerve block is performed by injecting anesthetic
      between the pectoralis major and the pectoralis minor (PECs I) or between the pectoralis
      minor and the serratus anterior (PEC II).

      The proposed advantage of the pectoral nerve block for regional anesthesia during breast
      surgery is equal analgesic efficacy with fewer potential complications.
