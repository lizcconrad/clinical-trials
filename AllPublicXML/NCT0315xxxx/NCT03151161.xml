  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor(TKI)- ie, erlotinib, gefitinib, icotinib,has been recommended
      as the first option for EGFR-mutated IIIb/IV NSCLC by serial trials as it prolonged patients'
      progression-free survival. The OPTIMAl trial indicated that those who received TKI and
      chemotherapy during the whole treatment window survived longest. Unfortunately, previous
      studies(INTACT, TRIBUTE et al) that concurrently combined TKI and cytotoxic regimens failed
      to improve survival in unselected patients. To avoid the potential synergistic antagonism,
      the FAST-ACT II trial committed a sequential strategy and find a superiority in the
      combination arm upon chemotherapy even in EGFR-mutated group. However, pharmaceutically, the
      continuous administration of an EGFR-TKI before subsequent chemotherapy in FAST-ACT II could
      obviate the effects of cytotoxic agents due to the erlotinib-induced G1 arrest.

      On the basis of these and other studies, the investigators hypothesized that a better
      sequential combination strategy of EGFR-TKI and chemotherapy (adding a EGFR-TKI wash-out
      window before chemotherapy) would be more efficacious than chemotherapy alone. In this study,
      the investigators investigate the efficacy(PFS:progression free survival), safety, and
      adverse-event profile of chemotherapy plus intermittent and maintenance of icotinib compared
      with icotinib single drug, when these drugs were used as first-line treatment in who had
      non-squamous lung carcinoma with EGFR gene mutation in China.
