    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of a
      customized, combined positive psychology and motivational interviewing (PP-MI) health
      behavior intervention versus a standard motivational interviewing (MI) intervention in a
      group of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare a combined positive psychology and motivational interviewing
      (PP-MI) intervention that is adapted for patients with T2D to a standard motivational
      interviewing (MI) intervention. The MGH Diabetes Center and MGH primary care clinics will
      serve as the source of subjects for the study, with patients who have a diagnosis of T2D
      serving as potential participants. The investigators will enroll 60 participants, who will be
      randomized to either an 8-week PP-MI health behavior intervention or an 8-week MI-based
      health education intervention.

      In this project, the investigators plan to do the following:

        1. Test an 8-week, telephone-delivered health behavior intervention utilizing PP exercises
           and systematic goal-setting against an 8-week standard MI intervention in a randomized
           controlled trial (N=60).

        2. Determine whether the PP-MI intervention leads to greater increases in physical activity
           than the MI intervention in T2D patients.

        3. Explore potential benefits of the intervention on outcomes of interest (e.g., optimism,
           positive affect).

      Participants will undergo an initial screening visit during which they will meet with study
      staff in person. At this visit, study eligibility will be confirmed, and eligible and willing
      participants will be enrolled. Following enrollment, participants will complete self-report
      measures, and nurses in the Translational and Clinical Research Center will collect vital
      signs and draw blood for A1c. To ensure that participants have low baseline physical
      activity, they will then take home and wear accelerometers for 1 week.

      Baseline information about enrolled participants will be obtained from the patients, care
      providers, and the electronic medical record as required for characterization of the
      population. This information will include data regarding medical history (type 2 diabetes
      mellitus), current medical variables (conditions affecting physical activity), medications,
      and sociodemographic data (age, gender, race/ethnicity, living alone).

      Participants will undergo a second in-person once adequate baseline physical activity data
      has been obtained.

      In this visit, accelerometer data will be reviewed to ensure that adequate baseline activity
      was captured. If so, participants will be randomized to PP-MI or MI and begin the study
      intervention. During this second in-person visit, participants will receive either a PP-MI or
      MI treatment manual, depending on randomization.

      For the PP-MI intervention:

      For each session, a PP exercise will be described in the manual, with instructions and space
      to write about the exercise and its effects. Next, an MI section will outline specific
      MI-based topics (e.g., pros/cons, managing slips) and facilitate physical activity
      goal-setting. At subsequent sessions, participants will review the prior week's PP exercise
      and learn about a new exercise, then will review the prior week's physical activity goal and
      set a new one.

      For the MI intervention:

      Each week, participants will learn about a different health behavior topic related to
      diabetes health. They will also be introduced to motivational interviewing topics in concert
      with the health behavior education topics.

      Participants will complete the remaining sessions (7 in total) by phone over the next 8
      weeks. Phone sessions will last for approximately 30 minutes, with PP-MI and physical
      activity assignments completed between phone sessions. PP-MI and MI components will be
      delivered stepwise within sessions (rather than intertwined) based on our experience,
      participant feedback, and pilot work. If a week is missed, the session will not be skipped,
      but rather the intervention will be completed sequentially (with participants who miss weeks
      then missing the final sessions), with the exception of the final visit, which skip to
      Planning for the Future in all cases.

      Participants will undergo an in-person follow-up assessment at 8 weeks. At this session,
      participants will repeat self-report assessments that were administered at baseline. Vital
      signs and a blood sample will again be collected at this in-person visit. Prior to this
      assessment, participants will wear an accelerometer for an additional 7 days to measure
      moderate or vigorous physical activity. Participants will also undergo a phone follow-up
      assessment at 16 weeks. During this session over the phone, participants will repeat
      self-report assessments that were administered at baseline. Finally, prior to this follow-up,
      participants will wear another accelerometer for an additional 7 days to measure moderate or
      vigorous physical activity.

      The investigators will allow a window of 3 weeks, to allow flexibility of scheduling such
      in-person appointments in Boston (and to allow coordination with other medical visits at
      MGH), as well as with the final phone assessment, while maintaining integrity of study
      findings.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. T2D. Eligible patients will meet American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for T2D
             (e.g., HbA1c [A1C] ≥6.5%, fasting glucose ≥126 mg/d), with diagnosis confirmed by
             their diabetes clinician and/or medical record review. Patients with well-controlled
             T2D will be included if they have low physical activity because inactivity still puts
             them at risk for complications.

          2. Low physical activity. Low physical activity will be defined as ≤150 minutes/week of
             MVPA (corresponding to ADA recommendations for moderate or greater intensity aerobic
             physical activity). Physical activity will be measured using a brief questionnaire
             adapted from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) which has been
             used and validated in medical cohorts.

          3. Prescribed a non-insulin glucose-lowering drug or choosing lifestyle interventions
             (diet and exercise) to manage T2D.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Cognitive impairment precluding consent or meaningful participation.

          2. Lack of phone availability.

          3. Inability to read/write in English.

          4. Additional medical conditions (e.g., severe arthritis) that preclude physical
             activity.
