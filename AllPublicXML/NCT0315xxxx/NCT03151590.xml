    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective intervention study is to find biomarkers and underlying
      pathomechanisms for non-response of improvement in glucose metabolism to exercise.

      An additional goal is to identify non-responders at an early stage, where prevention
      strategies (pharmacologically or by specific training) will be successful.

    <textblock>
      At baseline and end of study, an intensive metabolic phenotyping including cerebral insulin
      sensitivity as well as tissue biopsies are performed in overweight untrained healthy
      participants at high risk for type 2 diabetes. During the study, an individual exercise
      training at 80% VO2max is performed for 9 weeks. Before and after the training intervention,
      acute tissue biopsies after a standardized bout of exercise are obtained.
