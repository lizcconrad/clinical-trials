      The investigators will assess the heterogeneity of obese individuals in the United States to
      help researchers, clinicians and policymakers to establish goals for obesity treatment and
      identify whether differing interventions may be needed.

      Guidelines for obesity set common targets for interventions and goals around weight loss, and
      randomized trials and epidemiologic studies of obesity tend to consider obesity to be a
      homogeneous entity . The investigators will analyze data from the 2011-2012 wave of the
      NHANES. Obesity will be defined as having a body mass index greater than or equal to 30
      Kg/m2. The investigators aim to identify obese sub-groups according to demographic factors,
      clinical conditions and behavioral characteristics. Results of this type of analysis will
      shed light on an important gap in the way that obesity interventions and guidelines are
      developed and will be an important step in beginning the discussion towards this important
      area.

    <description>: NHANES collects objective physical examination data for each respondent in the sample, in mobile examination centers for standardization purposes. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, and then rounded to one decimal place. Participants were classified as obese using World Health Organization cut-offs for BMI (i.e. â‰¥30 kg/m2).</description>

        The analyses presented in this report included obese adult participants &gt;=20 years of age,
        giving a sample size of 1,873 (90% of obese participants). Due to missing data in the
        covariates, the final analytical sample size was 1,685 (90 % of intended sample).
