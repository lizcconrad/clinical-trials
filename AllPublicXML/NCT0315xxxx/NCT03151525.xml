  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis patients treated with Infliximab (IFX) in deep remission after at least 12
      months of treatment will be randomized to continue IFX or to stop IFX and start Azathioprine
      (AZA).

      Each patient will be followed for 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All eligible subjects will be able to participate in the study at any infusion occurred after
      12 months since the beginning. They will be screened by medical history, physical
      examination, blood and faecal tests (included C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin), as
      required by clinical practice. No children, pregnant or breastfeeding women, or elder
      subjects will be included. A colonoscopy + biopsies in the area of greater inflammation will
      be performed within ± 3 weeks since the baseline visit. The subjects can then be randomized
      and receive their first dose of study medication.

      Subjects will be then evaluated every 8 weeks for the following 12 months from the
      randomization. Clinical and blood tests will be performed, and the partial Mayo Score will be
      calculated at each visit, until the final visit, when a new colonoscopy with biopsies will be
      repeated and the global Mayo Score will be evaluated. At final visit a new faecal sample for
      calprotectin will be collected.

      Safety of the study treatments will be evaluated at each study visit. In case of study agent
      discontinuation, the patient will be managed according to usual practice and followed for the
      entire study period. Patients randomized in AZA arm, could restart IFX.
