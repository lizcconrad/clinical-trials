  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective clinical study designed to observe the long-term clinical outcomes of
      total knee arthroplasty using a patient-specific, posterior stabilized implant in patients
      with osteoarthritis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is prospective. Subjects will be implanted with an iTotal速 PS Knee Replacement
      System. The study will include a minimum of 100 subjects across up to 10 sites. The patients
      enrolled in this study may represent the first cases of the iTotal PS KRS implanted at a
      particular site; data collected for the first 15 patients at each site will be analyzed
      separately from the rest of the enrolled population. This will provide visibility towards
      determining if there exists a learning curve in the implantation process of the iTotal PS
      KRS. The study sites will be located in the United States.

    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Knee Society Scores from the pre-operative visit to the 1-year post-operative visit. The Knee Society Score (KSS) includes an Objective Knee Score, Function Score, Satisfaction Score, and Expectation Score. The objective knee score, completed by the surgeon, includes a VAS score of pain walking on level ground and on stairs or inclines, as well as an assessment of alignment, ligament stability, and ROM, along with deductions for flexion contracture or extensor lag. Patients then record their satisfaction, functional activities, and expectations (Scuderi et al., 2012).</description>

          -  Other physical disability affecting the hips, spine, or contralateral knee
