  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project will investigate the modulation of flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO)
      formation of the CVD risk factor trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in patients with kidney
      disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twelve patients with stage 3 to 4 kidney disease will receive an intervention for four weeks
      and a matching placebo in a crossover study design. Reduction of serum TMAO from baseline to
      end of intervention will be the primary endpoint.
