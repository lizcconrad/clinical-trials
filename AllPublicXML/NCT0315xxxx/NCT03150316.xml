  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) and recommened phase 2 dose(RP2D)
      based on dose limiting toxicity(DLT), and to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics(PK) profile
      of a single agent CKD-581 injection in Combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in
      patients with Previously Treated Multiple Myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, dose escalation study. Cohort of 3~6 patients receive escalation doses
      of CKD-516 until the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.
