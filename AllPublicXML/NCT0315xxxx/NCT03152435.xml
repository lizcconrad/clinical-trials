  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study to observe the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the safety and
      feasibility of chimeric antigen receptor EGFR (EGFR CART) cells in metastatic patients with
      colorectal cancer.

    <textblock>
      This is a study for the patients with colorectal cancer. Maximum tolerated dose climbing test
      is expected into the group of 9 cases of patients. And Phase II expected into the group of 11
      subjects, selected the above safe dose, carrying out a research into the clinical
      effectiveness. Subjects will be collected their T cells and modify them, the modification is
      a genetic change, that EGFR:4-1BB:CD28:CD3 modified T cells, in order to tells the T cells to
      recognize their target tumor cells and potentially kill them, but not other normal cells in
      the subject's body. The CART cells will then be expanded in vitro and then administered to
      subjects. The purpose of this study is observe the MTD and to assess the safety and
      feasibility of CART cells in the patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
