  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positive pressure ventilation can be life saving for patients who are hypoxic, hypercapneic
      or apneic. Manual ventilation with a facemask is a skill that is routinely required for
      emergency medical technicians, respiratory therapists, nurses and physicians. Although mask
      ventilation skills are routinely taught, even the most skilled and experienced
      anesthesiologists struggle to effectively mask-ventilate.

      The effective use of a standard mask requires the simultaneous establishment of a seal
      between the mask and face and the lifting of the jaw. The preferred grip is referred to as
      the C&amp;E technique. The C&amp;E technique requires the index finger and thumb to form a &quot;C&quot; and
      push down on the mask to establish a seal between the mask and face. The lateral three
      fingers form the &quot;E&quot; and wrap under the jaw to provide lift. The grip required to establish
      the seal and jaw lift simultaneously is awkward and difficult to teach. The basic design of
      the standard facemask has not changed in approximately 100 years.

      This study will evaluate a new mask design, Warters Mask, is based on a novel design that
      allows a far more ergonomic grip. The C&amp;E technique is replaced by a more natural grip. With
      the Warters Mask, downward pressure with the palm of the hand centered on the mask provides
      the seal between the face and the mask. The other four fingers align under the jaw to provide
      lift.

    <intervention_model_description>The sequence of standard vs Warters mask will be determined by random number generator. Mask ventilation will be scored with both masks before and after the standard administration of paralytic medication. After grading mask ventilation the study intervention is complete and the remainder of surgical and anesthesia care will be based on the clinical needs and decisions of the care team.</intervention_model_description>
