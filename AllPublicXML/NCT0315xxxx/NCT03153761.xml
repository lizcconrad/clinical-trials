  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate exposure to tobacco constituents from two moist snuff products, and
      provide a basis for comparing mouth-level exposure (MLE) in moist snuff users after use of
      each of the two moist snuff products.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an unblinded, single-center, randomized, two-way crossover study, conducted in
      generally healthy, adult moist snuff users who will be randomly assigned to the order in
      which they will use two moist snuff study products (comparator product, test product).
      Enrolled subjects will use one of each of the study products exclusively for approximately
      one week (seven days +1/-2 day) prior to a test visit, with a different product used each
      week over a two-week period. During each test visit, subjects will use study product ad
      libitum during a 6-hour period. Expectoration will be collected from the subjects during each
      product use. The used study product will be collected after use. Blood samples will be
      collected at each test visit, prior to study product use, for determination of plasma
      cotinine levels.

          3. Self-reports currently using at least two cans of moist snuff per week;

          4. Self-reports that moist snuff is the only tobacco- or nicotine-containing product used
             within 30 days of the Screening-Enrollment Visit;

          5. Usual brand (UB) of moist snuff is one of the products specified in the protocol;

          6. Used their UB product for ≥ 3 months;

          1. Self-reported history of heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, liver disease,
             uncontrolled hypertension, or uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia;

          2. At risk for heart disease, i.e., obesity (body mass index [BMI] &gt; 43 kg/m2), as

             Screening-Enrollment Visit. (The 30-day window for each subject will be derived from
             the date of the last study event in the previous study to the Screening-Enrollment
             Visit of the current study);
