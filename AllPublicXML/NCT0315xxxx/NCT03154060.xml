  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On the first of July 2016, reimbursement for the Freestyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring
      (FGM) was introduced by the Belgian healthcare authority by means of a new diabetes
      convention. Making this the only way to receive the device in Belgium. Since then, many type
      1 diabetes (T1D) patients switched to FGM. But some patients found the sensor on the upper
      arm too visible. Abbott does not recommend to place the sensor on a different place of the
      body than the back of the upper arm, because no tests were done yet (besides on the upper
      arm) to make an accuracy claim. With this study, we want to evaluate the accuracy and the
      precision of the Freestyle Libre FGM by using three FGM sensors simultaneously on different
      places of the body and perform regular self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) tests.

    <description>Three FGM sensors will be inserted simultaneously (one on the back of the upper arm, abdomen and thigh) and will be worn for a consecutive 14 days. Throughout the study, patients should measure capillary blood glucose (BG) with the built-in BG meter of the Freestyle Libre at least 7 times per day (before and 1-2 hours after every meal and before bedtime). Additionally, patients should scan each sensor at least every 8 hours to obtain every measured interstitial glucose value. At the end visit (after 14 days), patients will come back to the hospital to download FGM and SMBG data.</description>

          -  Adult patients â‰¥ 18 years

          -  Signed informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Patients with severe cognitive dysfunction or other disease which makes FGM use
             difficult.

          -  History of allergic reaction to any of the FGMs materials or adhesives when in contact

          -  History of allergic reaction to chlorhexidine or alcohol anti-septic solution.

          -  Abnormal skin at the anticipated glucose sensor insertion sites (excessive hair, burn,
             inflammation, infection, rash, and/or tattoo).

          -  Presence of concomitant pathology that might cause edema at the insertion sites (such
             as heart failure, liver failure, kidney failure defined as eGFR &lt; 45 ml/min).
