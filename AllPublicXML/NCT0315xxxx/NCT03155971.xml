      Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon Catheter is a new device in coronary disease, it can inhibit the
      proliferation of smooth muscle of coronary vessels by transitory contaction, without residual
      implantation.

      More and more evidences have shown its efficacy and safety in diffuse small coronary disease,
      bifurcation disease and in-stent restenosis. But there are still seldom evidences in De Novo
      Lesions of Main Coronary Arteries.

      PCB has used in some subgroup of many study but confused with in-stent renstenosis or small
      coronary disease. The investigators designed this study to evaluate the Efficacy and Safety
      of Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon Catheter in Patients With Diffuse Long De Novo Lesions of Main
      Coronary Arteries.
