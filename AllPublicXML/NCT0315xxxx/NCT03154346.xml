  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first initiative of Project Baseline, a broader effort designed to develop
      a well-defined reference, or &quot;baseline,&quot; of good health as well as a rich data platform that
      may be used to better understand the transition from health to disease and identify
      additional risk factors for disease. Project Baseline endeavors to test and develop new tools
      and technologies to collect, organize, and activate health information.

    <description>An unlimited number of participants will be accepted into a Baseline registry. From the Baseline registry, approximately 10,000 participants will be selected for the Baseline Study. Participant enrollment for the Baseline Study will be stratified by age, sex and risk factors and will aim to reflect the race and ethnicity distribution within the U.S.. The population includes a broad range of participants across the health spectrum, including exceptionally healthy participants, participants at risk of disease, and participants with current disease. The study population will be enriched for participants with an elevated risk of primary cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and/or breast/ovarian cancers.</description>
