  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the statistic reports from World Health Organization (WHO) International Agency
      for Research on Cancer (IARC), the incidence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer ranked
      third and fourth respectively among ten most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide; moreover,
      based on the statistics from Health Promotion Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare
      in Taiwan, the incidence and mortality rate of colorectal cancer ranked second and third
      respectively among call cancer in Taiwanese population. However, if colorectal cancer is
      diagnosed and treated in early phase, the 5-year survival rate for stage I colorectal cancer
      can be up to 90%; on the other hand, the 5-year survival rate for end stage colorectal cancer
      is only approximately 10%. Therefore, the screening, early diagnosis od colorectal cancer is
      crucial. To date, there are some known risk factors for colorectal cancer, including familial
      adenomatous polyposis, obesity, physical inactivity, etc. Alcohol had also been identified as
      an important risk factor for colorectal cancer, and the risk could be higher among Asian
      population because of the reduced enzymatic activity of some of the alcohol metabolizing
      enzymes. Thus, through this study, the investigators hope to find out the risk factors of
      colorectal cancer among Taiwanese population, including alcohol metabolizing enzyme gene
      polymorphisms and their interaction with environmental factors, to attain the purpose of
      early prevention of colorectal cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to find out relationship between alcohol metabolizing enzyme
      gene polymorphism and colorectal cancer, and discuss the impact of the interaction between
      gene polymorphism and environmental factors on the risk of colorectal cancer.
