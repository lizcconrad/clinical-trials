  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR), or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), is
      a specialized form of radiotherapy used to treat prostate cancer with five treatments over
      two weeks, compared with a conventional eight-week or longer treatment course. The purpose of
      this trial is to investigate the effect that proton-based SABR has on quality-of-life in
      patients with localized prostate cancer. The evaluation and treatment will otherwise follow
      standard of care, and is not considered investigational.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer will be
      evaluated according to standard of care medical practices. The evaluation includes history
      and examination, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood testing, and review of the prior
      prostate biopsy pathology report; radiology scans (for example, computed tomography [CT],
      magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], radionuclide bone scan) may be done also; recently
      completed testing may not need to be repeated. Small markers will be placed in the prostate
      to guide the proton beam stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) treatments, and a
      hydrogel spacer may also be placed between the prostate and the rectum to push the rectum
      away from the prostate; the hydrogel spacer will dissolve a few months later. Participants
      will receive five (5) proton SABR treatments over a two (2) week time period. The study will
      have participants complete a quality-of life questionnaire and be evaluated for side-effects
      before starting SABR, at the end of SABR, at three (3), six (6) and 12 months after SABR, and
      then yearly for five (5) years. Evaluation of the cancer status will follow standard of care
      practices for at least ten (10) years.

          -  Prostate volume &lt;75-cc, determined by ultrasound, computed tomography or magnetic
             resonance imaging (modality with lesser volume is acceptable).

          -  If neoadjuvant-concurrent androgen suppression is used, the prostate volume after the
             start of androgen suppression may be used.

          -  American Urological Association voiding symptom index ≤15.
