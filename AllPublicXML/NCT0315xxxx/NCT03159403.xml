  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Types Of Primary Infections Being Treated With Oritavancin</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Types Of Primary Infections refers to whether the primary infection was skin or skin structure or other systemic infection (for example, bacteremia, prosthetic joint infection, osteomyelitis).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Classification Of Primary Infections Being Treated With Oritavancin</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The classification of primary infection refers to whether a skin or skin structure infection was cellulitis, abscess, wound, or other.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion Of Participants With Positive Cultures For Gram Positive, Gram Negative, And Anaerobic Pathogens From The Infected Site</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after oritavancin IV infusion</time_frame>
    <description>All microbiology results during the infection event will be reported. Microbiology results will be noted only for the infection site for which oritavancin (in addition to other agents) is administered or other site related to the primary infection in case of multiple infections. An adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence in participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration Of Treatment With Oritavancin</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through end of oritavancin IV infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The number of days of treatment with oritavancin will be presented.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion Of Participants With A Clinical Outcome Of Cure, Improved, or Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after oritavancin IV infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical assessments will be based on participant records between end of infusion to 30 days following the last dose of Oritavancin. Clinical categories for assessment include:
Cure - Clinical signs and symptoms are resolved, and no additional antibiotic therapy is necessary for the treatment of the infection
Improved - Partial resolution of clinical signs and symptoms, and no additional antibiotic therapy is necessary for the treatment of the infection
Failure - Inadequate resolution, or new or worsening clinical signs and symptoms, such that additional antibiotic therapy is necessary for treatment of the infection
Non-evaluable - Unable to determine response because the participant record did not contain the necessary information to determine cure, improvement, or failure</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion Of Participants With A Microbiologic Eradication Or Microbiologic Persistence</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after oritavancin IV infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Microbiological assessments will be based on participant records between end of infusion to 30 days following the last dose of oritavancin. Microbiological categories will include only gram positive pathogens believed to be related to the infection process and are defined as:
Microbiologic eradication (the baseline gram positive pathogen has been eradicated)
Microbiologic persistence (the baseline gram positive pathogen persists)
Culture drawn post-oritavancin therapy, but no information regarding microbiologic culture results
No culture collected following the last dose of oritavancin
No information available</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Use Of Concomitant Antibiotics With Oritavancin</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through end of oritavancin IV infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Concomitant antibiotics include those used between the first and last dose of oritavancin. The number of participants and the type of antibiotic taken will be presented.</description>
