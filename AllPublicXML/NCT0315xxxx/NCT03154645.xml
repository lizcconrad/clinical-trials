      This double blind randomized trial will compare ibuprofen to acetazolamide for the prevention
      of acute mountain sickness. These drugs have never been directly compared for efficacy. The
      study population is hikers who are ascending at their own rate under their own power in a
      true hiking environment at the White Mountain Research Station, Owen Valley Lab (OVL) and
      Bancroft Station (BAR), Bancroft Peak, White Mountain, California.

      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate if acetazolamide will be similar to ibuprofen
      (i.e. Ibuprofen being non-inferior) in decreasing the incidence of Acute Mountain Sickness
      (AMS) in travelers to high altitude. It has been shown that ibuprofen taken 3 times a day 6
      hours prior to ascent is effective for the prevention of AMS, with a number needed to treat
      of 4, decreasing the odds of getting AMS by a third. The efficacy appears to be similar to
      acetazolamide, with a NNT of 3 -8, although these two medications have not been directly
      compared in prevention of AMS. Acetazolamide is diuretic that is the only FDA approved AMS
      prophylactic medication and the most commonly used drug for AMS prevention. Although
      acetazolamide has been given a 1A indication, it has been shown to limit exercise
      capabilities at high altitude, and rapid ascent has been shown to attenuate its protective
      effects. Ibuprofen has been given a IIB recommendation by the Wilderness Medical Society
      Practice Guidelines, in part because it has not directly compared to acetazolamide. It is
      unknown if a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory can provide protection from AMS equivalent to
      acetazolamide.
