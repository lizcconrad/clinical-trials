  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is the treatment of choice for resectable periampullary cancer.
      PD is still associated with a relatively a high incidence of delayed gastric emptying. And,
      there are no acknowledged strategies to avoid DGE. Several feeding strategies have been
      investigated to cope with this problem. However, there is still no consensus concerning the
      best nutrition support method after pancreaticoduodenectomy. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the effect of nutrition support methods on DGE after pancreaticoduodenectomy: early
      enteral nutrition or total parenteral nutrition.

      Patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy will be randomized to receive early enteral
      nutrition (EN group), or Saline administration (Saline group), or oral intake only (Natural
      control). The EN group will receive standard enteral diet administered through a nasojejunal
      tube. Enteral nutrition will be started on the 1st postoperative day and increased daily by
      20-40 ml up to the estimated level. The Saline group will receive saline administered through
      a nasojejunal tube beginning from the 1st postoperative day. Oral intake will not be
      restricted in all three group.

After PD, enteral nutrition liquid regimen will be used step by step from postoperative day 1 to postoperative day 7.Patients are targeted to receive calories for 25 kcal/kg/day. Meanwhile, oral food intake was not restricted.</description>
