  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, over 2.5 million people suffer from asthma, including one-third of children. This
      is the chronic respiratory disease leading to the highest rate of hospitalization. The
      conventional oxygen delivery means in children are the non-rebreather face mask or low flow
      nasal cannula (standard oxygen therapy - SOT). New non-invasive ventilatory support systems
      such as High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) are emerging. These are nasal cannulas allowing the
      delivery of a high air (or oxygen) flow, exceeding the inspiratory flow of patients with
      acute respiratory failure, allowing to deliver a slight positive expiratory pressure while
      ensuring humidification and warming of the airways. Aerosol administration is also possible
      with excellent efficiency and without interrupting respiratory assistance. Physiological data
      and clinical studies in other pathologies suggest the interest of this technique during the
      asthma attack, but no comparative study currently exists in this indication. The HFNCs could
      have their place upstream of Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV), thus replacing non-rebreather
      face mask sometimes not tolerated by the children. The investigators's hypothesis is that
      HFNCs could improve patients' health faster, reduce the use of other ventilatory assistance
      (NIV, invasive ventilation) and reduce the duration of hospitalization in intensive care
      units or continuous monitoring units (CMU).

    <description>Oxygen therapy will be delivered through high flow nasal cannulas. Aerosol treatments will be administered through a vibrating mesh nebulizer directly connected to the circuit (aerogen®). The airvo® system (Fisher &amp; Peykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Zealand) will be used as the high flow cannula system in the study. Cannula size will be tailored to the child according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The gas flow will be adjusted according to the child's weight in a predefined chart. FiO2 will be adjusted to allow for a SpO2 &gt;92%.
All the patients, regardless of their treatment failure status, will be evaluated at H2, H6, H12 and H24 to monitor their evolution (evaluation of the standard parameters, consciousness, PRAM (Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure) score, pain assessment by the FLACC (Face Legs Activity Cry Consolability) score). .</description>

    <description>Children will receive supplemental oxygen as commonly delivered through a non-rebreather face mask or low flow nasal cannula (standard oxygen treatment) and beta2 agonist aerosol via vibrating mesh nebulizer (aerogen®) according to the procedures usually used in the unit and according to the GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) protocol. This group is the standard treatment group and is therefore the control group.
All the patients, regardless of their treatment failure status, will be evaluated at H2, H6, H12 and H24 to monitor their evolution (evaluation of the standard parameters, consciousness, PRAM score, pain assessment by the FLACC score). The use of adjuvant therapies (magnesium sulfate, salbutamol IVSE, and ipratropium bromide) will remain at the discretion of the physician in charge of the child and will be evaluated as a secondary criterion.</description>
