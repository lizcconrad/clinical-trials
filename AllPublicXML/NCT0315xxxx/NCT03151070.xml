      &quot;¡Que Vivan las Madres!: Venga a tener su parto al CAP&quot; (QVLM) is a guatemalan
      quasi-experimental study that has been performed from January 2014 to January 2017 by the
      Epidemiological Research Center in Sexual and Reproductive Health (CIESAR) in Guatemala in
      coordination with PRONTO International and University of San Francisco, California. This
      project has been financed by Grands Challenges Canada' &quot;Save Lives at Birth, A Grand
      Challenge for Development&quot; partnership that includes USAID, Norwegian ministry of foreign
      affairs, Bill&amp;Melinda Gates foundation, UKaid. This project has applied a stepped wedge
      design (SWD) over 6 zones or clusters. Each one of the zones contains from 4 to 6
      communities, each one with the presence of one second level health facility (known in Spanish
      as CAP, Centro de Atención Permanente). These health centers are the next level in attention
      after home, traditional and empirical attention. Communities around the selected health
      centers are mostly rural and have the worst maternal health indicators in the country. These
      health centers are expected to have enough equipment and personnel to attend the deliveries
      that occur in their communities. This study was performed in Huehuetenango and Alta Verapaz
      districts in north Guatemala. Each one with 3 zones for a total of 6 zones. The study follows
      a Stepped Wedge Design, in which all 6 zones are eventually intervened, but at different
      regular periods of time (each period is 4 months long). This project applies a package of 3
      simultaneous interventions in each zone with the purpose of increasing institutional
      deliveries and improving deliveries attention in public health centers. This intervention
      plan has been implemented in a pilot study reported in (Kestler et. al, 2013).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individual delivery data has been collected in site from health centers records. Thus, the
      study does not depend on official data from the ministry of health. Not only is MOH data hard
      to obtain, it also may not contain the details we are interested in that are put by hand by
      doctors and nurses in clinic histories. In order to get uniform data that fits the study
      needs, a parallel monitoring process has been set up. Data for mortality and morbidity events
      that occured in communities during the study is limited. We don't have the community
      counterpart of our indicators. Government data of perinatal deaths in community may be
      obtained with 1 or 2 years of delay, however there may be an underreporting of such events.
      Likewise, there is no data source for maternal morbidity in community deliveries since
      community practice is usually not documented nor reported.

      The concept of perinatal mortality used in this study is not the standard concept that
      includes death from 28th gestational week to 7 days after birth. The perinatal mortality
      outcome in this study takes into account only deaths that occur during care in health centers
      (approximately 48 hours since birth). This is intentional since the aim of this study is to
      improve clinics' skilled delivery care, thereferore it is concerned on reducing the newborn
      deaths that occur during care given in site. Along this study, the focus is in these subset
      of perinatal deaths.

      The APGAR measure 1 minute and 5 minutes after birth, and the reported procedures for the
      newborn are used to identify cases of perinatal morbidity.

      This study is targetted to the low level health centers in Huehuetenango and Alta Verapaz.
      This includes 33 health centers. This is a fixed number of health centers and there is no
      control of the patients that got treated at the health centers. This is the reason why there
      is no sample size assessment. The selection of the health centers was limited by the
      definition of CAP (second level health facilities according to local definition) and the
      amount of patients that received the intervention by attending their deliveries in health
      centers can not be controlled.

      Having data on all vaginal and uncomplicated deliveries that occur in health centers, the
      analysis can be done by individual cases and also by aggregating data in time periods. Also,
      analysis methodology of trials with stepped wedge design has been developed in the last
      years. A generalized mixed model for a multilevel and longitudinal analysis is going to be
      used in order to account for different sources of variability within and between health
      centers and times. So far (April 2017) we have done preliminary analysis this way and are
      confortable with this methodology selection.

        The total population projected for 2014 for the involved communities is approximately 1.4
        million. Each community is associated to one low level public health center. Communities in
        Huehuetenango have an average population of 34,158, and those in Alta Verapaz have 61,237.
        In the 33 communities, 75% of live births occurred at home while only 22% of live births
        had medical attention according to national live birth data from 2014. Huehuetenango
        district has perinatal mortality rate of 43 (per 100,000 live births) and Alta Verapaz
        district has 35. These two districts have the worst perinatal mortality indicators
        according to the guatemalan national survey on maternal and child health (ENSMI) for the
        period 2014-2015.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For participating facilities, health centers in Huehuetenango and Alta Verapaz
             districts.

          -  For participating facilities, health centers of type &quot;CAP&quot; (centro de atención
             permanente) which is the second level of attention in Guatemala, after attention in
             home and community.

          -  For institutional deliveries events, vaginal deliveries attended in participating
             health centers.

          -  For perinatal morbidity and mortality, any child that is born from an eligible vaginal
             delivery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For deliveries, cesarean sections are ignored, since the training is focused on
             vaginal delivery care.

          -  In a secondary analysis, perinatal mortality cases that occured before arrival to the
             health center are excluded.
