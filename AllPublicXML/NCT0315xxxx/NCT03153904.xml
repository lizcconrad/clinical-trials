      Connecticut Child STEPS is a randomized controlled trail investigating the effectiveness of
      MATCH-ADTC in treating anxiety, depression, trauma, and/or behavioral problems in children
      seeking services at four Department of Children and Families (DCF) funded clinics in the
      state of Connecticut. The study will evaluate child outcomes following two forms of therapist
      training in the MATCH model.

      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will investigate the effectiveness of a modular,
      transdiagnostic treatment protocol for youth with anxiety, depression, trauma, and/or
      behavioral problems (MATCH-ADTC) in four DCF funded clinics in the state of Connecticut.
      MATCH synthesizes common elements found across dozens of evidence-based treatments into one
      model that is flexible and responsive to the complex needs of children and families. The RCT
      will evaluate child outcomes following two forms of therapist training in the MATCH model:
      (1) the 6-day MATCH training only; (2) the 6-day MATCH training plus weekly ongoing case
      consultation with a MATCH consultant. Participating children are between the ages of 7 and
      15.

    <description>Therapists at local, community clinics attend a 6-day training on the Modular Approach to Therapy for Children with Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, and Conduct Problems (MATCH; Chorpita &amp; Weisz, 2009). After the training, therapists participate in weekly consultation meetings that are led by a MATCH Consultant from the study team. MATCH Consultants review sessions and the clinical monitoring and feedback system, provide recommendations for upcoming sessions, and review MATCH modules via role-plays and models.</description>

    <description>MATCH-ADTC (Chorpita &amp; Weisz, 2009) is designed for children aged 6-15. Unlike most evidence-based treatments (EBTs), which focus on single disorder categories (e.g., anxiety only), MATCH is designed for multiple disorders and problems encompassing anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and disruptive conduct, including the conduct problems associated with ADHD. MATCH is composed of 33 modulesâ€”i.e., specific treatment procedures derived from decades of research on EBTs. The various modules can be organized and sequenced flexibly to tailor treatment to each child's characteristics and needs.</description>

    <description>For each child, the web-based MFS provides weekly monitoring of the MATCH modules used and the child's treatment response, in two forms (a) changes on the Brief Problem Monitor (BPM) and (b) changes in severity of the top treatment concerns identified by youths and caregivers. At the end of treatment, the MFS provides a complete record of modules used, and child treatment response, across all weeks of treatment.</description>
