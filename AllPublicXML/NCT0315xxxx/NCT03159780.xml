  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clear-lens extraction has been considered as first-line therapy for primary angle closure
      glaucoma(PACG) and application of toric intraocular lens (IOLs) leads to better postoperative
      visual acuity, yet little is known about the prevalence of corneal astigmatism in PACG
      patients. We intend to make biometry examination for Chinese PACG patients, to obtain
      keratometry (K) , axial length (AL) and so on, and demographics data will also be recorded.
      We will study the prevalence of corneal astigmatism before glaucoma surgery in Chinese
      patients with PACG. Furthermore, differences of corneal astigmatism between primary
      angle-closure glaucoma and cataract patients will be explored. Finally, the prevalence of
      corneal astigmatism before glaucoma surgery in Chinese patients with PACG will be portrayed
      and can be instructive to the IOLs' manufactering.

      Biometry examination contains keratometry (K) , axial length (AL), central anterior chamber
      depth, visual field loss(mean deviation, MD), choroidal thickness(CT), range of
      goniosynechia, and stage of PACG.

      Demographics data contains age, gender, and eye.

        Primary angle closure was defi ned as iridotrabecular contact, either appositional or
        synechial, of at least 180Â° on gonioscopy, and primary angle-closure glaucoma as
        reproducible glaucomatous visual fi eld defects, glaucomatous optic neuropathy, or both,
        and intraocular pressure greater than 21 mm Hg on at least one occasion.
