  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is a rare genetic skin disease characterized by fragility
      of the skin and mucous membranes resulting in painful blisters and erosions after minor
      trauma. The simplex form is classified by skin blister development in the basal epidermis.
      Diacerein 1% Ointment is a topical ointment that is being developed for the treatment of EBS.
      Diacerein in the topical formulation is hydrolyzed to rhein in the epidermis and dermis
      following administration. Diacerein and rhein have been shown to inhibit the in vitro and in
      vivo production and activity of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and other pro-inflammatory
      cytokines.The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Diacerein 1% Ointment to
      Control Ointment when applied once-daily for 8 weeks in subjects with EBS.

      The proposed study is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      vehicle-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical
      Diacerein 1% Ointment for the treatment of subjects with EBS. Subject randomization will be
      stratified by genotype (KRT5 and/or KRT14 versus other genotypes) and age group (&lt;8 and ≥8
      years old). Participants will be subject to up to 6-week screening period, then be assigned
      to treat EBS lesions once daily with either Diacerein 1% ointment topical formulation or
      placebo control ointment for 8 weeks, followed by an 8 week follow-up period. Approximately
      80 subjects are planned to be randomized to one of the 2 treatment groups in this study at
      approximately 20 international investigational centers.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of Diacerein 1% Ointment to
      Control Ointment based on reduction in body surface area (BSA) of EBS lesions being treated
      when applied once-daily for 8 weeks in subjects with EBS. The secondary objectives are to
      compare the effects of Diacerein 1% Ointment to Control Ointment in subjects with EBS in
      changes in Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scores, pain, pruritus, mobility, and safety
      and tolerability.

             interferes with the study medication application or the study assessments

          -  Subject has a non-EBS skin disease (e.g., psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, eczema, sun
