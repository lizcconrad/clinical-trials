  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The health promotion actions carried out in the school environment have positive
      effects on reducing risk factors for chronic diseases in adolescents. Interdisciplinary
      strategies involving school and family to increase the level of physical activity among
      adolescents, inside and outside the school, are essential to encourage healthier lifestyles.

      Aim: To determine whether a 24-weeks interdisciplinary intervention program promotes
      improvement in the level of physical activity, physical fitness, sleep quality, life
      satisfaction, eating habits and reduce the sedentary behavior of schoolchildren aged 10 to 13
      years of public schools in the city of Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil.

      The intervention: Includes training of teacher Physical Education in the principles of
      self-determination theory and ecological theory at practical applications for motivating
      adolescents in physical activities and sports. The students will be given information on the
      benefits of a physically active lifestyle and will be encouraged to participated the new
      opportunities for physical activity in their school and community. The program will offer
      physical activity strategies over the 24-weeks during class Physical Education, afternoon
      recess and active lesson breaks in theoretical classes. Nutritional guidelines and gardening
      experience will be developed to encourage healthy eating habits among schoolchildren and to
      reduce salt, oil and sugar in the preparation of school lunch.

      Methods/design: The project, which being conducted as cluster randomized trial, is to
      evaluated whit in a mixed methods, including qualitative and quantitative approach will be
      used for the construction of the actions integrated to the school physical education
      curriculum and evaluation of the program by the participants and supporters. The RE-AIM
      evaluation metric (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) is used
      to guide the validation this program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention will be unfold over the 24-weeks with students of six to seven school terms
      of implementation physical activity and nutrition intervention strategies. The total of five
      schools full-time were contacted for participation in the survey, one was excluded because
      they had no interest in participating. Allocation of pairs of schools in the experimental and
      control groups was done by randomization (draw for the experimental and control groups), and
      later the schools were informed about their condition in the study (experimental group or
      control group). The dimensions assessed in the research were defined from the problems and
      needs pointed out by the school in the initial stage of training and diagnosis of the local
      reality. The intervention strategies consisted of the following across: promote teacher
      Physical Education training; develop school actions integrated in the school curriculum;
      increase pratice of physical activity (in class time and recess); Improve eating habits
      (nutritional guidence, gardening experience, school lunch); promote healthy lifestyle program
      during school breaks; provided with physical activity equipment; parent engagement in health
      education practice.
