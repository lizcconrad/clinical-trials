  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor learning occurs with structural and functional modifications in neural networks that
      meet a certain demand. The improvement of performance in diverse activities is a measure of
      learning, as well as the generalization and transference of this capacity. Transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a modulation technique of brain activity that modifies
      cortical excitability, causing changes in motor evoked potentials that influence motor
      learning. Modifications similar to the long-term potentiation, essential for learning
      processes, have also been described after applying tDCS. The primary motor cortex is the area
      of stimulation where there is more robust evidence in favor of increased motor learning.
      PURPOSE: to investigate the effects of anodic tDCS on the learning of sequential finger
      movements in young and healthy individuals.

      Thirty-six young healthy individuals, right-handed, with no deficits that difficult the
      performance of the procedures will participate in the study. These individuals will be
      randomly divided into an experimental group that will perform the motor training of a
      sequential task of fingers simultaneously to the anodic tDCS on the contralateral motor
      cortex the trained hand and a control group that will perform the same training
      simultaneously the stimulation placebo (simulated in the same region of the experimental
      group). The training will consist of 8 blocks with 300 repetitions of sequential finger
      movements performed with only the right upper limb. The speed and accuracy of sequential
      movements will be used as a measure of performance. These measures will be performed prior to
      training, immediately after, 48 hours, 7 days, and 28 days after trained hand training (TH)
      for assessment of short and long term learning. In addition, performance evaluations (1) of
      the reverse-trained sequence in TH will be performed to evaluate the generalization; (2) of
      the trained sequence in left hand (non-trained) to evaluate the intermanual transfer; and (3)
      trained sequence in TH in double-task condition to evaluate automaticity. Appropriate
      statistical methods will be used to identify inter- and intra-group differences.
