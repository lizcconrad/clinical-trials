    <textblock>
      This study used a pre post intervention mixed methods quasi-experimental design with a group
      of health facilities offering antenatal care (ANC) services (primary health centers in rural
      area) as the sampling units. This study was conducted in three phases, which consisted of a
      situational analysis using qualitative methods (Phase 1), selecting an appropriate test
      through evaluating 4 candidate tests and the participatory design and implementation of an
      intervention that included onsite training, provision of supplies and medicines, quality
      control and supervision (Phase 2), and an evaluation combining review of record tools,
      interviews, time motion study and estimating incremental costs (Phase 3). The conceptual
      framework draws on multilevel assessment (MLA), policy triangle framework, Medical Research
      Council framework for designing complex interventions and the Normalization Process Model
      (NPM). Methods included document review, seventy five interviews were conducted with health
      providers, district managers, facility managers, traditional healers, pregnant women,
      community health workers, and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) managers in phase I and
      fourteen in phase III, non-participant observation, time-motion study, incremental cost
      analysis, and sensitivity, specificity and ease of use analysis of four candidate point-of
      care tests. Data were collected between 2012 and 2014. Qualitative data were analyzed through
      thematic analysis supported by Nvivo software. Quantitative data were analyzed through
      descriptive statistics such as frequency, mean and median supported by SPSS. Phase I
      identified barriers to implementation and uptake of syphilis testing at health provider and
      community levels. The most important barriers at provider level included fragmentation of
      services, poor communication between health workers and clients, failure to prescribe
      syphilis test, and low awareness of syphilis burden. Cost of testing, distance to laboratory
      and lack of knowledge about syphilis were identified as barriers at community level. Phase
      II: Alere DetermineTM Syphilis was the most sensitive of the four point-of-care tests
      evaluated. The components of the intervention were successfully implemented in the selected
      health facilities. Overall, phase III showed that it is feasible and acceptable to introduce
      a point of care test for syphilis in antenatal care services at primary health care level
      using the available staff. The findings suggested that an intervention that introduces point
      of care test for syphilis at antenatal care services is feasible, acceptable, and of
      comparable costs to HIV screening in pregnancy. Nonetheless, instructions and supervision
      need to be clearer to achieve optimal levels of screening and quality control, and barriers
      identified by health workers need to be overcome. The point-of care test for syphilis is
      likely to be acceptable by health workers as a routine service and incorporated as a normal
      practice in Burkina Faso context.
