  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For a number of years, researchers have examined the effects of the muscle-tensing technique,
      Applied Tension (AT), on blood donation-related vasovagal symptoms and donor retention. AT
      was developed originally to reduce symptoms and avoidance behaviour in people with strong
      fears of blood and needles (phobics). It was based on the idea that exercise-related
      increases in blood pressure might be able to counteract the effects of stimuli that lead to a
      decrease in delivery of blood to the brain. AT was adapted for non-phobic blood donors and
      significant reductions in self-reported vasovagal symptoms and the need for nurse-initiated
      treatment as well as increases in donor retention were observed in some groups.

      That said, individual response to AT is quite variable. This is probably related to recent
      research indicating that exercise-related maintenance of heart rate and blood pressure plays
      only a minor role in reducing vasovagal symptoms. Rather, AT appears to be working at least
      in part by regulating breathing and reducing the possibility of hyperventilation. Pilot
      results suggest that a novel intervention aimed specifically at breathing may be more
      effective and reliable than traditional AT. To evaluate this idea, 408 blood donors at mobile
      clinics in colleges and universities will be assigned randomly to four conditions. In brief,
      5-minute preparation sessions using a notebook computer, donors will either learn a
      respiration control technique to avoid hyperventilation, AT, both, or neither. As a
      manipulation check and also a means of examining mechanisms of the interventions, e.g., the
      possibility that AT may work by regulating breathing and CO2, participants will wear
      non-invasive portable capnometers while they are giving blood. Outcome will also be assessed
      by self-report of vasovagal symptoms, observational data, and number of return visits to a
      blood clinic in the following year verified by the provincial blood collection agency,
      Héma-Québec. As a secondary aim, the research will examine possible moderating effects of
      pre-donation anxiety and sex.

      The development of simple, effective approaches to reduce vasovagal symptoms during blood
      donation has the potential to improve the blood donation experience and blood donor retention
      as well as encourage people who have never given blood to consider the procedure. It will
      also improve medical and dental care more generally given the use of needles in so many
      procedures.
