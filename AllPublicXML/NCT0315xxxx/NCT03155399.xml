  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the repetitive proprioceptive
      bilateral stimulation for the early recovery of the voluntary muscle contraction in stroke
      patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The central nervous system (CNS) has plastic properties allowing its adaptation through
      development. These properties are still maintained in the adult age and potentially activated
      in case of brain lesion. In the present study authors hypothesized that a significant
      recovery of voluntary muscle contraction in post stroke patients experiencing severe upper
      limb paresis can be obtained, when proprioceptive based stimulations are provided. The
      proprioceptive based training (PBT) aims to stimulate the emergence of voluntary contraction
      and to foster motor recovery. It is based on motor learning principles, such as the
      repetition of tasks with concurrent use of feedbacks. The proposed concept is based on the
      concurrent repetitions of movements performed with the non-affected limb and with the
      affected one, passively mobilized by physiotherapist in charge of guaranteeing the optimal
      kinematic execution.

    <description>During the PBT patient will stay in supine position with the upper limbs positioned in symmetric posture. He/She will be asked to move both limbs with the same frequency performing bilateral flexion-extension of one of the upper limb districts according to the available free ROM of the target joint. The movement execution of the affected arm will be supported by the physiotherapist performing passive movement at the same rhythm, as the one executed with the unaffected side. Patient will be asked to focus the attention on the movement performed against gravity, which will be reinforced by a verbal command. Afterwards, the physiotherapist will fully support movement execution coherently with the patient's movement initialization. The active movement performed voluntarily by the patient with unaffected limb will be considered as the reference movement, that the physiotherapist has to emulate passively, by synchronization of passive movement executed in phase with the affected side.</description>

    <description>The patients randomized to the CNT group will be asked to perform exercises for postural control, exercises for hand pre-configuration, exercises for the stimulation of manipulation and functional skills, exercises for proximal-distal coordination. All the exercises will be performed with or without the assistance of a physiotherapist. The upper limb motricity will be trained with progressive complexity.</description>
