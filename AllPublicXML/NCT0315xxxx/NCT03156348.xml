  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adverse drug events (ADE) are one of the major problems affecting quality of care and
      achievement of therapeutic goals in older adults (OA), increasing re-admissions, hospital
      stays, resource use, and problems on patient safety. The present study aim is to determine
      the impact of the clinical pharmacist interventions on the prevention of ADE in OA at 3
      months post-discharge compared to usual care.

      A randomized clinical trial of two parallel groups 1: 1 (control and intervention) plus a
      historical control group will be carried out at the Internal Medicine Service (IMS) of the
      teaching Hospital at the University of Chile. The sample will be of 611 patients (242 per
      each parallel group and 127 of the historical control group) of 60 years or older, admitted
      to the IMS for acute pathology or decompensation of chronic pathology, with survival over 6
      months, who is under pharmacological therapy and have a caretaker or responsible contact
      person at discharge.

      The historical control group will receive usual care and the parallel control group will also
      receive training on pharmacogeriatrics. The intervention group will receive the care of a
      clinical pharmacist during hospitalization, at discharge and post-discharge, through a home
      visit at 30 days post-discharge and a telephone call at 60 days post discharge.

  <detailed_description>

      The intervention plan during hospitalization will consist of daily monitoring of
      pharmacological efficacy and safety, participating in clinical rounds and patient interviews.
      To review, assess the indications according to the conditions of each patient and evaluating
      possible interactions of clinical importance, dose adjustments, potentially inappropriate
      medication for older adult (OA), adverse effects and omissions of therapy. To make
      recommendations to the healthcare team regarding pharmacological therapy received during
      hospitalization and at discharge.

      Patient-directed interventions will occur at discharge and post-discharge, focusing on
      clarifying management regimens, drug use motives, preventing drug-related problems,
      clarifying doubts and educating on pharmacotherapy, and enhancing adherence to treatment. The
      selection and recruitment of the patients will be made during the first 48 hours of their
      admission to the Internal Medicine Service (IMS), where they will be invited to participate
      and sign the informed consent.

      In all groups, a physician, pharmacist, and occupational therapist, blind to treatment
      assignment, will collect sociodemographic, morbid, pharmacotherapeutic, and functional
      (Barthel Index and Lawton &amp; Brody Scale), adherence (Morisky &amp; Green Scale), delirium
      (Confusion Assessment Method, CAM), comorbidity (cumulative illness rating scale in
      Geriatrics (CIRS-G)), anticholinergic burden (Anticholinergic Burden Scale and Ars Risk
      Scale), potentially inappropriate medications (Beers Criteria and screening tool of older
      people's prescriptions &amp; screening tool to alert to right treatment criteria (STOPP &amp; START))
      before, during hospitalization, at discharge and post-discharge. Also a follow up by
      telephone interviews at 30, 60 and 90 days after hospital discharge from the IMS.

      Two trained and independent evaluators (geriatrician and clinical pharmacist), blind to
      treatment assignment, will evaluate the history of each case and by consensus will assign the
      presence of Adverse Drug Events (ADE), and classify them as preventable or not and according
      to severity. The Chi-squared or Fisher exact test will be used to test the hypothesis that
      clinical pharmacist intervention prevents at least 50% of ADE at 3 months post-discharge in
      OA compared to usual care in the IMS.

    <description>During hospitalization and at discharge a clinical pharmacist (CP) will monitor daily pharmacological safety and efficacy of the medication to asses and make appropriate recommendations. CP will explain the use reasons of each of the drugs.
At 30 days post-discharge, the CP will review the updated clinical record of patient and conduct a home visit to enhance and ask about adherence, self-medication, medication use at that time and possible results of laboratory tests performed and clarify doubts regarding the use of current medications. The same activities will be made at 60 days by telephonic way, to reinforce the recommendations.</description>
