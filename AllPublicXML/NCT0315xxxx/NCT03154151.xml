  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If you worked or volunteered as a WTC rescue, recovery or clean-up worker after the 9/11
      attacks, and you are still experiencing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms related
      to your WTC experience, you might be eligible to participate in this clinical trial of
      therapist-assisted, Internet-based (online) writing therapy for WTC responders with
      persistent PTSD symptoms. This study is for WTC responders who are not currently receiving
      psychotherapy/counseling, and who are not currently taking prescription medication for a
      psychiatric or emotional problem. In this study, the researchers aim to find out if
      Internet-based therapy can help WTC responders who are still experiencing PTSD symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some people who live through traumatic experiences, such as the 9/11 WTC attacks or their
      aftermath, suffer from mental and physical problems that occur as a result of the incident
      and can persist over time. These problems are known as post-traumatic stress reactions or
      symptoms, and may include sleep disturbances, feelings of guilt and shame, persistent
      nightmares or upsetting memories of the incident, avoidance of reminders that might trigger
      upsetting memories, loss of interest in activities, concentration difficulties, and feeling
      distant from other people.

      People who experience persistent PTSD symptoms often receive treatment in person in an
      outpatient clinic. However, recent findings suggest that Internet-based treatment can also
      yield positive treatment effects. The Internet offers people the opportunity to receive
      psychological support from home. For some people, it is easier to communicate without direct
      visual contact with another person about their experiences. Despite the distance, people can
      reflect on their situation or concerns with the help of a personal therapist.

      As mentioned above, this study is for WTC responders who are not currently receiving
      psychotherapy/ counseling, and who are not currently taking prescription medication for a
      psychiatric or emotional problem. After completing the online consent form and an initial
      online questionnaire, participants complete a telephone assessment conducted by a member of
      the team at Mount Sinai Medical Center. If you are eligible and agree to participate, you
      will be randomly assigned (as by the flip of a coin) to receive one of two therapies:
      Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy or Internet-based supportive therapy. Each
      participant is assigned a personal therapist from the team at Mount Sinai to work with
      throughout the treatment. In this study, communication between participant and therapist is
      conducted exclusively across the Internet, in written form, through the secure Web platform
      housed at Mount Sinai. The treatment involves written exchanges between participant and
      therapist over the course of approximately six weeks. Through guided writing, online therapy
      aims to help WTC responders process their traumatic experiences or better manage current life
      problems. In this study, the researchers aim to find out if Internet-based therapy can help
      WTC responders who are still experiencing PTSD symptoms.

The PCS and MCS are scored to range from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating the lowest level of health and 100 indicating the highest level of health.</description>
