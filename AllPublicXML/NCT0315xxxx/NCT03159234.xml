  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is the most common medical complication of pregnancy in the united states four to
      five percent of pregnancies are complicated by diabetes.

      Pregestational diabetes (diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy, type 1 or type 2 diabetes
      mellitus) comprises approximately 13 percent of all diabetes in pregnancy, while gestational
      diabetes ( diabetes with onset or first recognition in pregnancy) comprises the remaining 87
      percent . The prevalence of pregestational diabetes has been increasing due to the increasing
      prevalence of type 2 diabetes in women of reproductive age . The mainstay of the medical
      management of pregestational diabetes involves frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels
      with adjustment of diet and insulin therapy to achieve normoglycemia. Normoglycemia is
      important because maintenance of maternal blood glucose concentration at or near
      normoglycemic levels decreases the likelihood of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as
      miscarriage , congenital anomalies , macrosomia and fetal death.

    <intervention_name>fetal lung volume</intervention_name>
    <description>the best method for measurement of fetal lung volume is by the rotational technique in which each lung is obtained by serial contouring of the pulmonary area after rotating the volumetric image.this is more recent method seems to have advantages allowing finer contouring of the lung and subsequent modification of the contour as well as being better able to estimate the volumes of irregular and small lung as in congenital diaphragmatic hernia</description>

    <intervention_name>pulmonary artery resistance index</intervention_name>
    <description>Women placed in semirecumbent position and an axial plane through the fetal thorax to achieve 4 chamber view of the heart. The main pulmonary artery was followed to the point where it divides into right and left branches by rotating the transducer from the 4 chamber view to the short axis view of the heart. Pulsed and colour Doppler was used. The fetal pulmonary artery flow waveform measurements was taken within the proximal portion of the main pulmonary artery</description>

    <intervention_name>Fetal adrenal gland volume:</intervention_name>
    <description>the adrenal gland has a characteristic sonographic appearance; each limb is seen as a long anechoic structure with a thin, echogenic line within its center . Both limbs can sometimes be seen in the coronal plane, and if so there is a strong echogenic line between limbs (probably fat). On the basis of pathologic and histologic studies , we believe the anechoic bulk of the gland represents the fetal zone of the cortex, while the central echogenic core is the medulla.</description>
