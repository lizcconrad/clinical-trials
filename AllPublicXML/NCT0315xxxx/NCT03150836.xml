  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, randomized, prospective, open-label phase II study. Patients in this
      study will have localized (cT3-cT4), or metastatic bladder cancer with a symptomatic, intact
      primary bladder tumor. In this study, patients will undergo stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT) to the bladder tumor and will receive durvalumab with or without tremelimumab.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will commence with a safety lead-in phase at UCSF in which 6 patients are accrued
      to Regimen A1 (RT + durvalumab). If this is not tolerated then an alternative Regimen A2,
      containing a lower total radiation dose will accrue 6 patients. If either A1 or A2 is
      tolerated then patients will be accrued to Regimen B1 (durvalumab, tremelimumab x 2 doses,
      and RT dose determined from Regimen A) following a 3+3 design for safety. If Regimen B1 is
      not tolerated an alternative Regimen B2 (durvalumab, tremelimumab x 1 dose, and RT dose
      determined from regimen A) will accrue following a 3+3 design for safety.

      After the safety lead-in for each group is completed, an expansion cohort will accrue
      patients. In this expansion cohort, patients will be randomized 1:1 to be treated with either
      regimen A or regimen B dose selected from the safety lead-in stratified by patient population
      (localized patients and metastatic patients).

             performing any protocol-related procedures, including screening evaluations

          2. Locally advanced (cT3 or cT4) or metastatic (N+ or M+) urothelial bladder cancer.
             Mixed histologies with predominant urothelial pattern are allowed

          3. If metastatic disease present patients must have an intact, symptomatic bladder tumor,
             appropriate for palliative RT to the bladder.

             metastatic disease must have at least 1 lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be
             accurately measured at baseline as at least 10 mm in the longest diameter (except
             lymph nodes which must have a short axis greater than or equal to 15 mm) with computed
             tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and that is suitable for accurate
             repeated measurement as per RECIST v1.1 guidelines.

          5. Age greater than or equal to 18 years at time of study entry

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.

             opinion of the treating investigator.

          9. Patients must be ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The reason for cisplatin
             ineligibility must be documented. Cisplatin ineligibility is defined as meeting 1 of
             the following criteria:

               -  Creatinine clearance (calculated or measured) less than 60 mL/min

                  the absence of hemolysis or hepatic pathology), who will be allowed only in
                  consultation with their physician].

                  normal unless liver metastases are present, in which case it must be less than or
                  equal to 5x ULN.

               -  Serum creatinine CL greater than 30 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula
                  (Cockcroft and Gault 1976) or by 24-hour urine collection for determination of
                  creatinine clearance. Serum creatine measurement is the preferred measurement for

             tremelimumab, other anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 antibodies, and
             therapeutic anticancer vaccines. Prior BCG or intravestical immune therapy (ie
             interferon) is not an exclusion to study participation.

         13. Prior radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis.

         14. Any concurrent systemic chemotherapy, biologic, or hormonal therapy for cancer
             treatment. Concurrent use of hormonal therapy for non-cancer related conditions (i.e.
             hormonal replacement therapy) is acceptable.

         15. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the
             first dose of IP. Note biopsy and TURBT of the primary tumor is acceptable.

         16. History of another primary malignancy except for:

               -  Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease for at
                  least 5 years before the first dose of study drug and of low potential risk for
                  recurrence

               -  Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence
                  of disease

               -  Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease eg, cervical
                  cancer in situ. (Optional criteria that are dependent on the patient population
                  under investigation.)

               -  Patients with incidental finding of early stage prostate cancer will not be
                  eligible.

         17. QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) greater than or
             equal to 470 ms calculated. Any clinically significant abnormalities detected require
             triplicate ECG results and a mean QT interval corrected for heart rate using
             Fridericia's formula (QTcF) greater than or equal to 470 ms calculated from 3 ECGs).

         18. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first
             dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab, with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled
             corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses, which are not to
             exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid

         19. History of primary immunodeficiency

         20. History of allogeneic organ transplant

         21. History of hypersensitivity to durvalumab, tremelimumab, or any excipient

         22. History of hypersensitivity to the combination

         23. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, active
             bleeding diatheses including any subject known to have evidence of acute or chronic
             hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or
             compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent

         24. Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical
             history, physical examination, and radiographic findings, and TB testing in line with
             local practice).

         25. History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis

         26. Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 30 days prior to study entry or within
             30 days of receiving durvalumab or tremelimumab

         27. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
             evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study results

         28. Brain metastases or spinal cord compression unless the patient's condition is stable
             (asymptomatic, no evidence of new or emerging brain metastases) and off steroids for
             at least 14 days prior to the start of study treatment. Following radiotherapy and/or
             surgery, patients with suspected brain metastases at screening should have an MRI
             (preferred)/CT, preferably with IV contrast.

         29. Subjects with uncontrolled seizures.

         30. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of
             reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from
             screening to 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination
             therapy or 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy, whichever is the
             longer time period
