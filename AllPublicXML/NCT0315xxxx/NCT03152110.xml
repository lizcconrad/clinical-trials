    <textblock>
      Objectives: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is debilitating to an individual's health and functional
      capacity and can significantly reduce quality of life. Specifically, SCI contributes to a
      sedentary lifestyle and a subsequent elevated risk for preventable cardiometabolic and
      hypokinetic diseases. While physical activity is strongly promoted in persons with SCI as a
      means to reduce the incidence and development of secondary disabling conditions, a majority
      of individuals with SCI are inactive and have low levels of fitness. High intensity interval
      training (HIIT) is a form of exercise that is characterized by brief, intermittent bouts of
      intense exercise, separated by periods of lower intensity exercise for recovery. The
      magnitude of improvements in aerobic exercise capacity and other key cardiometabolic risk
      factors following HIIT are similar to moderate-intensity continuous training, but only
      require a fraction of the total energy expenditure and a vastly reduced time commitment.
      Little research has been conducted on HIIT in persons with SCI, who are unique from other
      special population groups due to their inability to carry out conventional lower limb HIIT
      exercises. An upper extremity form of HIIT that is effective, safe, quick and has acceptable
      positive affect could be an attractive option for persons with SCI who are not presently
      exercising and have low fitness levels. The study will look at feasibility and acceptability
      of a 6-week HIIT program for persons with a spinal cord injury who are untrained.

      Methods: Investigators aim to test 10 individuals with spinal cord injury/dysfunction who are
      untrained and use a manual wheelchair full time for mobility. Prior to starting any testing
      or exercising, participants will be screened and will need to obtain a signed medical release
      form from their physician. The screening procedure will include asking the participant the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and administering two short questionnaires related to physical
      activity that will determine eligibility for the study. After obtaining the release form,
      participants will be scheduled for their first visit. During Visit 1, participants will
      complete baseline exercise testing and questionnaires. The study questionnaires will include
      questionnaires related to sociodemographics, pain and health measures, general health and
      function, and physical activity. Exercise testing includes an aerobic exercise stress test
      (conducted following American College of Sports Medicine guidelines using an electronic
      ergometer) and an anaerobic (maximum power output) test. After Visit 1, participants will
      exercise three times per week for six weeks, following a standard HIIT protocol. Two of those
      sessions will be supervised by a trainer, and one session will be completed on their own.
      After the six week time period, participants will be scheduled for Visit 2 and will complete
      the same evaluations as Visit 1. Additionally, participants will complete evaluations
      measuring the level of satisfaction of the training program and their likelihood of
      continuing the program.

      If the participant is eligible and would like to participate, the study team will send a
      physician release form to be signed. After the study team receives the signed release form,
      the participant will be scheduled for their Visit 1, Baseline Visit. Participants will be
      given the following instructions prior to their first lab visit:

        1. Do not participate in any strenuous physical activity 24 hours prior to testing.

        2. Do not eat a large meal 4 hours prior to testing, however a light snack is okay.

        3. Do not drink alcohol or caffeine 4 hours prior to testing.

        4. No smoking 1 hour prior to testing.

        5. Wear comfortable, loose clothing that is easy to exercise in.

      Visit 1: Baseline Visit

      Eligible participants will be directed to come to the lab to obtain written informed consent,
      complete study questionnaires, and perform baseline exercise tests. Participants will be
      considered enrolled in the study after they have signed the informed consent document.
      Participants will complete the following questionnaires regarding demographics, pain and
      health measures, general health and function, and physical activity:

        1. Demographics questionnaire: May include information such as disability type, level of
           SCI, years with disability, age, gender, and information about their wheelchair (e.g.
           make, model, cushion, etc.).

        2. Numerical Rating Scale (NRS): Participants will complete this scale once for each upper
           limb joint (wrist, elbow and shoulder). Participants will be asked to rate their
           average, most severe, and least severe wrist, elbow and shoulder pain during the last 24
           hours using an 11 point scale (i.e. 0-10) anchored at the ends by &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst
           pain ever experienced.&quot; An 11 point NRS measure of intensity allows for comparison
           across clinical trials of pain treatment and is recommended as a core outcome measure
           for chronic pain clinical trials. NRS pain measures are widely used and have been shown
           to be valid and reliable assessments of pain.

        3. Wheelchair Users Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI): The WUSPI is a 15 item, self-report
           instrument that measures shoulder pain intensity, within the last week, in wheelchair
           users during various functional activities of daily living such as transfers, leading a
           wheelchair into a car, wheelchair mobility, dressing, bathing, overhead lifting,
           driving, performing household chores and sleeping. The WUSPI is a valid and reliable
           measure of shoulder pain. Test-retest reliability of the total index score was 0.99 and
           Cronbach's alpha (internal consistency) was 0.98.

        4. Short Form Health Survey Walk Wheel (SF-36 WW): A 36-item general health and function
           questionnaire that has been validated for persons with SCI. The SF-36 is a brief,
           multi-dimensional, self-report health questionnaire that measures eight concepts:
           physical functioning, role limitation due to physical problems, bodily pain, general
           perception of health, vitality, social function, role limitation due to emotional
           problems and mental health.

        5. Physical Activity Scale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities (PASIPD): The PASIPD
           is a 13-item self-report instrument covering (1) leisure activities, (2) household
           activities, (3) occupational activities and (4) light, moderate, and strenuous sport and
           recreational activities. The scale asks individuals to report how many days and hours
           per week that they spend participating in these various physical activities and a total
           score is calculated that is expressed in a metabolic equivalent (MET). The maximum
           possible score on the PASIPD total score is 199.5 MET.

      Lastly, height and weight will be taken. Subjects will transfer to a mat table where they
      will lay on their backs. Once in this position we will measure their height with a measuring
      tape. Weight will be measured using a wheelchair scale. Participants will be weighed with
      their wheelchair and the wheelchair will be weighed without the subjects in them. The weight
      will be the difference between the two measurements.

      Following completion of all study questionnaires, participants will begin exercise testing.
      Both exercise tests will be administered by an exercise physiologist and directly supervised
      by a physician. Both tests have been widely used in previous research studies. The tests are
      outlined in further detail below:

        1. Maximal aerobic exercise test: the purpose of this test is to evaluate cardiac function
           and fitness. Additionally, this test will determine peak power output (PPO) that will
           later be used to set an individualized goal for the participant during the HIIT
           protocol. Prior to starting the maximal exercise testing participants will be fitted
           with a mask that analyzes the air that is being inhaled and exhaled (also known as &quot;open
           circuit spirometry&quot;). Cardiorespiratory measures (i.e., heart rate, blood pressure,
           oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange ratio, pulmonary ventilation, carbon dioxide
           expiration, etc.) will be recorded throughout this test. Heart rate will be collected
           using the same heart rate monitor that will be worn during the in home exercise portion
           of the study. The heart rate monitors will be worn around the chest in area under the
           heart. Participants will be able to use a private space to put the heart rate monitor on
           prior to staring the study. A member of the study team will verify the heart rate
           monitor is placed properly. Prior to beginning the maximal exercise test, the Borg and
           Wheel Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scales will be presented to participants. RPE
           scales rate how hard a person feels their body is working and is an accepted
           supplementary tool for prescribing exercise programs in both healthy and special
           populations. Throughout the test, the participant will be asked to report their RPE by
           pointing to the corresponding number on the scales. The exercise test will be
           administered using an incremental modified Bruce protocol on an electronically-braked
           cycle ergometer. The Bruce protocol outlines speeds and inclines to test cardiopulmonary
           function and health. The protocol outlines specific time increments and the settings for
           the treadmill to ensure a maximal aerobic capacity is achieved. This protocol will be
           modified for an arm ergometer, where the resistance on the ergometer and the revolutions
           per minute (RPMs) will be modified instead of incline and speed. The settings on the
           ergometer will attempt to match the incremental changes outlined in the Bruce protocol.
           Initially, resistance will be set at 25W, and then increased by 25W every 2 minutes
           until the subject can no longer continue or until their respiratory exchange ratio
           exceeds 1.15.

        2. Maximum power output test: the primary purpose of this test is to evaluate the highest
           amount of power that the participant can produce in a short period of time. Other
           measures include heart rate, blood pressure, relative peak power, anaerobic capacity and
           anaerobic fatigue. The same ergometer will be used for this study that was used for the
           maximal aerobic exercise test. Initially, the resistance will be set at zero and will
           then be increased over the duration of the test. The participant will initially crank on
           the cycle with minimal resistance for about thirty seconds, then the resistance will be
           increased to a maximal level. Participants will crank for as long and as hard as they
           are able to for another thirty seconds. The participant will be asked to complete this
           process up to three separate times, with a minimum of 30 seconds of rest in between.
           After the test is completed, the resistance will return to zero and the participants
           will cycle at a comfortable pace to cool down.

      Following completion of the exercise tests, the study team will introduce the participant to
      the type of exercises that will be performed for the study. They will be able to use the
      ergometer in the lab to try out a brief HIIT protocol.

      6-Week HIIT Protocol: If participants already own a handcycle, investigators will make every
      attempt to fit their handcycle to the roller system that will be used for the study. If
      investigators are not able to retrofit their handcycle or if they do not own a handcycle, the
      study team will provide a handcycle for the duration of the program. If a participant is
      uncomfortable using a handcycle, or is unable to transfer into the handcycle, then the study
      team will provide a tabletop ergometer to use for the duration of the study. At the end of
      the study the handcycle or tabletop ergometer and the roller system will be returned to the
      study team. Participants will be given a heart rate monitor, which they will be asked to wear
      and use for every exercise session for the duration of the study. They do not have to return
      the heart rate monitor at the end of the study. Participants will be provided with a bike
      computer that will be fit to the handcycle/ergometer and will be used solely for the purpose
      of recording power output and heart rate during the exercise sessions. Participants must
      return the bike computer at the end of the study.

      The first exercise visit will be tentatively scheduled within one week of the first study
      visit. Exercise sessions will be scheduled, ideally, 3 times per week (every other weekday),
      with the total training protocol lasting 6 weeks. Two of the sessions will be supervised by a
      trainer and one session will be completed on their own. During the last week (week 6),
      subjects can opt to have their supervised sessions via FaceTime or Skype (if they have a
      smartphone or computer). The exercise goal for all participants is to achieve 10 sets of 60
      second bouts of arm cycling at 90% of their PPO (as determined in baseline testing),
      separated by 60 seconds of active recovery.

      Further details regarding the supervised and unsupervised workouts are explained below.

      (A) Supervised exercise sessions: the trainer will meet the participant at their home for
      each supervised exercise session. Prior to exercise, the trainer will measure/record the
      participant's heart rate and blood pressure. In addition, the trainer will make sure that
      there haven't been any recent changes in health or medical status.

      The trainer will guide the participant through a warm-up and stretching routine prior to
      exercising (approximately 10 minutes). The participant will be familiarized with the same
      Borg and Wheel RPE scales used during Visit 1, and the Feeling Scale. The Feeling Scale (-5
      very bad to +5 very good) is commonly used to measure affective response during exercise.

      The trainer will prescribe individualized work and rest phases based on their PPO from their
      maximal aerobic test. In order to reach the HIIT goal mentioned above, the trainer will hold
      participants at 90% PPO as a constant target intensity to start, shortening the work phase
      (e.g. 10-15 seconds), and if necessary, lengthening the recovery phase (e.g. 75-90 seconds).
      These ramping parameters will be progressed and documented by the trainer for each session.
      The trainer will determine when to change their work and rest parameters based off of heart
      rate and self-reported RPE.

      At the end of each session, the trainer will measure/record the participant's heart rate and
      blood pressure again. Power output and heart rate data is automatically stored in the bike
      computer during each exercise session. These measures are collected to evaluate adherence to
      the prescribed HIIT intensities.

      (B) Unsupervised exercise sessions: participants will be asked to repeat the same HIIT
      protocol they performed during the previous supervised session. The trainer will provide
      written directions for their convenience. Participants will be instructed to wear the heart
      rate monitor so that during the next supervised exercise session, the trainer will be able to
      retrieve/collect the data to store on one of our study devices for future analysis. The heart
      rate data as well as power output data will automatically be stored on the device in the same
      manner as during the supervised sessions. At the next supervised session the trainer will
      retrieve the data from the device.

      Visit 2:

      After completing the 6-week HIIT program, participants will be scheduled for a second/final
      lab visit. Visit 2 will be ideally scheduled within one week of finishing the 6-week HIIT
      program, but to provide scheduling flexibility, participants have up to two weeks to complete
      their second visit. Investigators will try to schedule the follow-up exercise testing around
      the same time of day as Visit 1. Participants will complete the same exercise testing
      protocol that was completed in Visit 1. Participants will also complete the NRS, WUSPI, and
      SF-36 WW questionnaires from Visit 1. Participants will be asked to complete a survey
      regarding their satisfaction of the HIIT program using the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale
      (PACES). Finally, participants will be provided with an open-ended questionnaire to discuss
      their feelings about HIIT, likelihood to continue, and what would be needed in terms of
      support to help them (or others like them) to keep doing HIIT.

    <description>A handcycle or tabletop ergometer will be used for HIIT. Exercise sessions will be scheduled 3x/week for 6 weeks (2 sessions supervised, 1 session unsupervised). The HIIT goal is to achieve 10 sets of 60 second bouts of arm cycling at 90% of their PPO with 60 seconds of active recovery.
Supervised exercise sessions: Measures include HR, BP, RPEs, Feeling Scale, and PPO. After warming up, individualized work/rest phases will be prescribed based on their PPO from their maximal aerobic test. Participants will be held at 90% PPO as a constant target intensity to start, shortening the work phase, and if necessary, lengthening the recovery phase. These parameters will be progressed each session. The trainer will determine when to change their work/rest parameters based off of HR and RPEs.
Unsupervised exercise sessions: Participants will repeat the same HIIT protocol they performed during the previous supervised session. The bike computer automatically stores HR and PPO.</description>
