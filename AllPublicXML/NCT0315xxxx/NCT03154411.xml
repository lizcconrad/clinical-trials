  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary study objective is to determine if microdoses of ABY-029 (up to 6X) lead to
      detectable signals (defined as signal-to-noise ratio, SNR ≥10, with the Odyssey NIR scanner
      in sampled tissues with an EGFR pathology score ≥ 1 based on histological staining and
      compare SNR to tissues with an EGFR pathology score &lt; 1).

      The secondary study objective is to assess if the spatial patterns of EGFR expression
      correlate with the tumor targeting of ABY-029 detection by NIR scanner relative to
      histopathology diagnosis, and other indicators (e.g. proliferation, infiltration, etc.) as
      the gold standard, and to measure the molecular uptake and concentration of ABY-029 in
      resected specimens.

      The investigators plan to enroll a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 18 adult patients with a
      diagnosis of primary soft-tissue sarcoma in this open label, single center, clinical trial of
      ABY-029. Two cohorts will be enrolled with a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 12 subjects in
      Cohort 1 and 6 patients in Cohort 2. Cohort 1 will include patients with an EGFR pathology
      score ≥ 1; Cohort 2 will include patients with an EGFR pathology score of &lt; 1 (control).

      Initial diagnostic biopsy specimens will be analyzed for EGFR positivity by
      immunohistochemistry following routine diagnostic processing by Pathologist. Patients will be
      administered a single intravenous dose of ABY-029 1-3 hours before surgery. Following tumor
      excision, the tumor will be transported to the Pathologist and will be inked and sectioned.
      Following sectioning the tumor will be imaged using a near-infrared scanner and fiber-probe
      based system. Quantitative measurements of fluorophore concentration will be measured for
      tumors with EGFR pathology score ≥ 1 and compared to those with EGFR pathology score &lt; 1.
      Quantitative mapping of fluorophore concentration will be correlated with local EGFR
      concentration and blood vessel density. Upon specimen analysis, fluorophore measurements will
      be taken from normal, marginal tissues (e.g. skeletal muscle, adipose) in addition to the
      tumor. Average EGFR concentration and blood vessel density will be determined for each tumor
      through histological analysis of sections by routine sarcoma protocol and analysis guided by
      regional variations in ABY-029 concentration based upon near-infrared scan results.

      The protocol is not a safety study since no physiological effects are expected at microdose
      levels of ABY-029. No diagnostic or therapeutic intent is proposed, and administration of the
      study drug is not intended to alter the extent of planned tumor resection during the surgical
      procedure.
