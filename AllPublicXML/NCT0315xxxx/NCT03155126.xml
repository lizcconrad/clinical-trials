    <textblock>
      Fluid resuscitation is important to shock patients. Saline is the classical fluids for
      resuscitation. However, studies showed that resuscitation with saline could increase the
      incidence of hyperchloremia and acute kidney injury. Thus, the goal is to observe that the
      incidence of acute kidney injury in patients who need fluid resuscitation when resuscitated
      with saline or acetated Ringer's sodium.
