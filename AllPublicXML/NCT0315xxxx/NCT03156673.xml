  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchial basal cells are proved to be able to regenerate lung structures to repair the
      injured lung. In COPD patients, bronchus structures are injured and cannot be repaired, which
      may result in the failure of pulmonary function rescue clinically.In our research, autologous
      bronchial basal cells will be transplanted into lung of patients suffered with COPD to treat
      the disease. Specifically, autologous bronchial basal cells will be dissected from
      brushed-off samples by bronchofiberscope. Then, they will be expanded in vitro and
      transplanted into lung to regenerate new alveoli and bronchus structures and re-establish
      pulmonary system.
