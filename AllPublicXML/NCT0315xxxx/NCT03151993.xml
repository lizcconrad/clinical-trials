      The aim of the study is to determine if single-bolus recombinant nonimmunogenic
      staphylokinase is effective and save thrombolytic agent in with ischemic stroke in comparison
      to alteplase.

      Experimental Drug Profile. The active substance of Fortelyzin is Forteplase. It`s recombinant
      protein which contains aminoacid sequence of staphylokinase. It is single chain molecula,
      consists of 138 aminoacids, weight 15.5 kDa. When staphylokinase is added to human plasma
      containing a fibrin clot, it preferentially reacts with plasmin at the clot surface, forming
      a plasmin-staphylokinase complex. This complex activates plasminogen trapped in the thrombus.
      The plasmin-staphylokinase complex and plasmin bound to fibrin are protected from inhibition
      by alpha2-antiplasmin. Once liberated from the clot (or generated in plasma), however, they
      are rapidly inhibited by alpha2-antiplasmin. This selectivity of action confines the process
      of plasminogen activation to the thrombus, preventing excessive plasmin generation,
      alpha2-antiplasmin depletion, and fibrinogen degradation in plasma. In rabbits anti
      forteplase antibodies are not produced. It was achieved by replacement of amino acids in
      immunogenic epitop of molecule staphylokinase. Blood fibrinogen decrease after i.v. injection
      of Fortelyzin less 10% within first 24 hours. Angiographic data suggests that restoration of
      coronary blood flow appears in up to 80% of patients with STEMI after i.v. injection of
      Fortelyzin.

      Main goals of the study to prove an efficacy of the single-bolus intravenous injection of
      recombinant nonimmunogenic staphylokinase (Fortelyzin) in comparison with bolus infusion
      alteplase(Actilise) in patients with ischemic stroke.

      Main goals of the study to prove an efficacy of the single-bolus intravenous injection of
      recombinant nonimmunogenic staphylokinase (Fortelyzin) in comparison with bolus infusion
      alteplase (Actilise) in patients with ischemic stroke.

      to prove a safety and to assess possible adverse events in the single-bolus intravenous
      injection of recombinant nonimmunogenic staphylokinase (Fortelyzin) in comparison with bolus
      infusion alteplase (Actilise) in patients with ischemic stroke.

      Study Design. All eligible patients will be randomized in two equal groups for administration
      recombinant nonimmunogenic staphylokinase (Fortelyzin) or alteplase (Actilise) by using
      &quot;envelope method&quot; of randomization. It is an open-lable study. Each of agents will be
      administered no longer then 4,5 hours from symptoms onset. Experimental and comparative agent
      will be administered as prescribed in its instructions.

      Worsening of pre-existing conditions Expected fluctuations or expected deterioration of the
      underlying disease will not be recorded as an AE. Worsening of the disease under study will
      be recorded as an AE if one of the following criteria is met.

      Worsening of disease meets the criteria for an SAE. Action is taken with investigational
      drug, i.e. dose is reduced or treatment discontinued or increased.

      Treatment is required (concomitant medication is added or changed). The investigator believes
      a patient has shown a clear, unexpected deterioration from baseline symptoms.

      The same criteria as above apply to recording of AEs resulting from worsening of other
      pre-existing conditions. Pre-existing conditions are not recorded as AEs if they do not meet
      the criteria above. Specifically, the following will not be recorded as an AE:

      Pre-existing conditions present at baseline, which remain unchanged during the trial.

      Vital Signs, ECG and Laboratory test results qualifying as AE Changes in safety tests
      including blood pressure, pulse rate, ECG and laboratory tests will be recorded as AEs, if:

      they are not associated with an already reported AE, symptom or diagnosis and action is taken
      with the investigational drug, i.e. dose is reduced or treatment discontinued or treatment is
      required (concomitant medication is added or changed) An AE is defined as any untoward
      medical occurrence, including an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition, in a patient in a
      clinical investigation who received a pharmaceutical product. The event does not necessarily
      have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. All adverse events occurring during
      the course of the clinical trial (i.e., from signing the informed consent onwards through the
      observational phase) will be collected, documented and reported to the sponsor by the
      investigator. A SAE is defined as any AE which results in death, is immediately
      life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, requires or
      prolongs patient hospitalisation, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect, or is to be deemed
      serious for any other reason representing a significant hazard, which is comparable to the
      aforementioned criteria. All serious adverse events and non-serious bleeds will be fully
      documented in the appropriate CRFs. For each adverse event, the investigator will provide the
      onset, end, intensity, treatment required, outcome, seriousness and action taken with the
      investigational drug. The investigator will determine the relationship of the investigational
      drug to all AE as defined in the 'Adverse Event Reporting' section of the Investigator Site
      File. The basis for judging the intensity of the AE as well as the causal relationship
      between the investigational product and the AE is described below. Intensity of event Mild:
      Awareness of sign(s) or symptom(s) which is/are easily tolerated Moderate: Enough discomfort
      to cause interference with usual activity Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work
      or to perform usual activities
