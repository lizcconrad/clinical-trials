  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that increase level of BAFF could promote the settlement of
      long-lived plasma cells in the spleen of ITP patients treated with anti-CD20. This
      single-center prospective pilot study, currently in phase IIa, will evaluate the efficacy of
      a rituximab and belimumab sequential combination treatment. Investigators plan to include 15
      patients with persistent ITP over a 24-month inclusion period. Each patient will be followed
      for 1 year

      This single-center prospective pilot study, currently in phase IIa, evaluates the efficacy of
      a rituximab and belimumab sequential combination treatment. Based on the Fleming method, this
      study scheme includes a single step method.

      Eligible patients, having given consent and having been verified for inclusion criteria, will
      receive two intravenous perfusions of 1 g of Rituximab (Mabthera ®) at W0 and W2 coupled with
      100 mg intravenous methylprednisone to avoid potential allergic reactions.

      Five belimumab (Benlysta ®) injections will be administered (W0 + 2days, W2 + 2 days, W4, W8,
      W12) at 10mg/kg doses. The first two injections are administered 2 days after Rituximab
      perfusions. The adopted experimental scheme was once used to show use of belimumab in
      systemic lupus erythematosus in accordance with AMM regulation.

      This phase II prospective single-center open-trial will be conducted at the National Referral
      Center for Adult Immune Cytopenia located in the Henri Mondor University Hospital.
      Investigators plan to include 15 patients with persistent ITP over an 24-month inclusion
      period. Each patient will be followed for 1 year
