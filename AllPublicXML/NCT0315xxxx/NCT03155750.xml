      Objectives: To evaluate the clinical effects of Zero-Time Exercise (ZTEx) for treating
      insomnia disorder delivered by a training course.

      Hypothesis: Subjects in the ZTEx training group will have greater improvement in insomnia
      symptoms and daytime impairment than those in the sleep hygiene education (SHE) group at week
      8.

      Design and subjects: A randomized controlled trial. 32 inactive subjects with insomnia
      disorder recruited from the community will be randomized to ZTEx training or SHE groups in a
      1: 1 ratio.

      Study instrument: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) will be used to assess insomnia symptoms and
      daytime impairment.

      Interventions: Subjects in the ZTEx training group will attend two training lessons (2-hour
      each) to learn ZTEx and practice it every night for 8 weeks; subjects in the SHE group will
      receive sleep hygiene education with the schedule and duration that are same to the ZTEx
      training group.

      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is the ISI score. Other measures include
      sleep parameters by subjective sleep diary and objective actigraphy, Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 and Short Form-6 Dimension.
      Acceptability and compliance of ZTEx will be evaluated.

      Data Analysis: Differences in the questionnaire scores, subjective and objective sleep
      parameters will be examined using a mixed-effects model.
