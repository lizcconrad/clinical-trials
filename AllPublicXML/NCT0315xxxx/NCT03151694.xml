  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-national program applies a breakthrough approach to childhood obesity called,
      Brain-to-Society (BtS) Diagnostic Approach. In Montreal, Canada and Palwal, India, the
      investigators will recruit two cohorts of 612 children (6 to 12 years; 306 boy/306 girls)
      where Whole-of-Society (WoS) transformations are taking place (industrialized societal
      context with peaking childhood obesity and where a broad governmental plan to promote healthy
      lifestyle has been adopted -Canada; developing societal context with increasing childhood
      obesity if replication of past pathways that have lead to double burden; India) are taking
      place along with World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution A63-12 for marketing of food to
      children. Individual-level BtS Diagnostic will examine the degree to which individual
      differences in genetics and biology and differences in the environmental exposures modulate
      the behavioral, body weight/fatness and nutritional risk over time in the context of WoS
      transformations. Societal-level BtS Diagnostic shall examine the influence of decisions in
      policy, investment, business and innovation made by different stakeholders (government,
      private sector, civil society in health and non-health society systems including agriculture,
      business and media practices) on the community.
