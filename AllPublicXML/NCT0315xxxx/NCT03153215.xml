  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe fetal growth restriction (FGR) complicates approximately 0.4% of pregnancies and
      severely increases the risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality.Sildenafil citrate may offer
      a potential therapeutic strategy to improve uteroplacental blood flow in IUGR pregnancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of sildenafil citrate therapy on severe early
      and late onset intrauterine growth retardation.A total of 46 patients with severe early onset
      intrauterine growth retardation will be enrolled in a prospective case control study .

      Patients will randomly be allocated to two groups with 23 patients in each group.Sildenafil
      citrate therapy may increase the likelihood of increased growth velocity [measured by
      abdominal circumference (AC) (ultrasound)] for fetuses of pregnancies complicated by severe
      early-onset IUGR .Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP-specific
      phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP which results
      in increased levels of cGMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation. Placental disease,
      consequent on deficient uteroplacental blood flow, includes FGR, pre-eclampsia, and placental
      abruption and has been implicated in more than 50% of iatrogenic premature births .For this
      reason, the problem of severe FGR forms a substantial portion of the population that tertiary
      care centres care.
