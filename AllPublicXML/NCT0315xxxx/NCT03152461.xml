      This study will evaluate the performance of the Quantra System comprised of the Quantra
      Hemostasis Analyzer with the Quantra Surgical Cartridge in patients undergoing major surgical
      procedures specifically, major cardiac and vascular procedures and major orthopedic surgery
      (primarily complex spine surgeries).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Quantra System is a fully integrated and automated in vitro diagnostic device which uses
      SEER Sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology, to characterize the viscoelastic
      properties of a whole blood sample during coagulation. The Quantra Surgical Cartridge was
      developed to monitor hemostasis during major surgical procedures in adult patients. The
      cartridge consists of four independent channels each containing different sets of reagents,
      which provide four measurements performed in parallel yielding six parameters that depict the
      functional status of a patient's coagulation system.

      This multi-center, prospective, observational study will evaluate the performance of the
      Quantra System as compared to standard coagulation tests and comparable measures determined
      using the ROTEM Delta.

        The study population includes subjects 18 years or older undergoing a surgical procedure
        with high risk of intra- or post-operative bleeding. It is anticipated that approximately
        two-thirds of the enrolled subjects will be cardiac or vascular surgery patients and
        one-third will be orthopedic surgery patients.
