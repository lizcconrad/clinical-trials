      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the reduction of low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (LDL-C) with alirocumab subcutaneous (SC) every 2 weeks (Q2W) in comparison to
      placebo after 12 weeks of treatment.

        Note: The information listed below is not intended to contain all considerations relevant
        to a patient's potential participation in this clinical trial, therefore not all
        inclusion/exclusion criteria are listed.

        Key Inclusion Criteria

          1. Diagnosis of HoFH by at least 1 of the following genotype or clinical criteria (all
             patients on LDL apheresis must be diagnosed based on genotype):

               1. Documented homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in both low-density
                  lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) alleles

               2. Presence of homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in Apo B or PCSK9

               3. Presence of double heterozygous mutations, i.e, mutations on different genes in
                  the LDLR, Apo B or PCSK9 alleles

               4. Untreated TC &gt;500 mg/dL (12.93 mmol/L) and TG &lt;300 mg/dL (3.39 mmol/L) AND Both
                  parents with history of TC &gt;250 mg/dL (6.46 mmol/L) OR cutaneous or tendinous
                  xanthoma before age 10

          2. Receiving a stable dose of a statin at the screening visit (documentation if statin
             ineffective or patient unable to tolerate statin)

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Documented evidence of a null mutation in both LDLR alleles

          2. Use of a PCSK9 inhibitor within 10 weeks from screening visit

          3. Background medical lipid modifying therapy (LMT) that has not been stable for at least
             4 weeks (6 weeks for fibrates, 24 weeks for mipomersen, 12 weeks for maximum tolerated
             dose of lomitapide) before the screening visit.

          4. LDL apheresis schedule/apheresis settings that have not been stable for at least 8
             weeks before the screening visit or an apheresis schedule/settings that is not
             anticipated to be stable over the next 24 weeks.

          5. Use of nutraceuticals or over-the-counter (OTC) therapies known to affect lipids, at a
             dose/amount that has not been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit
             or between the screening and randomization visits.

          6. Chronic use of systemic corticosteroids, unless on a stable regimen of 10 mg daily
             prednisone equivalent or less for at least 6 weeks prior to randomization. Note:
             topical, intra-articular, nasal, inhaled and ophthalmic steroid therapies are not
             considered as 'systemic' and are allowed

          7. Systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg at the
             screening visit (1 repeat measurement is allowed).

          8. History of a myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina leading to hospitalization,
             coronary artery bypass graft surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention ,
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, carotid surgery or stenting, stroke, transient
             ischemic attack, valve replacement surgery, carotid revascularization, endovascular
             procedure or surgical intervention for peripheral vascular disease within 3 months
             prior to the screening visit.
