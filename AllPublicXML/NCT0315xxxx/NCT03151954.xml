  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hippo-YAP pathway is a newly discovered pathway controlling the growth, and plays important
      roles in the regulation of stem cell function and tissue regeneration. Previously we found
      that a higher expression of YAP in NP, and LPS was able to activate the hippo-YAP pathway in
      NESCs. Thus, we hypothesize that the aberrant proliferation and differentiation of NESCs
      could be regulated via the hippo-YAP pathway.

      Studies have shown that the development of nasal polyps (NP) are closely related to the
      epithelial remodeling.The investigators have shown that nasal epithelial stem cells(NESCs)
      derived from NP had reduced growth and proliferation dynamics in vitro culture,and
      differentiated into ciliated cells with impaired cilia architecture and ciliogenesis.Further
      studies demonstrated that NESCs were involved in the aberrant damage repair process of the
      epithelial remodeling in NP.Hippo-YAP pathway is a newly discovered pathway controlling the
      growth,and plays important roles in the regulation of stem cell function and tissue
      regeneration.Previously the investigators found that a higher expression of YAP in NP,and LPS
      was able to activate the hippo-YAP pathway in NESCs.Thus,the investigators hypothesize that
      the aberrant proliferation and differentiation of NESCs could be regulated via the hippo-YAP
      pathway,which may result in the epithelial remodeling.In this study,the investigators intend
      to investigate the mechanism of the hippo-YAP pathway in regulating aberrant proliferation
      and differentiation of NESCs and explore its upstream signaling and downstream target
      genes,using the NESCs gas-liquid interface culture system,and a silencing and overexpression
      of the hippo-YAP pathway component strategy.The investigators aim to unravel the effect and
      mechanism of the hippo-YAP pathway in the epithelial remodeling of NP,providing new targets
      and strategy for the improvement or reversal of NP epithelial remodeling.
