  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Salford Lung Study (SLS) subjects represent a group of COPD and asthma patients whose
      disease is extremely well-characterised over a short time period. Subjects in the SLS
      originally consented for information relevant to the study to be shared with the sponsor
      (GSK). These data were limited to three years prior to randomisation and the twelve-month
      interventional treatment period. Broadened access to patients' data would allow SLS subjects'
      entire disease journey to be researched, presenting a rare opportunity to improve scientific
      and clinical understanding of COPD/asthma disease risk, treatment and progression. This
      proposal seeks to collect additional subject-level data from SLS patients via their
      electronic medical records (encompassing past and future data for up to 10 years from the
      date of consent) and via a one-off patient questionnaire administered at the time of consent.
