    <description>Patients and parents will use MigraineManager to complete assessment measures at baseline and post-treatment (i.e., 2 months after baseline). Answers to these measures will determine what interventions each participant will receive. Data obtained in this phase will be used to make final modifications to MigraineManager for large scale testing.</description>

    <description>Answers provided during the online assessment will result in certain intervention recommendations. Once assessments are completed, a treatment plan will be automatically generated for patient and parent guidance.</description>
