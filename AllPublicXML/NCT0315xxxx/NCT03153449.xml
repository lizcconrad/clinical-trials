      Five-year, Prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, non-controlled study of the ATTUNE®
      Revision total knee prostheses, utilizing the fixed bearing (FB) and rotating platform (RP)
      tibial component with the posterior stabilizing (PS) femoral component in complex primary
      total knee arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within primary TKA, there are factors that lead to more complex procedures that include
      patients with high BMIs, advanced preoperative deformities and ligamentous laxity. Such cases
      may require the surgeon to treat using ancillary components, such as stems and/or augments
      and/or additional constraint.

      This post-market study will evaluate the short/medium term clinical performance and medium
      term survivorship of the ATTUNE Revision system system, which includes instrumentation, in
      complex primary TKA. The study is designed as a worldwide non-comparative, multi-center study
      with each site initially having a cohort of approximately 20 Subjects to recruit. The study
      will enroll 200 fixed bearing and 200 rotating platform configurations.

      The 2-year KOOS-ADL (activities of daily living) was selected as the primary endpoint because
      it will evaluate the post-operative period during which outcomes typically plateau and will
      therefore provide a good indication of longer term outcomes

      Male and female Subjects, age 22-80 years, inclusive, who require a primary knee arthroplasty
      in a joint that, due to deformity, instability, bone loss etc., necessitates the use of
      implants found within the ATTUNE Revision knee system and are suitable candidates for TKA
      using the ATTUNE® Revision system are eligible for enrollment in this study.
