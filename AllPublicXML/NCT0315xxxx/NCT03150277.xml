      The main purpose of this study will be comparison of acute effects of plyometric and heavy
      resistance exercise on post-activation potentiation

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, crossover study. Collegiate soccer players will be
      enrolled in this study. The study will be performed in 3 separate sessions.In the first
      session, participants will be familiarized with the experimental conditions and 1RM will be
      calculated. Participants will then be randomized to receive either heavy resistance or
      plyometric exercise first in the second session and then will be crossed over to receive the
      opposite intervention in the third session. The objective of the study is to compare the
      acute effects of plyometric and heavy resistance exercise on post - activation potentiation
      by measuring physical performance and blood lactate level.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood lactate level</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured prior to and after the intervention period (at 1 minute and 10 minute)</time_frame>
    <description>Small pinprick blood samples will be taken from fingertip and blood lactate level will be measured by Blood lactate analyser (EKF Diagnostic Lactate Scout +, UK). The area will be cleaned first, using a dry tissue to remove sweat, then an alcohol swab. Once the area is dry, the lancet (often with a spring loaded apparatus) will be used to pierce the skin.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Countermovement jump height</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured prior to and after the intervention period (at 1 minute and 10 minute)</time_frame>
    <description>The countermovement jump height will be measured using an iPhone app 'My Jump'. Jump height will be determined using an acknowledged flight - time calculation. During the CMJ, the subject rest their hands on their hips while performing a downward movement, followed by a maximum effort vertical jump. The subjects have to land in an upright position and to bend knees on landing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>20 m single sprint time</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured prior to and after the intervention period (at 1 minute and 10 minute)</time_frame>
    <description>The 20m single sprint is a standard test for assessing soccer players' running speed. The test involves running a single maximum sprint over 20 meters, with the time recorded using a stopwatch.</description>
