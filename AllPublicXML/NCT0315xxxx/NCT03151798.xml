  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate whether the level of fat stored in the liver is related to the
      liver's ability to burn fat.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has two phases. In Phase I, liver samples from patients undergoing bariatric
      surgery or a diagnostic liver biopsy will be tested for the ability to burn fatty acids. In
      Phase II, patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease will participate in either a
      nine-month lifestyle treatment program or undergo standard care. The goal is to determine how
      weight loss and exercise improve liver health.

      Inpatient comprehensive metabolic tests are performed before and after the nine-months.

    <intervention_model_description>In Phase I, liver samples derived from patients undergoing either bariatric surgery or a liver biopsy to diagnose nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, are tested one time in vitro. There is no treatment in Phase I.
In Phase II, only patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (and not those who have had bariatric surgery) are eligible to go into a study in which they are randomly assigned to 1) a lifestyle treatment program or 2) a control group undergoing standard care. Allocation is 2:1 subjects in the treatment vs standard care groups.
Thus, the arms are:
Arm 1: Phase I studies with no treatment, only observational data generated in vitro from the liver samples Arm 2: Phase II lifestyle treatment Arm 3: Phase II control standard of care</intervention_model_description>
