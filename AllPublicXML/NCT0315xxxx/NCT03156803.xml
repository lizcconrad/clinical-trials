      on dietary behaviors of mothers

    <textblock>
      Mothers randomised to the experimental group were exposed to one weekly blog post for 6
      months. Blog posts focus on the improvement of dairy products as well as vegetables and
      fruits consumption targeting five food skills categories: (1) knowledge about food, nutrition
      and cooking; (2) planning of healthy meals, and for including children to develop their food
      skills; (3) conceptualizing outcomes; (4) mechanical techniques for food preparation; (5)
      perception of food characteristics. Each post included a step-by-step recipe developed by the
      research team and featuring dairy products, vegetables and fruits. Recipes were described
      textually and also using pictures. Twenty-six posts were created over the six-month
      intervention. Participants randomised to the control group were not exposed to the healthy
      eating blog. The primary outcome is the daily intakes of dairy products, vegetables and
      fruits. The secondary outcomes are mothers' food skills and body weight.
