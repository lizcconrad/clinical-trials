  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The supra ventricular tachycardia is the most common symptomatic arrhythmia in pediatrics.
      Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug used in this indication. Pharmacokinetic, efficacy and
      safety data are not known in the pediatric population due to the lack of a suitable specialty
      available on the market.

      The development of an amiodarone oral solution formulation adapted to this age group should
      provide a therapeutic alternative and collect data on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy,
      acceptability and tolerability of the drug.
