  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled study designed to evaluate safety and
      repeatable effectiveness. Subjects will be randomized 2:1:1 to transcutaneous afferent
      patterned stimulation (TAPS), sham, or 'no intervention', respectively. Subjects randomized
      to the TAPS and sham arms will be blinded to their randomization assignments for the first
      two weeks of participation (controlled phase). After the first two weeks, all subjects will
      be crossed over to TAPS (open-label phase) for 2 weeks. During study participation, all
      subjects are to remain on a stable dosage of medications prescribed for the treatment of
      essential tremor, if applicable.

    <masking>Double (Participant, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The first two weeks of the study are double-blinded for the treatment and sham arms. The subjects and rating movement disorder neurologists will be blinded to the therapy allocation for the treatment and sham arms. The subjects in the 'no intervention' arm and their rating neurologists will not be blinded to their therapy allocation.
The last two weeks are open-label, and all subjects will be given the option to use the Cala ONE device.</masking_description>
