      Ivory Dentin Graft is at least as good as the reference test device (OsteoBiol Gen Os) for
      alveolar ridge preservation following tooth extraction.

      The null hypothesis is that Ivory Dentin Graft and OsteoBiol Gen Os are not equivalent (Gen
      Os is better than Ivory Dentin Graft) and the alternative hypothesis is that the proportions
      in the two groups are equivalent, assuming that the expected difference in proportions is 0.0
      (Ivory Dentin Graft is as good as Gen Os Graft).

      Device Description - Investigational Medicinal Product Ivory Dentin Graft is a bone graft
      material for the repair or augmentation of bone defects in dental procedures. It consists of
      sterile 300 - 1200 μm porous particles of hydroxyapatite which retain the natural form of the
      source porcine dentin.

      Ivory Dentin Graft is intended to be used as a bone graft material for the repair or
      augmentation of bone defects in dental procedures.

      OsteoBiol Gen Os. - Comparator control device A natural replicate of autologous bone, Gen-Os®
      conserves the same intimate structures (matrix and porous form) and presents a highly
      osteoconductive properties. Gen-Os® is gradually resorbable and provides support in bone
      neoformation helping to preserve the original graft shape and volume.

      Study Design The Ivory Dentin Graft study is a prospective, randomized, semi double blinded
      with blinded assessments study comparing patients grafted with Ivory Dentin Graft (study arm)
      and patients grafted with OsteoBiol Gen Os (control arm) for alveolar ridge preservation
      following tooth extraction.

      Study Population and Justification A total of 44 adult patients in 2 study groups scheduled
      to undergo at least one dental implant placement of mandibular premolar or molar are planned
      to be enrolled. The patients will be randomized into two treatment groups: One group is to be
      grafted with Ivory Dentin Graft while the second group will be grafted with OsteoBiol Gen Os,
      randomization ratio of 1:1 between the experimental and control group.

      Sample size Justification and Statistical Analysis Plan The rationale for sample size
      calculation is based on demonstrating non-inferiority in the study primary endpoint between
      the tested and the reference treatment groups.

      The calculations assume a difference of up to 30% between the treatments, which will be
      considered equivalent (non-inferiority).

      In a sample of 15 patients, a difference of up to 0.30 (30%) in the proportion of responders
      between the treatment groups will be considered equivalent with 5% significance level and 80%
      statistical power. Assuming expected dropout rate of ~30%, 44 patients (22 per group) will be
      recruited in order to ensure final sample size of 30 study completers (15 per group).

      When the sample size in each group is 15 (total study population of 30 subjects), a two-group
      large-sample normal approximation test of proportions with a one-sided 0.05 significance
      level will have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the test and the standard are
      not equivalent (the difference in proportions, paiT - pai, is 0.30 or farther from zero in
      the same direction) in favour of the alternative hypothesis that the proportions in the two
      groups are equivalent, assuming that the expected difference in proportions is -0.15 and the
      proportion in the standard group is 0.50. The data will be analysed using the SAS ® (SAS
      Institute, Cary North Carolina).

      Handling of Participant Withdrawals A patient discontinuing the study before grafting of
      Ivory Dentin Graft (Visit 2) can be replaced, at the discretion of the investigator, by
      another consenting patient. The discontinuing patient will be followed for safety. Each case
      of premature withdrawal will be properly recorded in the Screening Failure Log as deemed
      necessary.

      Patient Screening Prior to any study-related screening procedure, delegated study team
      members will approach potentially eligible adult patients who are waiting to be scheduled for
      tooth extraction and grafting for necessary titanium implant placement. Those who may be
      eligible will be offered the choice of undergoing screening to potentially enroll in the
      study. Patients who do not meet inclusion criteria or who are for any other reason determined
      to be unsuitable for inclusion in the study, or who decline to participate in the study, will
      be considered and recorded as &quot;screening failure&quot; and receive standard and appropriate
      treatment.

      Informed Consent The informed consent document will be signed and dated for screening and
      enrollment and each patient consenting will be documented in the patient medical binder. The
      patient will be given a copy of the consent form together with the study doctor's letter at
      the time of enrollment. The clinician will ask the patient about his plans and his
      willingness to attend all scheduled follow-up visits.

      Randomization will be done by Castor EDC web-software. The patients will be randomized into
      two treatment groups: One group is to be grafted with Ivory Dentin Graft while the second
      group will be grafted with OsteoBiol Gen Os, randomization ratio of 1:1 between the
      experimental and control group.

      TRIAL PROCEDURES After informed consent is obtained, a case record form including all aspects
      listed below will be recorded. Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and be
      treated according to standard treatment protocols for tooth extraction, grafting, implant
      placement, dental biopsy and dental radiographic procedures and with the standard protocol
      for local anesthetic.

      Visit 1: Screening and Enrolment, as part of pre-operative visit (2-4 weeks before grafting
      procedure )

      The following assessments will be performed:

      Demographics, Medical history, Vital signs, Current medications, Physical examination.

      A CT scan will be performed prior to visit 2 in order to verify patient eligibility and graft
      procedure preparation Visit 2: Randomization and extraction socket graft filling by Ivory
      Dentin Graft or Gen Os after tooth extraction.

      The designated randomization groups (Ivory Dentin Group and Gen Os) will be:

        1. Recorded in the patient CRF

        2. Recorded (soft copy or hard copy) on the patient Dental CT- this will be used as source
           to verify correct grafting site.

      All patients will be operated by study delegated physicians using the same method).

      Socket debridement and cleaning: After exposure of the defect the sounding walls should be
      debrided by surgical curette and all granulation tissue removed.

      The extraction site will be graft filled either using Ivory Dentin Graft or OsteoBiol Gen-Os
      according to the respective Instructions for Use using either vial or syringe applicators
      with or without dental membrane. Only the graft performing sub-investigator and the study
      coordinator will be un-blinded to the patient allocation. All efforts and measures would be
      taken by the study team to keep the patient and blinded assessors blinded of allocation- semi
      double blinded study.

      Periapical x-ray imaging will be performed on each enrolled patient once completing the graft
      filling in order to validate the bone grafting procedure.

      The following assessments will be performed following the procedure:

        1. Extraction socket grafting Physician usability Form

        2. Study Patient Discharge form. Patients will be monitored for short-term follow-up (1 and
           4 months following their extraction socket grafting procedure) and for long-term
           follow-up and will be evaluated for their medical and dental conditions. Implantation of
           titanium implants will be conducted 4 months following the grafting procedure at grafted
           site of each enrolled patient.

      Short-term Visit 3: Follow up 1 month following grafting procedure The patient will be asked
      to report any dental complication- all will be investigated by the sub-investigator using
      Visit 3 safety Follow Up Form.

      Periapical x-ray imaging will be performed

      In addition, the following assessments will be conducted by study investigator:

        -  Physical examination

        -  Vital signs A Computerized Tomography (CT) will be performed prior to visit 4 Visit 4:
           Follow up 4 months following grafting procedure and dental Implant placement (Short-term
           Termination visit)

      Prior to the procedure, the patient will be asked to report any dental complication. The
      following assessments will be conducted prior to device removal/ replacement by balloon
      gastrostomy:

        1. Physical examination

        2. Vital Signs

      d) Implant placement Physician usability Form e) Study Patient Discharge form. f) Short-term
      termination visit The alveolar bone strength (torque measurement) will be measured by torque
      measurement.

      Adequacy of bone graft (need for additional grafting at implant placement) will be evaluated
      by the study investigator based on the clinical examination, torque measurement and CT scan,
      and will be specified and justified in the Case Report Form.

      Patients will be monitored also for long-term follow-up (6 and 10 months, 2.5 and 5 years
      following their extraction socket grafting procedure) and will be evaluated by the study
      nurse for their medical and dental conditions.

      Un-scheduled visit:

      The study investigator will instruct the patient to immediately contact the study team in
      case of: Implant failure, loose graft particles, loss of grafting material, graft site
      infection, insufficient healing of graft site, excessive bleeding and wound dehiscence. The
      patient must call the study nurse to schedule an un-scheduled visit which may only be
      performed by the principal Investigator.

      Data Monitoring and Quality Control The investigator, through an appointed Clinical Research
      Associate (CRA), will be responsible for implementing and maintaining quality assurance and
      quality control systems with written Standard Of Procedures to ensure that trials are
      conducted and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the
      protocol, GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirement(s), including ISO 14155:2011.

      The investigator will be responsible for ensuring direct access to all trial related sites,
      source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the
      hospital, and inspection by Israeli regulatory authorities.

      Quality control should be applied to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are
      reliable and have been processed correctly.

      The study CRA will verify that (a) The rights and well-being of human patients are protected,
      (b) The reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents and
      (c) The conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved
      protocol/amendment(s), with GCP, and with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) (including
      ISO 14155:2001). The full responsibilities of the trial monitor appear in full in the
      ICH-GCP.

      The monitor(s) should follow Ivory Graft (or their CRO representative) written for monitoring
      the specific trial.

      The monitor will submit a written report after each trial-site visit or trial-related
      communication. A report should include the date, site, name of the monitor, and name of the
      investigator or other individual(s) contacted. A report should include a summary of what the
      monitor reviewed and the monitor's statements concerning the significant findings/facts,
      deviations and deficiencies, conclusions, actions taken or to be taken and/or actions
      recommended to secure compliance.

      To ensure compliance of this investigator initiated trial with current national regulations
      and the ICH guidelines, data generated by this study will be available for inspection upon
      request by representatives of the local health authorities- IRB or the national authorities -
      MOH, or any entity providing support for this trial. Routine monitoring or audit activities
      for this study will be conducted by authorized representatives. The general scope of such
      visits would be to inspect study data (regulatory requirements), source documentation and CRF
      completion in accordance with current GCP, the ICH guidelines and the respective local and
      national government regulations and guidelines.
