  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare imaging software and 2 different
      radiation doses during a standard CT scan in order to &quot;see&quot; problems in the liver and still
      produce a good image quality.

      This is an investigational study. The CT scans in this study are performed using an
      FDA-approved and commercially available method. The comparison of software used in this study
      at 2 different radiation doses is considered research.

      Up to 104 participants will be enrolled in the study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have a CT scan that is done as part of your
      routine care. This CT scan will be done at the normal radiation dose.

      During this scan, you will also have a scan of the liver at a lower radiation dose, which is
      part of the research in this study. This will add about a minute to your normal scan time.

      Information will also be collected from your medical record.

      After your scan, your participation in this study will be over.

    <description>Primary endpoint is metastasis detection accuracy status of each patient, where the standard of care scan reviewed by ''truth readers'' (independent to the blinded radiologists) serve as the gold standard. If any lesion of a patient is diagnosed as metastasis by &quot;truth readers&quot; or blinded readers' consensus, that patient will be considered true positive and diagnosis positive, respectively. The expected accuracy of standard CT is 95%, and a low dose CT detection be considered non-inferior if its accuracy is 85% or higher.</description>
