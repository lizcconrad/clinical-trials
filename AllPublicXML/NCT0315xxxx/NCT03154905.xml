  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The digestive system may be involved in various pathologic conditions, with different
      inflammatory, metaplastic and neoplastic aspects. As the therapeutic tool-box for digestive
      diseases grows and becomes more focused, at times targeting specific molecules, decision
      making in managing patients becomes more and more important, and must be evidence based.

      Defining biomarkers with predictive value will theoretically allow physicians in making
      diagnosis, deciding on a suitable first line therapy (with specific endpoints suggesting
      response or indicating 2nd line therapy is indicated) and finally may suggest surgical
      intervention is warranted, thus forming an &quot;individually tailored treatment&quot; for each
      patient. These biomarkers may be located in the peripheral blood, in the gastrointestinal
      tract in general, or confined to specific intestinal lesions.

      Chitinase 3-like 1 protein (YKL-40) is produced by different tissues (e.g. - synovium, smooth
      muscle, intestinal epithelium). Its specific action is unknown, but several reports have
      described it in different inflammatory conditions including those involving the
      gastrointestinal system. Chitinase 3 like-1 protein (YKL-40) has also been studied for its
      possible role in angio and onco-genesis.

      This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of peripheral and tissue
      Chitinase 3-like-1 (YKL 40) levels in gastrointestinal and liver diseases.

      For periphery tests: 10 ml blood will be collected from all eligible subjects into SST tubes.
      Then serum will be separated and freeze at -80 degrees until analysis of Chitinase 3 like-1
      protein by ELISA.

      For tissue tests: biopsies will be taken from colons of eligible participants. One part of
      these biopsies will be freeze until analysis of Chitinase 3 like-1 protein by ELISA. The
      other part of the biopsies will be placed in dishes with appropriate media and will be
      incubated in 37 degrees in order to follow cytokine secretion for 24 h. Media will be
      collected after 24 h and then freeze until further analysis of Chitinase 3 like-1 protein by
      ELISA. The investigators will also measure mRNA levels of Chitinase 3 like-1 protein in
      collected biopsies.

      The investigators will try to correlate between the Chitinase 3 like-1 protein levels in the
      blood and in tissue among various groups of participants and will compare between healthy
      participants and IBD participants. The investigators will also follow mRNA expression in
      tissue biopsies taken from all the participants.

      The study allows the measurements of chitinase 3 like 1 proteins in blood and tissues. Upon
      consenting to participation in the study, each volunteer may consent to specimens' storage
      and additional testing. Even though the samples contain DNA, and participation may include
      analysis in the RNA level, direct DNA sequencing will not be performed and is not included in
      the additional testing permitted by the subject.
