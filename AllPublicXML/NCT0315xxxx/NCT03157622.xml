    <textblock>
      The present study intends to specifically investigate treatment elements during exposure and
      cognitive-behavioral therapy, which are especially powerful in electing time contingent
      therapeutic change. hereby, it is the goal to explore further change processes, which play an
      important role during psychological treatment of individuals with CLBP and high levels of
      fear-avoidance.

    <description>In the Exposure in vivo (EXP) condition, patients are given a careful explanation of the fear-avoidance model. Patients are encouraged to adopt the model to their individual situation. Factors for the maintenance of chronic pain (such as pain cognitions and pain-related fear) are discussed. Especially, negative consequences of avoidance behavior are highlighted. In preparation of the exposure sessions, patients develop an individual fear hierarchy using the Photo Series of Daily Actives. Subsequently, patients are encouraged to test their fear-avoidance beliefs during behavioral experiments and to reduce avoidance behaviors during individually tailored exposure exercises.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Cognitive Behavioral Psychotherapy</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>In the Cognitive Behavioral Psychotherapy (CBT) condition, patients are introduced to several strategies to improve their pain management. The principle of graded activity encourages patients to re-engage in former activities by dividing these activities into smaller steps. Predetermined resting periods are offered as a form to prevent patients from phases of excessive demands followed by long terms of recovery. Progressive muscle relaxation is introduced as a technique to improve the experience of pain. The strategy of attention shifting is presented to change their perception of pain. Maladaptive pain-related cognitions are identified and challenged by cognitive interventions.</description>
