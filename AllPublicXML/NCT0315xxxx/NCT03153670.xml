  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease,
      medically refractory tremor, dystonia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Several hypotheses
      driven DBS trials are underway to study modulation of circuit dysfunction in other
      neurological and psychiatric disorders like epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease and depression.
      Recent reports suggest profound effects of DBS on the anatomy and function of downstream
      areas in the brain. For example electrical stimulation of limbic circuits is associated with
      increase in hippocampal neurogenesis. Similarly, stimulation of subthalamic nucleus (STN) or
      globus pallidus (GPi) results in activation of cortical motor circuits. Non-invasive imaging
      modalities are increasingly being employed in these investigations to better understand the
      effects of DBS on the structure and function of the brain.

      There have been important advances in MRI and we now have MRI which provides higher
      resolution and higher quality brain images. More specifically, the investigators propose to
      use MRI to perform functional magnetic resonance imaging (i.e. fMRI) to assess the effects of
      deep brain stimulation on brain function.
