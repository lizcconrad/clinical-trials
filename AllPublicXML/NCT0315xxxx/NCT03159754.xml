  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When the appendix becomes infected and inflamed, it is called appendicitis. Sometimes, if the
      infection and inflammation get worse, the appendix can die or burst, leading to a larger
      infection or even pus pockets around the appendix. This is called complicated, or perforated,
      appendicitis. Three common treatments for complicated appendicitis are

        -  appendectomy (removal of the appendix) right away

        -  appendectomy several weeks after the diagnosis

        -  treating the appendicitis without performing an appendectomy

      This study seeks to determine which of these three approaches is most cost-effective in
      children with complicated appendicitis.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a single center, prospective study to compare early appendectomy vs. non-operative
      management of immunocompetent patients with complicated appendicitis, and then to compare
      interval appendectomy vs. no interval appendectomy in those managed with the initial
      non-operative approach. Patients who choose early appendectomy will have surgery within 24
      hours of diagnosis and be discharged once they are afebrile for 24 hours, have a normal WBC
      count, and can tolerate a diet. They will be discharged with 5 days of oral ciprofloxacin and
      metronidazole and follow-up in clinic 2-4 weeks later. Patients who choose non-operative
      management will receive piperacillin-tazobactam with or without abscess drainage until they
      are afebrile 24 hours with a normal WBC count and are tolerating a diet, followed by 5 days
      of oral ciprofloxacin and metronidazole upon discharge. These patients will then be seen in
      clinic in 2-4 weeks, at which time they will be given the choice of whether or not to undergo
      interval appendectomy at least 8 weeks from initial presentation. Those in the interval
      appendectomy group will follow-up one month post-operatively. Patients in both groups will be
      contacted 3 months and 2 years following initial presentation.
