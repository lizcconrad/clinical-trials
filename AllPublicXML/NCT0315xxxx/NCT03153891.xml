  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial examines the effect of nature exposure on pain intensity
      levels among older adults who experience chronic pain. Investigators examine the effects of
      nature on: the experience of chronic pain, on pain catastrophizing, and on attention
      restoration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nature has been used to reduce pain in the context of acute pain (e.g., during painful
      medical procedures) but nature has not been examined as an intervention strategy to address
      chronic pain. Second, the mechanism though which nature might reduce the experience of pain
      is not well understood. Participants are cognitively intact individuals aged 60-90 who
      experience chronic pain and who rate their health as fair, good or excellent. Participants
      are randomly assigned to one of three conditions: virtual reality (VR) nature; VR built
      environment; or control. Researchers examine effects of VR nature exposure on the experience
      of chronic pain, pain catastrophizing, and on attention restoration as well as the relations
      among these variables.
