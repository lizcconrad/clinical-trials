  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the relative bioavailability of BI
      409306 tablets with prior 7-day intake of rifampicin tablets (Test, T) compared to BI 409306
      tablets without prior administration of rifampicin (Reference, R) following oral
      administration in healthy male subjects.

      The secondary objective is the evaluation and comparison of several pharmacokinetic
      parameters between the treatments. The secondary objectives will be assessed by descriptive
      statistics.

        Inclusion criteria

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure
             (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 55 years (incl.)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including (Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate
             (PR) or Electrocardiogram (ECG)) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically
             relevant by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 45 to 90 beats per minute (bpm)

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy and/or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with
             the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy and simple hernia
             repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  Use of drugs within 30 days prior to administration of trial medication if that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial (incl. QT/QTc interval prolongation)

          -  Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered
             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication, or current
             participation in another trial involving administration of investigational drug

          -  Current smoker or ex-smoker who quit smoking less than 30 days prior to screening.

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on specified trial days

          -  Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than 30 g per day)

          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening

          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial
             medication or intended donation during the trial

          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to
             administration of trial medication or during the trial

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

        In addition, the following trial-specific exclusion criteria apply:

          -  History of relevant liver diseases such as disturbance of liver function, jaundice,
             drug induced liver injury, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor syndrome, or liver tumours

          -  Thrombocytes below lower limit of normal or liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT, AP) above
             upper limit of normal at the screening examination

          -  Subjects with CYP 2C19 PM status
