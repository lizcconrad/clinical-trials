  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perfusion index (PI) measured via a pulse oximeter has been shown to correlate with
      activation of the sympathetic nervous system, such as by pain stimulation, as a result of
      involuntary contraction of the arterioles. Thus PI holds potential for use as a tool for
      &quot;objective pain measurement&quot;, although its practical usefulness and dependability as such
      have not previously been investigated.

      The investigators aim to explore associations between changes in PI and onset of pain
      following cessation of regional anaesthesia in alert patients following ankle fracture
      surgery.

      Methods:

      The investigators report an exploratory, observational analysis of prospectively gathered PI
      data from patients undergoing regional anaesthesia with spinal or peripheral nerve block for
      ankle fracture surgery as participants of the randomised AnAnkle Trial (EudraCT:
      2015-001108-76). PI is measured on an unaffected extremity in approximately 20 consecutive
      patients already included in the AnAnkle Trial at Herlev University Hospital, evenly
      distributed between spinal anaesthesia (SA) and peripheral nerve block (PNB).

      Both anaesthesia forms and pain medication regimes are standardised as part of AnAnkle Trial
      and participants register pain scores on a 0-10 numeric rating scale every three hours and
      register the time of cessation of anaesthesia identified by return of sensation to the ankle.
      Morphine consumption is also registered.

      The investigators will explore correlations of changes in PI to increases in pain upon
      cessation of the regional anaesthesia and, secondly, differences in cessation related PI
      changes with SA versus PNB.

      Ethics:

      All participants have already given informed, written consent for use of this data for the
      AnAnkle Trial. All necessary ethical and legislative approvals have been obtained for
      initiation of AnAnkle Trial in July 2015.
