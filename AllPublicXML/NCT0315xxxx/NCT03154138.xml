  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural imbalance after stroke leads to limitations of activity and a worse autonomy. The
      postural imbalance is increased in right supratensorial stroke (RSS) compared to left
      supratensorial stroke. The evidences for the rehabilitation of postural imbalance are weak.

      Likewise, disorders of spatial reference frames are increased in RSS. The postural imbalance
      is correlated with the disorders of spatial reference frames in RSS patients.

      Prismatic adaptation (PA) is often used for the rehabilitation of unilateral spatial neglect
      after RSS. Several studies have demonstrated a peculiar expansion of sensorimotor
      after-effects to spatial cognition. An immediate effect of reduction in postural imbalance
      have been showed in acute RSS. Therefore, it is interested to investigate the immediate and
      delayed effects of PA on the postural balance and the spatial reference frames in chronic RSS
      to purpose a new therapeutic approach.

      The hypothesis of the study is that PA would improve the postural balance (activity) of
      chronic RSS patients by a reduction in mediolateral postural asymmetry, resulting from a &quot;
      bottom-up &quot; action of PA on spatial reference frames.

    <intervention_name>The prismatic adaptation (PA)</intervention_name>
    <description>Prismatic adaptation (PA) is based on the wearing of a pair of glasses producing a visual field deviation of 10° to rightward. While wearing theses glasses, the patient is asked to perform fast pointing movements towards targets by the right hand. Targets are symmetrical located at 10° in the right and left side in front of the patient. The order of pointing between these two targets is pseudo-randomly by the therapist. At the beginning of the exposure, the patient performs pointing movements with a shift toward the right side (initial errors consecutive to the prism deviation). Taking into account theses errors, the patient then compensates the optical deviation. After removing the prismatic glasses, the asked pointing movement to the targets is once again shifted but to the left side this time (after-effects attesting the prismatic adaptation)</description>

    <description>The sham prismatic adaptation (S-PA) is based on the wearing of a pair of glasses producing no visual field deviation. Theses sham glasses is identical with theses used in PA group without the optical deviation. The conditions are similar with theses in the PA group.
The procedure with the sham glasses are similar with these one used in the PA group: While wearing the sham glasses, the patient is asked to perform fast pointing movements towards targets by the right hand. Targets are symmetrical located at 10° in the right and left side in front of the patient. The support with targets are the same as these one used in the PA group. The order of pointing between these two targets is pseudo-randomly by the therapist. At the beginning of the exposure, the patient performs pointing movements without shift. No compensation of movement is observed. After removing the prismatic glasses, the asked pointing movement to the targets is not shifted (No after-effects observed)</description>
