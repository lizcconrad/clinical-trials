    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata (AA) is a common, idiopathic and sometimes recurrent non-scarring type of
      hair loss.

      Several etiological factors, including psychological, trauma-related, genetic and autoimmune
      factors have been considered as possible etiological factors . A T cell-mediated autoimmune
      mechanism in genetically vulnerable individuals is the most acceptable etiology.

      Alopecia areata presents clinically with well demarcated patches of non cicatricial hair loss
      in any hair bearing area with no remarkable gender preference.

      Although AA may occur at any age, incidence is high among younger age groups. In fact, it is
      the most common form of alopecia seen in children. Various clinical patterns of alopecia have
      been described as patchy, diffuse, reticulate, ophiasis and ophiasis inversus. Depending on
      the extent of hair loss, it can be classified into alopecia subtotalis, alopecia totalis
      (complete loss of scalp hair), and alopecia universalis (complete loss of body hair).

      National Alopecia Areata Foundation has devised &quot;Severity of Alopecia Tool Score&quot; (SALT
      score) as a measure of disease severity. Scalp is divided into 4 areas, namely, Vertex-40% of
      scalp surface area; right and left profiles-18% each and posterior scalp aspect-24%. SALT
      score is the sum of percentage of hair loss in the above mentioned areas.

      Alopecia areata is now considered a systemic autoimmune disease that may have other serious
      comorbidities, such as cardiovascular and ocular. However, the results of studies of ocular
      findings in AA are controversial.

      Several ocular alterations have been previously reported in patients with AA ranging from
      minor punctate opacities to cataract. However, there are contrasting opinions on the
      significance of these lenticular changes. In addition, Horner syndrome, pupil ectopia, iris
      atrophy, fundus changes , bilateral keratoconus, iris changes and retinal changes have been
      reported in AA.

      Dermoscopy is a noninvasive, diagnostic tool which visualizes subtle patterns of skin lesions
      not normally visible to the unaided eye. Characteristic dermoscopic finding of AA included
      black dots , tapering hair corresponding to &quot; exclamation mark hairs &quot; , broken hairs ,
      yellow dots , and clustered short vellus hairs ( shorter than 10 mm).

      Since ocular affection can be a profound morbidity factor in patients with AA, we will search
      deeply in this study about this correlation in order to conclude the value of ocular
      screening in each and every patient with AA.
