  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study should reveal differences in composition of luminal and mucosa-associated
      microbiome of the human gastrointestinal tract.Therefore bacterial species of different
      intestinal location sites (small intestine and colon) isolated of biopsies were compared to
      bacterial composition of stool samples. Additionally the bacterial composition of healthy
      persons, patients with inflammatory bowel disease and with liver disease (liver cirrhosis)
      will be compared to detect influence of local and systemic inflammation on microbiome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A dysbiosis of human gut microbiome is discussed in the pathogenesis of many disorders, also
      including gastrointestinal (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, IBD) or liver diseases (e.g.
      liver cirrhosis) . A detailed analysis of intestinal bacterial patterns might reveal
      important findings for understanding disease pathogenesis. Thereby many studies only analysed
      the luminal microbiome of stool samples, whereas mucosa-associated bacteria have possibly a
      greater impact on human health and immune system .

      To determine the differences of luminal and mucosa-associated bacteria, stool and mucosa
      samples (via biopsies) will be collected. Thereby biopsies are taken of different intestinal
      locations (small intestine and colon) to detect variations along intestinal tract. An
      additional comparison of bacterial patterns in patients with chronic, local (IBD) and
      systemic inflammation (with liver cirrhosis) or without intestinal inflammations (healthy
      controls) should reveal the influence of microbiome on or by inflammation processes.
