      Purpose of the study:

        -  To assess clinical efficacy of Tenoten for children liquid dosage form (oral drops at a
           daily dose of 10 drops, for 12 weeks) in the treatment of sequelae of perinatal injury
           to central nervous system (CNS) (cerebral hypoxic-ischaemic event and/or grade I or II
           intracranial haemorrhage).

        -  To assess safety of Tenoten for children liquid dosage form (oral drops at a daily dose
           of 10 drops, for 12 weeks) in the treatment of sequelae of perinatal injury to CNS
           (cerebral hypoxic-ischaemic event and/or grade I or II intracranial haemorrhage).
