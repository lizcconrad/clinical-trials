  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will recruit syringe exchange participants with opioid use disorder in New York
      City and test whether starting buprenorphine treatment at the syringe exchange program is
      more effective than referral to a community health center for buprenorphine treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a 24 week randomized controlled trial based in a large urban area with high rates of
      opioid use disorder (OUD) and HIV, 250 out-of-treatment opioid users who utilize syringe
      exchanges will be recruited and randomize to receive an onsite treatment intervention (O-BMT)
      or enhanced referral to buprenorphine treatment. Over 2 weeks, participants in the O-BMT arm
      will see a buprenorphine provider twice, receive weekly blister packs of medication, and then
      their care will be transferred to a community health center for maintenance buprenorphine
      treatment. In the control arm, participants will receive enhanced referral to the community
      health center for maintenance buprenorphine treatment. Data collection will include urine
      drug tests, questionnaires, and medical and pharmacy record review. Key outcomes will include
      engagement in buprenorphine treatment, treatment outcomes, and programmatic costs.
      Buprenorphine diversion will be assessed by using electronic monitors that estimate
      medication adherence, testing urine samples for buprenorphine, and through sequential surveys
      regarding buying or selling illicit buprenorphine.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in HIV risk behaviors we will be assessed using the HIV risk behavior survey. A dichotomous measure (yes/no) of injecting risk will be used based on self-report of at least one risk behavior (sharing syringes, not using bleach to clean syringes, sharing cookers, or front/back loading of syringes).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diversion</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Diversion will be defined as having at least one problem behavior: non-adherence to prescribed medication on electronic monitoring, self-reported diversion, or a urine sample consistent with diversion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ICER will be calculated by dividing the incremental mean cost of the O-BMT arm relative to the control arm by the incremental mean effectiveness of the O-BMT arm relative to the control arm. The primary economic effectiveness outcome will be the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), a measure that incorporates both duration and health-related quality-of-life and is recommended as the primary economic effectiveness measure.</description>
