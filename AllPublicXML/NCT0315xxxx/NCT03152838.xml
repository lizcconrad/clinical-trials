    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social
      communication and repetitive or stereotyped behaviors. According to the World Health
      Organization , the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder is one person in 160.

    <textblock>
      Genetic and non-genetic factors would contribute to the development of autism. However, the
      molecular mechanisms of ASD are not clear and successful treatments are still under research.
      Autism Spectrum Disorder can occur due to exposure to environmental pollutants which lead to
      epigenetic changes like DNA methylation, acetylation and post-translational modifications.
      However, the role of epigenetic changes in Autism Spectrum Disorder is still debated.

      Epigenetic mechanisms represent a link through which environmental factors interact with the
      genetic factors resulting in modification of Autism Spectrum Disorder risk through changes in
      gene expression. DNA methylation and histone deacetylation are two major epigenetic
      mechanisms that regulate the gene expression at successive stages of brain development.

      Brain derived neurotrophic factor is responsible for brain development. Altered BDNF levels
      and expression may be closely associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder. . Glial fibrillary
      acidic protein is the hallmark intermediate filament protein in astrocytes, the main type of
      glial cells in the central nervous system. Interestingly, Glial fibrillary acidic protein is
      a marker of astroglial activation and the recent data indicated that Glial fibrillary acidic
      protein could be implicated in the pathophysiology of autism. However, the underlying
      mechanisms for the role of brain derived neurotrophic factor and glial fibrillary acidic
      protein in autism spectrum disorder are poorly understood.

    <description>20 confirmed autism cases will be involved in this study.
The autism patients will be diagnosed according to:Gilliam Autism Rating Scale Arabic version: An assessment of the severity of autism using the Gilliam autism rating scale Arabic version: This test was used for diagnosis and assessment of the severity of autistic features for ages 3-22 years. It consists of 56 items, subdivided into 4 subscales: communication, social interaction, stereotyped behaviors, development and total score.

    <description>Fasting blood samples will be collected from both autism and controls for DNA extraction. Peripheral blood (2ml) will be drawn from the cubital vein intoplastic syringes. Lymphocytes will be isolated from blood samples. We will examine the gene methylation in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of drug-naı¨ve autism patients and control subjects.
DNA will be isolated from lymphocytes, purified and processed for bisulfate modification. Bisulfate treatment of genomic DNA will be performed using DNA methylation kit according to the manufacturer´ instructions. Bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA converts cytosine to uracil, but leaves methylated 5'Cytosines unchanged. Quantitative real time Polymerase chain reaction will be used to determine the DNA methylation status of the Brian derived neurotrophic factor and glia fibrillary acidic protein genes using primers specific to the human genes.</description>

    <description>An assessment of the severity of autism using the Gilliam autism rating scale Arabic version: This test was used for diagnosis and assessment of the severity of autistic features for ages 3-22 years. It consists of 56 items, subdivided into 4 subscales: communication, social interaction, stereotyped behaviors, development and total score. The Arabic version has been validated with good reliability and validity and used in many studies before. The lower the scores are, the worse the condition is.
The scale will be done by trained and certified psychologist. The protocol and informed consent for this study will be reviewed and approved by the ethics committee at the Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Egypt.</description>
