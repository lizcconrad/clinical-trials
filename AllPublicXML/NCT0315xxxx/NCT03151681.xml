  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attachment injuries are events occurring within couple relationships that involve betrayal or
      abandonment by a significant other during times of need (e.g., infidelity). They can be
      understood as relationship traumas, which can lead to debilitating symptoms consistent with
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and generalized anxiety for the injured
      partner. Research has demonstrated that the presence of an attachment injury represents a
      barrier to empirically effective couple's therapy. However, disrupting memory reconsolidation
      with the beta-blocker propranolol has been shown to alleviate PTSD symptoms by attenuating
      the salience of the emotional trauma memory, representing an interesting avenue for the
      treatment of adjustment disorders stemming from attachment injuries. Here, the investigators
      aim to extend the conditions under which reconsolidation therapy with propranolol can be used
      in a clinical setting. The investigators hypothesize that 6 sessions of memory reactivation
      under propranolol would significantly reduce trauma-related, depression, and anxiety symptom,
      associated with an attachment injury.
