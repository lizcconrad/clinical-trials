  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atropine eye drops are increasingly prescribed for the management of progressive myopia or
      short-sightedness. A previous study suggested that the back of the eye or choroid may be a
      part of the mechanism by which it induces its effects.

      The aim of this study is to characterize the effects of atropine on choroidal thickness and
      the influence of time of administration (am vs pm). It is hypothesized that the atropine's
      effect on choroidal thickness will vary with baseline thickness related to diurnal rhythm,
      where thicker baseline thickness will show a reduced choroidal response.

      Atropine eye drops are increasingly prescribed for the management of progressive myopia or
      short-sightedness. A previous study suggested that the back of the eye or choroid may be a
      part of the mechanism by which it induces its effects. The choroid shows diurnal variation
      and the efficacy of atropine on myopia control in relationship to the patient's baseline
      choroidal thickness is unknown. Thus, the objective of this study is to provide data to
      characterize the influence of atropine on choroid thickness. The study aims are to:

        1. Determine the effect of am or pm atropine application on choroid thickness

        2. Determine the effect of atropine on choroid thickness in relationship to baseline
           thickness

      Participants will be asked to attend a screening session and 13 study visits. Following the
      screening visit, participants will be scheduled to return for 4 visits across 12 hours (4
      hour intervals starting from 8am) in a single day where eye shape measurements will be taken
      to characterize diurnal variations in eye shape.

      Subjects will then be randomized to receive a drop of 1% atropine eye drops in both eyes in
      the morning or a night. Measurements of the shape of the front and back of the eye will be
      taken after approximately 1, 12, 24 and 96 hours after drop instillation. After a 2 week
      washout period, 1% atropine eye drops will be administered either in the morning or at night
      (the visit that was not previously scheduled) and measurements of the shape of the front and
      back of the eye will be taken after approximately 1, 12, 24 and 96 hours after drop
      instillation.

    <description>One drop of Atropine Sulfate 1% Oph Soln will be administered either in the morning or at night in each eye. Study measurements will be taken approximately after 1, 12, 24 and 96 hours after drop instillation. After a 2 week wash out period with no eye drops, another drop of 1% atropine sulfate ophthalmic eye drops will be administered either in the morning or night (the visit that was not taken before) and study measurements will be scheduled approximately after 1, 12 24 and 96 hours after drop instillation</description>
