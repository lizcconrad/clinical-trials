      This study evaluates the performance of &quot;CRYOBEAUTY MAINS&quot;, a Cyto-selective Cryotherapy
      based on Difluoroethane as a treatment of Solar Lentigines in 30 volunteers. Only one
      application of &quot;CRYOBEAUTY MAINS&quot; in one hand (right or left hand according to the
      randomization code).
