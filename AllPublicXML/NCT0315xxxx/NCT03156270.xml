      This study evaluates subjective and objective measures of treatment outcome after using the
      Aerin Medical Vivaer™ Stylus to treat nasal obstruction
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-significant risk, prospective, non-randomized study to evaluate subjective and
      objective measures of nasal obstruction both before and after treatment with the Vivaer
      Stylus. The Stylus is used to deliver radiofrequency (RF) energy to the nasal valve area to
      improve symptoms in those diagnosed with nasal airway obstruction.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Complaints of nasal obstruction for at least 1 year

          -  Failed maximum medical therapy (4-6 weeks of steroids)

          -  Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) score of ≥ 60 at Baseline

          -  Nasal valve is a primary or significant contributor to the subject's nasal obstruction
             as determined by the study investigator (based on clinical presentation, physical
             examination, nasal endoscopy, etc.) and the subject has a positive response to any of
             the following temporary measures (based on patient history or during office exam):

               1. Use of external nasal dilator strips (e.g., Breathe Right Strips)

               2. Q-Tip test (manual intranasal lateralization)

               3. Use of nasal stents

               4. Cottle Maneuver (manual lateral retraction of the cheek)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior surgical treatment of the nasal valve

          -  Rhinoplasty, septoplasty, inferior turbinate reduction or other surgical nasal
             procedures within the past three (3) months

          -  Severe and/or chronic sinusitis, recurrent sinusitis, or allergies leading to nasal
             obstruction and currently requiring oral corticosteroid therapy

          -  Severe case of any of the following: septal deviation, turbinate hypertrophy, polyps,
             or ptotic nose tip believed to be the primary contributor to the subject's nasal
             obstruction symptoms and warranting surgical intervention

          -  Known or suspected allergies or contraindications to the anesthetic agents and/or
             antibiotic medications to be used during the study procedure session

          -  Known or suspected to be pregnant, or is lactating

          -  Other medical conditions which in the opinion of the investigator could predispose the
             subject to poor wound healing or increased surgical risk
