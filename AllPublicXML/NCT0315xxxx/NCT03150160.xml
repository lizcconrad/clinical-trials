  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the incremental intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering
      that is achieved when brinzolamide 1% / brimonidine 0.2%, BID, is used adjunctively to
      travoprost in patients with normal tension glaucoma that may benefit from further intraocular
      pressure lowering.

      Data from this study will result in publications and provide health care practitioners with
      important treatment guidance on the use of brinzolamide 1% / brimonidine 0.2% in this
      clinical setting.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, 2-arm, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in patients with normal tension glaucoma who are insufficiently controlled on travoprost 0.004% monotherapy. Approximately 200 patients will be randomized and treated for up to 11 weeks whilst they will receive double-masked study medication for 6 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Patients, Investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and data analysts will not be aware of the identity of the masked treatment (brinzolamide 1% / brimonidine 0.2% or placebo) being administered from the time of randomization until database lock, using the following methods:
- Randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of unmasking, and will not be accessible by anyone else involved in the study.
- The identity of the treatments will be concealed by the use of masked study drug that are all identical in packaging, labeling, and schedule of administration. Both brinzolamide 1% / brimonidine 0.2% and placebo will be provided in identical masked bottles labeled with the protocol and kit numbers. Each kit will contain 1 bottle of masked study medication.</masking_description>

          -  Adults and elderly patients 18 years of age or older diagnosed with normal tension
             glaucoma (at Screening)

             lowering medications according to the following minimum time schedule AND establish a

               -  miotics and oral/topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, 5 days

               -  beta-antagonists, 28 days

               -  fixed combination medications: the longest washout of the individual components

          -  OR, for patients already receiving Travoprost monotherapy, or treatment naïve
             patients, must have, or be able to establish a minimum 28 day intraocular pressure
             baseline on Novartis/Alcon manufactured branded travoprost.

          -  Mean Intraocular pressure measurements in at least 1 eye ≥ 16 and &lt; 22 mmHg at 09:00

             to the point of fixation.

          -  Chronic, recurrent or severe inflammatory eye disease in either eye (from screening).

          -  Ocular trauma or surgery within the past 6 months in either eye; ocular infection or
             laser surgery within the past 3 months in either eye (all from screening)

          -  Clinically significant or progressive retinal disease such as retinal degeneration,
             diabetic retinopathy, or retinal detachment in either eye.

          -  Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score worse than 55 Early Treatment of Diabetic
             Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters (equivalent to approximately 20/80 Snellen, 0.60
