      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kilogram per meter
             square (kg/m^2) (BMI = weight [kg] / height [m]^2), and a body weight of not less than
             50 kilogram (kg)

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, neurological
             examination, medical history, vital signs, and 12 lead (electrocardiogram) ECG, and
             peripheral capillary oxygen saturation [(SpO2) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 97
             percent] performed at Screening and Day -1

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at
             Screening and Day -1. If the results of the serum chemistry panel, coagulation,
             hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may
             be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from
             normal to be not clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the
             participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator

          -  Female participants must not be of childbearing potential by fulfilling 1 of the
             criteria: a) be over 45 years of age with no menses for 12 months without an
             alternative medical cause, with screening follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels of
             greater than (&gt;) 40 International Unit per Liter (IU/L) or milli-International Unit
             per milliliter (mIU/mL). b) be permanently surgically sterile. Permanent surgical
             sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral tubal
             occlusion/ligation procedures, and bilateral oophorectomy. Documentation of FSH levels
             is not required in the case of surgical sterility

          -  Female participants must have a negative serum pregnancy (Beta -human chorionic
             gonadotropin [Beta -hCG]) test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day
             -1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has current, or history of, clinically significant medical illness
             including, but not limited to, liver or renal insufficiency, significant cardiac,
             vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic,
             rheumatologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disturbances

          -  Participant has a history of abnormal bleeding or clotting, or disorder of fibrinogen
             (example, dysfibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia)

          -  Participant has history of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions are
             squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or
             malignancy that in the opinion of the Investigator, with concurrence with the
             Sponsor's medical monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence)
