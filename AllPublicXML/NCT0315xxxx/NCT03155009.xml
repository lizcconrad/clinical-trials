  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of alectinib, in selected participants, with
      anaplastic lymphoma kinase-rearranged (ALK-rearranged) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
      after disease progression on prior treatment strategy with crizotinib, as only ALK inhibitor,
      and eventually chemotherapy treatment(s).
