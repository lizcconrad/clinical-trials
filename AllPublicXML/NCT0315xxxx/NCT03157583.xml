    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the SPF and UVAPF of four sunscreen formulations
      using international standard methodologies ISO24444:2010 for SPF and ISO24443:2012 for UVAPF.

      This study consist of two steps. Step 1: determination of the SPF of the test products which
      will be performed as a single-center, randomized, evaluator blind, intra-individual
      comparison, no treatment and positive controlled clinical study as per ISO24444:2010. And
      Step 2: determination of the UVAPF of the test products which will be performed as a single
      center, open-label, negative and positive controlled technical test as per ISO24443:2012
      (using test plates for assessing UV transmittance of four developmental sunscreens).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Arithmetic mean of Individual sun protection factor (SPFi) values</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours post UV exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Arithmetic mean of all valid SPFi values of each product on each participant will be calculated from the individual Minimal Erythemal Dose (MED) on product treated (MEDp) test sites in relation to unprotected (MEDu) test sites 16-24 hours after exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. SPFi = MEDp/MEDu.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Arithmetic mean Individual ultraviolet-A protection factor (UVAPFi)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 minutes post UV exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Arithmetic mean of all valid individual UVAPFi values will be assessed for each product. The test method used for all UVAPF calculation is based on the assessment of UV-transmittance through a thin film of sunscreen sample spread on a roughened substrate (Polymethylmethacrylate [PMMA] plates), before and after exposure to a controlled dose of radiation from a defined UV exposure source. Glycerin-treated PMMA plates will be used as a reference &quot;blank&quot;. The method is controlled by the use of a reference sunscreen formulation (S2) to verify the test procedure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Critical wavelength</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 minutes post UV exposure</time_frame>
    <description>The critical wavelength of a sunscreen is defined as the wavelength at which the summed UV absorbance from 290 nanometer (nm) equals 90% of the total absorbance in the UV region (290-400 nm). The UV absorption spectrum of each test product treated plate shall be measured 9 times. The critical wavelength of each plate is calculated from the mean UV absorption spectrum of each plate. The critical wavelength for each test product shall be reported as the mean critical wavelength of all measured plates. The recommended minimum critical wavelength is 370 nm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spectrum of sun protection</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 minutes post UV exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Broad spectrum of sun protection will be calculated by the ratio of the arithmetic mean of SPF to the arithmetic mean of UVAPF.</description>
