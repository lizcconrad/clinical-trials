  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to explore the effects of a dietary nitrate supplement on
      immunity, mood, cardiovascular activity, and lung function during and following final exam
      stress in both healthy and asthmatic individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Past research has demonstrated significant changes in immune response and airway inflammation
      during times of stress. Specifically, significant decreases in the fraction of exhaled nitric
      oxide (FeNO) in both healthy and asthmatic undergraduate students have been found during
      times of final exam stress. Additionally, research suggests that dietary supplementation of
      nitric oxide may have beneficial cardiovascular effects which may offset the physiological
      consequences of stress.

      This research study explores the effects of a dietary supplement on immunity, mood,
      cardiovascular and respiratory function during and following final exam stress. In this
      study, investigators monitor changes in respiratory infection incidence, airway nitric oxide,
      mood, blood pressure, and lung function in students with and without asthma during the time
      of final exams and a comparable time of low stress during the term. There are three
      assessments in the laboratory, as well as two additional brief questionnaires on separate
      days. During the final exam period, half of the participants are randomly assigned to the
      experimental group which is provided with a dietary supplement (beetroot juice drink) of
      which they are asked to take one dose every day in the morning for seven days. The three
      assessments periods include two during the week of final exams and one during a period of low
      stress scheduled up to two weeks to two months before that time. For the final exam period,
      the first of the two sessions takes place on the day before the second of these exams, and
      the second assessment takes place on a subsequent day after second exam. A follow-up
      assessment of cold symptoms takes place online 7 days after the final exam period.
