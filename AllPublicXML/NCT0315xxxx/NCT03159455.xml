    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the current study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of
      BI 1467335 in healthy Japanese male subjects following oral administration of multiple rising
      doses The Caucasian group will receive higher dose only.

      A secondary objective is the exploration of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BI
      1467335 in healthy Japanese and Caucasian male subjects.
