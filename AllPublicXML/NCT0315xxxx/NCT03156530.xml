  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By using a static stabilometry platform, the investigators believe the possible verification
      of the efficiency of auricular acupuncture points that correlates with regions of our body
      that may interfere with static equilibrium.

      The present work aims to analyze the effect of the stimulation of atrial points of the lower
      limbs on the equilibrium response evaluated by static stabilometry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Balance is an extremely relevant subject because of the large and increasing incidence of
      falls mainly in the elderly population. This leads to a significant social impact since falls
      can lead an elderly to increasing dependence on the family and can be the cause of depression
      and reduce their quality of life. Studies have already demonstrated the efficacy of
      acupuncture stimulation in the treatment of vertigo and also for the improvement of postural
      control. For this, the option of auricular acupuncture was chosen because it is a
      non-invasive and safe method. Thus, the objective of this study will be to analyze the
      effects of atrial stimulation of the lower limbs on the equilibrium response by static
      stabilometry. Participants in this study were 40 healthy individuals aged between 18 and 30
      years who will be divided into two groups: GA (acupuncture group) (n = 20) and CG (control
      group) (n = 20). The acupuncture group will be stimulated unilaterally according to the motor
      preference side of each individual in the points referring to the three joints of the lower
      limb (knee and ankle hip). The control group will not receive stimulation. Balance
      evaluations will be performed before the stimuation (initial), 20 minutes after the
      initiation of the protocol (second evaluation) and 5 minutes after the second evaluation,
      with eyes open and closed. Participants will be positioned standing with their arms along
      their body, mouth closed not with force and parallel feet. Statistical analysis will be
      performed by means of a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the differences between the
      data will be evidenced by Holm Sidack's post-test. Values of p≤0.05 will be considered
      significant.
