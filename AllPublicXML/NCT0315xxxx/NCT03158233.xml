  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, surveillance study will assess the operational Zika virus definition for
      use in future Zika purified inactivated virus (ZIKV) vaccine efficacy trials in order to
      identify Zika virus disease (ZVD) cases among the study cohort.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, cohort study will conduct active and passive surveillance for
      ZVD and determine its prevalence and seroconversion incidence in areas of Latin America
      experiencing Zika epidemic activity. A description of the occurrence of dengue virus and
      chikungunya virus infections in the cohort may also be provided as differential diagnosis of
      ZVD.
