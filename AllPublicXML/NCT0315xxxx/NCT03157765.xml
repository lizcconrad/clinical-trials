  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a history of recurrent implantation failure who are planning a frozen embryo
      transfer (FET) are enrolled into the program. Patients are randomized to an endometrial
      biopsy prior to starting estrogen to prepare for the transfer of warmed vitrified embryos or
      to routine care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who failed to achieve a clinical pregnancy after embryo transfer of at least three
      high quality embryos in at least two IVF or FET cycles and for whom their last failed cycle
      was a frozen embryo transfer are offered the opportunity to enroll in this study. All
      patients will follow our routine FET protocol.

      On a randomized basis, selected patients will undergo an endometrial biopsy using a Pipelle
      disposable device in the week prior to starting estrogen to prepare her endometrium.
