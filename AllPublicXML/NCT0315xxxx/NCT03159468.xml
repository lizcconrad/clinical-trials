  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rates of sexual assault are alarmingly high, and alcohol is consistently implicated in the
      majority of these assaults. Despite well-intentioned prevention efforts, this pandemic
      continues unabated, warranting the development of novel and innovative approaches to the
      reduction of sexual aggression. The goal of this research is to evaluate the efficacy of two
      brief online emotion regulation interventions for reducing alcohol-related sexual aggression
      in heavy episodic drinking young men with a sexual aggression history. Previous research
      suggests that emotion regulation difficulties are associated with both alcohol consumption
      and aggressive behavior. Despite the potential prevention utility of improving sexually
      aggressive men's emotion regulation skills in order to reduce their alcohol-related sexual
      aggression, this approach has yet to be explored. Thus, this study evaluates the effects of
      two brief online ER interventions - cognitive restructuring and mindfulness - on men's
      emotion regulation during a sexual aggression-related analogue. Additionally, these effects
      will be evaluated during both sober and intoxicated states through a laboratory- based
      alcohol administration experiment.
