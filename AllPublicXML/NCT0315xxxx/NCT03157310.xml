  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gefitinib is a selective small molecule epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) tyrosine
      kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI), it's curative effect on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has
      been confirmed by a number of prospective clinical trials. The researches aim to analysis
      whether bone metastasis could affect the survival of NSCLC patients who were effective in
      Gefitinib treatment over 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) have inhibitory effects on cell apoptosis, cell
      growth, angiogenesis and metastasis of tumor cell. The advent of EGFR-TKI significantly
      improved the clinical efficacy and safety of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment.
      Compelling study also demonstrate Gefitinib may be effective in the treatment of bone
      metastases. For NSCLC patients who were effective in EGFR-TKI treatment, whether bone
      metastasis would shorten the survival time of the patients or reduce the quality of life of
      patients is worth studying. The researches aim to analysis whether bone metastasis could
      affect the survival of NSCLC patients who were effective in Gefitinib treatment over 6
      months.
