    <textblock>
      This study will be looking at whether combining cyclophosphamide, pembrolizumab (an antibody
      that blocks negative signals to T cells), GVAX (pancreatic cancer vaccine), and IMC-CS4
      (LY3022855) (an antibody that blocks a molecule called CSF1-R which prevents the bodies
      ability to fight cancer) is effective (anti-tumor activity) and safe in patients with
      borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.
