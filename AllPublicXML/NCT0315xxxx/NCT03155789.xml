  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this prospective study is to compare the clinical outcomes after lumbar
      fusion for chronic low back pain using the four techniques commonly employed in our surgical
      practice. Lumbar fusion stops motion at a painful vertebral segment, which can decrease back
      pain. The four techniques are standard transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (S TLIF),
      minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MI TLIF), extreme lateral
      interbody fusion (XLIF), and axial lumbar interbody fusion (AxiaLIF). Each differ in where
      incisions are made and level of invasiveness; not all may be implemented in each surgical
      case. The four different techniques are all standard approaches with different advantages and
      have yet to be compared in efficacy for relieving chronic low back pain.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 6 months, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This is part of the Patient Questionnaire primary outcome measure. A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that measures the intensity or frequency of pain across a continuum of values.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Prolo Functional and Economic Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 6 months, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This is part of the Patient Questionnaire primary outcome measure. The Prolo Score is a 10-point scale consisting of only two questions evaluating the functional and economic status of the patient.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Dallas Pain Questionnaire (DPQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 6 months, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This is part of the Patient Questionnaire primary outcome measure. The Dallas Pain Questionnaire (DPQ) assess the amount of chronic spine pain that affects the patient's daily and work-leisure activities, anxiety-depression, and social interest.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Short Form 12 (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 6 months, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This is part of the Patient Questionnaire primary outcome measure. The Short Form 12 (SF-12) was designed to measure the patient's functional health and well-being.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 6 months, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This is part of the Patient Questionnaire primary outcome measure. The Oswestry Disability Index measures a patient's impairment and quality of life due to pain.</description>
