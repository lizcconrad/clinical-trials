      Objectives: To investigate the efficacy of bedside respiratory muscle training on pulmonary
      function and stroke-related disabilities in stroke patients.

      Design: Prospective randomized controlled trial

      Setting: A single physical medicine and rehabilitation department at a university hospital

      Participants: Stroke patients in a rehabilitation unit were recruited and randomly assigned
      to either the intervention group or the control group.

      Intervention: Both groups participated in a conventional stroke rehabilitation program.
      During the study period, the intervention group received bedside respiratory muscle training
      twice a day for three weeks. The respiratory muscle training consisted of (1) a breath
      stacking exercise, (2) inspiratory muscle training and (3) expiratory muscle training. The
      participants were evaluated at baseline and again at the end of the study (3 weeks later).

      Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes were measures of pulmonary function: functional
      vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak flow.

      Secondary outcomes were stroke-related disabilities assessed by the following: National
      Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Modified Barthel Index, Berg Balance Scale, Fugl-Meyer
      Assessment, the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination, and the incidence of pneumonia.

    <description>The intervention group participated in a conventional stroke rehabilitation program, which consisted of joint range of motion exercises, muscle strengthening, gait training, fine motor exercises, and activity of daily living training. This program was performed for 30 minutes twice a day 5 days a week, over for at least 3 weeks. During the same period, the intervention group also took part in bedside respiratory muscle training twice a day for 7 days a week over a 3-week period.</description>
