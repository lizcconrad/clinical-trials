    <textblock>
      This Nordic Myeloma Study Group study is a phase 2 study for advanced multiple myeloma (MM)
      patients below 75 years of age. The main aim of this study is to assess the overall response
      rate (ORR) with a new drug combination, carfilzomib + elotuzumab + dexamethasone
      (CAR-ELO-Dex). Even if this is not a randomized study rough comparisons can be done with
      earlier reports of different regimens in the same clinical situation. In addition, safety
      assessment is of critical importance for a new regimen. A modern concept is to study the
      depth of complete responses (CR) with a sensitive multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) method
      for minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment - an endpoint that is mostly lacking in
      previous studies for this patient population. We assume that treatment with this new
      combination of CAR + ELO + Dex will produce at least as good responses as the most efficient
      regimens so far used in this clinical situation, and there will be a substantial proportion
      of CR responses with MRD-negativity which can be regarded as an indicator of high-level
      treatment efficacy and which gives a good basis for comparisons of treatment efficacy between
      different study regimens in future.

      The target population of the study is the patients who have relapsed or progressed after 1 to
      3 prior treatment lines in which PI (bortezomib and/or ixazomib) and/or lenalidomide have
      been included. The primary endpoint is overall response rate while the secondary endpoints
      include complete remission, duration of response, assessment of the depth (quality) of CR
      with MRD measurement by flow cytometry, estimation of progression free survival (PFS) and
      time to next treatment, and evaluation of adverse events and safety.
