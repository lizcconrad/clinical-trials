  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During surgery, electrophysiological signals will be acquired with the instrument (ISIS IOM,
      NeuroExplore, Software Version 4.4, Inomed) already in use at the Neurosurgery Service of the
      Neurocentro of the Hospital Civic Italian Switzerland in Lugano. Simultaneously to
      Somatosensorial Evoked Potential (SEP) will also be recorded the Electroencephalography (EEG)
      activity with the same detection of locations.

      For the purposes of the study the signals transmitted to the neurosurgeon through the
      hardware and the corresponding assessments done by the neurophysiologist responsible for
      intraoperative monitoring will be recorded. It will also be kept track of procedures
      performed during surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years old

          -  Patient bearer of a not broken cerebral aneurysm, which has been defined per size and
             morphology susceptible to surgery

          -  Aneurysm for medium-sized cerebral arteries; cases of multiple aneurysms are also
             eligible

          -  Informed consent for participation in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with an aneurysm of the posterior circulation (vertebrobasilar system)

          -  The aneurysm was a source of bleeding (subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral,
             intraventricular).

          -  Patient with a pace-maker (for the risk that the electric currents used in the study
             could compromise the operation of the pace-maker)
