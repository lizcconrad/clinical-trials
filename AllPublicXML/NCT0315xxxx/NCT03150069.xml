  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study seeks to interview women with Morquio A and Morquio B syndrome, to explore
      their concerns surrounding pregnancy and the impact of ERT on their perspectives, in
      comparison with the control group of Morquio B subjects for whom no ERT treatment exists.

      Interviews will be conducted by a health psychologist, in-person or over the telephone. Data
      will be analyzed using MAXQDA 12.0 software and Grounded Theory. Differences in thematic
      trends between Morquio A subjects, for whom treatment exists, and a control group of Morquio
      B subjects, for whom there is no treatment, will be compared.

      The present study seeks to interview women with Morquio A and Morquio B syndrome themselves,
      to explore and discover their perspectives and concerns surrounding pregnancy and having
      biological children, the impact of the advent of ERT for Morquio A on their perspectives and
      concerns in comparison with the control group of Morquio B subjects for whom no ERT treatment
      exists, as well as what each group is being told by the medical community and others in their
      lives in this regard.

      Interviews will be conducted by a health psychologist, either in-person or over the
      telephone. We will interview 1) those women with Morquio syndrome who are known to have been
      pregnant and 2) those women with Morquio syndrome who have not been pregnant and/or chose to
      adopt children. All information will be kept confidential, except as in accordance with
      Georgia law relating to reporting of child or elder abuse, suicidal and/or homicidal intent.

      Data will be analyzed using MAXQDA 12.0 software to develop code which can be used to
      describe and compare the data using Grounded Theory. Differences in thematic trends between
      Morquio A subjects, for whom treatment exists, and a control group of Morquio B subjects, for
      whom there is no treatment, will be compared.
