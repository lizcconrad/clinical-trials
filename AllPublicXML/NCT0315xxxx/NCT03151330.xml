  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Preterm birth (PTB) remains the leading cause of neonatal mortality and long term
      disability throughout the world. Recently treatments early in pregnancy such as progesterone,
      cervical support and maternal support have been demonstrated to delay delivery amongst at
      risk women. Nonetheless, the majority of women who are at risk are not identified using
      current screening modalities.

      Hypothesis: Women who are screened using the PreTRM速 test around 20 weeks gestation will have
      a -statistically significant reduction in preterm birth compared to an unscreened historical
      control group of preterm birth.

      Study Design Type: Prospective cohort study of screened women compared to a historical
      control. The study will employ an adaptive design allowing periodic evaluation of the data to
      determine the optimal time to stop the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Population: Women who are 18 years or older, with a singleton pregnancy between 195/7 weeks
      and 206/7 weeks gestational age (GA) confirmed by ultrasound prior to enrollment, and no
      history of prior preterm birth (delivery between 160/7 weeks and 366/7 weeks) will be invited
      to participate. A comparable population will be identified using a historical control group
      in a contemporaneously maintained database.

      Intervention: Qualifying women will be screened using the PreTRM速 test (Sera Prognostics,
      Inc.) at a large tertiary care center. Predicated upon the degree of risk, women will be
      treated according to a prespecified algorithm. The outcomes of these women will be compared
      to a historical control group at the same tertiary care center.

      Outcomes:

      Primary outcome: To determine whether women who are screened with the PreTRM速 test and then
      managed according to a prespecified algorithm will have a statistically significant reduction
      in spontaneous PTB &lt; 37 weeks compared to a historical control group.

      Secondary outcomes: To determine whether women who are screened with the PreTRM速 test and
      then managed according to a pre-specified treatment algorithm will have a statistically
      significant reduction in proportion of any type of preterm births (spontaneous and
      indicated), the total length of hospital stay for spontaneous preterm births, and total
      length of hospital stay for any preterm birth.

      Observations:

        -  Neonatal death and stillbirth

        -  Birth weight and number of subjects with birth weight &lt;1500g and &lt;2500g

        -  Total number of days spent in the NICU and nursery

        -  Composite neonatal morbidity score and components

        -  Whether or not received surfactant

        -  Occurrence of pneumonia

        -  Number of days of mechanical ventilation

        -  Number of subjects with 5 minute Apgar &lt; 7

        -  Occurrence of asphyxia

        -  Number of preterm deliveries at &lt;37, &lt;35 and &lt;32 weeks

        -  Occurrence of preeclampsia

        -  Proportion of primiparous women experiencing preterm birth and spontaneous preterm birth

        -  NICU days for spontaneous preterm birth in primiparous women in prospective treatment
           arm are significantly less than NICU days in primiparous women in the control group of
           sPTB

        -  Correlation of blood levels of 17-OHPC and other progestin levels to outcomes and
           observations

      General Outcomes:

      Total cost of hospital care for both the mother and fetus beginning at initiation of care
      through primary delivery and 28 days of life.
