  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to study the effect of therapeutic education on
      patient adherence for at-home continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or at-home
      non-invasive ventilation. This first study will use data already present in the Association
      for Home Assistance and Rehabilitation (APARD) database to compare patients who received
      therapeutic education with a control group who did not.
