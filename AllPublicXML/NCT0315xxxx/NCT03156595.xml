  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chimiotherapy produces neuropathies injuries to 30% to 70% cases. A third of those patients
      keeps suffering from this side effects disabilities and their quality of life is seriously
      affected.

      Hypnosis, as a non-invasive tool without physical side effects, might be used to relieve
      them.

      the purpose of this trial based on our own experience, is to demonstrate the value of using
      hypnosis and self-hypnosis in chimiotherapy- induced chronic neuropathies.

      The aim will be to sustainably improve the quality of life by expanding self-management of
      pain and motor function side effect.
