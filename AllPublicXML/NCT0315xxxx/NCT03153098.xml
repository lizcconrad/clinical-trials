  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a high prevalence of inactive adults in the United Kingdom (UK), many of whom suffer
      from conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and poor mental health. These
      problems often co-exist more frequently in areas of higher socio-economic deprivation. There
      is an ongoing need to test the effectiveness, acceptability, and sustainability of community
      physical activity interventions. The Active Herts programme is a community physical activity
      programme aimed at inactive adults aged 16 and over who have one or more risk factors for
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or a mild to moderate mental health condition. The programme
      uses the latest evidence-based behaviour change techniques to target physical activity,
      wellbeing, and key drivers of behaviour from the COM-B ('Capability', 'Opportunity',
      'Motivation' and 'Behaviour') model of behaviour change.

      This evaluation will follow a mixed-methods longitudinal (baseline, and 3, 6 and 12 month
      follow-ups) pragmatic observational design. Two types of programme are being delivered, each
      in a different area. In one, group participants will receive a behaviour change technique
      booklet, consultations (baseline, and optional at 3, 6, and 12 months), a booster phone call
      (week 2), motivational text messages (weeks 3, 6, and 12), and signposting to 12 weeks of
      exercise classes. In the other 'enhanced delivery' group, participants will receive the same
      but the 12 weeks of exercise will be free and tailored to their needs, and there will be
      optional exercise 'buddies' available. An outcome evaluation will assess changes in physical
      activity as the primary outcome, and sporting participation, sitting, wellbeing,
      psychological capability, and reflective motivation as secondary outcomes. A process
      evaluation will use both one-to-one interviews and focus groups to explore the views of
      stakeholders, delivery staff, and participants over three phases (set-up, deviations in the
      delivery of the intervention, and looking back over the intervention). Economic evaluation
      will examine the costs of the Active Herts programme against the benefits gained in terms of
      reduced risk of morbidity from a range of chronic conditions.

      This study will measure key drivers of physical activity using up to date behaviour change
      theory, allowing evaluation of not only whether physical activity has increased but also why.
      The research will inform the future development of a scalable intervention that can be more
      robustly tested in a randomised controlled trial.

        Participants will live in one of four Hertfordshire districts (Broxbourne, Stevenage,
        Hertsmere, and Watford), United Kingdom. The four districts contain the highest number of
        deprived Lower Super Output Areas (LSOA) in Hertfordshire and are in the five highest rates
        of under 75 mortality rate from CVD (2-3%), adult obesity (8-10%), and diabetes (4-6%). A
        life expectancy gap of 6-9.6 years exists between the most and least deprived areas across
        these districts. Less than 50% of this population participate in 30 minutes of physical
        activity once per week.
