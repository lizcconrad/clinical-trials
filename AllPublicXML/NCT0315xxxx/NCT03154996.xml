  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to establish, for the first time, safety of prolonged
      intracerebral convection enhanced delivery of chemotherapy in patients with recurrent high
      grade glioma (HGG). Secondary objectives will include determination of topotecan (TPT)
      distribution and radiographic tumor response with prolonged continuous intracerebral
      convection-enhanced delivery (CED).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant gliomas are among the most pernicious of human tumors - locally invasive and
      universally recurrent, with recurrence usually occurring within two centimeters of the
      original resection cavity. Although numerous chemotherapeutic drugs demonstrate significant
      anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies, the efficacy in clinical trials has been dismal
      because systemic delivery fails to achieve therapeutic drug levels in tumor cells due to
      various factors including limited blood-brain barrier permeability and systemic toxicity.

      Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a method of regional drug delivery that circumvents
      this problem. Phase 1 clinical trial has shown that a potent topoisomerase inhibitor,
      topotecan (TPT), can be safely and effectively delivered by CED into patients with recurrent
      malignant gliomas. This study will expand on these clinical results to address two current
      limitations to the clinical application of CED: 1) A reliable method for non-invasively
      monitoring drug distribution throughout the tumor and brain does not exist; and 2) Duration
      of CED therapy has been limited to short-term infusions secondary to the use of externalized
      infusion pumps.

      The hypothesis is that extended chronic local-regional delivery of TPT is safe, effective and
      feasible in patients with recurrent gliomas. TPT will be directly and chronically delivered
      into the tumor and surrounding brain by CED through subcutaneously implanted pumps while
      innovating a methodology for monitoring the drug distribution through non-invasive imaging.
      This strategy will overcome the limitations of chemotherapy as currently used in the
      treatment of gliomas, and may be applicable to other central nervous system (CNS) diseases
      currently limited by drug delivery barriers.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a recurrent malignant glioma (World Health Organization (WHO) grade
             III-IV), including recurrent glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic
             oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, and anaplastic ependymoma.
             Stereotactic biopsies will be performed to confirm this diagnosis prior to initiating
             the treatment.

          -  Patients with tumors of the brain must have been previously treated with surgical
             resection, external beam radiation, and temozolomide chemotherapy.

          -  An magnetic resonance (MR) scan must be obtained within 30 days of enrollment and must
             demonstrate an enhancing mass without significant mass effect. Tumors must be less
             than 32 cc in total volume. The lesion must be stereotactically accessible.

          -  Patients must have demonstrated evidence of increasing contrast enhancement on MR or
             computed tomography (CT) imaging while on stable or increasing dose of steroid.

          -  Karnofsky performance score of greater than or equal to 60.

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential must practice birth control. Women of child
             bearing potential must have a urine pregnancy test within 7 days of study entry.

          -  Patients must possess the ability to give Informed Consent.

          -  Patients must be willing to and medically capable of undergoing the surgical
             operation.

          -  There is no upper age limit. Patients at extreme upper end of the age spectrum will
             not be automatically excluded, but will be carefully scrutinized to determine their
             suitability for this procedure.

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years old.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Leukocytes: ≥3,000/ cells per microliter of blood (mcL)

               -  Absolute neutrophil count: ≥1,500/mcL

               -  Platelets: ≥100,000/mcL

               -  Total bilirubin: within normal institutional limits

               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT):
                  ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine: within normal institutional limits OR

               -  Creatinine clearance: ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels
                  above institutional normal.

             illness.

          -  Patients who are known HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C positive. HIV-positive patients
             on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for
             pharmacokinetic interactions with topotecan. In addition, these patients are at
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
