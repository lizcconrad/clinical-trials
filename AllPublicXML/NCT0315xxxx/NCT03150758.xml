  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction persists in approximately 80% of men 1 year after prostatectomy. Various
      erectile rehabilitation strategies have not provided benefit. Electrical stimulation has been
      demonstrated to benefit neuroregeneration and the functional recovery of neuromuscular
      systems. Therefore, electrical stimulation of the cavernosal nerves during radical
      prostatectomy is being investigated for its potential development into a treatment aimed at
      improving recovery of erectile function after prostatectomy. This pilot study is intended to
      determine the threshold of electrical stimulation that results in penile erection, as defined
      by persistent intracavernosal pressure increase, such that future studies of sub-threshold
      stimulation may be pursued.

      Objective:

      To determine the cavernosal nerve electrical stimulation amplitude thresholds at which an
      erection, as indicated by persistent increases in intracavernosal pressure, occurs for
      various stimuli of fixed frequency and fixed pulse-width.

      Study Design:

      This is a prospective pilot study used to determine a threshold range of cavernosal nerve
      electrical stimulation parameters that result in penile erection. Assignment to the order of
      stimulation paradigms will be randomized. No placebos are used. No blinding is used.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have prostate cancer being treated via radical prostatectomy by a single
             surgeon (primary investigator) with planned intraoperative nerve sparing.

          -  Subjects must have intact preoperative erectile function, sufficient for penetrative
             intercourse without medication nor assistive device, as defined by a Sexual Health
             Inventory for Men (SHIM) / International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-2) score 22
             or higher, which is collected as part of routine care.

          -  Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Baseline erectile dysfunction, as defined by the use of medications or devices to
             assist erection, lack of baseline erections, or a SHIM / IIEF-2 21 or lower, which is
             collected as part of routine care.

          -  Lack of successful intraoperative nerve sparing.

          -  Neurologic, metabolic, or vascular diseases that may negatively impact erectile
             function, such as: diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery
             disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, parkinson's disease, multiple systems atrophy,
             epilepsy, or spinal cord injury.

          -  Inability to provide a fully informed consent.
