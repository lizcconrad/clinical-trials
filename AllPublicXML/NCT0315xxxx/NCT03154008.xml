  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will examine neurophysiological, specifically event-related potential
      (ERP), measures of emotional processing as predictors of response to cognitive behavior
      therapy for adolescent depression.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurophysiological measures (i.e., event-related potentials) of reward responsiveness and
      regulation of mood-congruent, sad stimuli will be assessed in a sample of adolescents with
      depression prior to group cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). CBT will follow the Adolescent
      Coping with Depression Course, an established 16-session group treatment protocol, and
      consist of behavioral activation, relaxation skills, cognitive therapy, social skills,
      problem solving, and relapse prevention. Changes in symptoms will be monitored through
      biweekly self-report and clinician ratings to examine prediction of change in symptoms across
      CBT. Baseline individual differences in reward responsiveness and emotion regulation will be
      evaluated as predictors of change in self-reported symptoms and clinician-rated improvement
      following CBT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants presenting with major depressive or persistent depressive disorder and
             moderate severity on the Clinical Global Impressions scale.

          -  Participants may have comorbid externalizing or anxiety disorders.

          -  Participants (and parents of minors) fluent in English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Youth with history of treatment for substance use disorders.

          -  Youth with intellectual or developmental disabilities (e.g., autism spectrum
             disorders, pervasive developmental disorders).

          -  Youth with lifetime schizophrenia, psychosis, or mania.

          -  Youth with severe current suicidality.

          -  Youth taking antipsychotic medications or mood stabilizers.

          -  Youth with recent changes in dosage of antidepressant (adolescents with change in
             dosage in past 30 days who otherwise meet study criteria will be asked to begin the
             study once dosage has been stable for 30 days).

          -  Parent or child not fluent in English.

          -  Youth who are unable to complete study procedures because of visual or hearing
             impairments.

          -  Youth who have recently started outside therapy (past 30 days at time of intake), are
             engaged in treatment that is determined to be too similar to study therapy (e.g, other
             CBT groups), or are currently in treatment that is too intensive to allow for
             participation in study therapy (e.g., partial hospitalization programs)
