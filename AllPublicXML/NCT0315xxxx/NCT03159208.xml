  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to establish clinical determinants of poor cognitive and physical
      functional outcome of CCI patients so that the investigators may develop and validate a
      multi-dimensional clinical prediction model to more effectively inform decision making
      earlier in the course of the ICU care. The investigators hypothesize that multiple premorbid
      and acute factors measured early in the course of CCI will have strong independent
      associations with functional recovery. The investigators further hypothesize that social and
      economic factors are associated with long-term functional outcomes independent of the acute
      clinical problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A substantial number of critically ill patients experience persistent organ failure leading
      to chronic critical illness (CCI). The majority of these patients die within a year, and many
      survivors must cope with long-term physical and cognitive limitations that are often severe.
      Survival with severe physical and cognitive dysfunction is a significant clinical, emotional,
      and economic burden in this population, but little is known about which patients are at
      highest risk for physical and cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, although long-term mortality
      in CCI can be reliably estimated with a validated mortality prediction model, there is
      currently no validated method to predict long-term functional disability for purposes of
      shared decision-making and resource planning. In order to address these gaps in knowledge,
      the investigators will conduct a multi-center prospective cohort study that measures clinical
      and premorbid risk factors for long-term physical and cognitive dysfunction in CCI. Using
      these risk factors, the investigators will construct a multi-outcome prognostic model for
      survival with severe physical or cognitive dysfunction to facilitate shared decision-making
      and resource planning. Additionally, the investigators will identify independent social and
      economic variables that are risk factors for long-term survival and functional disability.
