  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of silicone material inserts within
      pressure garments is effective in decreasing hypertrophic burn scar formation as compared to
      standard pressure garment therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical revision, potential hospitalization, and extensive post-surgical rehabilitation may
      be required for the revision and correction of hypertrophic burn scars to restore function
      and prevent disability. This in turn results in an increased financial burden to the medical
      system. More importantly, the patient is required to undergo an additional invasive medical
      procedure that can potentially create further hypertrophic scarring.

      Prevention and reduction of hypertrophic scars with non-invasive, cost effective, and
      evidence based treatment modalities is therefore the most desirable approach. Two of the most
      generally accepted methods of non-invasive treatment, pressure garments and silicone gel
      sheeting, have been demonstrated to individually treat hypertrophic scarring. Recently, burn
      therapists have begun to use silicone bonded material inserts within pressure garments
      following the logical deduction that the two therapeutic techniques can be combined to
      resolve many of the cited individual disadvantages, while reaping the benefits of each
      individual modality. It is the aim of this study to determine the efficacy of these silicone
      bonded material inserts within pressure garments in the treatment of hypertrophic scarring.
