  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1b study in participants with locally advanced
      rectum cancer where primary resection without chemoradiotherapy is unlikely to achieve clear
      margins as defined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is conducted to assess the safety,
      to assess the tolerability, and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of E7046 in
      combination with pre-operative chemoradiotherapy. The study will also assess the efficacy of
      the combination in the expansion part at RP2D.

             baseline assessment is required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained
             more than 72 hours before the first dose of study drug. Females of childbearing
             potential (all females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they
             are postmenopausal [amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate
             age group, and without other known or suspected cause] or have been sterilized
             surgically [ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral
             oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing]) who:

               -  Had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days before study entry and who do
                  not agree to use a highly effective method of contraception (eg, true abstinence
                  if it is their preferred and usual lifestyle [defined as refraining from
                  heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the
                  study treatments], an intrauterine device, a contraceptive implant, an oral
                  contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia)

               -  Are using hormonal contraceptives but are not on a stable dose of the same
                  hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before dosing and who do not
                  agree to use the same contraceptive during the study or for 6 months after study
                  drug discontinuation.

          -  Males who have not had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and
             their female partners do not meet the criteria above (ie, not of childbearing
             potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period or
             for 6 months after study drug discontinuation)
