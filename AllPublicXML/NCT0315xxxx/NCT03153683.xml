  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective open enrollment registry to evaluate arterial blood and thrombus
      removed during the standard thrombectomy procedure, which will then be used for the purposes
      of identifying biological markers, inflammatory cell infiltrates, and biological states in
      large vessel occlusive stroke in the human condition. The primary objectives are to evaluate
      the feasibility of obtaining distal clot blood during thrombectomy; develop a group of
      biosamples (blood and clots) to evaluate novel proteins, cell types, and cytokines in acute
      ischemic stroke in the human condition, and evaluate specific biomarkers, proteins, and
      leukocyte populations in stroke in the human condition. The study population will include up
      to 250 subjects. Male and female participants 18 years of age and older will be enrolled.
      Participants must have had a suspected acute ischemic stroke based on clinical and
      radiographic evidence as determined and documented by the Stroke Neurology team at University
      of Kentucky. There is no therapeutic intervention involved in this study.

      This is the first study to our knowledge that will utilize thrombectomy technique to collect
      focal blood samples and the clot related brain infarction. This proposal will provide
      preliminary data needed to understand relationships between the local inflammatory cascade
      and clinical variables such as age, gender, time from symptoms to thrombectomy, and stroke
      imaging results. Characterizing these relationships is vital in the formulation of related
      therapeutics. Issues of gender-differences, age-based variations, and co-morbidities all
      engender heterogeneity, which plague translation of stroke research from animal to human. By
      starting with the human condition, the investigators aim to minimize this loss in
      translation. Overall, this study will have a great impact on our knowledge of stroke
      pathology. In essence, this could fundamentally change not only how the investigators develop
      treatment strategies for the stroke patient population but allow us to individualize the
      treatment dependent on time after stroke, age, sex, and co-morbidities. Molecular techniques
      that are impractical when delivered systemically could be delivered locally to impede the
      early inflammation.

      This study represents the first time that clot and blood will be evaluated for the markers,
      proteins, and cytokines listed in the protocol in human subjects undergoing thrombectomy for
      emergent large vessel occlusion stroke. The study is an open, unblinded, clinical and
      biologic registry to evaluate specific questions that are novel to understanding stroke in
      the human condition. There is no therapeutic intervention involved in this study. The study
      population will include up to 250 subjects enrolled at the University of Kentucky. The
      primary endpoints of the study will be evaluation of specific proteins and leukocyte
      populations in the human stroke clot and blood. Secondary endpoints include: Acid/Base
      Balance: Evaluate pH of blood as a marker of acid/base balance in distal blood and proximal
      blood, and correlate to interval of time between Last Known Normal and vessel recanalization;
      Inpatient Biomarker; Protein, RNA, expression with Clinical Correlation.

      Participants will be recruited from patients evaluated at University of Kentucky Chandler
      Hospital for acute ischemic stroke. Participants with impaired capacity may be included as
      the pathology to be studied (stroke) may impair their capacity.

      The study events occur during the acute hospitalization for the subject's condition (acute
      ischemic stroke).

      Baseline (Day 0):

        -  Verify inclusion/exclusion criteria

        -  The patient or the Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) will be consented within 24
           hours following the standard of care thrombectomy procedure.

        -  Medical history taken from medical record, participant and family to determine
           eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion criteria (Standard of Care)

        -  Medication history (Standard of Care)

        -  Baseline physical examination to include vital signs (Standard of Care)

        -  Premorbid Modified Ranking Score (mRS)

        -  NIH Stroke Scale (Standard of Care)

        -  BMI (Body Mass Index) (Standard of Care)

        -  Obtain consent from the patient or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR)

        -  Cerebral angiogram with Endovascular Thrombectomy (Standard of Care)

        -  Study Specimen Collection as detailed below

      Datapoints recorded will include the vessel location of the thrombus and time from Last Known
      Normal to vessel recanalization, along with TICI (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction) score.

      Study Specimen Collection

        1. Once a subject is determined by clinical staff to require thrombectomy, the thrombectomy
           pager will be activated. Since potential subjects arrive at any time of day,
           approximately 10 researchers will share call responsibilities. Once paged, the on-call
           researcher will attend the thrombectomy procedure.

        2. During the procedure, the neurointerventionalist will retain three samples, which are
           removed during the thrombectomy procedure:

      1. 1 cc of blood obtained from the microcatheter distal to the clot prior to thrombectomy
      (see Figure 1) 2. The thrombus itself (normally discarded) 3. 5 cc of whole blood from
      arterial guide catheter placed for the thrombectomy procedure. This represents a small amount
      of the blood typically removed/lost during the suction aspiration performed at the guide
      catheter. No separate venipuncture or arterial puncture will be necessary.

      3. The on-call researcher will retrieve the blood samples and thrombus. The samples will be
      collected, processed, and aliquoted by the researcher in a manner that will not delay or slow
      the thrombectomy procedure. In addition to the samples, a separate researcher will enter
      clinical data points on each subject into a REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture)
      database.

      All endpoints listed below are standard of care for followup after thrombectomy.

      The following clinical endpoints will be captured:

        1. Date of Birth

        2. Age at enrollment

        3. Gender

        4. Race/ethnicity

        5. Height

        6. Weight

        7. Body Mass Index (BMI)

        8. Premorbid Modified Rankin Score (mRS)

        9. Location of the thrombus (e.g. M1 segment of middle cerebral artery) and source of the
           thrombus (cardioembolic, intracranial stenosis, dissection, carotid occlusion,
           infection, unknown).

       10. Presence of tandem occlusion of the cervical artery proximal to the thrombus

       11. Time from last known normal to thrombectomy completion (reopening of the vessel)

       12. Thrombectomy success as rated by TICI score

       13. NIH Stroke Scale prior to discharge

       14. Modified Rankin Score (mRS): premorbid, discharge, 90 days (Standard of Care)

       15. Mini-Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Mini-MoCA) or similar cognitive scale prior to
           discharge (Standard of Care)

       16. Medical comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia

       17. Volume of infarct

       18. Significant intracranial hemorrhage (defined as intracranial hemorrhage resulting in
           4-point increase in NIH Stroke Scale or requiring surgical intervention)

       19. Petechial hemorrhages.

       20. Proximal (systemic) blood (pH - potential of hydrogen/acidity or basicity, pCO2 - carbon
           dioxide partial pressure, pO2 - oxygen partial pressure, pHCO3 - bicarbonate partial
           pressure, Na - sodium, K - potassium, Ca - Calcium)

       21. Distal blood (pH, pCO2, pO2, pHCO3, Na, K, Ca)

       22. Concomitant medications

      Visit 1 (Within 48 hours)

      MRI or CT is performed typically within 48 hours after thrombectomy as standard of care.
      Radiographic endpoints that will be captured include:

        1. Volume of infarct

        2. Significant intracranial hemorrhage (defined as intracranial hemorrhage resulting in
           4-point increase in NIH Stroke Scale or requiring surgical intervention)

        3. Petechial hemorrhages.

      For the purposes of this study, the central clinical endpoint will be time from Last Known
      Normal to thrombectomy completion. The other data points will be captured for exploratory
      purposes as correlations and associations with immune cell and cytokine levels may lead to
      future studies beyond the scope of this grant.

      Laboratory Procedures/Evaluations The three biospecimen samples described will be banked, and
      may be used for pH analysis and electrolyte analysis, serum biomarker analysis, protein and
      RNA levels, and leukocyte populations. These analyses may be correlated to clinical factors
      including but not limited to age/gender, interval from Last Known Normal, location of the
      thrombus, medical co-morbidities, and source of the thrombus.
