    <textblock>
      Although it is now recognized that a variety of respiratory abnormalities, such as
      diaphragmatic dysfunction, can be present in primary hypothyroidism and reverse with adequate
      hormone treatment, the role of thyroid hormone replacement therapy on respiratory system in
      patients with the nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) remains to be clarified. The NTIS has
      been found to be an independent risk factor for prolonged (&gt; 13 days) mechanical ventilation.
      It is unclear, however, whether the NTIS is only a biochemical prognostic marker or it
      actually contributes to the development and progression of respiratory failure.

      The aim of this study will be to assess respiratory muscle function after thyroid hormone
      substitution therapy in mechanically ventilated patients with the NTIS.
