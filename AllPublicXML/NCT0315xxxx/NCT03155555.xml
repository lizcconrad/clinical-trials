  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether carotid Doppler peak systolic velocity can
      be an easy to measure possible surrogate for echocardiographic measurement of aortic peak
      systolic velocity variation which is an index of fluid responsiveness in mechanically
      ventilated children intra-operatively.
