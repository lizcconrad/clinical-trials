  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of nutritional supplement on bone turnover markers (which are
      sensitive and respond quickly to nutrition or drug intervention) in Indian healthy
      premenopausal women after 6 months of intervention.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double blind, single-center, randomized-controlled trial testing the effect of
      fortified beverage on bone turnover markers as compared to placebo control in 25-45 years old
      premenopausal women. The study will consist of two groups: Group 1 (Test) - Protein rich
      beverage powder fortified with MMN and Group 2 (control) - Low protein non-fortified
      iso-caloric beverage powder.
