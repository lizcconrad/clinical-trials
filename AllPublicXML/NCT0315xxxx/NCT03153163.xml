  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase I study of single-agent trastuzumab emtansine administered by
      intravenous (IV) infusion. The study will characterize the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab
      emtansine and its relevant analytes and the safety of trastuzumab emtansine in Chinese
      participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive locally
      advanced/metastatic breast cancer (LA/MBC).

             3 + and/or gene amplified [HER2 to CEP 17 ratio ≥ 2] by in situ hybridization [ISH])
             through use of archival paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. Both IHC and ISH assays will
             be performed; however, only one positive result from either method is required for
             eligibility
