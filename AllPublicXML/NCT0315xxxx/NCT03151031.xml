  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will determine the effect of cryotherapy applied to the knee joint
      on static and dynamic standing balance. It is hypothesized that there will be no change in
      dynamic postural stability after cryotherapy application.Twenty four individuals (age 18 to
      30) participated in the study. They will be randomly divided into two groups, experimental
      and control group. Each participant, in the experimental group will be asked to perform star
      excursion balance test (SEBT) under two conditions, before and after the application of
      cryotherapy. The participants will receive ice pack wrapping of the knee for 10 minutes. The
      control group performed SEBT at room temperature in an interval of 10 minutes. The two group
      will be analysed and compared

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cooling procedure for the knee joint was initiated by using a cryopack or cold-pack. On
      completion of the initial SEBT, the participant lied supine and the investigator applied the
      cryotherapy for 10 minutes. After the 10 minute period of cryotherapy, the cryopack was
      removed, and the participants performed SEBT for the second time.
