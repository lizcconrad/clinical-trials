  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among behavioral cognitive psychotherapies, new &quot;Mindfulness&quot; interventions allow patient to
      identify, pay attention and accept external (sensory stimuli) and internal (cognition and
      emotions) phenomena. This &quot;to do with&quot; training has yielded promising results in stress
      management, prevention of depressive relapse, management of craving and an increase in
      self-efficacy. Few studies (none in France) have attempted to measure the efficacy of this
      technique on alcohol relapse, in particular by comparing it with a usual management strategy
      (conventional relapse prevention therapy).

      The main objective of this study is to compare the efficacy on alcoholic relapse (measured in
      the &quot;first glass&quot; consumed), from a Mindfulness therapeutic program to a conventional Relapse
      Prevention program. Secondary objectives are to demonstrate the efficacy of this program on
      craving, self-efficacy, and secondary endpoints of relapse (massive alcoholism, number of
      alcoholisation days).

      Each patient will perform 12 psychotherapeutic sessions (Mindfulness or Relapse Prevention)
      over a period of 6 weeks. Patients will be evaluated by a practitioner different from the
      practitioner who makes the psychotherapeutic management.

      Patients will be assessed at inclusion (Initial visit), after the 12 sessions of management
      (M0), 1 month (M1), 2 month (M2), 3 month (M3), 4 month (M4), 5 month (M5), 6 month (M6),
