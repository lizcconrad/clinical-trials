      Assess if the use of SYNRINSE can improve short-term subjective and objective outcome
      measures after one week in patients with active Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) who have had
      prior sinus surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SYNRINSE is osmotically balanced and also contains soluble chitosan-argininamide, a modified
      natural glycopolymer that has a number of properties important to relieving the symptoms of
      mucus build up and bacterial biofilms. First, SYNRINSE reduces the viscosity of biofilms, the
      protective environment of infective bacteria that prevents topical antibiotics and other
      rinses to penetrate to reach the bacterial. By disrupting biofilms, SYNRINSE allows them to
      be cleared from the sinuses. Second, SYNRINSE has been shown to interact with the polymers
      comprise mucus, loosening thick, sticky layers and reducing their ability to adhere together
      and to mucosal surfaces. Third, all of the components in SYNRINSE are biocompatible and
      soothing to sensitive nasal cavities.

    <description>The first 10 non-CF subjects will be instructed to once daily irrigate both nasal passages with SynRinse (supplied) delivered via nasal irrigation using the NeilMed® Sinus Rinse™ system for 1 week. No prescription is necessary. The subjects will be asked to refrain from performing any sinus irrigations during the test treatment period with any product including saline.
The second set of 10 non-CF subjects (if the study continues to this point) will be instructed to irrigate both nasal passages twice daily (rather than once daily) for one week with SynRinse (supplied). The subjects will be asked to refrain from performing any sinus irrigations during the test treatment period with any product including saline.</description>
