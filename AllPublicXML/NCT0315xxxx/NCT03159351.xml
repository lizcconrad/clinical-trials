  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aims to assess the
      effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation(rTMS) in treating depression
      after basal ganglia ischemic stroke and to examine whether such effects are related to
      restoration of white matter integrity.Sixty-six participants will be recruited from three
      centers and randomized with a 1:1 ratio to receive active rTMS treatment or sham rTMS
      treatment in addition to routine supportive treatments.The data of neuropsychological tests
      and MRI will be collected at 0, 2 and 4 weeks after the commencement of the treatment.

      data of neuropsychological tests and MRI will be collected at 0, 2 and 4 weeks after the
      commencement of the treatment.The primary outcome is the measurement of 24-item Hamilton
      Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-24) scores, and the secondary outcomes include diffusion tensor
      imaging (DTI) results and the results of neuropsychological tests including National
      Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLs), Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA),Clinical Global Impressions scales(CGI), Aphasia Battery in
      Chinese (ABC), Social Support Revalued Scale (SSRS) and Medical Coping Questionnaire (MCMQ).
