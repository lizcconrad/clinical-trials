  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of preoperative high-intensity inspiratory muscle training
      (IMThi) before cardiac surgery on perioperative inflammatory response. Half participants will
      receive high intensity inspiratory muscle training and the others a sham inspiratory muscle
      therapy.
