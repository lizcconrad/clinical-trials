    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how family caregivers of ICU patients perceive
      their psycho-social needs and quality of life, how they use music in their everyday life and
      perceive music as beneficial to themselves. Participants are adult family members of
      critically ill patients in ICU. After obtaining the informed consent form, a questionnaire
      will be distributed to each participant.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate how family caregivers of ICU patients perceive
      their psycho-social needs and quality of life, how they use music in their everyday life and
      perceive music as beneficial to themselves. Participants are adult family members of
      critically ill patients in ICU. After obtaining the informed consent form, a questionnaire
      will be distributed to each participant. The questionnaire consists of Beck Depression Index,
      Quality of Life scale, and the self-reported items on music use in everyday lives and
      perceived benefits of music. Based on the completed measures, how caregivers of ICU patients
      use music and perceive music as beneficial media for their psycho-social health will be
      analyzed in relation to demographic information and the current level of depression and
      quality of life.
