  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, open-label study in healthy male and non-pregnant, non-lactating
      females. The study will consist of up to 2 parts; the decision to proceed to the optional
      second part will be made following review of Part 1 data.

      Part 1 is a single dose, two period crossover to assess food affect of oral BTD-001.

      Optional Part 2 is a non-randomised, single arm study multi dose design to evaluate PK
      profile of BTD-001
