  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is is looking at the effect of the dietary supplement &quot;Nicotinamide
      mononucleotide&quot; (NMN) on key cardiovascular and metabolic functions, specifically those that
      are important risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, the
      investigators will evaluate the effect of NMN on how well (a) the hormone insulin works to
      control blood sugar, (b) the body produces insulin, and (c) blood vessels dilate (get wider).
      The investigators will also look at the effects of NMN on blood lipids; body fat and liver
      fat; and other blood, fat tissue and muscle tissue markers of cardiovascular (heart) and
      metabolic health. Data from studies conducted in rodents have shown that NMN supplementation
      has beneficial effects on cardiovascular and metabolic health, but this has not yet been
      studied in people.
