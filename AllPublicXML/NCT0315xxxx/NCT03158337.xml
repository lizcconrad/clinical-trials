  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While it is well established that physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for
      vascular disease and cognitive decline, the mechanism by which exercise exerts its protective
      effect on the cerebral circulation and cognition is unknown. This knowledge gap was
      recognized recently in the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention and the Alzheimer's
      Association document &quot;National Public Health Road Map to Maintaining Cognitive Health&quot;. Our
      rationale for these studies is that the identification of physical exercise as a lifestyle
      factor able to improve cerebrovascular reserve and cognition would establish a strong
      scientific framework justifying design of a randomized clinical trial that could evaluate the
      role of physical activity in cerebrovascular health and function.

      This research is based on data we obtained from a cross-sectional study that showed
      significant relations between physical fitness, vascular regulation and cognition.
      Cerebrovascular reserve and cognition were better maintained in women who were physically
      active but reduced in women who were sedentary. Our central hypothesis is that regular
      aerobic exercise mitigates age-related decreases in cerebrovascular reserve, which in turn
      imparts benefits in cognition. Further, we believe that these effects will persist after the
      structured aerobic exercise program is terminated.

      Our 18 month study began with a 6-month baseline period, followed by a 6-month exercise
      intervention, and a 6-month follow-up period. In addition, there are 5-year and 10-year
      follow-up periods. Volunteers (men and women aged â‰¥ 55 years) from the community were
      recruited using a variety of recruitment methods including media and distribution lists.
      After the baseline (pre-training) measurements, participants underwent a six-month aerobic
      training program, following guidelines previously used by us and according to the new
      exercise guidelines for older adults established by American College of Sports Medicine and
      the American Heart Association. The study involves comprehensive assessments of physical
      fitness, cerebrovascular responses to carbon dioxide at rest and during sub-maximal exercise,
      and an extensive battery of cognitive function tests.

    <description>Participants took part in a supervised 6-month long aerobic (walk/jog) training program held 3 days/week. Each session included a 5-min warm-up, 20-40 min of aerobic exercise (walking, jogging), 5-min cool-down, and stretching. Exercise prescriptions follow current principles and guidelines established by ACSM/AHA, including sufficient warm-up, cooldown, and ongoing provision of safety precautions/exercise tips. As participants progress, the duration of aerobic exercise increased from 20 (month 1) to 30 (months 2-3) and 40 min (months 4-6), with proportional increases to warm-up and cool-down periods. Exercise intensity is based on individual maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max), measured at baseline. Intensity builds from 30-45% (months 1-3) to mitigate the risk of injury and will progress to 60-70% (months 4-6) heart rate reserve (HRR).</description>
