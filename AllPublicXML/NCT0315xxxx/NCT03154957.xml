  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The analysis of professional practices in the emergency department of the Strasbourg CHRU in
      the management of acute shoulder dislocations aims at proposing a clinical pathway of
      synthesis taking into account current practices and data from the literature. Thus, the
      objectives are twofold: first standardize care in emergency rooms and try to improve the weak
      points of this care.The Investigators will concentrate thier observation work on the
      medicinal analgesic methods proposed to these patients in order to minimize the pain induced
      by the external reduction maneuvers performed, in the majority of cases, in the emergencies.
      This work will ultimately have a real clinical impact on the management of these traumatized
      patients
