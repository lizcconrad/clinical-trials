      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of IdeS in patients with severe anti-GBM
      (Glomerular Basement Membrane) disease receiving standard care consisting of
      pulse-methylprednisolone, oral prednisolone and intravenous cyclophosphamide combined with
      plasma exchange (PLEX).

      This is an Open-Label Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of IdeS in anti-GBM
      disease (Goodpasture's disease, i.e. GP) with Adverse Renal Prognosis. The primary efficacy
      objective is to evaluate the efficacy of an IdeS based regimen to salvage independent renal
      function measured as no need for dialysis at 6 months after IdeS treatment. The primary
      safety objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IdeS in patients
      with severe anti-GBM disease on background of standard care consisting of
      pulse-methylprednisolone, oral prednisolone and intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC) combined
      with plasma exchange (PLEX). The patients will be followed during 6 months according to the
      study visit plan.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Anti-GBM antibodies detected by ELISA above a level that is considered toxic by the
             investigator using local laboratory. Patients double-positive for anti-GBM and ANCA
             may be entered in the trial, but only if their level of anti-GBM antibodies fulfil the
             criteria listed above.

          2. eGFR &lt; 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 (by MDRD equation) or if the patient is non-responsive to
             standard treatment, and has lost &gt;15 ml/min/1.73 m2 after start of treatment

          3. Haematuria on dipstick and/or urinary sediment

          4. Male or female patients aged at least 18 years; Female patients of childbearing

          6. Judged to be otherwise healthy by the Investigator, based on medical history, physical
             examination, and clinical laboratory assessments. Patients with clinical laboratory
             values that are outside of normal limits (other than those specified in the Exclusion
             Criteria) and/or with other abnormal clinical findings that are judged by the
             Investigator not to be of clinical significance, may be entered into the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Anuria for more than 2 days (less than 200 ml during last 48 hours);

          2. Dialysis dependency for more than 5 days (maximum 3 sessions before signing informed
             consent);

          3. Ongoing moderate to severe pulmonary haemorrhage (or having ceased within the last two
             weeks), defined as requiring assisted ventilation, oxygen or blood transfusions.

          4. Pregnancy.

          5. Symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA class 2-4) and requiring prescription
             medication or clinically evident peripheral edema of cardiac origin;

          6. Myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stroke within 3 months prior to screening;

          7. Ongoing bacterial infection requiring antibiotic therapy or viral infection with
             Hepatitis B, C or HIV (up to 3 months old negative test results are accepted); or
             active tuberculosis as indicated by chest x-ray.

          8. Patients should not have received investigational drugs within 30 days prior to
             screening or within 4 half-lives (whichever is longer); and

          9. History or presence of any medical condition or disease which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may place the subject at unacceptable risk for study participation.
