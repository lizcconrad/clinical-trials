    <textblock>
      According to recent studies, we want to find evidences that infant colics could be a episodic
      symptom associated to migraine as cyclic vomiting syndrome or abdominal migraine are. The
      main purpose is to compare the presence of colics in infants between 60 days and 180 days of
      life and the presence of migraine in their parents to determine if colicky children's parents
      are more migrainous than other parents.

      Recent studies shows that :

        -  Infants with colics have more probability to become migrainous when they will grow up

        -  Migrainous children have more colic history in their past

        -  Migrainous parents have more babies with colics than non-migrainous parents

      According to these studies, we want to find othen evidences that infant colics could be a
      migraine equivalent as cyclic vomiting syndrome or abdominal migraine are. Recently, the
      international classification of headache disease IIIbeta added in its appendix colics in the
      episodic symptoms associated to migraine

      The main purpose of our study in the pediatric emergency unit of Nancy is to compare the
      presence of colics in infants and the presence of migraine in their parents to determine if
      colicky children's parents are more migrainous than other parents. The data collection will
      be made thanks to a survey which will be completed by the parents.
