    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study focus on characterizing the relationship between atomoxetine
      exposure and clinical outcomes, as assessed by standardized measures. We will also
      simultaneously monitor side effect of atomoxetine, another measure of clinical outcomes, and
      categorize study participants on their ability to tolerate atomoxetine.
