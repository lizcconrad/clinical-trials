  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding has a fundamental impact on the short-, medium- and long-term health of
      children and has an important impact on women's health. Breastfeeding protects against
      gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses and is associated with better cognitive
      development in childhood, particularly in preterm infants. Despite these potential benefits,
      preterm infants experience lower rates of breastfeeding initiation and continuation compared
      to term infants.

      The use of breastfeeding peer support initiatives, in which advice is given by experienced
      and trained peer counselors, is an effective way to promote and support breastfeeding,
      regardless of a woman's socioeconomic status. Several small studies have shown that
      breastfeeding peer support initiatives were effective for preterm infants and that this
      efficacy was increased by the co-intervention of lactation consultants.

      The purpose of this study is to develop and to evaluate the effectiveness of a breastfeeding
      support program among mother-preterm infant dyads in Europe, by evaluating the impact of the
      intervention on 1) breastfeeding rates, 2) morbidity and mortality during the
      hospitalization, 3) children's cognitive development and behavior 4) mothers' mental health,
      4) costs benefits.

      The breastfeeding support program will include peer counselors under the supervision of
      lactation consultants. Breastfeeding counselors will be voluntary mothers who have had a
      positive breastfeeding experience with at least one preterm infant. After a training course,
      they will meet the future or new mothers by face-to-face and share their experiences at least
      once a week during hospitalization and provide phone support up to 1 month after discharge
      from hospital.

      The study design will be a stepped wedge cluster trial conducted in 8 NICU in Europe (France,
      Switzerland and Belgium). Infants and mothers will be followed up from the time of
      hospitalization in the maternity and NICU up to 6 months after the discharge. The cost
      analysis will be performed in a subgroup of mother-preterm infant dyads that will be followed
      up at 24-months after their discharge
