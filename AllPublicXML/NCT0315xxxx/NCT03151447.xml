    <description>In patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer, stereotactic body radiation therapy will be combined with anti-PD-1 antibody.

             epidural anesthesia must have been completed for at least 72 hours and the patients
             have recovered from these surgeries. Skin biopsy that needs local anesthesia must have
             been completed for at least 1 hour.

               5. AST ≤2.5×ULN, ALT ≤2.5×ULN; both ALT and AST ≤5×ULN if there are liver metastasis

               6. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN (except for patients with Gilbert syndrome, the total
                  bilirubin of those patients must be &lt;51.3μmol/L)

          -  Prior traditional Chinese medicine therapy with antitumor activity within past 2
             weeks;

          -  Prior therapy with monoclonal antibodies within past 3 months (except for locally
             administration);

          -  History of other malignant tumors. (Except for non-melanoma skin cancer and the
             following carcinomas in situ: bladder, stomach, colon, endometrium, cervical /
             dysplasia, melanoma or breast cancer). Patients who have obtained complete response

             be included;

          -  Underlying medical conditions, according to the investigator, that would increase the
             risks of study drug administration or obscure the interpretation of adverse events;
