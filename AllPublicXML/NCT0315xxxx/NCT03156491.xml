    <textblock>
      Background of the study:

      The etiology of recurrent miscarriage (RM, defined as three or more consecutive miscarriages
      without any proven maternal or fetal cause), remains undiagnosed in more than 50% of cases.
      In these cases it is generally considered that a disturbance in the normal mother-embryo
      interactions is a causal factor. This disturbance may be based on a dysregulation of embryo
      invasiveness and/or decidual acceptance (e.g. altered decidualization; endometrial changes in
      preparation for the acceptance of a putative pregnancy). Moreover, dysfunctional maternal
      immune regulatory natural killer (NK) cells, implicated in tolerance induction and
      trophoblast invasion,may also underlie the occurrence of RM. The Selection Failure hypothesis
      for RM suggests that super-receptive endometrium (possibly due to increased embryo
      invasiveness and/or decidual acceptance and/or dysregulated immune cell function) may allow
      'poor quality' embryos to implant and present as a clinical pregnancy before miscarrying.
      Fundamental knowledge on mechanisms of embryo implantation, decidual function and maternal
      immune reactivity in successful pregnancies has accumulated over the past 5 years. This study
      aims to investigate whether dysregulation of (one of) these mechanisms may underlie RM.

      Objective of the study:

      To test The Selection Failure hypothesis by assessing A) the degree of embryo invasiveness
      and decidual acceptance (the quality of decidualization, endometrium-embryo communication and
      endometrial stromal cell (ESC) migration) and B) the angiogenic capacity of decidual NK (dNK)
      cells, in order to elucidate the pattern of the mother-embryo equilibrium in women with RM.
