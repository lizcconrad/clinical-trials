      This study will be conducted on women in labor. Fetal heart rate monitoring will be
      conducting using the Novii Fetal ECG/EMG system and comparing it to current standard of care
      external fetal heart rate and tocometry. These approaches will be compared with the respect
      to need for additional monitoring, amount of nursing intervention, cost and satisfaction of
      patients and healthcare providers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interpretation of fetal heart rate monitoring during labor is one of the most common
      procedures performed in the practice of obstetrics. Continuous monitoring of the fetal heart
      rate is used to identify infants at risk for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and allow for
      intervention to prevent this terrible complication. The quality of the fetal heart rate
      signal is critical for appropriate interpretation of the characteristics that identify risk.

      This is a prospective, randomized pragmatic trial comparing the Novii Fetal ECG/EMG system to
      external fetal heart rate and tocometry (standard of care) for the amount of time of
      interpretable fetal heart rate during labor. Randomization will occur in blocks based on BMI
      to control for the potential effect of BMI.

      Fetal heart rate tracings from both groups of women will be reviewed in a blinded fashion by
      experienced Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) physicians who will assess the tracing for quality
      and interpretability. In addition, both approaches will be compared with respect to the need
      for additional monitoring modalities, amount of nursing intervention, cost and satisfaction
      of the patients and healthcare providers.

    <intervention_model_description>Women will be randomized to either standard monitoring with external Doppler and tocodynamometer or monitoring with the Novii Fetal ECG/EMG system using a computer generated randomization scheme through REDCap. Randomization will occur in blocks based on the subject's BMI. Women with a BMI &lt; 30 will be randomized separate from women with a BMI &gt; 30.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Amount of time in minutes with the interpretable fetal heart rate tracing during the course of labor.</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of randomization until time of delivery (up to 48 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of the fetal heart rate for each minute of tracing will be assessed visually by 2 or more blinded reviewers. For the purpose of this study, uninterpretable fetal heart rate will be defined as continuous fetal heart rate data with one or more of the following:
Data is missing for more than 75% of the minute of tracing
Artifact is present for more than 25% of the minute of tracing
Missing data or artifact prevents determination of baseline rate
&gt; 15 seconds of continuous missing tracing
Missing data is not continuous but is sufficiently frequent that the one minute segment of tracing could not be used to determine baseline rate
The total number of interpretable minutes of fetal heart tracing and the percentage of time with interpretable fetal heart tracing over the course of labor (Number of minutes with interpretable FHR/Total number of minutes in labor) will be calculated for each patient.</description>

    <time_frame>Time of randomization until time of delivery (up to 48 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>a. Each 10 minute segment will be deemed to be interpretable if it meets all of the following criteria: i. Sufficient data are available to determine a baseline ii. Sufficient data are available to determine the variability of the tracing iii. Sufficient data are available to identify periodic changes in the tracing (e.g. accelerations, decelerations, etc) b. For each 10 minute segment that is called Uninterpretable, the reviewer will indicate the reason for this designation by selecting one of the following options: i. Poor signal quality due to missing data ii. Poor signal quality due to artifact iii. Adequate signal quality but intrinsic fetal heart rate makes interpretation impossible (e.g. marked variability, etc.)</description>
