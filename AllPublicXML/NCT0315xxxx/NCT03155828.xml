    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with
      continuous positive airway pressure in women with both OSA and polycystic ovarian syndrome
      will improve the regularity of the women's menstrual cycles.

      Women seeking fertility treatment at the University of Louisville will be screened for
      polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) based on history and then blood work if history suggests
      PCOS. After establishing a diagnosis of PCOS based on the National Institute of Health
      criteria, they will be screened for impaired glucose tolerance, Class III obesity, and
      obstructive sleep apnea [using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) as the initial screen]. For
      those women that screen positive on the ESS, they will be referred to the University of
      Louisville Physicians Sleep Center for a formal sleep study. Only patients with PCOS, severe
      obstructive sleep apnea, impaired glucose tolerance, and Class III obesity will qualify for
      enrollment in the study. Once enrolled, patients will be encouraged to use continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP, standard of care for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea)
      for at least six months. During those six months, patients will be asked to track their
      menstrual cycles and whether they took progesterone to induce a withdrawal bleed during that
      time period. The use of ovulation predictor kits to help determine ovulation status will be
      encouraged, but not required for the study.

      During initial evaluation, patients seeking fertility care having a clinical presentation
      concerning for PCOS have their blood drawn for evaluation of thyroid stimulating hormone,
      free and total testosterone, antimullerian hormone, and 2 hour glucose tolerance test. At the
      conclusion of six months of CPAP therapy, patients will be asked to repeat the above blood
      tests for comparison to baseline values.

      Women can continue to attempt pregnancy during the study time period if they desire.
