  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several observational studies have shown improvement in episodic migraine with the use of
      greater occipital nerve block as an acute therapy, and a recent placebo controlled trial did
      not show a decrease in frequency of episodic or chronic migraine; however, there has never
      been a placebo controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of GONB as an acute treatment for
      headache, and there has been no determination of guidelines for selection of patients who
      would be most likely to respond to GONB. In light of the above, the investigators propose a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial examining the use of GONB with
      lidocaine/bupivocaine in patients with an acute episodic migraine. The results of this trial
      are expected to guide more appropriate therapeutic management of these participants and the
      optimal use of this procedure. 50 subjects will be entered into this study. This study is
      being conducted at Thomas Jefferson University only.
