  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have mandibular deformity and will undergo bilateral sagittal split osteotomy
      will be included in the study.One side of the osteotomies randomly will be considered as
      study group and another side as a control group.In the study group , platelet rich fibrin
      will be placed after osteotomy and before rigid fixation.In the control group, fixation will
      be done without Platelet-rich Fibrin (PRF).Neurosensory disturbance will be evaluated 6 and
      12 months after surgeries.

      Patients who have mandibular deformity and will undergo bilateral sagittal split osteotomy
      will be included in the study.One side of the osteotomies randomly will be considered as
      study group and another side as a control group.In the study group , platelet rich fibrin
      will be placed after osteotomy and before rigid fixation.In the control group fixation will
      be done without Platelet-rich Fibrin. Before starting the surgical procedure, 20 mL of venous
      blood will take and placed in a centrifuge for 12 minutes with 28000rpm. After
      centrifugation, the cap will be removed from each tube and they will be placed into a sterile
      rack L-PRF™. Fibrin matrix will prepare. The L-PRF™ will be removed from the tube. Then, the
      clot right beneath the red blood cell clot will be placed on the surface tray and covered.
      Five minutes will be waited before removing and using the fibrin matrix.Neurosensory
      disturbance will be evaluated in 6 and 12 months after osteotomies by two-point
      discrimination (TPD) test and pin tactile discrimination(PTD) tests.
