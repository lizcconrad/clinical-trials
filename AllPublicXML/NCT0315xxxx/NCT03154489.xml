  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interdisciplinary collaboration between doctors, nurses and pharmacists, can facilitate
      the control of patients under treatment with coumarin anticoagulants, increasing their safety
      and effectiveness. On the other hand, the clinical utility of tools such as pharmacogenetics
      and the SAME-TT2R2 is unexplored. Based on the foregoing, it seems necessary to study the
      impact of the Program of medication review with follow-up in collaboration with doctors and
      nurses in primary care improves the degree of control of the patients under treatment with
      coumarin anticoagulants. Method: a randomized, controlled study for the main objective.
      Population and scope of study: Patients on treatment with coumarin anticoagulants with time
      in therapeutic range (TTR) according to the method of Rosendaal less than 70% in follow-up
      from primary care in a health area of the Arrabal Health Center (Zaragoza, Spain). Each
      patient will be followed by a period of 6 months. After this period, patients in the control
      group (CG) will receive the service of medication review with follow-up for a period of time
      equivalent (6 months). Intervention: Program of pharmacotherapy follow-up. Variables result:
      Stability of the INR, drug adherence, intake of vitamin K, knowledge of the patient on the
      use of acenocoumarol, associated costs, avoided costs, quality of life, satisfaction of
      patients and professionals involved. Statistical analysis and sample size: 204 patients.
      Multivariate analysis will be used and cost-effectiveness..

    <description>Analyze the clinical utility of the incorporation of additional tools like pharmacogenetic analysis of this four genes (CYP2C9 and VKORC1, ApoE CYP4F2) for clinical decision-making in patients with unstable INR. Thanks to the bibliography is known that these gene affect the individual variability of each patient to the acenocoumarol so is going to be studying patients pharmacogenetics for this four genes.</description>

    <description>Evaluate the effect of specific pharmaceutical interventions (medication review with follow-up) aimed at patients in treatment with coumarin anticoagulants within the framework of medication review with follow-up. The economic outcome is going to be assess by following patients if they have admissions in hospital due to bad INR control or they need some extra visits to doctor. This cost a lot to Health System and if it can be avoided it would save costs.</description>
