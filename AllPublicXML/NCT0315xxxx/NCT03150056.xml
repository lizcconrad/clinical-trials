  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the combination of GSK525762 with other agents that have been
      shown to be effective in the treatment of CRPC or metastatic CRPC, including approved agents
      (e.g., abiraterone, enzalutamide) as well as investigational agents for mCRPC that have
      proven to show efficacy and can be combined based on complimentary mechanism of action. As a
      first step, the combination of GSK525762 will be evaluated as a combination with abiraterone
      or enzalutamide in men with metastatic or advanced castrate-resistant prostate cancer who
      have progressed on at least one line of prior androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapy. This
      study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose
      (RP2D) based on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy profiles of GSK525762 in
      combination with either abiraterone (Arm A) or enzalutamide (Arm B). Arm A and Arm B will
      further have 2 cohorts: A1, A2 and B1, B2 respectively based on prior lines of therapy (L2
      [chemo-naive subjects treated with a second androgen-deprivation therapy] and Lx [subjects
      treated with both prior androgen-deprivation therapy and chemotherapy]). During dose
      escalation, both the treatment arms (A and B) will follow a modified Toxicity Probability
      Interval (mTPI) design. Approximately 130 subjects will be enrolled worldwide in this study.
      Subjects from both dose escalation and dose expansion may be combined to reach 30 subjects.
      The total duration of study will be approximately 2 to 3 years. A subject will be considered
      to have completed the study if they are followed until death.

          -  Therapeutic-dose anticoagulation (e.g., warfarin, low-molecular weight heparin [LMWH],
             or novel oral anticoagulants) must be discontinued and coagulation parameters must be
             normalized prior to the first dose of abiraterone/enzalutimide. Prophylactic
             anticoagulation, with low doses (per standard practice) of agents such as low
             molecular weight heparin (LMWH), direct thrombin inhibitors, or factor Xa inhibitors
             is permitted.

          -  Concurrent use of high dose aspirin (doses up to 81 mg oral dose daily allowed) and
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), except for where NSAIDs provide

             or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ carcinoma of the bladder, or other
             cancers for which they are treated with curative intent with no active disease in the
             3 years prior to enrollment.

          -  Subjects with known symptomatic brain metastasis are not suitable for enrolment.
             Subjects with asymptomatic, stable, treated brain metastases are eligible for study
             entry.

          -  History of seizure or any condition that may predispose subject to seizure (e.g.,
             prior cortical stroke or significant brain trauma).

          -  History of loss of consciousness or transient ischemic attack within 12 months prior
             to enrollment

             or who are currently being treated with cytochrome P450 enzyme inducing anti-epileptic
             drugs for seizures (use of anti-epileptic drugs to control pain is allowed in subjects
             not suffering from seizures unless drug is excluded due to Cytochrome P450 3A4
             induction - phenytoin, carbamazepine, Phenobarbital.

          -  Current use of a prohibited medication or planned use of any forbidden medications
             during treatment with GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide. This includes
             medications with significant risk of Torsades de pointes as well as those that are
             potent inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 enzymes or strong inhibitors of CYP2C8.

          -  Subjects with gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the
             study medication.

          -  Subjects with known bleeding diathesis will be excluded from the study.

          -  Current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or

             per investigator assessment).

          -  Initiating bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy or adjusting dose/regimen within 3
             months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Subjects on a stable bisphosphonate or denosumab

          -  Any serious known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction to GSK525762 or
             idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to the investigational drugs. Additionally,
             any known hypersensitivity to either enzalutamide, abiraterone or any excipients would
             be excluded.

          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening. Subjects with positive hepatitis C antibody due to prior resolved
             disease can be enrolled only if a confirmatory negative hepatitis C ribonucleic acid
             polymerase chain reaction is obtained.
