  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Ocrelizumab (OCR) in
      Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis patients who have been previously treated with natalizumab (NTZ)
      by evaluating relapse rate, progression on MRI and disability progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, open-label, Phase IV clinical trial. Patients with
      relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), ages 18 to 65, who have received 12 or more
      continuous infusions of NTZ, and have been free of relapses, disability worsening or Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) progression 6 months prior to the transition screening visit will be
      eligible for the study. After informed consent to participate has been obtained, the patient
      will have physical exam (PE), non-blinded Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), MRI,
      Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) and labs done for the screening visit to determine
      eligibility. Brain MRI with and without contrast will be performed with the standard MS
      protocol. MRIs will be performed with 3mm slice thickness with no gaps between slices.
      Patients will receive their first dose of OCR 4 to 6 weeks after the last dose of NTZ. Other
      baseline measures, including physical exam, EDSS, MSIS-29, and labs will be performed within
      4 weeks of screening. Physical exam, non-blinded EDSS, and labs will be performed at month 3,
      month 6, month 9, and month 12. MSIS-29 will be performed at months 6 and 12. In addition,
      MRIs will be performed at months 3, 6, and 12.
