  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuro-oncological trials may fail due to the drug never getting to the intended target (i.e.
      within the tumor micro environment). Also, changes' occurring in tumor cells when removed
      from patients and grown in-vitro is another limiting factor influencing the clinical success.

      Important questions are therefore:

        1. Does the drug get there?

        2. Does the drug do what it is intended to do?

      To improve chances of clinical success there is a need for rational and intelligent selection
      of potential drugs in future trials. This is an initiative for analyzing tumor concentration
      of preoperative administered repurposed drugs

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The subjects must fulfill all the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for
        participation in the study, unless otherwise specified:

          1. A suspected glioblastoma (based on MRI) or recurrent glioblastoma undergoing surgical
             resection.

          2. Elective surgical indication

          3. Age 18 years or older.

          4. Karnofsky performance status of 60 - 100 (see attachment 3).

          5. Not receiving another experimental treatment for glioblastoma at the moment of
             inclusion.

          6. Able to take oral medications.

          7. No known allergy to substance

          8. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL and platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL

        Exclusion Criteria:

        General

          1. Other likely diagnosis than glioblastoma based on MRI.

          2. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.

          3. Women of childbearing potential who do not have a negative pregnancy test (not older
             than 14 days) before inclusion.

          4. History of active liver disease, including chronic active hepatitis, viral hepatitis
             (hepatitis B, C and CMV), cholestatic jaundice of any etiology or toxic hepatitis or
             inadequate hepatic function, defined as baseline ASAT and ALAT &gt; 1.5 X upper
             institutional limit and/or bilirubin &gt; 1.5 X upper institutional limit.

          5. Suspected significant raised intracranial pressure or other indication for emergent
             surgery

          6. Unfit for participation for any other reason judged by the including physician.

        Specific additional exclusions criteria for disulfiram

          1. History of uncontrolled hypertension (i.e. systolic BP &gt; 180 mmHg) and a diagnosis of
             congestive heart failure

          2. History of psychiatric conditions (e.g. depression, psychosis, schizophrenia) or
             dementia.

          3. History of Wilson's disease or family member with Wilson's disease (unless excluded as
             a carrier by genetic test).

          4. History of hemochromatosis or family member with hemochromatosis (unless excluded as a
             carrier by genetic test).

          5. Nickel hypersensitivity (disulfiram mobilize nickel causing a brief increase in nickel
             concentrations before excretion. The initial increase may lead to hepatitis and
             predisposed patients).7

          6. Need for metronidazole, warfarin and/or theophylline medication (the metabolism may be
             influenced by disulfiram).

          7. Patients who are taking medications metabolized by cytochrome P450 2E1, including
             chlorzoxazone or halothane and its derivatives (phenytoin, phenobarbital,
             chlordiazepoxide, imipramine, diazepam, isoniazid, metronidazole, warfarin,
             amitriptyline within 14 days prior to the first dose of disulfiram. Of note, lorazepam
             and oxazepam are not affected by the P450 system and are not contraindicated with
             disulfiram).

          8. Addiction to alcohol or drugs. Alcohol must be avoided.

          9. Serum/plasma copper and serum ceruloplasmin outside institutional limits. a. However
             increased levels are seen together with ongoing acute phase reaction as determined by
             elevated C-reactive protein (ceruloplasmin is elevated as part of the same process) it
             is possible to retest after normalization of C-reactive protein.

        Specific additional exclusions criteria for metformin

          1. Diabetic patients or other patients where treating physician and/or anesthesiologist
             consider may have an increased risk for lactic acidosis per- and postoperatively

          2. Known renal failure, renal risk factors (including single kidney, donor kidney,
             polycystic kidneys) or estimated glomerular filtration rate below 80 ml/min.

          3. Congestive heart failure

          4. Scheduled diagnostic work-up where contrast medium containing iodine is indicated

          5. Concomitant use of NSAIDs (risk of renal injury)

          6. Risk of dehydration judged by the treating physician (e.g. when symptoms include
             vomiting)

          7. Alcohol must be avoidance during treatment (increased risk of lactic acidosis)

          8. Treatment with diuretics as they may increase risk of lactic acidosis.
