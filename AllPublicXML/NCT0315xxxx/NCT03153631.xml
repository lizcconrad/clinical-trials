      Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death

      In Egypt, cancer breast is one of the commonest cancers among females representing
      38.8%.cancer breast among females ranked the top with a high frequency in lower, middle,
      upper Egypt (33.8%,26.8%,38.7% resp.).

      Women who developed breast cancer were more amenable than women who remained free of breast
      carcinoma to experience reduced physical function, vitality, social function.

      Difficulties related to sexuality and sexual functioning were common and occurred soon after
      surgical and adjuvant treatment. addressing these problems is essential to improve the
      quality of life of young women with breast cancer.

      Sexuality is a basic and important domain of human experience that can be damaged during and
      following cancer treatment. The risk of sexual dysfunction is even of greater importance
      among young cancer patients and survivors, with young breast cancer patients at particularly
      high risk.

      In cancer breast patients, various factors can induce sexual dysfunction. Some of these
      factors; hormonal alterations induced by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or physiological and
      functional disturbances are related to the deterioration of physical condition. These factors
      are strictly clinical.

      Other factors which induce disturbances in sexual behavior, such as anxious\ depressive
      reactions in adapting to illness and treatment and cancerophobic reactions and loss of self
      esteem that accompany any illness are more psychological\ psychiatric in nature.

      Having sexual problems (or dysfunction) includes experiencing disturbances in sexual desire
      and physiological changes associated with loss of sexual desire and arousal, reduction in
      sexual pleasure, difficulty achieving orgasm, anxiety about sexual performance and pain
      during intercourse.
