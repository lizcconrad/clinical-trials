  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, two-stage study of the safety and efficacy of pracinostat in combination
      with azacitidine in patients with IPSS-R high and very high risk MDS who are previously
      untreated with HMAs. Enrollment in this study will be limited to high/very high risk MDS
      because this group represents the highest unmet need, with median survival of less than 18
      months.

      Stage 1 will be conducted as an open-label single arm in up to 40 subjects to assess if this
      regimen with a lower pracinostat dose results in a discontinuation rate that meets a
      predefined threshold and in efficacy that justifies expansion of enrollment into Stage 2.

      A discontinuation rate of approximately ≤10% in Stage 1, a rate comparable to that observed
      with azacitidine alone in study MEI-003, is considered desirable and supports expansion into
      Stage 2.

      Stage 2 will be conducted as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm design
      to confirm that the discontinuation rate observed in an open-label design can be reproduced
      in a placebo controlled design, and to provide unbiased information on efficacy and safety.
      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the 2 treatment arms (Arm A, pracinostat
      + azacitidine and Arm B, placebo + azacitidine). Study drugs should be continued until
      disease progression or intolerable toxicity. It is important to note that the median time to
      achieving a response with azacitidine alone is 4 to 5 months. Furthermore, the median time to
      achieving a CR in study MEI-003 was 4 cycles. Therefore, early (&lt;6 months) discontinuation of
      trial therapy for 'no response' should be avoided. The Medical Monitor should be contacted
      prior to discontinuing a subject from the study to discuss the rationale for discontinuation.
