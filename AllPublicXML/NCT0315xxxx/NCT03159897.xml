  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FIL-Rouge is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase III, 2-arm study. The primary
      objective is to compare efficacy and tolerability of the intensified variant
      'dose-dense/dose-intense ABVD' (ABVD DD-DI) with an interim PET response-adapted ABVD program
      as upfront therapy in advanced-stage classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is devoted to patients affected with advanced stage (IIB-IV) Hodgkin Lymphoma.

      The study aims to compare the efficacy of two alternative ABVD-based strategies, the first
      one (Comparator arm) based on a PET-2-adaptation, the second (Experimental arm) relying on a
      straight dose- and time-intensified schedule, devoid of any PET-adaptation.

      In the Comparator arm, the patients will receive two courses of standard ABVD (ABVD-28).
      Those with a PET-2 negative scan (Deauville Score 1-3) will proceed with additional 4 ABVD
      courses while those with a PET-2-positive scan (Deauville score 4-5) will be diverted towards
      a deferred intensification with either escalated BEACOPP or HDT plus ASCR , according to the
      preference of the Center.

      In the Experimental arm, patients are treated with three cycles of a dose-dense/dose-intense
      ABVD (ABVD DD-DI) [e.g. a modified ABVD including the single escalation of doxorubicin to 35
      mg/m2 (70 mg/m2 per cycle) and a three-weekly recycle time for all drugs (e.g. administration
      of all 4 drugs at days 1 and 11 of each cycle)]. Those with a progressive disease or
      non-responder patients according to PET/CT imaging at interim evaluation (after cycle 3) as
      categorized with Lugano 2014 Classification will be diverted to salvage strategies. The other
      patients will receive one additional course of ABVD DD-DI followed by two courses of
      dose-dense three-weekly ABVD (ABVD DD) (e.g. administration of all four drugs at days 1 and
      11 of each cycle at the conventional doses, including doxorubicin at 25 mg/m2).

      In the Comparator arm, consolidation radiotherapy is planned on initial bulky disease sites
      even if PET negative (DS 1-2) (30 Gy), in patients with PET-negative (DS 3) rests (30 Gy) and
      in patients with a PET-positive rests (DS 4-5) (36 Gy) even if the residual lesion is not in
      a bulky lesion. In the Experimental arm, consolidation radiotherapy will be delivered only to
      rests at treatment completion, without intentional consolidation radiotherapy on the initial
      bulky, more specifically, in patients with DS3 rests (30 Gy) and in patients with a
      PET-positive rests (DS 4-5) (36 Gy) even if the residual lesion is not in a bulky lesion.

      Blinded independent central reviewing for PET imaging will supervise response categorization
      at interim and final PET/CT evaluation.

    <description>Patients will receive 2 courses of standard ABVD (ABVD-28, d1, d15, cycles of 28 days) and then proceed to interim PET/CT evaluation. Those with a PET-2-negative scan (score 1-3 on 5PS) will continue with additional 4 ABVD courses while those with a PET-2-positive (score 4-5) scan will be diverted towards an intensification phase with either escalated BEACOPP or HDT plus ASCR, according to the preference of the centre. Upon completion of treatment, patients will be categorized for response (Lugano2014) by comparing actual PET/CT imaging with baseline, whether 6 ABVD cycles or ABVDx2 + intensification phase with BEACOPP or HDT/ASCR. A salvage rescue program will be planned for patients with Stable (&lt;PR) or Progressive Disease. 30 Gy Involved Site Radiotherapy (ISRT) will be delivered as consolidation treatment on initial bulky site(s) and 30-36 on focal PET rests scoring ≥ 3 on 5PS.</description>

    <description>Dose-dense and dose-intense ABVD regimen (ABVD DD-DI: intercycle 21 days, d1, d11; doxorubicin 35 mg/m2 DD 1 and 11) is given in cycles 1 to 4 and dose-dense ABVD (ABVD DD: intercycle 21 days, D1 and D11; conventional doxorubicin dose, e.g. 25 mg/m2 DD 1 and 11) is given as cycles 5 and 6). The treatment is not PET-adapted, and only patients with no response or progressive disease at interim FDG-PET as defined by the Lugano Classification (e.g., score 4 or 5 on 5PS with no significant change or with increased uptake matched with baseline and/or new FDG-avid foci consistent with lymphoma) will be diverted to salvage therapy. 30-36 Gy ISRT will be delivered as consolidation treatment on focal PET rests scoring ≥3 on 5PS at the end of ABVD DD-DI. No intentional consolidation radiotherapy on the initial bulky area(s) is scheduled.</description>
