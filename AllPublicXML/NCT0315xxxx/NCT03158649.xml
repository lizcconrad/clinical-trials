  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The identification and treatment of the disorders connected to the perinatal period has
      traditionally catalyzed the researchers' attention. Nevertheless, since the World Health
      Organization has recently coined the concept of positive pregnancy experience, which includes
      not only treatment of diseases, but also health education, and health promotion, research on
      antenatal care has expanded to a salutogenic perspective. In the wake of this perspective, a
      growing number of research have been examining the potential benefits of positive aspects and
      protective factors on maternal prenatal well-bein. This salutogenic perspective is supported
      by the emerging field of Positive Psychology. Evidence from Positive Psychology studies has
      shown that it is possible to build and enhance personal strengths, sense of meaning and
      positive feelings by practicing some brief positive exercises, called Positive Psychology
      Interventions (PPIs). Recently, researchers have started to investigate the effects of a PPI
      on women's prenatal well-being, reporting promising findings in terms of potential direct
      effects of the positive intervention on women's prenatal stress in comparison to a
      treatment-as-usual control condition. In the past decade, many web-based delivered
      interventions have been designed and documented to be effective for the promotion of mental
      health and for the prevention and treatment of different disorders. Indeed, recent systematic
      reviews provides preliminary evidence that web-based interventions can be a promising and
      advisable form of intervention during the perinatal period. PPIs have been translated also in
      the online format. Preliminary evidence suggests that online positive psychology
      interventions can effectively enhance well-being and reduce depressive symptoms.

      The research team have developed the protocol for a web-based positive psychology programme
      addressed to promote and enhance women's prenatal well-being. This intervention programme
      will last five weeks and will be completely self-administered. It is intend to study the
      effect of the intervention on levels of mental well-being, depression, pregnancy related
      anxiety and other relevant variables, and the results will be compared to a waiting list
      control group.

      Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a positive psychology
      online-based intervention on indices of prenatal wellbeing. Hypotheses: Specifically, the
      primary hypothesis is that women that would participate to the intervention would report
      higher levels of mental well-being comparing to the ones reported by women assigned to the
      control group (i.e., waiting list, WL). Secondly, it is expected that women that would be
      involve in the positive intervention would report higher levels of positive affect, perceived
      social support, positive future thinking, and self-acceptance, comparing to the ones reported
      by the WL group. Moreover it is expected that participants assigned to the intervention
      condition would report lower levels of negative affect, depression symptoms, pregnancy
      related anxiety and negative future thinking, comparing to the ones reported by the WL group.
