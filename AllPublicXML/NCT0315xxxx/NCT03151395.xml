  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the infectious aetiology of AECOPD has been suggested to vary according to geographical
      region, the primary purpose of this study (which will be conducted in several countries in
      Asia Pacific) is to evaluate the occurrence of bacterial and viral pathogens in the sputum of
      stable COPD patients and at the time of AECOPD. Given the increasing and projected burden of
      COPD in the Asia Pacific region, this study will also evaluate the frequency, severity and
      duration of AECOPD, as well as the impact of AECOPD on health-related quality of life
      (HRQOL), healthcare utilisation and lung function.

      The protocol has been amended to implement the following changes:

        -  Alignment of the protocol to the updated GOLD consensus report of 2017 and the COPD fact
           sheet.

        -  Alignment of the study endpoints to the study objectives.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol (e.g., completion of electronic Diary Card, sputum
             sampling, pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry, return for follow-up visits).

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Male or female aged 40 years or older at the time of enrolment.

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of moderate to very severe COPD based on post-bronchodilator
             spirometry (i.e. forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] over forced vital
             capacity [FVC] ratio [FEV1/ FVC] &lt; 0.7 and FEV1 &lt; 80% predicted [GOLD grades 2, 3 and
             4].

          -  Stable COPD patient* with documented history** (e.g. medical record verification) of
             at least 1 moderate or severe AECOPD within the 12 months before study entry.

               -  Patient for whom the last episode of AECOPD is resolved for at least 30 days at
                  the time of study entry.

                       verification) is a medical record of worsening COPD symptoms that required
                       systemic/oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics (for a moderate
                       exacerbation) or hospitalization (for a severe exacerbation). Prior use of
                       antibiotics alone does not qualify as an exacerbation history unless the use
                       was associated with treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD, such as
                       increased dyspnea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence (color). Subject
                       verbal reports are not acceptable.

          -  Current or former tobacco smoker (cigarette) with a smoking history of ≥ 10 pack-years

          -  Able to provide a sputum sample at Screening Visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with a respiratory disorder other than COPD (such as sarcoidosis, active

             bronchiectasis, lung fibrosis, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, lung cancer diagnosed
             within the previous 5 years, current primary diagnosis of asthma in the opinion of the
             investigator), or chest X-ray revealing evidence of clinically significant
             abnormalities not believed to be due to the presence of COPD*. Subjects with allergic
             rhinitis do not need to be excluded and may be enrolled at the discretion of the
             investigator.

               -  A chest X-ray must be taken at Screening Visit, if no chest X-ray taken within
                  the previous 3 months is available.

          -  Diagnosis of α-1 antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying cause of COPD.

          -  Undergone or has had lung surgery 12 months before, or plans to have lung surgery 12
             months after, study entry.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).

          -  Received chemotherapy within the 12 months before study entry.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational vaccine/ product (pharmaceutical product or device).

          -  Administration of antibiotics within 1 month of study entry OR continuous
             administration of antibiotics (defined as more than 30 days in total) within 90 days
             before study entry.

          -  Systemic administration of corticosteroids for more than 14 consecutive days within 90
             days prior to informed consent.

          -  Contraindication for spirometry testing (such as recent eye surgery, recent thoracic
             or abdominal surgery procedures, unstable cardiovascular status, recent myocardial
             infarction or pulmonary embolism).

          -  Psychiatric illness or any other condition that interferes with the ability to
             understand the study procedures.
