  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy of tesamorelin as a therapy for
      peripheral nerve injuries. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with tesamorelin will
      allow for faster and greater recovery of motor and sensory function following surgical repair
      of injured peripheral nerves. Patients with upper extremity nerve injuries will be randomly
      assigned to receive either the drug or a placebo (inactive drug). A number of tests for nerve
      regeneration, muscle function and sensation will be performed every month for a total of 12
      months. Outcomes in the patients treated with tesamorelin will be compared to outcomes in
      patients who received the placebo to determine the effectiveness of tesamorelin as a therapy
      for nerve injuries.

      This is a multi-institutional, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial
      assessing the efficacy of tesamorelin as a therapy to improve functional recovery following
      peripheral nerve injury. Tesamorelin is a drug that stimulates increased production of growth
      hormone, and growth hormone has been shown to improve nerve regeneration and functional
      recovery in animal studies. A total of 36 participants with repaired ulnar nerve lacerations
      will be enrolled, of which 18 will be randomly assigned to receive the study drug and 18 will
      receive the placebo. To avoid bias, the study participants and investigators will be blinded
      to the treatment group assignments. Following enrollment, each participant will have 12
      monthly follow-up visits during which participants will undergo testing to assess recovery.
      Outcome assessments will include clinical exams, MRI, electrodiagnostic studies and
      questionnaires. The total duration of the study is expected to be 4 years.
