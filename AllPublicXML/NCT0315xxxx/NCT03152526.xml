  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II trial designed to test the safety and efficacy (complete response [CR]) of
      related donor HLA-haploidentical NK-cell based therapy for the treatment of acute myelogenous
      leukemia (AML).

      Patients with newly diagnosed AML who failed to achieve a complete remission (CR) after one
      or two standard induction attempts receive after a preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide
      and fludarabine a single infusion of CD3-/CD19- NK cells or CD3-/CD56+ NK cells followed by a
      short course of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) to facilitate NK cell survival and expansion.

    <textblock>
      This trial uses a Simon's two-stage design to estimate the complete remission rate at day +42
      post NK cell infusion. The trial includes an initial randomized sub- study of 24 patients
      during stage 1 to choose which of the enriched NK cell products (CD3-/CD19- versus
      CD3-/CD56+) should be used to complete the trial based on successful in vivo NK cell
      expansion. This parameter is defined as 40% donor DNA and 40% of lymphocytes are NK cells at
      day 7 post infusion OR 20% donor DNA and 20% of lymphocytes are NK cells at day 14 post
      infusion. Twelve patients will be randomized to each product.

      Enrollment Plan:

      Stage 1: Enroll 24 patients with 1:1 randomization for NK cell processing (CD3-/CD19- versus
      CD3-/CD56+) Stage 2: Enroll an additional 17 patients using the optimal NK cell product
      identified during stage 1.

      If neither product achieves success at the end of stage 1, the study will stop and the
      platform redesigned

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia (except acute promyelocytic leukemia)
             and has failed one or two prior standard induction attempts. Failure is defined as:

          -  ≥ 30% bone marrow blasts with at least 20% cellularity at mid-cycle bone marrow biopsy
             or residual AML on subsequent~ day 28 bone marrow biopsy by morphology, flow, PCR or
             FISH

          -  Patients enrolling after only 1 failed induction attempt must meet at least one of the
             following additional eligibility criteria of high risk: ≥ 60 years of age adverse
             cytogenetics or molecular characteristics

          -  AML that progressed out of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is eligible if the patient
             did not receive treatment directed at the MDS

          -  HLA-haploidentical related donor (aged 12 to 70 years)
