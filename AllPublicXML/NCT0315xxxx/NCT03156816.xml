  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory processes have been identified as key mediators of ischemia/ reperfusion injury
      in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. They add additional damage to the myocardium
      and are associated with clinical adverse events (heart failure and cardiovascular death) and
      poor myocardial recovery. All the different anti-inflammatory approaches to reduce
      reperfusion injury have been disappointing.

      Colchicine is a well-known substance with potent anti-inflammatory properties. In a recent
      pilot study performed in 151 acute STEMI patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary
      intervention(PPCI) Deftereos et al. showed a 50% reduction of infarct size (creatine kinase
      release) with a short course treatment of colchicine in comparison to placebo.

      One mechanism to explain this effect could be the reduction of adverse left ventricular (LV)
      remodelling. LV remodelling is part of the healing process of myocardium after MI. It is
      defined as the end diastolic volume (EDV) increase in the first months after MI. Adverse LV
      remodelling is increased by inflammation and ultimately leads to heart failure.

      Our main hypothesis is that colchicine with its anti-inflammatory properties significantly
      reduces the initiation of adverse LV remodelling, together with a significant reduction of
      infarct size and microvascular obstruction in comparison to placebo in acute STEMI patients
      referred for PPCI.

      After inclusion and randomisation, patients will receive the first part of their experimental
      treatment: colchicine or placebo before PCI, then, the second part after PCI and during 5
      days. They will be followed up during their hospitalization and until one year. In order to
      evaluate LV remodelling, two cardiac magnetic resonance studies will be performed during
      their participation: one during their hospitalization and a second at 3 months. At 1 year,
      adverse events will be collected by phone.
