      The importance of play and physical activity include many benefits on positively improving
      health and well-being, enhancing children's and young people's thinking and performance in
      school, improving their sleep and enabling confidence and skill building. However, some
      children find it hard to learn and perform motor skills, and are at risk of decreased
      participation in sports and physical activity and subsequently decreased physical fitness and
      overall health and well-being.

      Previous studies from the research group have explored the impact and recovery following
      acute exercise at different intensities in children and adolescents with and without movement
      difficulties. Following this, a pathway promoting physical activity and engagement has been
      successfully established within schools for those with and without movement difficulties.
      Taking the previous studies further, we want to specifically focus on the children's
      performance and learning of a sporting skill, such as stepping, and the associated brain
      activity changes, using available high resolution imaging techniques. This will help us
      understand how these children perform and learn motor and sporting skills. Evidence obtained
      from imaging alongside measures of movement has helped the development of optimal therapeutic
      approaches for other conditions such as stroke and Parkinson's and will help us to develop
      approaches to help children best learn motor skills and hence gain confidence in performing
      sporting activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with poor motor skill acquisition and execution despite having opportunity for
      learning, are now described as having developmental coordination disorder (DCD). There is a
      prevalence of 5-6% of young people who have normal intelligence who meet this category who
      have problems affecting their activities of daily living (ADL's). Young people with lower
      motor skills are one of a number of conditions affecting children identified by the Chief
      Medical Officer as requiring an improved evidence base for management. Poor motor skill
      acquisition and execution, whereby skills remain substantially lower than expected despite
      opportunities for learning; interferes with participation in academic, sporting and leisure
      activities. Motor performance is slower and of poor quality; and children may have
      difficulties learning all kinds of motor skills including sporting activities. Importantly
      people with poor motor skill acquisition and execution can fail to establish the fundamental
      movement skills and literacy required to integrate in physical pursuits, such as sport, and
      become exposed to long-term conditions associated with inactivity. Motor sporting skills can
      be learnt if trained, but difficulties in performing and learning skills persist into
      adulthood.

      Brain imaging during rhythmic motor tasks which are essential in day-to-day (non-)sporting
      activities, have established that children with poor motor skill acquisition and execution
      show differences to healthy controls in grey and white matter functional connectivity and in
      cortical activation patterns during performance of simple movement tasks . Provisional
      evidence suggests that individuals with poor motor skill acquisition and execution utilise
      activation processes when learning motor tasks that are more controlled and require extra
      processing demands, but a systematic review of neural correlates of those with poor motor
      skill acquisition and execution concludes that data is scarce and more studies are needed.
      Performance of motor tasks requires a balance between automatic and controlled processes that
      is dependent upon the demands of the task and the capabilities of the individual. Young
      people need to be able to consider their environment when performing a sport rather than just
      thinking about the skill, so that they can work out where the best place to kick a ball on a
      football pitch is, not just kick the ball. Typically developing (TDC) children acquire motor
      skills either implicitly or explicitly by observing and imitating other children and adults
      or by trial and error. Acquisition of motor tasks requires plasticity in the nervous system
      with improvements in motor performance underpinned by a move from cortically controlled
      mechanism, towards more automatic performance, freeing up cortical resources. The ability to
      automate certain parts of motor skills allows the execution of tasks in more complex
      environments. Provisional evidence suggests that people with poor motor skill acquisition and
      execution may learn motor skills in a more controlled manner and have a reduced ability to
      move automatically. To date no studies have explored the brain changes underpinning
      fundamental motor skills attainment over a training period in people with poor motor skill
      acquisition and execution.

      The main aim is to better understand performance and acquisition of sporting tasks in
      children with poor motor skill acquisition and execution using an ecologically valid task and
      learning environment in order to develop more effective approaches which enable these
      children to participate.
