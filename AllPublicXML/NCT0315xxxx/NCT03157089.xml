  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to assess the efficacy of afatinib in combination with pembrolizumab,
      as measured by objective response (OR) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      squamous NSCLC who progressed during or after first line platinum-based treatment.

      The secondary objectives are to confirm the RP2D, assess the safety profile, and the
      secondary measures of clinical efficacy including disease control (DC), duration of objective
      response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and tumour shrinkage.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC considered to be of squamous histology,
             including mixed histology, in the opinion of the investigator.

             for curative therapy.

          -  Documented disease progression or relapse (based on investigator's assessment) during
             or after completion of at least 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy as first line
             treatment of Stage IIIB/IV SCC of the lung. This includes patients relapsing within 6
             months of completing (neo)adjuvant/curative-intent chemotherapy or definitive
             chemoradiotherapy. Patients should be eligible to receive 2nd line therapy in the
             opinion of the investigator.

          -  At least one target lesion (outside the brain) that can be accurately measured per
             Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. In patients who
             only have one target lesion and a biopsy of the lesion is required; the baseline
             imaging must be performed at least two weeks after the biopsy.

          -  Availability and willingness to provide a fresh tumour tissue sample obtained after
             relapse or progression on or after prior therapy. In case a fresh biopsy cannot be
             obtained (e.g. inaccessible lesions or patient safety concern), an archived specimen
             may be submitted.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Recovery from major surgery or any previous anti-cancer or radiation therapy-related
             toxicity to ≤ CTCAE Grade 1 at C1_V1 (except for alopecia; stable sensory neuropathy
             must be ≤ CTCAE Grade 2).

          -  At least 18 years of age or over the legal age of consent in countries where that is
             greater than 18 years at screening.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with ICHGCP and local
             legislation prior to admission to the trial.

             father a child must be ready and able to use highly effective methods of birth control
             per ICH M3 (R2) that result in a low failure rate of less than 1% per year when used
             consistently and correctly, starting with the screening visit and through 120 days
             after the last dose of pembrolizumab treatment and 2 weeks after last afatinib
             treatment, respectively, as listed in the protocol. A list of contraception methods
             meeting these criteria is provided in the patient information. -- Note: Female
             patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test
             within 72 hours prior to taking study medication. If the urine test is positive or
             cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. The serum
             pregnancy test must be negative for the patient to be eligible.
