  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to assess the efficacy of the Rhythm Stabilization component of HealthRhythms'
      product, investigators will recruit 128 outpatients between the ages of 18 and 65, presenting
      to the University of Utah Department of Psychiatry outpatient clinics with a current mood
      and/or anxiety disorder. Sixty-four of these individuals will be randomly allocated to
      receive the full HealthRhythms package (Rhythm Sensing, Rhythm Trending, and Rhythm
      Stabilization) on their smartphones, while 64 will be asked to consent to Rhythm Sensing
      only. Participants in both arms will receive treatment as usual (TAU) for their mood and/or
      anxiety disorders, as typically provided at the University of Utah clinics. The duration of
      the study will be 16 weeks.

      The primary outcome measures of the RCT will be the PROMIS Depression, the PROMIS Anxiety and
      the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance computerized adaptive testing (CAT) measures. The investigators
      hypothesize that those receiving the full package will demonstrate lower levels of
      depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance. In addition, investigators will explore the
      relationship between sensed rhythm stability and scores on patient-reported outcome measures
      of mood, anxiety and sleep disturbance (PROMIS). The investigators hypothesize that positive
      changes in the PROMIS measures will be mediated by positive changes in rhythm stability.

      The primary outcome analyses will be based on random regression models, while the mediation
      analyses will follow the approach described by Helena Kraemer and colleagues.

    <ipd_description>The project will contain two distinct datasets: 1) data from HealthRhythms' collaboration with ImagineCare; and 2) data from the RCT of the Rhythm Stabilization Product (n=128). The investigators will not share the first dataset because it contains proprietary data not owned by HealthRhythms. The investigators will share the RCT data which will consist of self-reported measures, smartphone-sensed data and clinical assessments. Although the final dataset will be stripped of identifiers prior to sharing, there will remain a remote possibility of deductive disclosure of participants' identity using the sensed location data. The investigators will make the data and its documentation available to individuals via a data sharing agreement that requires a prior written commitment: 1) to only use the data for research purposes and not to identify participants; 2) to protect and secure the data using best practice security methods; and 3) to destroy the data once analysis has been completed.</ipd_description>
