  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the most appropriate dose for the combination of
      ibrutinib and pembrolizumab and to see if the combination is active for the disease. The
      study will monitor for any side effects and if the combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab
      works in the cancers being studied.

      There will be 2 experimental drugs given to the subject in this study. One experimental drug
      used in this study is called ibrutinib and the second is called pembrolizumab.

      This is the first time that ibrutinib will be used in combination with pembrolizumab. This
      combination is considered experimental. Experimental means that it is still being tested to
      see if it is safe and effective. Ibrutinib is a new drug known as a 'Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase
      (BTK) inhibitor'. Ibrutinib blocks an enzyme (protein) that affects how certain types of
      blood cancer cells grow and survive. Blocking this enzyme is a very important mechanism in
      killing blood cancer cells. Ibrutinib has been approved in the United States, Israel, and the
      European Union for use in adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and adult patients
      with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy.
      Pembrolizumab is an antibody (a type of human protein) that is being tested to see if it will
      allow the body's immune system to work against tumor cells. Pembrolizumab is approved for use
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with
      melanoma (skin cancer) who have received prior treatments. Pembrolizumab is not FDA approved
      to treat patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] and mantle cell lymphoma [MCL].

      (1) Objective: a. (Phase 1) Assess the safety of fixed dose or, as needed, de-escalated
      ibrutinib/pembrolizumab in patients with MCL (Cohort A) and CLL (Cohort B) to determine
      recommended phase 2 dosing.

      b. (Phase 2A): Assess CR rate of combination ibrutinib/pembrolizumab therapy, in comparison
      to historical data of ibrutinib monotherapy, in patients with MCL (Cohort C) and CLL (Cohort
      D).

      Hypothesis:

      This is an open-label Phase 1/2A study, which consists of Phase 1 (Safety Assessment Cohorts)
      utilizing a 3+3 dose de-escalation design and Phase 2A (Expansion Cohorts) utilizing a single
      arm one-stage design.

      All patients receive a 28 day lead-in of ibrutinib and thereafter, a treatment 'cycle' is
      defined as a course of treatment of 21 days starting with the intravenous administration of
      pembrolizumab on Day 1 of each cycle along with once daily oral intake of ibrutinib on all
      days.

        1. The combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab will be safe and well tolerated.

        2. The combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab will result in higher CR rates compared
           to historic data of ibrutinib monotherapy in cohorts of CLL and MCL.

      Secondary Objectives &amp; Hypotheses

      (1) Objective: (Phase 2A): Assess duration of response, overall response rate, and duration
      of stable disease, compared to historical data of single agent ibrutinib, in patients with
      MCL (Cohort C) and CLL (Cohort D).

      Hypothesis: The combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab will increase duration of
      response, overall response rate and duration of stable disease when compared to historical
      data of single agent ibrutinib.

             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include
             lymphomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

          9. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 1 year
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a

             Patients who have previously discontinued btk inhibitor therapy because of intolerance
             may be considered for eligibility per the assessment of the PI and treating physician
             if there is reason that the patient may better tolerate btk inhibitor therapy at
             enrollment versus previously.

         17. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-MistÂ®) are live
