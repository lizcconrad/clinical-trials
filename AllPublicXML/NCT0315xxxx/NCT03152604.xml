  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent pain (PP) affects many people worldwide. Patient Education is central to good
      management. Pain neurophysiology education (PNE) is a new form of education. It aims to help
      patients 'reconceptualise' their understanding of pain away from the perception that PP is an
      indicator of tissue damage, to PP is due to a sensitised nervous system. This perception is
      considered a less threatening and more conducive to rehabilitation. There is a growing body
      of evidence supporting its effectiveness. One unpublished Australian study combined PNE with
      a pain management program and found significant beneficial effects. However, there is a need
      to test this intervention rigorously under randomised controlled trial conditions to inform
      clinical practice. The Medical Research Council state that during the development and
      evaluation of a complex intervention (in this case a PNE informed PMP), it is important to
      undertake feasibility work, to investigate the components of randomised controlled trial
      (RCT) methodology prior to a full scale trial. The overarching aim of this mixed-methods
      study is to develop a feasible research protocol for a RCT investigating the efficacy of a
      pain neurophysiology education informed pain management programme. In this feasibility study,
      participants with PP will be assessed before and after a PNE informed pain management program
      that they are due to receive as part of their usual care. In the week before the programme
      participants will attend Teesside University (TU) where they will complete a battery of
      outcome measures. A subsample of participants will also undergo a semi-structured interview.
      In the week following completion of their usual care PMP participants will once again attend
      TU where they will complete the same outcome measures and the same subsample of participants
      will undergo a second semi-structured interview. At this point participants will have
      completed the study.

    <time_frame>Change from pre intervention (week 0) to post intervention (week 9)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to stand quietly with your gaze at a fixation point, 3m away, at head height. When the participant has settled in double limb stance, arms by their sides they will be asked to instruct the researcher when they are ready. The centre of pressure data will then be recorded for 30 seconds. After the recording the participant will step off the force plate whilst it is re-calibrated giving them approximately one-minute rest before repeating the process so that three trials are recorded in total.
The balance tests will then be repeated in the same way except participants will be instructed to close their eyes.</description>
