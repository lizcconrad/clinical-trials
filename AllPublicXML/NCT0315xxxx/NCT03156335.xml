  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is to evaluate the safety and initial efficacy of MRgFUS for patients with
      treatment-refractory OCD. This study is designed as a prospective, single arm, nonrandomized
      study. Assessments will be made before and after MRgFUS for adverse events related to
      treatment, for clinical symptom relief, and quality of life (QoL). The target in the brain
      chosen for ablation will be the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) (i.e
      'capsulotomy'). Safety will be assessed prospectively in radiologic and clinical terms.
      Post-procedural imaging will be evaluated for evidence of swelling, hemorrhage, and the
      evolution of the lesion in the anterior limb of the internal capsule. Patients will be
      clinically followed up at Day 1, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6 and Month 12 post-procedure. At
      every follow-up visit, patients will be evaluated for general health, neurological changes,
      as well as for device/procedure related adverse events. Imaging will also be performed with
      positron emission tomography (PET) and MRI, as per the Month 3 and Month 12 post-procedure.
      Feasibility will be evaluated by determining the rate of patient accrual, the tolerability of
      the procedure for patients, and the technical ability of heating the ALIC to lesional
      temperatures.

    <description>Primary effectiveness will be evaluated using validated scores and subscales related to the symptom being treated (i.e., Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale). Efficacy is defined as a clinically meaningful reduction in symptoms at 12 months post-treatment. A patient with OCD is considered to have a treatment response if their YBOCS is reduced by 35% compared to baseline.</description>

    <description>MR-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) offers the possibility of lesioning deep brain targets, while obviating the need for open surgical approaches. There is no radiation, incision, or burr hole, and lesions are generated in real-time under MR image guidance. Intracranial FUS for other applications, essential tremor most notably, has been shown to be safe and effective, recently receiving Health Canada approval for this indication. The technology, methods and procedures used in this study are identical to those in essential tremor.</description>
