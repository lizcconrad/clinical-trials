  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight-reducing obesity surgery (OS) generally gives good results but complications are
      common; e.g. impaired weight loss, weight regain, bowel pain, diarrhea, vitamin/mineral
      deficiency, osteoporosis and impaired dental health. The BASUN study is a prospective 10-year
      comparison of 1000 surgically and 400 conventionally treated individuals regarding adverse
      side-effects, risk factors for complications and poor outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of obesity surgery (OS) has increased dramatically due to the lack of effective
      conventional weight reducing methods. OS generally gives a sustained weight reduction and
      improves metabolic co-morbidities but complications are not uncommon, e.g. weight regain,
      bowel pain, diarrhea, vitamin/mineral deficiency, osteoporosis and impaired dental health.
      Studies of OS regarding adverse side-effects, risk factors for complications and poor
      outcomes are few or missing.

      The BASUN study is a prospective 10-year comparison of 1000 surgically and 400 conventionally
      treated individuals. Inclusion started in April 2015 and will be completed in 2017. Subjects
      are consecutively included from the whole western region of Sweden and are followed by
      detailed checkups at 2, 5 and 10 years. Protocol includes nutritional and bone status, oral
      health, psychiatric health, GI symptoms, socioeconomics and health economy. Data are
      collected by interviews, blood and fecal samples, questionnaires, dual energy x-ray
      absorptiometry, dentist examinations, patients' record and registries. The study is carried
      out in close cooperation with experts in surgery, medicine, psychiatry, endocrinology,
      gastroenterology, hematology, molecular biology, osteoporosis, oral medicine, physiology and
      general medicine.

      The BASUN study will be able to form the basis for more individualized medical guidelines
      with the objective of improving therapeutic quality and the utilization of health care
      resources.
