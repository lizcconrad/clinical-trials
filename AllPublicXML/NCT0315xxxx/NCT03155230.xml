  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Danish male patients who had undergone bilateral TAPP (July 2012 to June 2013) were recruited
      from the Danish Hernia Database and cross-checked with hospital files and the National
      Patient Registry. A standardized postal questionnaire was sent out two years after the index
      surgery to investigate Patients Related Outcome Measures (PROMs) such as chronic
      post-operative pain.
