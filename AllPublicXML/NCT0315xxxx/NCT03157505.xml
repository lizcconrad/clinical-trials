  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local allergic rhinitis (LAR) is relatively new disease. The question of effect of allergen
      specific immunotherapy on LAR is open. The randomized, double blind placebo controlled trial
      of birch subcutaneous AIT on LAR were performed in twenty eight patients. The therapy was
      performed during 24 months in proportion 15 patients with AIT and 13 placebo. The primary
      endpoint was decreased of symptoms medication score (SMS). Additionally monitoring serum
      specific IgE, specific IgG4 and nasal specific IgE (nsIgE) to Bet v1 and parameters of safety
      and quality of life were provided.

    <textblock>
      Local allergic rhinitis (LAR) is still an under diagnosed and under treated disease. It is
      characterised by local production of IgE during natural exposure to aeroallergens. These
      patients have negative skin prick tests and serum-specific IgEs but have positive nasal
      provocation tests for aeroallergens. More than 50% of patients with chronic non-allergic
      rhinitis may have a problem with lack of LAR diagnosis. Misdiagnosis can lead to mistakes in
      the treatment as well as inefficiencies.

      Besides on only local IgE-mediated reaction, allergen immunotherapy (AIT) could be a
      potential way of treatment such patients. However, there are only sufficient data that the
      AIT is effective in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma to pollens and house dust mites
      and some animal.

      The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of AIT for birch pollen allergens
      in patients with local allergic rhinitis and a confirmed birch pollen allergy.
