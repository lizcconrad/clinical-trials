  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate patient-specific surgical simulation by permitting
      pre-operative rehearsals, in the form of the surgeon completing a dry run of the procedure on
      a model constructed from the patient's radiological studies that replicates every aspect of
      their organs. The investigators' aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of this form of
      practice in optimizing intraoperative and postoperative outcomes . The investigators hope
      eventually to use these rehearsals as a standard study tool for surgical training.
