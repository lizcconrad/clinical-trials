    <measure>Relative Bioavailability of Xisimin Compared With Clarityne</measure>
    <time_frame>Cohort 1 and Cohort 2: Predose, 0.25 hour (h), 0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 2.5h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Bioavailability means the extent to which the active ingredient of a drug dosage form becomes available at the site of drug action or in a biological medium believed to reflect accessibility to a site of action. Relative bioavailability is the percentage of the administered dose that is systemically available, calculated as: (AUC [0-infinity] of test divided by AUC [0-infinity] of reference) multiplied by 100, where the reference treatment is a non-intravenous administration.</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to Last Quantifiable Time (AUC [0-last]) for Loratadine</measure>

    <description>The AUC (0-last) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last quantifiable time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC[0-infinity]) for Loratadine</measure>

    <description>The AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC(last) and C(last)/lambda(z); wherein AUC(last) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last quantifiable time, C(last) is the last observed quantifiable concentration, and lambda(z) is elimination rate constant.</description>
