    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of EPA- and DHA-enriched omega-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acid dietary supplements on cerebral blood flow during a series of
      cognitive, mathematical subtraction tasks and subjective ratings of task difficulty before
      and after 26 weeks of supplementation
