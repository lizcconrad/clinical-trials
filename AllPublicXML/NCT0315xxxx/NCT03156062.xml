  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a multisystem disease predominately manifested as chronic inflammation of the
      skin and characterized by scaly, erythematous patches, papules and plaques, which are often
      pruritic. As chronic disease, psoriasis waxes and wanes throughout patient life time. The
      disease course is modified with initiation and cessation of treatment, and spontaneous
      remission is rare. Clinically lesions can be distributed in any part of the body, this leads
      to impaired consequences on the perception of body image, social relations and in general on
      quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The severity of psoriasis is defined by the extent of body surface involvement as well as the
      involvement of areas that substantially affect daily life such as hands, feet, face and
      genital region . Approximately 80% of patients have mild to moderate disease and 20% have
      moderate to severe disease. Although the precise etiology of psoriasis remains unknown, a
      combination of immunologic, genetic and environmental factors contribute to its development
      and exacerbation. Psoriasis has multifactorial pathogenesis in which predisposing genetic
      factors (dysregulation of the immune system and alteration of keratinocytes) and
      environmental trigger factors (such as local trauma, streptococcal infections, emotional
      stress, drugs as B-blockers and lithium) interact with each other by triggering a specific
      immune response mediated by T-lymphocytes.Treatment of psoriasis is still very complex.
      Several treatments for plaque psoriasis are available as topical medications for mild to
      moderate cases of psoriasis (corticosteroids, vit D3 analogues, salicylic acid, dithranol
      etc.). Phototherapy is useful in moderately-severe psoriasis unresponsive to topical therapy
      alone. Systemic treatment is used for severe forms of psoriasis including immunosuppressive
      drugs such as methotrexate or cyclosporine, retinoids, etc., and in cases of
      contraindications or ineffectiveness of these drugs these severe forms of psoriasis can be
      treated with biological drugs such as adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, etc.The
      climatotherapy presents a safe and efficient alternative to conventional therapeutic modality
      for psoriasis. Climatotherapy treatment is based on healing capacities of natural
      resources.Climatic treatment includes balneotherapy and sun exposure. Balneotherapy
      represents a set of methods and practices (bathing, drinking, inhalation, etc.)
