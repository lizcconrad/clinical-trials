      The main purpose of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of
      TAEST16001（TCR Affinity Enhancing Specific T cell Therapy）in the multi-line treatment failed
      advanced solid tumors including bone and soft tissue sarcoma, melanoma, liver cancer,
      esophageal cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid and ovarian
      cancer. The patients must meet the two criteria: human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-A*0201+ and
      NY-ESO-1 positive cells≥25% by immunohistochemisty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TCR-T cell therapy has made a breakthrough for tumors in recent years. Phase I/II trial of
      NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-T treatment for synovial sarcoma and melanoma, conducted by the
      Rosenberg team at the National Cancer Institute, showed that 61% Synovial cell sarcoma and
      55% melanoma had benefits, without severe side effects found in T cell receptor (TCR)
      transduced T-Cell Immunotherapy. The US FDA has granted Breakthrough TCR-T cell therapy for
      patients with inoperable or metastatic synovial sarcoma. The European Medicines Agency has
      also approved the same therapy to Priority Medicines(PRIME).

      This clinical trial is mainly focused on cancer-testis antigen, because it is not expressed
      in normal cells. NY-ESO-1 antigen as one member of cancer-testis antigen, is commonly
      expressed in 10-50% of melanoma, lung, liver, esophageal, breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid
      and ovarian cancer cases, 60% of multiple myeloma cases, and 70-80% of synovial sarcoma. The
      NY-ESO-1 TCR cell therapy for synovial sarcoma and melanoma has benefited many patients, but
      its effect on other solid tumors is still unknown. So we plan to explore its efficacy in
      tumors including bone and soft tissue sarcoma, melanoma, liver cancer, esophageal cancer,
      breast cancer, thyroid and ovarian cancer.

      The trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of TAEST16001 cell therapy in
      multi-line treatment failed advanced solid tumors including bone and soft tissue sarcoma,
      melanoma, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, breast cancer, thyroid and ovarian cancer. The
      patients must meet the two criteria: HLA-A*0201+ and NY-ESO-1 positive cells≥25% by
      immunohistochemisty. By this trial, the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerance
      (MTD) of TAEST16001 will be initially identified.

    <description>TAEST16001 cells are prepared by lentiviral infection. The dose-limiting toxicity was administered in a dose escalation test according to the 3 + 3 design. Three days prior to infusion of TCR-T cell, patients receive cyclophosphamide treatment at dose 1 g/day for 2 days and take a rest for one day before infusion.
A single dose of Anti-NY-ESO-1 TCR transduced T cells (about 5×10^9) will be intravenously administered. Additionally, following infusion of Anti-NY-ESO-1 TCR transduced T cells, interleukin(IL)-2 subcutaneous injections (250,000 IU/day) will be administered for 14 days concomitantly to each subject.</description>
