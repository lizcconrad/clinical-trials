    <textblock>
      The study investigates the effect of dopaminergic stimulation over declarative memory
      functions in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. At this aim, 20 PD patients will receive
      declarative memory tasks in two different conditions: after 12-18 hours of dopaminergic
      stimulation withdrawal (&quot;off&quot; condition) and after the first daily dose dopaminergic therapy
      (&quot;on&quot; condition). 20 healthy controls will also administered the two tasks in two conditions
      with the same inter-session delay as PD patients, but without taking drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is frequently accompanied by declarative memory deficits. It has
      been hypothesized that these latter could be related to dopaminergic depletion within the
      fronto-striatal network. However, the nature of this relationship is not clearly understood.
      In this study we aim to assess the role of daily dopaminergic stimulation on the retrieval
      processes needed to perform different cognitive tasks. A group of PD patients will be
      administered declarative memory task both &quot;on&quot; (standard medication intake) and &quot;off&quot; (12/18
      hours after the last medication intake). A group of comparable normal controls will also
      present with the same cognitive task twice, without any drug assumption. Understanding the
      effect of dopamine treatment on declarative memory processes will allow standard medication
      treatment to be adjusted in order to take into account both motor and cognitive features of
      Parkinson's disease.

    <description>Patients were assessed in two experimental conditions that were performed on different days, with an intersession interval of about one month. In the &quot;off&quot; condition PD subjects performed the experimental tasks in the morning after 12/18 hours of Dopamine Agent withdrawal. In the &quot;on&quot; condition they were examined 90-120 minutes after they had taken their first morning dose of levodopa and/or dopamine agonists.</description>
