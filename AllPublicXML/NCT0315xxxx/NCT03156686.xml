      Evaluation of the efficacy, safety and and cost of home care versus conventional
      hospitalization care at 3-months in patients with worsening chronic heart failure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic heart failure (CHF) has an important socio-economic impact due to frequent hospital
      readmissions.

      Hypothesis: Home care treatment (HC) will improve quality of live and decrease cost.

      Methodology: Pilot, prospective, open, randomized controlled trial with 1-year follow-up for
      CHF patients admitted to 10 French hospital from March 2017 through February 2018, for acute
      decompensation of CHF. Patients will be randomly assigned to conventional hospital care or to
      the HC and treated with intravenous diuretics. Following discharge within 48 hours from the
      hospital, patients in the HC group will be treated at home. Follow-up will be conducted for
      both groups at discharge, 3 and 12 months after inclusion in the study.
