  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metformin is a classical oral antidiabetic drug, often recommended to be the first-choice
      treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Based on the previous research on PRKAA2, STK11
      and diabetes, this study aimed to investigate the distributive characteristic of PRKAA2 and
      STK11 polymorphisms and the potential influence of STK11polymorphisms on metformin efficacy
      among Chinese T2DM patients, discuss the association of PRKAA2 polymorphisms between T2DM
      patients and healthy subjects.
