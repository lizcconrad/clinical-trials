  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a health problem that affects one in 10 women of
      childbearing age, which is usually characterized by hormonal imbalance and metabolism
      problems such as hyperandrogenism and obesity. Diane 35 pills are classified as oral
      contraceptives, which effectively reduces circulating androgens and are treatment for
      hyperandrogenism caused androgenic skin symptoms and irregular menstrual cycles. GLP-1
      Receptor Agonist(e.g. exenatide, liraglutide) have the effects of lowering blood sugar and
      weight control by inhibiting of gastric emptying and reducing food intake. This study aims to
      evaluate the effect of metformin-GLP-1 Receptor agonist combination versus metformin-Diane-35
      combination treatment on lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risks in overweight polycystic
      ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients.
