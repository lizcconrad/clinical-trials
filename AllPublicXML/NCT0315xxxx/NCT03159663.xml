    <textblock>
      Hemophilia is an X-linked congenital bleeding disorder caused by deficiency of coagulation
      factor VIII (in hemophilia A) or factor IX (in hemophilia B).

      The deficiency is the result of mutations of the respective clotting factor genes.

      Hemophilia is rare, with only about 1 instance in every 10,000 births (or 1 in 5,000 male
      births) for hemophilia A and 1 in 50,000 births for hemophilia B.

      According to the World Federation of Hemophilia, 400 000 people worldwide &amp; 5,307 people in
      Egypt are suffering from hemophilia.

      Hemophilia A is more common than hemophilia B, representing 80-85 % of the total hemophilia
      population.

      Signs and symptoms of hemophilia vary according to the level of clotting factors, mild,
      moderate and sever.

        -  Unexplained excessive bleeding from cuts or injuries

        -  Epistaxis without a known cause

        -  Many large or deep bruises

        -  Hamoarthritis

        -  Hematuria and Melena.

        -  Intracranial hemorrhage and death

        -  In infants, unexplained irritability

      it is subjective representation of health, including not only physical,mental and social, but
      also emotional and everyday life dimensions in terms of well-being. Several definitions of
      QoL have been provided, the definition of the WHO viewing QoL as 'individuals perceptions of
      their position in life in the context of culture and value systems in which they live and in
      relation to their goals, expectation standards and concerns'
