  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicentre two-group parallel single-blind (outcome assessor) randomized controlled trial
      (RCT). A cost effectiveness study alongside a clinical trial using a payer and societal
      perspective to study the cost-effectiveness of geriatric assessment and management compared
      to usual care will be conducted.

      Participants allocated to the control group will receive usual oncology care. Participants
      allocated to the intervention group will receive a comprehensive geriatric assessment and
      management in addition to their usual oncology care. The intervention will take 6 months to
      be completed. Total study follow-up will be 12 months for each participant.

    <description>At study enrollment participants allocated to the intervention arm will complete a comprehensive geriatric assessment with the study intervention team (nurse and physician). Based on these findings a care plan tailored to the needs of the older adult with cancer will be developed and implemented. The study intervention nurse will call the participant at least monthly to follow up and evaluate the care (e.g. whether adjustments are required) and more if needed. All participants will receive a monthly healthy aging newsletter.</description>
