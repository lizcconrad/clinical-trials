  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ferrous sulfate is rapidly absorbed and the bolus of iron enters blood rather quickly
      possibly leading to higher concentrations of non-transferrin bound iron which induces
      oxidative stress. The objective of this study was to determine how quickly iron enters into
      blood stream from the iron-enriched Asperigillus oryzae (AspironTM, ASP) in contrast to
      ferrous sulfate. Seventeen healthy, female subjects (18-35 y) were randomized, double blind,
      cross-over experimental design with three treatments: 10 mg iron as FeSO4 and ASP as well as
      20 mg iron as ASP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a double-blinded cross-over design, 17 research participants were randomly given one of
      three iron-treatments : ferrous sulfate (10mg), AspironTM (10mg), and AspironTM (20mg). Each
      iron treatment was given with a test meal consisting of cabbage, green peas, green beans, soy
      sauce, peanut oil, 40 g baby carrots, steamed rice, and orange juice. Each subject consumed a
      meal with one of the three iron supplements in a random order and all participants consumed
      the three supplements 2 weeks in between each treatment. Prior to consuming the test meal
      with iron supplement for each treatment, blood was collected for baseline serum iron
      measuremt. Following consumption of the meal with iron, subsequent blood draws were taken
      every 30 minutes over the time period of 4 hours to assess the incease in serum iron.
      Ferritin, hepcidin, iron , and c-reactive protein concentrations were measured in the serum
      at baselime. After two weeks other treatments were administered to each participant. The
      serum iron response curves for each treatment were constructed and the area under the curve
      (AUC) was calculated with the change of serum iron from baseline.
