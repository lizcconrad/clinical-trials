  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drains are routinely utilized in breast reconstruction when using abdominal tissue of the
      patient to remove fluid buildup while the body heals after surgery. However, drains are
      associated with patient discomfort, anxiety, decreased mobility, increased hospital stays and
      outpatient visits. Drains can also serve as a site of origin for infection as the system is
      not completely closed, and infectious organisms could theoretically use the drain as point of
      entry.

      This proposed study investigates a potential novel mechanism to prevent the development of
      seromas (pockets of clear fluid which can develop after surgery) in patients who undergo
      breast reconstruction with their own abdominal tissue. By eliminating the required use of a
      drain, the study team expects patients to have less pain and use less pain medication, as
      well as more satisfaction with their overall surgical experience.

      Objectives:

        1. Establish the safety of a lysine-derived urethane adhesive (TissuGlu, Cohera Medical) in
           patients undergoing autologous abdominal-based breast reconstruction. This will be
           assessed via analyzing complication profiles of patients post-operatively. The primary
           endpoints are rate of seroma development, need for seroma drainage and time to drain
           removal (if in drain group).

        2. Determine if there is a difference in pain and other quality of life measures when
           comparing patients who do and do not have abdominal drains. This will be assessed via
           pain medicine utilization and by delivering a targeted survey pre-operatively, as well
           as at post-operative day three and four weeks.

      Study Design:

      Patients will be randomized to one of three arms: 1) Traditional closed-suction drains, 2)
      TissuGlu with closed-suction drains and 3) TissuGlu without closed-suction drains.

    <masking_description>The study is &quot;semi-blind&quot; in that patients will not be told which treatment they are receiving. If the patient is assigned to one of the drains groups, she will know post-operatively that she has drains, but she will not know if TissueGlu was utilized. The doctor will be aware of what treatment the patient is receiving, as he or she will administer the drug</masking_description>
