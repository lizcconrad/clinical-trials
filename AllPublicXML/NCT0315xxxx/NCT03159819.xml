  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single arm, open-label pilot study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and
      engraftment of CAR-CLD18 T cells in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma and
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with gastric adenocarcinoma who have not been cured with first line
      chemotherapy, and who are not willing to undergo second line chemotherapy after the failure
      of first line chemotherapy while there are no effective therapies for their unmet medical
      needs known at this time, and for patients with advanced/metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma
      which has relapsed after surgery or for which there is no surgical indication, who have not
      been cured with or refused to receive other standard regimens, single or multiple doses of
      CAR-CLD18 T cells will be given to observe safety and efficacy of CAR-CLD18 T cells.

      Primary objectives:

      Determine the safety, tolerability and cytokinetics of the autologous T cells transduced with
      anti-Claudin18.2 lentiviral vector in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.

      Secondary objectives:

      Make a preliminary evaluation on the efficacy of CAR-CLD18 T cells in patients with gastric
      adenocarcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma with the following parameters:

      Time of tumor progression (TTP);

      Disease Control Rate (DCR);

      Objective Remission Rate (ORR);

      Overall Survival (OS).

    <description>During the trial conduction, especially within the 24 weeks of treatment phase when CAR-CLD18 T cell administered, all adverse events (including laboratory abnormality and clinical events) will be closely monitored, and all ≥ grade 3 adverse events per CTCAE (v 3.0) will be recorded, including but not limited to the toxicities potentially suspected to relate to infusion procedures and/or CAR-CLD18 T cell therapy as listed below:
Fever
Chills
Nausea, vomiting and other gastrointestinal symptoms
Fatigue
Hypotension
Respiratory distress
Tumor lysis syndrome

    <description>Duration of in vivo survival of CAR-CLD18 T cells is defined as &quot;engraftment&quot;. The primary engraftment endpoint is the number of DNA vector copies per mL blood of CAR-CLD18 T cells at regular intervals through week 4 following the initial infusion. Q-PCR for CAR-CLD18 T vector sequences will be performed until any 2 sequential tests are negative, documented as engraftment and persistence of CAR-CLD18 T cells.</description>

          1. Patients aged 18 - 70 with pathologically confirmed advanced gastric adenocarcinoma
             and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

          2. Biopsy confirmation of Claudin18.2 positive.

          3. Patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma who have not been cured with second line
             chemotherapy, and who are not willing to undergo second line chemotherapy after the
             failure of first line chemotherapy. (1) Failure of treatment is defined as disease
             progression, recurrence or metastatic disease, or intolerable toxicities occurred
             after treatment. (2) Each line of treatment during the period of disease progression

             weeks of neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy, it is considered as one line of systemic
