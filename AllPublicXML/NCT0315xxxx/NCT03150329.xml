    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vorinostat when given together
      with pembrolizumab in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular
      lymphoma, or Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back after a period of improvement or that does
      not respond to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab block cancer growth in
      different ways by targeting certain cells. Vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving vorinostat and pembrolizumab
      together may work better in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular
      lymphoma, or Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of vorinostat plus pembrolizumab therapy by
      evaluation of toxicities including: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and
      duration.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      vorinostat when given in combination with pembrolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary estimates of the anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab plus
      vorinostat therapy by assessing the overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) rate,
      duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate responses and disease progression according to the Lymphoma Response to
      Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria (LYRIC).

      II. Explore genomic biomarkers of response and resistance to pembrolizumab plus vorinostat
      therapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), or
      Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

      III. Explore immunologic biomarkers of response and resistance to pembrolizumab plus
      vorinostat therapy in patients with DLBCL, FL, or HL.

      IV. Explore the value of circulating DNA (ctDNA) as a biomarker of response to pembrolizumab
      plus vorinostat therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vorinostat.

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) twice a day (BID) on days 1-5 and 8-12 and
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for
      24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 12
      weeks.
