  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the second most common gastrointestinal malignancy. Abdominal discomfort
      is a main symptom in patients with pancreatic cancer. Approximately 75% have pain at
      diagnosis and over 90% in advanced stages. Pain control is an important part of the plan of
      care for patients with pancreatic cancer.. The celiac plexus is a group of nerves that supply
      organs in the abdomen. EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (EUS-CPN) has been widely used for
      pain management in patients with pancreatic cancer. Radiofrequency ablation of celiac ganglia
      or celiac plexus (EUS-RFA) is also being performed to alleviate abdominal pain in pancreatic
      cancer patients. However currently no comparative studies exist comparing EUS-CPN with
      EUS-RFA. The purpose of the study is to compare EUS-CPN with EUS-RFA for pain management in
      pancreatic patients, in order to determine which technique is better at improving pain in
      pancreatic cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the second most common gastrointestinal malignancy and fourth leading
      cause of cancer mortality. The incidence in the US is estimated at 8.8 per 100,000 population
      with 30,000 new cases diagnosed annually. The prognosis of unresectable pancreatic cancer is
      poor; overall 1 and 5-year survivals do not exceed 20 and 4%, respectively. For the minority
      of patients (15%) who are resectable at diagnosis, the median survival is 10-20 months, with
      5-year survival of 10-25%.

      Abdominal discomfort is a predominant symptom in patients with pancreatic cancer.
      Approximately 75% have pain at diagnosis and over 90% in advanced stages. Therefore a major
      aspect of palliation is provision of adequate pain control. The standard approach to pain
      management is based on the World Health Organization (WHO) 3-step ladder, beginning with
      non-opioid analgesics (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen),
      followed by weak opioids and then finally strong opioids as necessary. Virtually all patients
      require escalating doses of opioids during their disease. Adjuvant therapies, including other
      medications (e.g. trazodone, tricyclic anti-depressants, and bisphosphonates), palliative
      radionucleotides, external beam radiation, or chemotherapy may also be useful for symptomatic
      control.

      In the last 10 years, EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (EUS-CPN) has been widely practiced
      for alleviation of pain in patients with pancreatic cancer and has been shown to be
      effective. At our institution, radiofrequency ablation (EUS-RFA), which involves ablation of
      celiac ganglia or celiac plexus using a radiofrequency catheter, is being performed to
      alleviate abdominal pain in pancreatic cancer patients. However currently no comparative
      studies exist comparing EUS-CPN with EUS-RFA for pain alleviation in pancreatic cancer
      patients.

      In this randomized trial, the investigators will be comparing EUS-CPN with EUS-RFA for pain
      alleviation in pancreatic patients, in order to determine which technique is better at
      improving pain in pancreatic cancer patients.

    <description>CPN will be undertaken at the celiac space which is located between the aorta and the celiac artery origin. A 22 or 19-gauge Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) needle is used, and its tip is placed slightly anterior and cephalic to the origin of the celiac artery. Aspiration is first performed using a syringe to ensure that vascular puncture has not occurred. 10 mL Bupivacaine is injected first, followed by 20 mL of 98% alcohol.</description>

    <description>Once the celiac ganglia are identified on EUS, a 19-gauge FNA needle is inserted into the center of the ganglion or area of celiac plexus under EUS guidance. The radiofrequency (RF) probe (EMcision, Montreal, Canada) is advanced through the FNA needle. Radiofrequency ablation is performed via the probe for 90 seconds, followed by a 90 second rest and repeated as required.</description>
