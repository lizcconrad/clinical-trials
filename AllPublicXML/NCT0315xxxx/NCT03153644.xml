  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to describe how contraceptive services are currently being
      delivered to women with medical conditions who seek care in community-based primary care
      settings, such as family medicine and internal medicine clinical offices.

      This pilot study seeks to:

      1. To understand women's beliefs, attitudes, and experiences with contraception in context of
      their medical conditions, drug therapy, personal preferences, and current experiences in
      primary care.

      b. To describe provider- To describe provider- and practice-level factors that impact the
      delivery of contraceptive services in primary care.

      To seek the perspectives of multiple stakeholders: 1) women aged 18-45 with one or more
      medical conditions; and 2) practice members who consist of primary care providers (PCPs) and
      office staff (e.g. nurses, medical assistants, and administrative staff members). The
      specific objective of this formative, qualitative study is to identify key patient-,
      provider-, and practice-level factors that are critical to the delivery of contraceptive
      counseling and services to women with medical conditions.

      To accomplish these aims, qualitative data will be collected in clinical settings that
      currently provide primary care and family planning for reproductive-aged women with medical
      conditions. Data collected will be: 1) in-depth interviews with women with medical conditions
      and practice members; and 2) semi-structured observations of office activities and processes
      (e.g. patient check in, patient scheduling).

      Using rigorous qualitative mixed methods to collect and analyze data, a deeper understanding
      will be gained of factors that should be considered in the design and implementation of
      future interventions to improve contraceptive care for women with medical conditions in
      primary care.

        Identification of primary care practices (5-10) that provide primary care services and
        provide prescriptions for birth control and/or provide insertion/removal of contraceptive
        devices (the intrauterine device or sub-dermal implant) within southeast Michigan. Primary
        care physicians (30) and medical staff (30) within the primary care practices identified
        for recruitment will be approached for interviews. Approximately 30 women will be
        approached about participation in the study after the approval of the primary care
        physician. A convenience sampling approach will be used.

             requires medication management and/or active monitoring, like hypertension, diabetes)
             that would pose greater than average risk to the woman during pregnancy, including the
             use of medications that could be associated with potential fetal harm in the event of
