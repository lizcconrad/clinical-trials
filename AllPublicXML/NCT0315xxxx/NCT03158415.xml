  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this mixed-methods study is to explore the lived experience of parents of
      young adults ages 18 to 25 years with type 1 diabetes who are transitioning to independence,
      and to test the preliminary efficacy of a mobile education program to reduce parental
      distress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As young adults with T1D navigate the transition process to independence, they often do so in
      partnership with their parents, who are tasked with providing support and guidance. At this
      time, however, no structured education program exists for these parents. In addition, little
      is known about their learning needs, levels of distress, and readiness to provide appropriate
      guidance for their emerging adult children. This represents a gap in the literature and an
      opportunity to undertake exploratory research to learn more about this population so that
      meaningful education and support can be provided.

      Aim 1. To describe the lived experience and diabetes-specific educational needs of parents of
      young adults with type 1 diabetes who are transitioning to independence.

      Aim 2. To measure the effect of a mobile diabetes education program on diabetes distress
      levels of parents of young adults ages 18 to 25 years who are transitioning to independence.

    <description>The Modified Diabetes Distress Scale will be used pre- and post-intervention to measure the effect of a brief mobile diabetes education program on diabetes distress levels of parents of young adults ages 18 to 25 years who are transitioning to independence. Higher scores on the Distress Scale indicate higher levels of distress.</description>

During six weeks, participants will receive a reminder via text and/or email twice per week to invite them to view diabetes education materials on the study's mobile website, T1DToolkit.org. Topics on this website include, among others, Caregiver Burnout; Your Child is Now an Adult; Sharing Responsibility; Sources of Support; Common Fears for Parents of Young Adults; and Your Child, Your Child's Doctor, and You.</description>
