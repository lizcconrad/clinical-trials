  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human study designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary anti-tumor activity of LOXO-292
      administered orally to patients with advanced solid tumors, including RET-fusion non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC), medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and other tumors with increased RET
      activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2).
      During Part 1, patients with advanced NSCLC, advanced MTC or other advanced solid tumors are
      initially eligible if the tumor has progressed following or has not adequately responded to
      standard therapy, or if the patient is intolerant of, unlikely to benefit from or refuses
      standard therapy. During Part 2, patients with NSCLC, MTC or other advanced solid tumor that
      harbors a RET gene alteration or other evidence of increased RET activity are eligible.

             approval.

          -  Investigational agent or anticancer therapy within 5 half-lives or 2 weeks (14 days)

             half-lives or 2 weeks of prior therapy if considered by the Investigator to be safe
             and within the best interest of the patient, with prior Sponsor approval.

          -  Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) within 4 weeks prior to planned
             start of LOXO-292.

          -  Radiotherapy with a limited field of radiation for palliation within 1 week of planned
             start of LOXO-292, with the exception of patients receiving radiation to more than 30%
             of the bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation, which must be completed at least
             4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Symptomatic primary CNS tumor or metastases (stable CNS tumor/metastases is allowed).

          -  Clinically significant active cardiovascular disease or history of myocardial
             infarction within 6 months prior to planned start of LOXO-292 or prolongation of the
             QT interval corrected (QTcF) &gt; 470 msec.

          -  Required treatment with certain strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.
