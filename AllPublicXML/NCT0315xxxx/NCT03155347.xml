  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, parallel-group study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (SC) tocilizumab (162 milligrams [mg] every 2 weeks
      [Q2W]) given as monotherapy and in combination with MTX versus MTX given as monotherapy, in
      participants with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have inadequate
      response to current DMARD therapy. The study comprises a 24-week double-blind treatment
      phase, followed by a 24-week extension phase.
