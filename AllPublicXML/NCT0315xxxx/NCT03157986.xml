  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this study is to compare the effects of whole-body Vibration Training versus
      conventional Balance Training on Balance performance, gait quality and exercise capacity in
      patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients will be recruited during
      a 3-week inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program and will be randomized into one of two
      intervention groups. On top of a standardized endurance and strength Training program (5 days
      per week) patients in both groups will perform an additional Balance Training (on 3 days per
      week). Patients in both Groups will perform the same 4 different Balance exercises (2x1
      Minute each): dynamic squats with closed eyes, heel raise, semi-Tandem stance and single leg
      stance but on a different surface. The Vibration Training Group will perform the exercises on
      a side-alternating Vibration platform (Galileo) at frequencies between 15 to 26 Hertz and the
      control Group will perform exercises on instable objects like Balance pads. The degree of
      difficulty in both Groups will be individually adjusted and will be progressively increased,
      if possible.
