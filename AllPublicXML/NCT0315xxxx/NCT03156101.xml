  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, uni-center, phase I/II study to determine the safety and
      efficacy of an experimental therapy called BinD19 cells in patients with B-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma, who are chemo-refractory, relapsed after allogeneic SCT,
      or are otherwise ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant.
