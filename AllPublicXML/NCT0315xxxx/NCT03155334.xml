  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, open label, crossover, single site study is to compare the
      PISs of two Multiple Sclerosis clinical trials to elucidate potential aspects of the given
      written information that could impact on the smooth running of the studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participation to a clinical trial is based on two forms of information: the spoken
      information, usually given by a clinician during the enrolment meeting, and the written
      information, reported on the Participant Information Sheet (PIS). Numerous studies performed
      to improve and enhance informed consent, have used different methods to evaluate the quality
      of the given information such as: interview, checklist, questionnaire, readability formulae.
      Even if these tools can be useful, they show evident limits in detecting the real efficacy of
      the proposed consent form in terms of the patient's comprehension.

      User Testing (UT) is a method originally developed in the 1990 in Australia, to assess how a
      text about medicinal products performs with its intended users and not just its content.

      Generally, the UT is based on an iterative 4-step process in a cohort of participants (the
      target group):

        -  individual reading of the text;

        -  individual questionnaire for a quantitative and qualitative evaluation;

        -  a brief semi-structured interview to each participant;

        -  a text revision to address any problems identified from participant feedback; Then the
           revised document is tested again with a second cohort and this iterative process
           continues until all issues with the document are resolved. However, a methodological
           issue not yet explored is whether the UT could be used to compare two different PISs, in
           order to elucidate aspects that could be involved in improving or worsening the
           understanding of a PIS.

      UT has been recently used to evaluate the PIS belonging to phase I and phase III clinical
      trials (CT) in Myeloid Leukemia, immunomodulatory therapy and for poor responders in vitro
      fertilization. To date, in no case the UT method has been tested in patients affected by
      chronic disease like Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

      We want to apply the UT approach to highlight the critical issues and communication
      difficulties present in PISs used in MS clinical trials.
