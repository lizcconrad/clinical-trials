    <textblock>
      Similar clinical trial results demonstrated that anti-PD-1 antibodies prolonged OS to
      approximately 9 months compared with 6 months in docetaxel group. Anti-PD-1 therapy in
      Chinese squamous NSCLC patients will be investigated in this clinical trial.

      Additionally the correlation between PD-L1 expression and the response to IBI308 treatment in
      Chinese squamous cell NSCLC as well as the role of irRECIST in immune checkpoint inhibitor
      treatment evaluation will also be assessed
