  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare nivolumab alone to nivolumab plus
      ipilimumab when given to patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that can be
      surgically treated.

      Researchers want to learn how effective both study treatments may be in helping to control
      NSCLC after surgery.

      This is an investigational study. Nivolumab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of NSCLC that has spread. Ipilimumab is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of melanoma. Combining these drugs is investigational.

      Your doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 66 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group
      is better, the same, or worse than the other group.

      If you are in Group A, you will receive nivolumab alone.

      If you are in Group B, you will receive ipilimumab and nivolumab.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will receive nivolumab by vein over 60 minutes on Days 1, 15, and 29.

      If you are in Group B, you will also receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes on Day 1.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive 3 doses of nivolumab before your scheduled surgery. However, in some cases
      fewer than 3 doses of nivolumab may be allowed before surgery. If you are in Group B, you may
      receive 1 dose of ipilimumab.

      Your surgery to remove the disease will most likely be performed at least 21 days after the
      last dose of nivolumab. You will sign a separate consent form that explains the procedure and
      its risks.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up.

      Study Visits:

      Within 7 days before your Day 15 and Day 29 nivolumab doses:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 5Â½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

      At least 14 days after the last nivolumab dose on Day 29:

        -  You will have a PET-CT scan and a CT scan of the chest.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  You will have lung function tests.

        -  You will provide a stool sample for biomarker testing.

      Leftover tissue removed during surgery (normal tissue, tumor tissue, and lymph tissue) will
      be collected and stored at MD Anderson for use in future biomarker testing. No extra tissue
      will be removed, as it is tissue that would be removed anyway for surgery and to check the
      status of the disease. A research bank will be created so that biomarker testing can be
      performed for as long as needed.

      Your samples will be given a code number. No identifying information will be directly linked
      to your samples. Only the researcher in charge of the bank will have access to the code
      numbers and be able to link the samples to you. This is to allow medical data related to the
      samples to be updated as needed.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 8 weeks after surgery:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

      Follow-Up:

      After the end-of-treatment visit, your medical record will be reviewed or you will be called,
      contacted by mail, or e-mailed to check on your health. If you are called, these calls should
      last about 5 minutes. You may also be asked these questions during regularly scheduled clinic
      visits.

      The follow-up period will last for as long as the study doctor thinks the information is
      needed.

             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or
             interfere with the interpretation of study results

             to enroll

          8. Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement
             doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active
             autoimmune disease. Subjects are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra-articular,

             drug components

         13. Serious illness or concomitant non-oncological disease such as neurologic,
             psychiatric, infectious disease or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk
             associated with study participation or study drug administration and in the judgment
             of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the study

         14. Patients who are sexually active, with preserved reproductive capacity, and unwilling
             to use a medically acceptable method of contraception (e.g. such as implants,
             injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices or vasectomized
             partner for participating females, condoms for participating males) during and after
             the trial as detailed below:

         15. This is a continuation of 14): WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy
             for 23 weeks after the last dose of investigational drug(s); Men who are sexually
             active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than
             1% per year; Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be
             instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of
             investigational product; Women who are not of childbearing potential as well as
             azoospermic men do not require contraception
