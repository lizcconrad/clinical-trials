  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm study of 11 men with treatment refractory metastatic Castrate Resistant
      Prostate Cancer (CRPC) who will receive temsirolimus IV at a dose of 25 mg weekly until
      progression. Progression will not include Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) progression;
      however, upon PSA progression, the addition of an anti-androgen will be permitted. The
      primary objective of the study is to evaluate change in circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts
      over time in men with metastatic treatment-refractory CRPC in response to temsirolimus
      therapy.

    <measure>Mean Percent of N-cadherin Expression at Baseline and 8 Weeks of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measures of epithelial plasticity on CTCs in response to Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition with temsirolimus, using genomic and protein immunohistochemical methodology. N-cadherin was measured in CTCs captured using the CellSearch profile kit. The proportion of CTCs expressing N-cadherin was calculated and divided by the total number of CD45-negative, pan cytokeratin (CK) - positive, and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI+) intact cells to give a fractional expression of N-cadherin. Results are reported as a percentage.</description>

    <measure>Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Time in months from the start of study treatment to the date of first progression according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trial Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria, or to death due to any cause. Patients alive who had not progressed as of the last follow-up had PFS censored at the last follow-up date. Median PFS was estimated using a Kaplan-Meier curve. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Additionally, according to PCWG2 criteria, disease progression in bone is defined as 2 or more new lesions seen on bone scan compared with the baseline scan used for trial entry. Per PCWG2 guidelines, therapy was not discontinued solely due to a rise in PSA alone.</description>

        <description>Time in months from the start of study treatment to the date of first progression according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trial Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria, or to death due to any cause. Patients alive who had not progressed as of the last follow-up had PFS censored at the last follow-up date. Median PFS was estimated using a Kaplan-Meier curve. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Additionally, according to PCWG2 criteria, disease progression in bone is defined as 2 or more new lesions seen on bone scan compared with the baseline scan used for trial entry. Per PCWG2 guidelines, therapy was not discontinued solely due to a rise in PSA alone.</description>
