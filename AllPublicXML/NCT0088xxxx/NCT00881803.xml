  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron overload is a life-threatening condition that can lead to liver disease, cardiac
      disease, diabetes and arthritis. Simultaneous supplementation with both iron and AA may place
      individuals with SCI at risk for iron overload as well as oxidative damage by iron-generated
      free radicals. Both conditions of high and low iron stores may present with common signs and
      symptoms. Accurate diagnosis of iron disorder should consider CRP, hematocrit, hemoglobin,
      serum iron, TIBC, percent saturation of iron binding capacity, serum ferritin and hepcidin.

      The investigators are proposing a study to determine the effect of concurrent AA and iron
      supplementation on iron status of individuals with SCI. The investigators goal is to identify
      abnormal status that may be attributed to simultaneous supplementation of iron and AA to
      develop future supplementation protocols in this population for optimal iron status.
