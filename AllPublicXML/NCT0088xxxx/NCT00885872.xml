      This study is to evaluate the effect of rosuvastatin 10-20 mg on carotid atherosclerosis
      progression in Chinese patients by evaluating the change in the percentage of volume of lipid
      rich necrotic core (LRNC) using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after
      24-months treatment.

          2. LDL-C concentration ≥ 100mg/dl (2.6mmol/L), but less than 250mg/dl (6.5mmol/L); and TG
             ≤ 353mg/dl (4.0mmol/L).

          3. New patients in regard to statin therapy.

          4. 16%-69% carotid artery stenosis by duplex ultrasound. At least one or more carotid
             plaques detectable in either the right or left side of the carotid artery 2.4 cm
             proximal and 2.4 cm distal to the bifurcation. Plaque must be more than 3 mm thick
             with calcification presenting less than 50% of the plaque area. The plaque must have a
             LRNC and intact fibrous cap detected by contrast-enhanced MRI (CE MRI).

          5. Female patients must agree to use an effective form of birth control throughout the
             2-year study treatment period. They must be either documented post-menopausal,
             physically or surgically incapable of bearing children, or using barrier contraceptive
             methods. In addition to using contraception, women of childbearing potential must also
             have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening.

          6. The patients who are willing to be enrolled have to remain on the low cholesterol
             dietary (refer to Chinese Guideline on Treatment of Dyslipidemia in Adult) for the
             study duration.
