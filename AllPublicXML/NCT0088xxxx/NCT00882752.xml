  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The method used for the biopsy analysis may be able to provide important insights into the
      complex microbial communities found in the human colon or in complex human infections.
      Therefore, this methodology may prove useful to other researchers or physicians.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The method used to identify the microbes in the sample was chosen because it had the
      potential to provide more exhaustive identification of the bacteria present in the sample as
      compared to culturing methodology. The molecular method worked well, so it is appropriate to
      share the method with the medical and scientific communities.
