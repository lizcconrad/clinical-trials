      chest (HRCT) in the investigation of an outbreak of TB that developed in the South Korean
      army.

      Outbreak investigation including tuberculin skin test (TST), QuantiFERONÂ® TB Gold In-Tube
      (QFT), and simple chest radiography (CXR) will be performed. For participants with any
      abnormal findings in these tests, HRCT will be carried out. Active pulmonary TB is diagnosed
      based on sputum studies or HRCT findings. In addition, participants with positive results
      both in TST and QTF will be treated as having a latent TB infection (LTBI). TST and QTF were
      repeated in participants with positive result in one of these tests. CXR will be repeated in
      all participants at 3 and 6 months of follow-up.
