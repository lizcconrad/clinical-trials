  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of an alternative treatment for deep caries lesions in Public Health Services.
      The alternative treatment consists of partial removal of carious dentine followed by
      restoration. The subjects were assigned to test or control groups: test - carious dentine
      partial removal and restoration in one session, and control - stepwise excavation. The
      stepwise excavation consists of partial removal of carious tissue from the cavity floor,
      indirect pulp capping with calcium hydroxide cement; temporary filling; cavity re-opening
      after 60 days, removal of the remaining soft carious tissue and filling. Each group was
      divided according to the filling material: amalgam or resin. The radiological exams are being
      performed before and after the treatment and then annually. Clinical evaluation of the
      restorations is performed right after the treatment and then annually (modified USPHS
      System). All evaluations are performed by calibrated and trained dentists.

    <description>All procedures will be carrying out under local anesthesia and rubber dam. The treatment will be performed as follow: access to the lesion using rotator instruments (if necessary); fully removal of carious tissue from the cavity walls according to hardness criteria by rotator instruments and/or hand excavator; removal of the necrotic carious tissue (soft and disorganized carious tissue) from the cavity floor by hand excavator (to avoid pulp exposure); cleaning with distilled water and drying with sterile filter paper; group randomization. If the tooth is assigned to test group: cavity floor covered with calcium hydroxide cement; restoration using amalgam or steel crown following their usual clinical procedures based on the instructions of the manufacturer</description>
