  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To characterize the effects of discontinuation of denosumab therapy on variables of bone
      histology in postmenopausal women with low bone mass or osteoporosis. Patients who have
      received denosumab and completed study 20050179 (NCT00293813), completed study 20050141
      (NCT00330460), completed study 20060237 (NCT00515463), completed study 20030216 (NCT00089791)
      but did not enroll in study 20060289 (NCT00523341) will be included in this study. Patients
      who will participate in the off-treatment imaging study for 20080747 (NCT00890981) are also
      eligible.

      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator’s discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multi-center studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
