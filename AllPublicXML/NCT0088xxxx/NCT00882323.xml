  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) has been used in severe aplastic anemia as a part of the
      conditioning regimen. Among the many kinds of ATG preparations, thymoglobulin had been found
      to be more effective in preventing graft versus host disease (GVHD) and rejection of organ
      transplants. As the fludarabine based conditioning regimens without total body irradiation
      have been reported to be promising for transplantation from alternative donors in SAA,
      thymoglobulin was added to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide conditioning to reduce GVHD and
      to allow good engraftment in unrelated donor transplantation. Our previous phase II study of
      fludarabine, cyclophosphamide plus thymoglobulin conditioning resulted in good engraftment
      (100%) and survival rate (74%). But grade III/IV toxicities occurred in 25% of patients and
      all events were treatment related mortalities. As cyclophosphamide is more toxic agent than
      fludarabine, we plan a new phase II study re; 'reduced toxicity fludarabine, cyclophosphamide
      plus thymoglobulin conditioning regimen for unrelated donor transplantation in severe
      aplastic anemia' by reducing dosage of cyclophosphamide and increasing dosage of fludarabine.
