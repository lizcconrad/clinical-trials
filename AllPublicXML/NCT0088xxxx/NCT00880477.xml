      This study will assess the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of GSK Biological's
      DTPa-HBV-IPV/ Hib vaccine as compared to GSK's DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine co-administered with HBV
      according to a three-dose immunisation course and as a booster dose in infants born to
      hepatitis B antigen seronegative mothers and previously primed with a birth dose of GSK's HBV
      vaccine.
