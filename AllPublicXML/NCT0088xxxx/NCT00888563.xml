      Background:

        -  People with many different diseases have symptoms of fatigue, which is a general sense
           of tiredness; however, the causes are not fully understood. Fatigue symptoms may be
           related to a person s level of fitness, health, and blood chemistries.

        -  Researchers are studying the potential role of plasma cytokines (signaling molecules)
           and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (part of the neuroendocrine system that
           controls stress) functioning in symptoms of fatigue.

      Objectives:

        -  To characterize the symptoms of fatigue in healthy individuals.

        -  To collect information on fatigue, pain, depression, stress, sleepiness, and quality of
           life from healthy adults of all ages.

        -  To compare results obtained from people with various illnesses to better understand
           possible causes of fatigue that are associated with those diseases.

      Eligibility:

        -  Physically and mentally healthy volunteers18 years of age or older who can speak and
           read the English language.

        -  Exclusion criteria include individuals with a disease or condition causing significant
           fatigue (congestive heart failure, cancer, or sleep disorders), individuals taking
           medicines that cause fatigue (beta blockers, diuretics, or narcotics), and individuals
           who have a major psychiatric condition (major depression, anxiety disorder, or
           schizophrenia).

        -  The following individuals may not participate: those who have two more alcoholic drinks
           per day, who use illicit drugs, or who drink more than 4 cups of coffee, 8 cups of soda
           or tea, or similar amounts of other caffeine-containing beverages a day, or eat more
           than 1 pound of chocolate per day; and individuals who worked evenings or night shifts
           in the past month.

        -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are not eligible.

      Design:

        -  Participants must make two outpatient visits to the Clinical Center. Each visit will
           last 5 hours and participants must refrain from smoking and consuming alcohol and
           caffeine for at least 24 hours.

        -  During the first study visit, researchers will conduct the following tests:

             -  Psychiatric interview, medical history, pregnancy test, and drug test.

             -  Urine test to measure the levels of stress hormones.

             -  Questionnaires that measure fatigue, pain, depression, stress, daytime sleepiness,
                and activity.

             -  Physical fitness test, including strength tests, walking tests, and physical
                activity monitoring.

        -  Before the second study visit, patients must refrain from smoking and consuming caffeine
           and alcohol for at least 24 hours and have nothing, even water, by mouth after midnight.
           During the second study visit, the following tests will be conducted:

             -  Stress hormone test (participant will receive a cortisol-releasing hormone).

             -  Four intravenous blood draws to determine cytokine profiles, gene expression, and
                levels of stress hormones (immune and gentic analysis).

        -  Participants will receive a small financial compensation for participation in the study.

      This protocol is designed to characterize the symptoms of fatigue in healthy individuals
      using standardized questionnaires and determine if physical activity, pain, depression,
      fatigue

      catastrophizing, stress, and daytime sleepiness play a role in the experience. This study
      will also examine the potential role of plasma cytokines and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
      axis (HPA) functioning in symptoms of fatigue in healthy individuals.

      Eligible participants will complete questionnaires that measure fatigue, pain, depression,
      fatigue catastrophizing, perceived stress, daytime sleepiness, neurological health, and
      physical activity. Participants will also perform strength testing (e.g. hand grips), walk
      testing (6-minute walk test), exercise testing on a treadmill, and physical activity
      monitoring using a portable activity device. Blood samples will be obtained to determine
      cytokine profiles, gene expression, and levels of stress hormones (cortisol,
      dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], catecholamines). Urine samples will also be obtained to
      measure the levels of stress hormones excreted. Information collected in this protocol will
      be used to make comparison in subjects who experience extreme symptoms of fatigue due to many
      different disorders, in order to better understand the mechanisms of fatigue.
