  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with a nucleoside analogue and subsequent viral decline has shown to partially
      restore immune hyporesponsiveness in chronic hepatitis B patients. Recent pilot studies
      investigating whether the effect of lowering viral load with nucleoside analogue therapy
      prior to the initiation of peginterferon results in higher sustained off-treatment responses
      showed contradictory findings.

      The aim of this study is to investigate sustained off-treatment response to peginterferon
      alfa-2b in chronic HBeAg-positive hepatitis B patients who are pretreated with nucleos(t)ide
      analogues, thereby lowering viral load

             peginterferon alfa-2b

          -  HBV DNA &lt; 2000 IU/ml during nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment within one month prior to
             initiation of peginterferon alfa-2b

          -  Compensated liver disease

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days of entry to this protocol

          -  Severe hepatitis activity as documented by ALT&gt;10 x ULN

          -  History of decompensated cirrhosis (defined as jaundice in the presence of cirrhosis,
             ascites, bleeding gastric or esophageal varices or encephalopathy)

          -  Pre-existent neutropenia (neutrophils &lt;1,800/mm3) or thrombocytopenia (platelets
             &lt;90,000/mm3)

          -  Co-infection with hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus or human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV)

          -  Other acquired or inherited causes of liver disease: alcoholic liver disease, obesity
             induced liver disease, drug related liver disease, auto-immune hepatitis,
             hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency

          -  Alpha fetoprotein &gt; 50 ng/ml

          -  Hyper- or hypothyroidism (subjects requiring medication to maintain TSH levels in the
             normal range are eligible if all other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met)

          -  Immune suppressive treatment within the previous 6 months

          -  Contra-indications for alfa-interferon therapy like suspected hypersensitivity to
             interferon or Peginterferon or any known pre-existing medical condition that could

          -  Pregnancy, breast-feeding

          -  Other significant medical illness that might interfere with this study: significant
             pulmonary dysfunction in the previous 6 months, malignancy other than skin
             basocellular carcinoma in previous 5 years, immunodeficiency syndromes (e.g. HIV
             positivity, auto-immune diseases, organ transplants other than cornea and hair
             transplant)

          -  Substance abuse, such as alcohol (&gt;80 g/day), I.V. drugs and inhaled drugs in the past
             2 years.

          -  Any other condition which in the opinion of the investigator would make the patient
             unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere with the patient participating in and
             completing the study
