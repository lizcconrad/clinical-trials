  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in Europe and North and South America. The primary aim of this
      observational study is to evaluate the frequency and pattern of bleeding episodes in
      haemophilia patients receiving preventative treatment with activated recombinant human factor
      VII. The secondary aim is to evaluate which patients are selected for this treatment, the
      dose and dose intervals used, and the safety of activated recombinant human factor VII when
      used as prevention. The study also aims to increase understanding of the unmet medical need
      and clinical relevance of preventative treatment in haemophilia patients.

          <description>Percent change in bleed episodes per month between pre-prophylaxis period and prophylaxis period by location of joint, target joint (= 3 or more documented bleeds in the same joint over the course of 6 months) or non-joint. All joints = target joints and non-target joints.</description>
          <population>Frequent bleeding population is a subset of patients in the bleeding population with at least one bleed per month in the pre-prophylaxis period of approx. 6 months. Patients from the French sites were not included because bleed location was not collected in these patients. Bleed episodes with no recorded locations were not included in the analysis</population>
