      The purpose of the study is to determine whether anticoagulant use (i.e. salicylates,
      clopidogrel, low-molecular weight heparin, or coumarin derivates) is able to prevent the
      development of the sinusoidal obstruction syndrome secondary to oxaliplatin-based neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy in patients suffering from colorectal liver metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection remains the only curative treatment for patients suffering from colorectal
      liver metastases, but only 15-25% of patients are initially eligible for resection. The
      majority of patients suffering from colorectal liver metastases receives chemotherapy prior
      to liver surgery in order to downsize the colorectal liver metastases. Preoperative treatment
      with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is related to sinusoidal injury, the so-called sinusoidal
      obstruction syndrome. Patients with histologically proven sinusoidal injury undergoing liver
      surgery have a higher risk of post-resectional morbidity. Damage to the hepatic sinusoids is
      a key factor for the development of the sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Anticoagulants (i.e.
      salicylates, clopidogrel, low-molecular weight heparin, or coumarin derivates) might be able
      to prevent this damage and, consequently, the development of the sinusoidal obstruction
      syndrome in patients suffering from colorectal liver metastases treated with neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy.
