      The purpose of this study is to find out if patients having the ON-Q post-op Pain Relief
      System for pain management of multiple rib fractures will require fewer ventilator days, and
      will need less IV pain medicine to control their pain, and as a result have improved
      respiratory function during their recovery.

      The standard of care for providing pain relief for rib fractures is to use an opioid drug
      that is injected into the vein but also has side effects. Increased doses can lead to over
      sedation and consequently lead to difficulty with breathing. The ON-Q pain relief systems
      uses a local anesthetic under the skin. The anesthetic is called bupivicaine, and it is
      delivered from a thin tube approximately 10 inches long is tunneled under the skin along the
      back and parallel to the spine. The medication is stored in an elastic pump which delivers a
      slow continuous drip of medication from multiple holes in the tubing. Subjects will be
      randomized to either standard intravenous opioid pain management or the ON-Q pain relief
      device with supplemental opioid medication if needed. The device will remain in use until the
      subjects are able to breathe without the ventilator.
