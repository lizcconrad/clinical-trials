      Previous studies by this team of investigators has determined that male infants are more
      likely to display more severe neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) as a result of maternal
      opioid use during pregnancy (Jansson, 2007)and there is appears to be a gender-related
      biologic vulnerability to NAS expression (Jansson, 2009, submitted). The proposed study
      explores the relationship between fetal gender and substance abuse treatment outcomes among a
      population of women in comprehensive substance abuse treatment to explore the possibility of
      a psychosocial vulnerability among drug exposed male fetuses as opposed to female fetuses.
      Women in substance abuse treatment are a group at high risk for current exposure to violence,
      usually at the hands of significant others, and having a history of sexual abuse as a child,
      usually resulting from contact with a male family member. Therefore, they often have
      difficult relationships with men. At the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy (CAP), a 2006
      study revealed that among a group of 715 pregnant women, reports of the exposure to violence
      was very high. Their rates of lifetime abuse ranged from 72.7% for physical abuse to 44.5%
      for sexual abuse. Rates of abuse remained high during their current pregnancy, ranging from
      20% for physical abuse to 7.1% for sexual abuse (Velez, 2006). The abuse was very often at
      the hands of partners or other male family member perpetrators. We hypothesize that women
      carrying male fetuses will be less likely to remain complaint in drug treatment or abstinent
      from illicit drug use, while women carrying female fetuses may be more likely to remain drug
      abstinent and treatment compliant. If supported, this theory has the potential to inform
      fetal gender specific treatment for pregnant drug dependent women. Additionally, we seek to
      support the previously documented link between male gender and more severe expression of NAS,
      and explore the relationship between other maternal prescribed drug use (i.e. psychotropic
      medications) and severity of NAS expression.
