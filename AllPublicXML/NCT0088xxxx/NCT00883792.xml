  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major burden in western countries. The disease develops from
      precursor lesions during a long time-interval. Colonoscopy can detect and remove CRC
      precursor lesions and may thus be effective for CRC prevention. Many national and
      international health organisations demand evidence from randomised trials to reduce incidence
      or mortality of the target disease before advocating population-wide cancer screening.
      However, while colonoscopy screening for the prevention of colorectal cancer is established
      in the United States and several European countries, no randomised trials exist to quantify
      the possible benefit of colonoscopy screening. NordICC is a randomised trial investigating
      the effect of colonoscopy on CRC incidence and mortality.

      NordICC is a multicentre, randomised trial in Nordic countries, the Netherlands and Poland. A
      minimum of 66 000 individuals, age 55-64 years, are drawn randomly from the population
      registries in the participating countries. 22 000 are invited for once-only colonoscopy (2:1
      randomisation). Expected work-load with 50% compliance will be 11,000 colonoscopies. At the
      screening examination, all detected lesions are biopsied and removed whenever possible. The
      remaining 44 000 individuals (control group) are not offered any screening examination (care
      as usual).The primary study aims are CRC incidence and CRC mortality after 15 years of
      follow-up, with an interim analysis after 10 years of follow-up. In an intention-to-treat
      approach, a risk reduction of CRC mortality of 25% in the colonoscopy screening group
      compared to the control group is expected after 10 years follow-up, estimating 50% compliance
      in the screening group.

    <description>The control group will not be offered any screening or intervention within the trial, but follow usual care in the participating countries. Individuals assigned to the control group will not be informed about their status as controls in the trial. This approach facilitates a truly population-based study, which will be used to estimate the effect of the screening intervention in the general population, mimicking national CRC screening programs.
All ethics committees at the participating centres have approved the study protocol before recruiting individuals to the trial. In Sweden, the national ethics committee particularly reviewed the non-information of the control group and found it ethically acceptable.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  This study is a population-based randomised controlled trial, with randomisation of
             individuals age 55-64 years living in the screening areas directly from the Population
             Registries to either screening group or control group. Eligible persons with the same
             home address will be randomised to the same group (household randomisation).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with previous colorectal surgery (resections, enterostomies)

          -  Individuals in need of long-lasting attention and nursing services (somatic or
             psychosocial, mental retardation).

          -  On-going cytotoxic treatment or radiotherapy for malignant disease

          -  Severe chronic (longer than trial duration) cardiac (NYHA III-IV)or lung disease

          -  Lifelong anticoagulant therapy with Warfarin

          -  A coronary event requiring hospitalization during the last 3 months

          -  A cerebrovascular event during the last 3 months

          -  Resident abroad

          -  Return of unopened letter of invitation and/or reminder (address unknown)
