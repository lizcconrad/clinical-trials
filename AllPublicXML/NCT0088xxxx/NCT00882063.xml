      The purpose of this study is to determine safety of P276-00 in patients with advanced
      multiple myeloma and whether P276-00 is effective in the treatment of advanced cases of
      multiple myeloma.

      This is an open label multicenter study of P276-00 in subjects with Relapsed and/or
      Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma. Cohort of 3 subjects will be enrolled at starting dose
      of P276-00 which is 50 mg/m2/day to be given intravenously from day 1 to day 5 every 21 days.
      This 21 day administration constitutes one cycle of P276-00. Six such cycles will be
      administered to the subjects. If the dose is well tolerated then next cohort will be enrolled
      at higher dose level of P276-00 till maximum tolerated dose is determined. Safety assessment
      will be repeated at regular interval and efficacy assessment will be repeated during every
      cycles.After the subject completes 6 cycles, there will be a follow-up visit after 4 weeks
      (+1 week) of study completion.Subjects who have stable disease or who have responded (MR, PR
      or CR) after completion of the 6 cycles will be given the option to continue treatment for a
      maximum of 12 cycles or until they are deemed to have progressive disease.
