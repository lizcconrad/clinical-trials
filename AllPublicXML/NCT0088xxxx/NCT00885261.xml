  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is considered as the epidemic of the century. Central obesity is one of the metabolic
      syndrome's features. It has been proven that obesity can cause back pain and headaches; thus,
      there might be a link between chronic pain and the syndrome.

      The objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients
      suffering from chronic pain.

      All patients will answer a questionnaire, their hip circumference will be measured, and their
      BMI will be calculated (weight/(height)2 ).

      The patients' blood pressure will be measured. The patients will be asked to bring their
      blood tests (lipids and glucose).
