  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early fixation of unstable fractures of the femur, pelvis, and acetabulum reduces some
      complication rates. However, in patients with multiple injuries, the optimal treatment of
      skeletal trauma may be affected by severe injury to the head, chest, or abdomen. The
      relationship between associated injury severity and the timing of definitive management of
      unstable fractures is not well-understood. The practice of &quot;early total care,&quot; early
      definitive fracture management, has been criticized by some, who have suggested that
      additional hemorrhage with surgery may be associated with a deleterious systemic inflammatory
      response. The alternative extreme of &quot;damage control orthopedics (DCO)&quot; has been recently
      proposed as a means of providing provisional stability of major skeletal injury, generally
      through external fixation. It is speculated that DCO will diminish the potential for systemic
      compromise. However, the need for further (definitive) surgery on a delayed basis, and the
      potential additional complications and costs associated with this strategy are controversial.
      The investigators' goals are to define which injuries or parameters warrant delay of
      definitive orthopaedic care, and to determine what time interval for fracture fixation
      promotes optimal patient outcome. The investigators will assess the effects of fracture
      fixation on head injury, chest injury, abdominal injury, mortality, complications, patient
      outcomes, and costs.
