  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal leukocytapheresis (LCAP) or granulocytapheresis (GCAP) has been used in the
      treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis and has shown
      promising safety and efficacy. LCAP and GCAP seem to be effective for steroid-resistant
      inflammation. The investigators have already reported safety and efficacy of GCAP in
      refractory asthma and expect the beneficial effect of LCAP in refractory asthma. In this
      study, in order to improve the therapeutic effect of LCAP by increasing the quantity of
      leukocytes that were removed, the investigators conducted a clinical study to investigate
      safety and efficacy of high-dose LCAP performed using a larger filter and an increased dose
      of the blood volume per body weight treated, as an possible therapy for refractory asthma.
