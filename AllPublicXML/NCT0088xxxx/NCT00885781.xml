      Comparison of efficacy and safety of two lipid emulsion products will be performed on
      gastrectomy patients postsurgically.

      The comparison of two lipid emulsion product will be performed. Patients who plan to accept
      gastrectomy will be consider for trial and signed content will be obtained. If the patient
      needs total parenteral nutrition (TPN) treatment after surgery for at least 5 days and meets
      all criteria, then he/she will be enrolled and randomized to ether of the groups, SMOFlipid
      or Lipovenoes MCT. During the treatment period, efficacy variables and safety variables will
      be measured. Life quality evaluation will also be performed through questionnaires
      collection.
