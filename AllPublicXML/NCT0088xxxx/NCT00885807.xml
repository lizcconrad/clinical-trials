      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the psychometric validation of the Weiss Functional
      Impairment Rating Scale and the Weiss Symptom Record. It is hypothesized that the Weiss
      Functional Impairment Rating Scale has strong psychometric properties and good convergent
      validity with other measures of functioning and discriminant validity from symptoms and
      quality of life.

      The measures for this rating scale were developed at the request of the Canadian Attention
      Deficit Disorder Resource Alliance to provide clinician friendly tools free of charge as a
      way of improving screening for ADHD and comorbidity.

      Patients are consented during clinic visits and agree to allow use of clinic data for the
      purpose of this research. They complete additional measure(s) for the purpose of the study.
      The data is then entered.

      Internal consistency will be measured using Cronbach's alpha. Convergent, concurrent and
      discriminant validity will be measured using Pearson correlations. Domain reliability is
      determined with factor analysis. Up to 220 patients will be enrolled in the study.
