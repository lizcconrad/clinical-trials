  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitroglycerin will increase the effectiveness of treatment with induction chemotherapy and
      concurrent chemo-radiotherapy by reducing chemo-radio resistance through an increased oxygen
      pressure in tumoral tissue. The combination treatment of nitroglycerin and chemotherapy will
      result in longer disease-free and over-all survival in patients with locally advanced NSCLC

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nitroglycerin decreases hypoxia-induced resistance to antitumor drugs due to inhibition of
      Hypoxia Inducible Factor alfa (HIF-1α), it increases oxygen pressure in tumoral tissue by
      augmenting tumor blood flow, increases apoptosis, activation of p53, and induces cellular
      growth inhibition. Randomized studies showed that the addition of transdermal nitroglycerin
      to non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with metastasis treated with vinorelbine and
      cisplatin achieved a significantly better global response to treatment than conventional
      treatment
