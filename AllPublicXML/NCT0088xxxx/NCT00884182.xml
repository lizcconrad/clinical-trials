      This study is part of an effort to develop an effective vaccination program in children in
      the event of a pandemic.

      Study objectives:

        -  To describe the safety profiles in the periods following each vaccination in subjects
           receiving different vaccination schedule.

        -  To describe the immune response after each vaccination in subjects receiving study
           vaccine.
