    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to utilize the PERPOS™ PLS System for transfacet lumbar spine
      fixation to evaluate its effect on patients' level of pain, procedural complications and
      functional status.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PERPOS™ PLS System involves a minimally invasive, percutaneous implant procedure via a
      small incision.

      The PERPOS™ PLS is intended for lumbar bilateral facet fixation, with or without bone graft,
      at single or multiple levels from L1 to S1.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females and males between 18 and 85

          -  Must have lumbar facet disease confirmed by:

               1. Documented pain relief with controlled lumbar facet block using local anesthetic
                  or steroid administration; AND

               2. MRI or CT scan, with or without bone scan, obtained within 3 months of
                  enrollment, confirming arthritic facet joints OR, must have lumbar facet disease
                  (as confirmed above) and are contra-indicated for steroid injections, or
                  non-compliant with conservative pain management treatments, or wish to avoid the
                  side-effects of steroids or prescriptive pain medication treatment

          -  Must score at least 4 on a 10-point Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for back pain

          -  Must score at least 40% on the Oswestry Disability Index.

          -  Must have less than 50% disc height loss

          -  Must have no greater than Grade I spondylolisthesis demonstrated on flexion and
             extension lumbar radiographs taken within 2 months of enrollment

          -  Willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol including follow-up
             requirements

          -  Willing and able to sign a study specific informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are within the first two PERPOS PLS System utilization experience of the investigator

          -  Have severe facet degeneration, radiographic findings of severe facet joint disease,
             degeneration of misshapen facet(s) or structural anomalies at the target fusion level
             that would preclude proper placement of the BONE-LOK Implant.

          -  Have evidenced malingering behavior related to workman's compensation claims

          -  Have had any significant prior intervention (greater than an injection) in the facet
             joint to be treated, or within two (2) levels above or two (2) levels below the facet
             joint to be treated

          -  Have had prior instrumentation of involved vertebrae at any time

          -  Have osteoporotic bone at the lumbar spine level to be treated based on the SCORE
             (Simple Calculated Osteoporosis Risk Estimation) screening questionnaire, (or a DEXA
             bone density measured T score &lt;-1.0.).

          -  Have scoliosis with lateral angulation &gt;20 degrees
