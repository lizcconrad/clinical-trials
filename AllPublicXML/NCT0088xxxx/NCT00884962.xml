    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, non-controlled Pilot Study. Approximately 24 patients
      will be assigned to one of 3 treatment groups (8 patients each group). Patients in each group
      will receive 2, 4, and 6 (3 followed by a retreatment of 3) subsegmental treatments,
      respectively. All patients will receive treatment in a single lung under conscious sedation
      or general anesthesia. Patients will be followed for 24 weeks after completion of PLVR
      treatment(s). Upon completion of 12-week follow-up, all safety and efficacy data will be
      analyzed to determine an effective treatment dose. Thereafter, Group 1 patients may elect to
      be retreated at additional sites so that their total dose received is consistent with the
      effective dose. All study patients will receive standard medical therapy in addition to PLVR.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of advanced upper lobe predominant (ULP) emphysema or
             advanced disease in the superior lower lobes as defined by FEV1/FVC &lt;70 % predicted,
             FEV1 of &lt; 50% predicted, TLC &gt; 100% of predicted, and RV &gt; 135% predicted.

          -  Patients must have persistent symptoms despite medical therapy and either not be
             candidates for Lung Volume Reduction Surgery (LVRS) or have elected not to undergo
             LVRS.

          -  Patients must be &gt; 40 years of age, have symptoms despite medical therapy, and have
             none of the pre-specified co-morbid conditions that could influence study outcomes or
             their ability to tolerate bronchoscopy.
