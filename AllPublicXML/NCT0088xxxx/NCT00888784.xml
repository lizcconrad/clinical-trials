    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to study the efficacy of
      beta blockers versus endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection in the prevention of gastric variceal
      (GOV2 or IGV1) rebleeding and improvement in survival.

    <description>Propranolol was started at a dose of 20 mg twice daily. The principle of incremental dosing was used to achieve the target heart rate for propranolol. The dose was increased every alternate day to achieve a target heart rate of 55/min or to the maximal dose to 360 mg/day if the medication was well tolerated and the systolic blood pressure was &gt;90 mm Hg. On the occurrence of intolerable adverse effects, systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg or pulse rate &lt;55/min, the dose of the medication was decreased step-wise, and eventually stopped if these adverse events persisted. Reintroduction of the medication was attempted if cessation of the medication did not result in improvement of the reported side-effect.</description>
