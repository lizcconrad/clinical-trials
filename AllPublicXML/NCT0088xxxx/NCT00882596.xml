        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able and willing to sign informed consent

          -  Age 50 or older at diagnosis

          -  Life expectancy greater than 10 years (excluding diagnosis of breast cancer)

          -  Surgical treatment of the breast must have been lumpectomy. The margins of the
             resected specimen must be histologically free of tumor (negative surgical margins per
             NSABP criteria)

          -  On histologic examination, the tumor must be DCIS and/or invasive breast carcinoma

          -  For patients with invasive breast cancer, an axillary staging procedure must be
             performed [either sentinel node biopsy or axillary dissection (with a minimum of 6
             axillary nodes removed), and the axillary node(s) must be pathologically negative]

          -  The T stage must be Tis, T1, or T2. If T2, the tumor must be less than or equal to 3.0
             cm in maximum diameter

          -  Estrogen receptor positive tumor

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 50 at diagnosis (regardless of histology)

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  Active collagen vascular disease

          -  Paget's disease of the breast

          -  Prior history of DCIS or invasive breast cancer

          -  Prior breast or thoracic radiation therapy for any condition

          -  Multicentric carcinoma (DCIS or invasive)

          -  Synchronous bilateral invasive or non-invasive breast cancer

          -  Surgical margins that cannot be microscopically assessed or that are positive

          -  Positive axillary node(s)

          -  T stage of T2 with the tumor &gt; 3 cm in maximum diameter or a T stage of T3 or T4

          -  Estrogen receptor negative tumor
