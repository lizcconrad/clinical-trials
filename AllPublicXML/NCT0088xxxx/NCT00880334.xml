    <textblock>
      In this research study the investigators are looking to see if the combination of docetaxel
      plus Vandetanib is effective in the treatment of metastatic transitional cell carcinoma
      (TCC). Docetaxel is a chemotherapy drug that kills cancer cells that are dividing. It is
      widely used in TCC. Vandetanib is a drug that is believed to stop new blood vessels from
      forming around cancer cells. The combination of docetaxel and Vandetanib has been studied in
      people with lung cancer and found to be helpful in killing cancer cells. Thus, this study is
      looking at people with TCC, to see if the combination of docetaxel plus Vandetanib is better
      or worse then docetaxel alone.

      -  Because no one knows which of the study options is best, and all of the options are
           considered equally likely to work, participants will be randomized into one of two study
           groups: docetaxel plus Vandetanib or docetaxel plus placebo.

        -  Each treatment cycle lasts three weeks during which time the participant will be taking
           Vandetanib or placebo once a day, every day. On Day 1 of each cycle (a cycle is 21
           days), participants will receive docetaxel as an infusion through a vein in the arm over
           one hour.

        -  On Day 1 of every cycle the following tests and procedures will be performed: physical
           exam and blood tests. On day 1 and on Day 8 of the first cycle only, participants will
           have an ECG. Every 6-9 weeks (every 2 to 3 cycles), the participants tumor will be
           assessed by x-ray, CT scan, bone scan, and/or MRI.

    <measure>Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease evaluations occurred at week 6 and 12 and thereafter every 3 cycles/9 weeks on treatment and every 3 months in follow-up. Participants were followed until PD, death or lost to follow-up. Median survival follow-up was 12 months (range 1-26).</time_frame>
    <description>PFS based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the time between randomization and documented disease progression (PD) per RECIST 1.0 criteria or death, or is censored at time of last disease assessment. Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or appearance of new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

    <measure>Grade 3-5 Toxicity Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed each cycle throughout treatment from time of first dose and up to day 30 post-treatment. Median treatment duration for this study cohort approximated 2 cycles (range 1-31).</time_frame>
    <description>Grade 3-5 toxicity rate is the percentage of participants experiencing maximum grade of all toxicity types of grade 3-5 with any attribution on treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Off treatment, patients were followed for survival information every 6 months (±1 month) until death,up to 2 years after discontinuing therapy, or until lost to follow-up. Median survival follow-up for the study cohort was 12 months (95% CI: 9-18 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined from date of randomization to date of death or censored at the date the patient was last known alive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease evaluations occurred at week 6 and 12 and thereafter every 3 cycles/9 weeks on treatment. Median treatment duration for this study cohort approximated 2 cycles (range 1-31).</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a confirmed overall partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) using RECIST criteria on treatment. Patients without measurable disease only at baseline are included, based on status of non-target lesions.Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no fewer than 4 weeks after the response criteria are first met. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed TCC. Mixed histologies are allowed as long
             as the predominant histology is TCC.

          -  Must have received chemotherapy treatment for TCC and have stage IV TCC at the time of
             study entry. 1-3 prior systemic chemotherapeutic or investigational treatment regimens
             for TCC are allowed. Patient with more regimens than the ones allowed may be included
             at the discretion of the Overall Principal Investigator if it is felt that the regimen
             has shown minimal activity and toxicity and will not influence prior or subsequent
             therapies. Specifically, participants must meet one or more of the following criteria:
             a) Progression after treatment with a regimen that includes a platinum salt (e.g.
             carboplatin or cisplatin) for Stage IV disease OR b) Disease recurrence within two
             years (from the date of last dose of chemotherapy or surgery until day the informed
             consent is signed) after neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with a regimen that
             includes a platinum salt.

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease, as defined by RECIST. If all sites of measurable or
             evaluable disease have been irradiated, one site must have demonstrated growth after
             irradiation.

          -  Adequate contraceptive method for subjects with reproductive potential (females with
             reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days of
             study entry).

          -  ECOG PS 0 or 1

          -  18 years of age or older

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of treatment of TCC (in any setting-neoadjuvant, adjuvant or for metastatic
             disease) with docetaxel. Patients treated with prior paclitaxel (Taxol) are eligible.

          -  History of treatment with a VEGF-axis active agent, including antibodies to VEGF,
             antibodies to VEGF receptors, or VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

          -  Laboratory results as outlined in the protocol

          -  Evidence of uncontrolled systemic disease or any concurrent condition which in the
             Investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the subject to participate in the
             trial or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol

          -  Clinically significant cardiac event such as myocardial infarction; NHYA
             classification of heart disease &gt;2 within three months before entry; or presence of
             cardiac disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, increases the risk of
             ventricular arrhythmia

          -  History of arrhythmia, bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, or uncontrolled
             atrial fibrillation which is symptomatic or requires treatment (CTCAE Grade 3) or
             asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation, controlled on
             medication is not excluded.

          -  Previous history of QTc prolongation as a result from other medication that required
             discontinuation of that medication.

          -  QTc with Bazett's correction that is unmeasurable, or 480 msec or greater on screening
             ECG. If a subject has a QTc of 480msec or greater on screening ECG, the screen ECG may
             be repeated twice (at least 24 hours apart). The average QTc from the three screening
             ECGs must be &lt;480 msec in order for the subject to be eligible for the study.

          -  Any concomitant medication that may cause QTc prolongation, induce Torsades de Pointes
             or induce CYP3A4 function.

             situ carcinoma of the cervix, adequately treated carcinoma of the skin, small renal
             masses, and adequately treated localized prostate cancer. Other cancers that are
             highly likely to be cured (cure rate of 75% or greater) may be included at the
             discretion of the Overall Principal Investigator.

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to drugs formulated with polysorbate 80.

        <description>PFS based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the time between randomization and documented disease progression (PD) per RECIST 1.0 criteria or death, or is censored at time of last disease assessment. Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or appearance of new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
        <time_frame>Disease evaluations occurred at week 6 and 12 and thereafter every 3 cycles/9 weeks on treatment and every 3 months in follow-up. Participants were followed until PD, death or lost to follow-up. Median survival follow-up was 12 months (range 1-26).</time_frame>

        <title>Objective Response Rate</title>
        <description>Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a confirmed overall partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) using RECIST criteria on treatment. Patients without measurable disease only at baseline are included, based on status of non-target lesions.Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no fewer than 4 weeks after the response criteria are first met. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.</description>
        <time_frame>Disease evaluations occurred at week 6 and 12 and thereafter every 3 cycles/9 weeks on treatment. Median treatment duration for this study cohort approximated 2 cycles (range 1-31).</time_frame>

        <title>Disease Control Rate</title>
        <description>Disease control rate is defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed overall Stable Disease (SD) or better using RECIST 1.0 criteria which parallels absence of disease progression (PD) on treatment. Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or appearance of new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Patients without measurable disease only at baseline are included, based on status of non-target lesions.</description>
