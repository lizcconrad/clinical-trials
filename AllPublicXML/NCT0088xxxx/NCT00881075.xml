  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of a manganese-based agent called
      SeeMore (EVP 1001-1 Injection) for enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients who
      have previously had a heart attack. It will determine whether SeeMore makes it easier to find
      damaged areas of the heart and will evaluate how well patients feel and how their bodies
      react after receiving the study medication.

      Adult patients who have previously had a heart attack and are in stable health may be
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, a brief physical
      examination and blood and urine tests.

      Participants undergo the following procedures:

        -  Collection of blood and urine samples 24 hours before receiving SeeMore and 24 hours
           after. A blood sample is also taken 3 and 10 days after receiving the drug.

        -  MRI scans one hour before receiving SeeMore and 10 minutes after receiving the drug. MRI
           uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs.
           After the first (baseline) MRI is done, SeeMore is given intravenously (through a vein)
           and the subject's vital signs and electrocardiogram (EKG) are monitored for 10 minutes.
           Then the second MRI is done to determine whether the study medication makes it easier to
           see areas of the heart that were affected by the heart attack.

        -  Check of vital signs, EKG and physical examination after the second MRI.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II open-label, baseline-controlled study. Approximately 10 adult male or
      nonpregnant female patients known to have had a myocardial infarct (nonacute) are intended to
      be enrolled at the current dose.

      Prior to entry into this study, all subjects will undergo a standard physical examination
      including medical history, details regarding the prior myocardial infarct(s), prescription
      and over-the-counter drug questionnaire, vital signs, ECG, evaluation of the major organ
      systems, hematology, serum chemistries, and urinalysis. In addition, female subjects will
      undergo a serum pregnancy test. All subjects will sign an Informed Consent prior to entry
      into the study.

      EVP 1001-1 will be administered intravenously over approximately one minute. Safety will be
      assessed by monitoring vital signs, ECG, and blood test after giving EVP 1001-1. MRI will be
      performed before and after EVP-1001-1 to measure enhancement relative to areas of myocardial
      infarction.
