  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the both the efficacy of odanacatib on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and
      the safety of odanacatib for postmenopausal osteoporosis in patients previously treated with
      alendronate. The primary hypothesis of the trial is that treatment with odanacatib 50 mg once
      weekly will increase bone mineral density at the femoral neck compared to placebo at the end
      of 24 months.

          <description>Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), Bone Mineral Density (BMD), T-score. T-Score is the difference between the BMD value and the average bone mass for sex-matched, healthy young adults; the difference being expressed in number of standard deviations; T-score based upon the normative database in use by the manufactures. A T-score of -1.0 or above is considered normal. More negative numbers are more indicative of osteoporosis.</description>
