    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response as Assessed by RECIST During First-Line Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until disease progression or death (up to 26 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Best overall response during first-line therapy was defined as the occurrence of either a confirmed complete (CR) or a partial response (PR), as assessed by the RECIST criteria. CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions (TLs) and normalization of tumor markers. Pathological lymph nodes must have short axis measures less than (&lt;) 10 mm. PR: at least a 30 % decrease in the sum of measures (longest diameter for tumor lesions and short axis measure for nodes) of TLs, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameters.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Disease Control During First-Line Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until disease progression or death (up to 26 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control was defined as stable disease(SD) for 6 weeks or longer, CR plus PR as assessed by RECIST criteria for participants with measurable disease.CR:disappearance of all TLs &amp; normalization of tumor markers. Pathological lymph nodes must have short axis measures&lt;10 mm. PR:at least 30% decrease in sum of measures(longest diameter for tumor lesions and short axis measure for nodes)of TLs, taking as reference baseline sum of longest diameters.SD:neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression taking as reference smallest sum of longest diameters on study. For participants without measurable disease, clinical benefit rate was defined as no clinical disease progression for &gt;/=6 weeks. Disease progression was defined as at least 20% increase in sum of diameters of TLs compared to smallest sum of diameters on-study and absolute increase of at least 5 mm, progression of existing non-target lesions, or presence of new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Change From Cycle 1 in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 36 (QLQ-C30) Scale Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>From Cycle 1 until disease progression (up to 26 months)</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 included global health status (GHS)/quality of life (QOL), functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), and single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Most questions used a 4-point scale (1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'); 2 questions used a 7-point scale (1 'Very Poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores were averaged and transformed to 0-100 scale; a higher score for Global Qol/functional scales=better level of QoL/functioning, or a higher score for symptom scale=greater degree of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change From Cycle 1 in EORTC QLQ-STO22 Scale Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>From Cycle 1 until disease progression (up to 26 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-STO22 is a gastric cancer quality of life questionnaire. There are 22 questions which comprise 5 scales (dysphagia, pain, reflux symptom, dietary restrictions, and anxiety) and 4 single items (dry mouth, hair loss, taste, body image). Most questions used 4-point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; 1 question was a yes or no answer). A linear transformation was used to standardize all scores and single-items to a scale of 0 to 100; higher score=better level of functioning or greater degree of symptoms.</description>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time between randomization and the date of first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first, according to RECIST. Progression of disease was defined as at least 20% increase in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions compared to the smallest sum of longest diameters on-study and absolute increase of at least 5 mm, progression of existing non-target lesions, or presence of new lesions. PFS was estimated using Kaplan Meier method. Reported data included censored observations. Participants who had neither progressed nor died at the time of study completion or who were lost to follow-up were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment or last follow-up for progression of disease. Participants for whom no post-baseline tumor assessments were available were censored at day of randomization.</description>

        <title>Change From Cycle 1 in EORTC QLQ-STO22 Scale Over Time</title>
        <description>The EORTC QLQ-STO22 is a gastric cancer quality of life questionnaire. There are 22 questions which comprise 5 scales (dysphagia, pain, reflux symptom, dietary restrictions, and anxiety) and 4 single items (dry mouth, hair loss, taste, body image). Most questions used 4-point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; 1 question was a yes or no answer). A linear transformation was used to standardize all scores and single-items to a scale of 0 to 100; higher score=better level of functioning or greater degree of symptoms.</description>
