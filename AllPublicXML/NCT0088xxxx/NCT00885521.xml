    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to examine the short and long term effects of an 8 week, twice
      weekly, outpatient exercise training program for people with bronchiectasis. Participants
      will be randomly allocated to undergo a supervised exercise training program at The Alfred,
      Austin Hospital or Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital.

      The hypotheses of this study are:

        1. Patients with bronchiectasis who complete an exercise program will have a higher
           exercise capacity and better quality of life and these improvements will be sustained
           for up to 12 months after completion

        2. Exercise training will significantly reduce the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations,
           use of antibiotics and rate of hospitalisation

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis not related to cystic fibrosis (non-CF bronchiectasis) is a chronic
      respiratory condition characterised by permanent dilatation of the airways arising from
      bronchial inflammation and infection. Predominant symptoms include daily productive cough,
      dyspnoea and generalised fatigue. This profile is associated with diminished health-related
      quality of life (HRQOL) and reduced exercise tolerance.

      Available medical treatments for bronchiectasis include antibiotic and inhalation therapy. To
      date, there is no evidence that these treatments can reduce the exacerbation rate or modify
      the rate of disease progression. While international guidelines for pulmonary rehabilitation
      recommend the inclusion of patients with bronchiectasis, there is a deficiency in evidence
      supporting exercise training in this population. It is proposed that a standard exercise
      training program conducted according to Australian guidelines for pulmonary rehabilitation
      will improve both exercise capacity, quality of life and reduce the number of acute
      infections in both the short and long term in people with bronchiectasis.
