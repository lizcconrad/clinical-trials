  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to provide additional insight into the factors affecting
      health-related quality of life with pediatric chronic pain as perceived by the patient versus
      his or her parents.In doing so, additional insight into the subjective interpretation the
      pediatric chronic pain experience will be gained. The four objectives of this study will be
      (a) to examine further the relationship between patient self-reported health-related quality
      of life and parent proxy-reported health-related quality; (b) to identify what biological,
      psychological, and/or social factors are the strongest predictors of a pediatric chronic pain
      patient's self-reported pain intensity and self-reported health-related quality of life, in a
      diverse cohort of patients referred to and subsequently treated by an anesthesiology-based
      yet interdisciplinary pediatric chronic pain medicine program; (c) to assess the effect of
      patient-specific, pain-focused biopsychosocial treatment regimen on pain intensity and
      health-related quality of life; and (d) to determine the effect of patient/parental
      satisfaction with on-going health care on their compliance with and uptake of the pain
      treatment regimen.

        Participants will come from those patients evaluated and treated in the Pediatric Chronic
        Pain Medicine Clinic at the Children's Hospital facilities. The likely study population
        includes essentially the pediatric population of the entire state of Alabama and
        immediately adjacent states (i.e., the geographic catchment area of the Children's Hospital
        of Alabama).
