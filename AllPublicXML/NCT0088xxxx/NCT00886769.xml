  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assessed the initial efficacy and safety of canakinumab over a 4 week period in
      patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) having a flare. Response to
      treatment will be according to the adapted American College of Rheumatology(ACR)Pediatric 30
      criteria at Day 15.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>CHAQ assessed physical ability and functional status of patients as well as quality of life. The disability dimension consisted of 20 multiple choice items about difficulty in doing eight common activities of daily living; dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reaching, personal hygiene, gripping and activities. Four response categories range from 'without any difficulty' (0) to 'unable to do' (3). The parent's or patient's pain assessment was on VAS that was part of CHAQ. The VAS scale ranges from no pain (0 mm) to very severe pain (100 mm). Negative change indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>CHQ-PF50 measures HRQoL in children 5-18 years old from parent's perspective. Questionnaire completed by parent without input from patient. Total score ranges from 0-100. Increases in scores represent improved well-being in subjects as assessed by their parents. Mixed linear model on change from baseline in CHQ-PF50 score with treatment group, stratification factors, day of assessment and interaction between group and day as covariates. Covariance analysis used a repeated measures approach, so all timepoints over time were taken into account.</description>

        <title>Change in Patient's Pain Intensity as Assessed on a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS)as Part of the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire(CHAQ)</title>
        <description>CHAQ assessed physical ability and functional status of patients as well as quality of life. The disability dimension consisted of 20 multiple choice items about difficulty in doing eight common activities of daily living; dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reaching, personal hygiene, gripping and activities. Four response categories range from ‘without any difficulty’ (0) to ‘unable to do’ (3). The parent’s or patient’s pain assessment was on VAS that was part of CHAQ. The VAS scale ranges from no pain (0 mm) to very severe pain (100 mm). Negative change indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>CHQ-PF50 measures HRQoL in children 5-18 years old from parent’s perspective. Questionnaire completed by parent without input from patient. Total score ranges from 0-100. Increases in scores represent improved well-being in subjects as assessed by their parents. Mixed linear model on change from baseline in CHQ-PF50 score with treatment group, stratification factors, day of assessment and interaction between group and day as covariates. Covariance analysis used a repeated measures approach, so all timepoints over time were taken into account.</description>

          <title>Change in Disability Score Over Time by Use of the CHAQ</title>
          <description>The disability dimension of CHAQ consisted of 20 multiple choice items about difficulty in doing eight common activities of daily living; dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reaching, personal hygiene, gripping and activities. Four response categories range from ‘without any difficulty’(0) to ‘unable to do’ (3). Mixed linear model on change from baseline in CHAQ score included treatment group, stratification factors, day of assessment and interaction between group and day as covariates. Negative change indicates improvement.</description>
          <population>The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Only observed cases were used in the analysis.</population>
