  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During radiation treatment for head and neck cancer a large percentage of patients at Mayo
      Clinic Rochester develop the need for tube feeding to meet nutrition and hydration needs.
      These patients are usually taking pain medication along with a stool softener or laxative.
      Currently, when these patients get a feeding tube it is our standard practice to choose a
      fiber-free enteral tube feeding formula as to not worsen their constipation. Currently, there
      are no guidelines as to which patients are good candidates for fiber containing enteral tube
      feeding formulas. The investigators hope this study will help determine if fiber containing
      enteral tube feeding formulas can be used for patients undergoing radiation for head and neck
      cancer without increasing rates of constipation or increasing use of stool
      softeners/laxatives.

      Hypothesis: Participants enrolled in the study will not have increased rates of constipation
      on fiber-containing enteral tube feeding formula compared to historical standards on
      fiber-free formula.
