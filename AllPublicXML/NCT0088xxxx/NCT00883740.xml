          <title>Medical Outcome Study Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) Sleep Disturbance Baseline Measure (Weeks 1 and 7)</title>
          <description>Sleep Disturbance subscale as measured by MOS-SS, a participant rated 12 item instrument. Baseline intervention period 1 collected at week 1 and baseline intervention period 2 collected at week 7. Scores were transformed and ranged from 0 to 100, higher scores indicated greater disturbance, negative changes indicated improvement.</description>
