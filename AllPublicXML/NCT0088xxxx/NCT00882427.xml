  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperglycaemia is commonly found in critically ill patients. Clinical studies demonstrated
      that tight blood glucose control in medical and surgical ICU patients results in a
      significant better outcome for the patients. Based on this emerging clinical evidence, there
      are increasing efforts worldwide to maintain strict glycaemic control in critically ill
      patients. However, achieving this goal requires extensive nursing efforts, including frequent
      bedside glucose monitoring and the implementation of complex intensive insulin infusion
      protocols. A fully automated algorithm may help to overcome some of these limitations by
      excluding intuitive interventions and integrating relevant clinical data in the
      decision-making process. This study will investigate the performance of an eMPC algorithm
      adjusted to target the range 4.4 - 8.3 mmol/L in line with the Surviving Sepsis guidelines.
