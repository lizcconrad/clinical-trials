    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to perform a safety and dose-determination efficacy
      clinical trial in patients having a degree of partial-thickness burn wounds. The trial will
      be a prospectively randomized and double-blind trial of Amnion-derived Cellular Cytokine
      Solution (ACCS) compared with standardized care using 0.9% NaCl (normal saline) solution in
      the same three treatment regimens.

      A Phase I/II multi-center clinical trial will be performed in 99 adults with
      partial-thickness burns. Two similar partial-thickness burn areas in a single patient will be
      selected. One burn will be randomly assigned to receive either test drug (ACCS) or normal
      saline in one of three treatment regimens.

      The three treatment arms will be:

        1. ACCS 0.01 mL/cm2 every 7th day vs. normal saline 0.01 mL/cm2 every 7th day;

        2. ACCS 0.01 mL/cm2 every 4th day vs. normal saline 0.01 mL/cm2 every 4th day; and

        3. ACCS 0.01 mL/cm2 every other day vs. normal saline 0.01 mL/cm2 every other day.

      Two different preclinical studies of partial-thickness burns on guinea pigs have demonstrated
      accelerated epithelialization with topical treatment with ACCS. Similarly, preclinical
      studies in Yorkshire pigs have demonstrated more rapid maturity of epithelialization and
      better quality healing of partial-thickness skin graft donor sites with ACCS treatment.

      In the preclinical studies, ACCS given in a dose of 0.01 mL/cm2 wound area appeared to
      saturate the wound adequately without excess and simultaneously improve healing. In
      preclinical toxicity studies, the dose of 0.01 mL/cm2 was shown to be safe.

    <description>ACCS is a clear liquid containing more than 200 proteins, cytokines, and growth factors in solution. Patients will be treated for 21 days unless both wounds have healed prior to 21 days, at which time a punch biopsy of the epithelialized area of each wound will be performed. A study evaluation visit for assessment of the biopsy site will occur on day 28 or within 7 days of the punch biopsies, whichever occurs first. Six months after the punch biopsy, the patient will return to the burn center for a final examination and photographs of the study wounds.</description>
