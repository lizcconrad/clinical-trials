  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doxazosin, an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor, may play an important role in cocaine addiction in
      humans. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of doxazosin in preventing drug relapse
      among cocaine dependent participants.

    <textblock>
      The NE system, especially the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor, may play an important role in
      cocaine addiction in humans. The results of this study will provide medical safety data on
      the duration of the induction schedule that will be optimal for attaining our target dose of
      8 mg doxazosin daily and will guide future pharmacotherapy trials using Doxazosin or related
      alpha 1 receptor antagonists for cocaine addiction.

      This 17-week double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial includes a 13 week medication
      trial (weeks 1-13) and up to 4 week washout period(weeks 14-17). Qualifying subjects will be
      randomized to receive Doxazosin 8 mg/day, or placebo during the study participation.

      Subjects will be receiving 1 mg study medication/placebo capsules at week 1, with 1mg/week
      induction rate for 8 weeks, according to their randomized assignments, and are maintained on
      these agents through week 13. At the end of the study (weeks 14-17), participants will
      undergo discontinuation from active/placebo medication over a 4-week period. Subjects who
      wish to be transferred to an appropriate treatment program or treatment-research program will
      be helped with referral during the 4 week period (weeks 14-17).
