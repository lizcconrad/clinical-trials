    <time_frame>baseline, 3 month and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were monitored for adverse events (AEs) at each visit. Cumulative AEs were tracked including specific AE, severity, and relationship on source documentation. Special attention was given to infusion-related events and hypersensitivity reactions. Assessment of Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Metabolic profile were also tracked.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinically Detectable Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>at each visit and at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluations will occur at each visit after the first infusion. At 3 months, response will be recorded and patients with improvement will be eligible to move into the steroid and/or antihistamine tapering portion of the study. Improvement was determined by a reduction in the number of hives.</description>

abatacept (Orencia ®): 4 doses of abatacept administered intravenously at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 week, and 8 weeks.The dose of abatacept received by each participant was based on weight. Participants received either 500mg, 750mg , or 1000mg of abatacept based on weights of &gt;60 kg, 60-100kg, or 100 kg respectively.</description>
