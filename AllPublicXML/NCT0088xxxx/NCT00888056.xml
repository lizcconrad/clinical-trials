  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia for which no treatment has
      shown consistent efficacy to stop or slow down the disease. Recent report of enhancement of
      memory abilities by bilateral chronic deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the fornix in the
      hypothalamus suggests that neuromodulation of circuits involved in memory processes may have
      therapeutic implications in AD patients with memory decline.

      The primary objectives of this prospective, non-controlled, pilot study are to evaluate the
      feasibility and safety of DBS in AD patients with mild cognitive and memory impairment, and
      to evaluate the efficacy of DBS to slow down or stabilize this decline. Five patients with AD
      (DSM IV) diagnosed less than two years, with mild cognitive decline (MMSE 20-24), and
      specific impairment of episodic memory will be included in a 2-year period. The evaluation
      criteria for feasibility will be the proportion of patients undergoing the procedure, chronic
      stimulation and evaluation process without adverse event (AE). Efficacy will be evaluated
      using numerous cognitive and memory testing. Changes in behavioral and mood scales, and
      changes in hypothalamic functions (clinical, biological and hormonal assessment) will
      evaluate safety and tolerance. Clinical, neuro-psychological, biological and imaging
      assessment will be performed 3 and one month before and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery.
      Bilateral electrodes (Medtronic 3389) will be implanted, by MR-guided frame-based stereotaxy,
      in the hypothalamic part of the fornix, and then connected to the generator (Kinetra,
      Medtronic). Chronic high-frequency stimulation will be delivered immediately after surgery.

      The investigators expect to slow down, or to stabilize the spontaneous decline of MMSE and
      ADAS scores after 6, 12 and 24 months of stimulation. In case of efficacy, DBS might offer to
      AD patient the possibility to slow down/stabilize their symptoms, which no other treatment
      can currently offer, and to increase their quality of life.

    <description>Clinical, neuro-psychological, biological and imaging assessment will be performed 3 and one month before and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Bilateral electrodes (Medtronic 3389) will be implanted, under local anesthesia, by MR-guided frame-based stereotaxy, in the hypothalamic part of the fornix, before its entry in the mamillary body (well defined on T2 weighted sequences). Intra-operative stimulation will be used to search adverse effects or acute effects. Electrodes will be connected to the generator (Kinetra, Medtronic) under general anesthesia. Chronic high-frequency stimulation will be delivered immediately after surgery.</description>
