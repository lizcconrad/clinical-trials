    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label study examining the safety and efficacy of betaine in
      addition to standard anti-viral therapy in genotype 1 hepatitis C non-responders or relapsers
      to previous pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. Betaine (20 gm/day) in 2 divided doses will
      be added to Peginterferon alpha 2a (180 mcg) plus weight-based Ribavirin (1000 or 1200
      mg/day, for body weight &lt; or &gt; 75 kg, respectively, for 48 weeks. Patients must be diagnosed
      with chronic hepatitis C, genotype I, and have undergone therapy for hepatitis C with
      pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. Subjects will be followed for safety, tolerability,
      hepatitis C viral response and the effect on interferon gene signaling in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells during therapy.

      The primary objective is to examine the safety and efficacy of the betaine when combined with
      standard anti-viral therapy in previously treated adult subjects with chronic hepatitis C
      infected with genotype 1. The efficacy will be determined through comparison of the sustained
      viral response (SVR) to our protocol three-drug regimen (Betaine, Peginterferon plus
      Ribavirin) to that historically seen in relapsers and non-responders when retreated with
      standard therapy (Peginterferon and Ribavirin alone).

      Secondary objectives include: (1) the comparison of the occurrence of rapid and early
      virologic response in the first 4 (Rapid Virologic Response, RVR) and 12 (Early Virologic
      Response, EVR) weeks of therapy, respectively, between the study regimen and historically
      treated patients. (2) the comparison of ALT normalization between the two groups. and (3) the
      effect on interferon gene signaling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) between the
      two groups in the first 12 weeks of therapy and 6 months following the end of therapy..
