  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Primary care plays an important role in health care delivery, but there is little research on
      its effectiveness. Western medicine is the most widely used and Traditional Chinese medicine
      (TCM) is gaining popularity. The investigators recent study showed that TCM consultations at
      the TWH were effective in improving the quality of life of patients in primary care. The aim
      of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Western Medicine (WM) in primary
      care for comparison with the effectiveness of TCM consultations, so that policy makers and
      the public can be better informed.

      Objectives:

      To evaluate whether WM consultation can significantly improve the quality of life of patients
      in primary care and to find out whether there is any difference in the effectiveness of WM
      and TCM, overall and for different health problems.

      Design, Setting &amp; Subjects:

      A prospective study on 700 patients recruited from the TWH and the Ap Lei Chau primary care
      outpatient clinics (OPC) in Hong Kong.

      Methods:

      All patients consulting for a new episode of illness at the study OPC will be recruited if
      they meet the selection criteria and consent to participate. Each patient will be asked to
      complete a structured questionnaire on socio-demography, morbidity and service utilization,
      the Hong Kong version of the Chinese Quality of Life instrument (ChQOL-HK), the Chinese (Hong
      Kong) SF-36 (SF-36-HK) and the PEI-2 before the consultation. Each subject will be followed
      up two weeks later either at the clinic or by telephone to complete the ChQOL-HK and the
      SF-36-HK again together with the Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI), the Global Rating Scale
      (GRS) on change of the condition, and a questionnaire on service utilization

      Outcome Measures and Data Analysis:

      The primary outcome measures are the changes in ChQOL-HK and SF-36-HK scores after the
      consultation. The GRS and PEI scores will be secondary outcomes. The ChQOL -HK and SF-36-HK
      scores will be correlated with the the GRS and PEI. Multivariate regressions will be carried
      out to identify factors that are associated with effectiveness. The outcomes will be compared
      with those obtained from the previous study on the TCM primary care clinics.

      Results:

      This is the first study in Hong Kong to evaluate the effectiveness of WM in primary care with
      a validated generic outcome measure, HRQOL. It will provide information on the benefit and
      limitations of WM, and allow a direct comparison between WM and TCM.

    <textblock>
      Primary health care serves every person and manages over 90% of the illnesses. The Hospital
      Authority public general and family medicine outpatient clinics provide about 11 million
      attendances each year, which is the major source of health care for the elderly and
      low-income population. The effectiveness of primary care has profound impact on the health of
      the population as well as the demand on expensive secondary care. Western medicine (WM) is
      the most commonly used type of primary care but 50 to 60% of people also consult Traditional
      Chinese medicine (TCM) in Hong Kong. The two types of medicine are often used sequentially or
      concurrently. There is a constant debate on whether WM or TCM is more effective, but few if
      any, comparative data are available. Few studies have investigated patient satisfaction with
      the public primary care clinics but none has investigated the effectiveness of care. A proper
      evaluation with a valid outcome measure will help to inform the public and policy makers on
      the benefit and limitations of the different primary care.

      The evaluation of the effectiveness of a health service needs to use appropriate outcome
      measures. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) with an emphasis on subjective perception of
      well-being and function is probably the most suitable outcome measure in primary care because
      most of the health problems are functional rather than pathological. The other advantage of
      HRQOL is that it is generic in that the same standard measure can be applied to different
      types of patients, illnesses and medical services.

      Our previous study showed that all patients had significant improvements in their HRQOL after
      TCM consultations at the different (internal medicine, bone-setting and acupuncture) primary
      care outpatient clinics in Tung Wah Hospital. We would like to carry out a study to evaluate
      the effectiveness of WM in improving the HRQOL of patients attending the WM general
      outpatient clinic of the TWH and another public primary care clinic. To the best of our
      knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effectiveness of care of the public
      primary care service. The results will allow a direct comparison between WM and TCM, overall
      and for different illnesses, which can help to determine their respective roles in primary
      care.
