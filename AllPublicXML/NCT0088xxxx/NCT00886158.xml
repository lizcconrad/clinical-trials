  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viral infections are an important complication of transplantation. Immunosuppressive therapy
      interferes with T cell immunity resulting in a high incidence of viral infection. Newer
      agents, such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and sirolimus, have been associated with an
      increased risk of herpes virus infection. The introduction of these more potent
      immunosuppressive agents over the past decade correlates with an increase in the rate of
      hospitalizations of transplant patients with infections. This prospective study will
      determine the role of sub-clinical herpes virus infections in the development of
      complications such as chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) and Post Transplant
      Lymphoproliferative Disease (PTLD). By focusing on treatable herpes virus infections, these
      studies have the potential to identify therapeutic strategies that can be used to diminish
      the burden of graft loss from CAN, significantly improving renal allograft survival and
      quality of life in transplant patients. Future specific interventions to test the hypothesis
      of a direct causal relationship between sub-clinical herpes virus infection and CAN may
      include the use of anti-viral therapy in response to sub-clinical infection of the renal
      allograft and/or peripheral blood.
