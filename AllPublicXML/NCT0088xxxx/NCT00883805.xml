      This is a pilot study to compare systemic concentrations of cobalt and chromium in patients
      that have previously undergone total hip arthroplasties with ceramic on metal and metal on
      metal bearing surfaces. Secondary goals include an assessment of osteolysis on radiographs,
      potential long term analysis of implant survivability, and cancer rates in the two patient
      populations.

      Increased metal ion production has been documented in metal-on-metal arthroplasty
      articulations. There are several concerns over metal ion production. First, even though there
      is a decreased histiocytic response to metallic debris, a dose dependent cytotoxic response
      with Interleukin 6, Prostaglandin E2, and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha persists and may cause
      osteolysis in the long term. Second, increased levels of cobalt, chromium and nickel has been
      shown to correlate with increased cancer rates in several animal models, and the carcinogenic
      risk in humans has not been fully elucidated as yet. Third, hypersensitivity reactions to
      metal ion develop in up to 25% of these patients, and 60% of patients with poorly functioning
      hip.

      Ceramic on metal avoids many of these problems due to the improved wear characteristics. If
      the level of metal ion production is significantly reduced and the implant survivability is
      proven in long term studies, this articulation may become the preferred method.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is 40 - 80, who has undergone a top hip arthroplasty with either metal on
             metal or ceramic on metal articulation for a diagnosis of non-inflammatory
             degenerative joint disease. We will also include subjects who have had bilateral hip
             arthroplasties or a second arthroplasty performed since the initial surgery.

          -  Patient must be able to provide consent to participate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis other than non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease, chronic renal
             insufficiency, or any systemic inflammatory condition

          -  Evidence of active infections

          -  Patients whose occupations include welding or metal working

          -  A second arthroplasty performed since the initial will not be exclude, but their data
             will be analyzed as a subpopulation

          -  unwillingness to comply with rehabilitation program or inability to return for
             follow-up visits

          -  Any systemic steroid therapy within 3 months of surgery

          -  Subjects who are pregnant
