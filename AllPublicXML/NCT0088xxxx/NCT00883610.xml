    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn what effect rapid atrial pacing (in patients with dual
      chamber pacemakers) will have on the electrocardiogram including the QT Interval. The
      investigators are also interested in the differences caused by genes.

      This study requires a total of two study days as well as two follow up visits. During study
      day one, baseline blood will be drawn, a baseline electrocardiogram will be performed, and
      continuous QT Interval monitoring will be performed. The pacemaker rate will be increased to
      90bpm at different time intervals and additional blood will be drawn to measure the effects
      of these rates changes.

      On study day two, baseline blood will be drawn, a urine specimen will be obtained, an
      electrocardiogram will be performed, and continuous QT Interval monitoring will be performed.
      Following the acquisition of this information, the pacemaker rate will be decreased to 80bpm.
      We will obtain blood specimens, a urine specimen and an electrocardiogram at 30 minutes post
      rate change and again at 60 minutes post rate change.

      Two days following the rate decrease to 80bpm, the patient will return to clinic to have
      their rate decreased to 70bpm. In two more days, the patient will return for a final rate
      change to 60bpm.
