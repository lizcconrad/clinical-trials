  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI) are medical conditions
      that occur when there is severe inflammation and increased fluids in both lungs, making it
      difficult for the lungs to function properly. Hospital treatment for a person with ALI/ARDS
      often includes the use of a breathing machine, or ventilator, until the person is able to
      breathe without assistance. Initiating proper nutrition through a feeding tube early in a
      person's hospital stay may help to improve recovery, but the optimal timing, composition, and
      amount of feeding treatments remain unknown. This study will evaluate whether early or
      delayed full-calorie feeding through a feeding tube is more effective in reducing recovery
      time and increasing survival rates in people with ALI/ARDS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ALI/ARDS involves extensive inflammation in the lungs that can lead to rapid respiratory
      failure. These conditions are most commonly caused by pneumonia, generalized infection, or
      severe trauma to the lungs, but can also be less commonly caused by smoke or salt water
      inhalation, drug overdose, or shock.

      For some people, ALI/ARDS resolves without treatment, but many severe cases result in
      hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU), where 30% to 40% of cases end in mortality.
      Current treatments for ALI/ARDS include assisted breathing with a ventilator, supportive
      care, and management of the underlying causes. Enteral feeding, in which patients receive
      nutrition through a feeding tube, plays an important role in treatment, too. Some recent
      studies have shown that enteral feeding initiated soon after a patient begins assisted
      breathing is associated with a shorter hospital stay and a better chance of survival than
      delayed enteral feeding. However, other studies have shown the opposite, and studies on
      optimal feeding volume and composition have shown conflicting results. This study will
      evaluate the effects of early versus delayed full-calorie enteral feeding on mortality,
      ventilator-free days, ICU-free days, and organ failure in people with ALI/ARDS.

      Upon admission to the ICU, a dietary evaluation will be done on each participant to determine
      goal, or full-calorie, feeding rates, which will be based on body weight and daily energy
      consumption. Participants will also undergo baseline assessments and procedures, which will
      include vital sign measurements, blood draws, a frontal chest radiograph, ventilator
      settings, and placement of a feeding tube. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive
      initial enteral feedings that are either minimal (trophic) or full-calorie. All participants
      will begin enteral feeding within 6 hours of treatment assignment.

      Participants assigned to initial minimal enteral feedings will receive feedings at 10 cubic
      centimeters (cc) per hour, to be continued at this rate for 144 hours, provided that the
      participant remains on the ventilator. After the 144 hours, the feeding rate will be advanced
      to full-calorie rates.

      Participants assigned to initial full-calorie enteral feedings will receive feedings at 25 cc
      per hour, and the feeding rate will be increased by 25 cc per hour every 6 hours until the
      goal rate is reached. During enteral feedings, gastric residual volumes (GRVs) will be
      checked every 6 to 12 hours to assure acceptable levels. Participants will complete enteral
      feedings upon hospital discharge, Day 28 of treatment, death, or ability to achieve 48 hours
      of unassisted breathing.

      Blood pressure, heart rate, ventilation settings, and various blood factors will be measured
      during treatment. Phone-based follow-up assessments will occur at Months 6 and 12 after ICU
      discharge and will include measurements of health-related quality of life; psychological,
      neurocognitive, and physical activity outcomes; healthcare utilization; and mortality.
