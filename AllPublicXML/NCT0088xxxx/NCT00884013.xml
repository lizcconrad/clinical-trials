      Do monetary incentives in small independent primary care practices improve the delivery of
      preventive services as recommended by U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines
      for cardiovascular health?

    <textblock>
      The NYC DOHMH received a private donation from the Robin Hood Foundation to provide monetary
      incentives to small practices for improving their delivery of preventive services in
      neighborhoods experiencing health disparities.

      Practices recruited by NYC DOHMH to adopt an electronic health record will be randomized to
      receive monetary incentives for improving both patient outcomes and delivery of care on:
      aspirin therapy, blood pressure control, cholesterol control, and smoking cessation
      intervention. The set of quality measures are referred to the ABCS.

      The NYC DOHMH will be collecting provider surveys on their experience on quality measurement
      and participation in other pay-for-performance programs, as well as transmit aggregated
      information on their performance on the ABCS to DOHMH on a monthly basis.
