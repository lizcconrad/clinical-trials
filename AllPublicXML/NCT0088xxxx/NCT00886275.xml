  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In intensive care unit, patients suffered pain and anxiety from mechanical ventilation,
      presence of endotracheal tube, central venous catheter, postoperative wound, and invasive
      procedures. Adequate analgesia and sedation can reduce pain and anxiety. However, traditional
      sedatives carry the risk of unstable hemodynamic status, respiratory depression, increased
      mechanical ventilation time, incidence of delirium, and length of ICU stay. Dexmedetomidine
      is a highly selec¬tive α2-adrenergic receptor agonist which causes sedative effects and
      reduces opioid requirements in the perioperative period. Memis et al had found that
      dexmedetomidine may prevent inflammatory effects in sepsis patients during sedation.
      Oxidative stress status is related to the inflammatory response. Moreover, oxidative stress
      may result in dysfunction of microcirculation. Dysfunction of microcirculation may cause
      vasoconstriction or microthrombosis, and it will impair tissue perfusion and result in organ
      dysfunction. The goal of this study is to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine and
      midazolam on requirement of analgesics, weaning parameter, hemodynamic status, time of
      extubation, incidence of delirium, and length of ICU stay, oxidative stress status, and
      microcirculation.
