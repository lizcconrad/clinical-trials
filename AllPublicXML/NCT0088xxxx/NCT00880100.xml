      Multicenter, explorative, phase IIIb, open-label study to assess the efficacy and safety of
      Ultrase® MT12, in the control of steatorrhea and clinical signs and symptoms of malabsorption
      in CF children with pancreatic insufficiency (PI). This study is sponsored by Aptalis Pharma
      (formerly Axcan).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, explorative, phase IIIb, open-label study in patients with CF and PI.
      The study consists of a screening visit (visit 1), followed by a baseline phase of 9 days
      (plus a 5-day window if necessary) during which the regular pancreatic enzyme will be
      maintained and 10 stool samples will be collected over 5 days, for baseline evaluation of
      steatorrhea. Afterward, a treatment phase of 19 days (plus a 5-day window if necessary) with
      Ultrase® MT12 will follow (the usual pancreatic enzyme will be replaced by Ultrase® MT12).
      Over the last 5 days of the treatment phase, 10 additional stool samples will be collected,
      for evaluation of steatorrhea.

    <time_frame>A period of 19 to 24 days, from Baseline (Visit 2) to Day 15 to19 of Treatment Phase (Visit 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Control of steatorrhea was defined as a less than 30 percent (%) of fat in stools as measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in all stool samples which are collected at baseline phase (usual pancreatic enzymes) during which the patients were on their prescribed pancreatic enzyme product (PEP) and during the 5-day collection period of the treatment phase during which the PEP was replaced with Ultrase MT12.</description>

    <time_frame>A period of 19 to 24 days, from Baseline (Visit 2) to Day 15 to19 of Treatment Phase (Visit 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Normal stool frequency was defined as having less than 4 bowel movements per day in baseline phase (usual pancreatic enzymes) during which the patients were on their prescribed pancreatic enzyme product (PEP) and 5-day collection period of the Treatment Phase during which the PEP was replaced with Ultrase MT12.</description>

    <description>Normal consistency of stool was defined as hard and formed or soft and formed consistency. Abnormal consistency was defined as loose and unformed stool or liquid stools and diarrhea. Percentage of stools with normal consistency of each patient was calculated from normal consistency of stools by the patient per day. Mean percentage of stools with normal consistency in baseline phase (usual pancreatic enzymes) during which the patients were on their prescribed pancreatic enzyme product (PEP) and 5-day collection period of the treatment phase during which the PEP was replaced with Ultrase MT12, for total patients was summarized.</description>

    <description>Stools of abnormal characteristics were defined as bulky/large, foul-smelling and/or oily stools. Mean percentage of stools with abnormal characteristics in baseline phase (usual pancreatic enzymes) during which the patients were on their prescribed pancreatic enzyme product (PEP) and 5-day collection period of the treatment phase during which the PEP was replaced with Ultrase MT12, for total patients was summarized.</description>

    <time_frame>A period of 19 to 24 days, from Baseline (Visit 2) to Day 15 to19 of Treatment Phase (Visit 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Abdominal complaints were defined as the reporting of abdominal pain and/or unusual and excessive flatulence/gas production. Mean number of days without abdominal complaints in baseline phase (usual pancreatic enzymes) during which the patients were on their prescribed pancreatic enzyme product (PEP) and 5-day collection period of the treatment phase during which the PEP was replaced with Ultrase MT12, for total patients was summarized.</description>

    <description>The total weight of stools in grams (g) is the total weight obtained during the stool collection period regardless of the number of stools that had been collected during this same collection period. Mean total weight of stools in baseline phase (usual pancreatic enzymes) during which the patients were on their prescribed pancreatic enzyme product (PEP) and 5-day collection period of the treatment phase during which the PEP was replaced with Ultrase MT12, for total patients was summarized.</description>

    <description>Mean percentage of days with abdominal complaints during baseline phase (BP) and the 5-day collection period of the treatment phase for total patients was summarized. Abdominal complaints were defined as the reporting of abdominal pain and/or unusual and excessive flatulence/gas production. Mean number of days abdominal pain (AP) and excessive flatulence (EF) in baseline phase (usual pancreatic enzymes) during which the patients were on their prescribed pancreatic enzyme product (PEP) and 5-day collection period of the treatment phase during which the PEP was replaced with Ultrase MT12, for total patients was summarized.</description>
