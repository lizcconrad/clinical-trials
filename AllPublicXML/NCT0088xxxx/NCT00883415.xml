      This study examines patients with chronic kidney disease-related anemia and measures changes
      in the metabolism of the heart using FDG/PET scanning, before and 6 months after their
      health-care provider has initiated anemia management therapy with the FDA-approved drug
      darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp), which is approved for chronic kidney disease-related anemia. The
      investigators hypothesize that the heart has abnormal metabolism with the anemia of chronic
      kidney disease but this improves after correction of this anemia with darbepoetin alfa.

        The study population consists of individuals being followed for their chronic kidney
        disease (CKD) at one of the Nephrology/Early Renal Insufficiency Clinics at the Baltimore,
        Maryland VA Medical Center and are being considered for erthropoietin therapy for anemia
        related to CKD.
