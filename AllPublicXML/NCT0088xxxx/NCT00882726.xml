  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics
      of CNTO 3649 following a single dose in healthy adults and following multiple doses in
      patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

      This is a randomized (study medication assigned by chance), placebo controlled, double-blind
      (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned study medication),
      ascending-dose study to assess the safety, tolerability, immune response, pharmacokinetics
      (what the body does to the drug), and pharmacodynamics (what the drug does to the body) of
      CNTO 3649. The study population will consist of approximately 80 healthy participants (Part
      1) and approximately 36 type 2 diabetic patients (Part 2). All participants will be
      randomized to CNTO 3649 or placebo in the ratio of 3:1. Out of 80 healthy participants, 48
      participants will receive single doses of CNTO 3649 (6 dose levels) or placebo as an
      intravenous infusion (directly into a vein) and 32 participants will receive single doses of
      CNTO 3649 (4 dose levels) or placebo as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. All 36
      diabetic patients will receive multiple doses of CNTO 3649 (3 dose levels) or placebo as
      subcutaneous injections. There will be a screening period of 30 days and 45 days for healthy
      participants and diabetes patients, respectively. Healthy participants will be in the study
      for 9 weeks. Diabetic patients will be in the study for 12 weeks.
