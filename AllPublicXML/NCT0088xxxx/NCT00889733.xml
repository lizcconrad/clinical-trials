    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intraperitoneal (IP) Cisplatin combined
      with intravenous (IV) Paclitaxel is well tolerated in women with epithelial ovarian cancer
      who have had neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by initial debulking surgery.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven epithelial ovarian cancer

          -  Previously received no more than 4 cycles of neoadjuvant platinum based chemotherapy,
             followed by debulking surgery

          -  ECOG PFS &lt;_ 2

          -  Adequate haematological (absolute neutrophil count &gt;_ 1,500/mm3; platelets &gt;_
             100,000/mm3; hemoglobin &gt;_ 100g/L); renal (&lt;_ upper limit of normal) and hepatic
             function

          -  Age &gt;_ 18 years

          -  Written informed consent and the ability of the patient to co-operate with treatment
             and follow up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindication to platinum/Paclitaxel chemotherapy: prior anaphylaxis to
             Carboplatin/Paclitaxel, unresolved or excessive toxicity from neoadjuvant
             chemotherapy. Patients must not have suffered significant bone marrow suppression
             during prior treatment. The significance of previous treatment delay and/or dose
             modification is to be determined by the Principle Investigator on a patient-by-patient
             basis.

          -  Serious concomitant medical condition, which in the investigators opinion would not
             make the patient a good candidate for the clinical trial.

          -  Patients with a past or concomitant malignancy other than skin cancer (excluding
             melanoma)

          -  Patients known to be serologically positive for Hepatitis B, C or HIV

          -  History of congestive heart failure or unstable angina or those who had a myocardial
             infarction within the past 6 months. Patients who were not expected to tolerate the
             hemodynamic effects of the fluid administered as part of the IP protocol.

          -  Patients who have not received chemotherapy prior to surgery

          -  Greater than 6 weeks from time of surgery to commencement of IP chemotherapy

          -  Residual disease greater than 1 cm at time of surgery. Patients whom in the surgeon's
             opinion are candidates for such surgery may be consented preoperatively to allow
             intraoperative IP catheter insertion. If however the surgeon is not able to reduce the
             bulk of disease to less than or equal to 1 cm, patients will be removed from the study
             and an IP catheter SHOULD NOT be placed.
