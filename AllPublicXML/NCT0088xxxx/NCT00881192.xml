    <textblock>
      Since its first introduction in humans in 1962, Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) is now the
      most commonly used therapeutic option to support failing heart in cardiac surgery. The main
      effects of IABP are an increase in diastolic blood pressure and therefore an improvement in
      coronary perfusion and a reduction of ventricular after load, thus increasing stroke volume
      and cardiac output. IABP-related complications include limb ischemia, bleeding at the site of
      IABP insertion, infection, and aortic dissection.

      IABP could be used preoperatively, intraoperatively, or postoperatively. However, despite the
      wide use of the device, the optimal timing and use of IABP in high-risk patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery remains controversial. Time of insertion has been showed to affect hospital
      mortality, ranging from 18.8% to 19.6% for preoperative insertion, from 27.6% to 32.3% for
      intraoperative insertion, and from 39% to 40.5% for postoperative insertion. Several studies,
      randomized and non-randomized, have been conducted to address the impact of preoperative use
      of IABP on the outcome, each study including a relative small number of patients. In an
      effort to increase the strength of the results, two meta-analysis have been conducted and
      published in 2008. The objectives of both were to assess the effect on mortality and
      morbidity of using IABP preoperatively in high-risk patients undergoing coronary artery
      bypass grafting (CABG). Surprisingly, the meta-analysis from Field and co-workers was
      conducted on four randomized controlled trials (for a total of 193 patients included)
      published by the same author from the same institution, making the results not conclusive
      although favourable toward a beneficial effect of the preoperative use of IABP. Moreover, two
      of the randomized trials conducted by Christenson and co-workers and included in the above
      mentioned meta-analysis, were excluded from the meta-analysis from Dyub and co-workers
      because considered duplicates. Unfortunately, one study by Christenson and co-workers and
      included in the meta-analysis from Dyub was conducted on off-pump surgery, introducing
      another bias in the criteria of eligibility.

      At present it is unclear whether the preoperative use of IABP in high-risk coronary patients
      scheduled for CABG operations leads to a better outcome. The experimental hypothesis of the
      present randomized, controlled trial (RCT) is that the placement of IABP immediately before
      beginning the surgical procedure induces a reduction of major morbidity after the operation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RCT including patients scheduled for elective CABG surgery (with or without associated
      procedures) and having a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 0.35. Exclusion criteria: age &lt;
      18 years, no patient's consent, contra-indications to the use of IABP (severe peripheral
      arteropathy; endovascular abdominal aortic prostheses).

      Patients will be randomly allocated to either a control group or a treatment group. Patients
      in the control group will not receive an IABP preoperatively, and patients in the treatment
      arm will receive an IABP positioned immediately after the induction of anesthesia and before
      beginning surgery.

      Randomization will be performed the day before the operation. Primary endpoint: reduction of
      major morbidity rate (defined as either prolonged (&gt; 48 hours) mechanical ventilation, acute
      renal failure, mediastinitis, surgical revision, stroke).

      Secondary endpoint: reduction in inotropic drug use, shortening of mechanical ventilation and
      ICU stay.

      Interim analyses and stopping rules: interim analyses will be done at half (80 patients)and
      2/3 (106 patients) of recruitment. The trial could be prematurely stopped in case of a
      difference in the primary endpoint reaching a P value of 0.005 at the first analysis, and
      0.01 at the second.A specific stopping rule is settled for operative mortality (30 days) at
      0.01 at the first interim analysis and 0.05 at the second interim analysis. Given the
      invasive nature and the costs of the intervention, a stopping rule for futility was settled
      in case of a lack of difference for the primary outcome. This was settled at a relative risk
      for the primary outcome not including the hypothesized value of 0.5 within 99% CI at the
      first interim analysis and 95% CI at the second.
