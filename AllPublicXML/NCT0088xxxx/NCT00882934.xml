  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (RCT) are the gold standard to provide
      applicable evidence for clinical practice. A vast number of RCTs for treatment of several
      disorders has shown a mean placebo effect of 30%. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a high
      prevalent disease and its first-line therapy is oral phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor
      (iPDE5) (i.e., sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil). Although the placebo effect in iPDE5
      RCT occurred at a rate as high as 50%, in the last decade, with the revolutionary discovery
      of effective pharmacotherapy for ED, oral iPDE5 has become one of the most common prescribed
      drugs for men. The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of patients'
      awareness on the composition of the therapeutic drug in the outcomes of the oral treatment
      for ED.

             and hematology, urinalysis (If the standard values of the laboratory for these tests
             are not evidenced, subjects can be included if the researcher consider the changes as
             not clinically significant).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Report of significant clinical problems by the subject's partner, such as decreased
