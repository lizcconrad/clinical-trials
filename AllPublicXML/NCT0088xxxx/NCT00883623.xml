  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment with oral melphalan and prednisone has been recommended as standard treatment
      of AL amyloidosis but the results are rather disappointing. Another therapeutic option is
      pulsed high-dose dexamethasone + melphalan (Mel-Dex) with more encouraging results regarding
      the achievement of a faster disease response and higher rates of haematological remission. In
      the last 5 - 10 years, promising treatment outcomes after therapy with high-dose melphalan
      and autologous stem cell support have been reported by several groups but only highly
      selected patients are eligible for this treatment. Lenalidomide has been shown to be
      effective in phase II and III trials in MM patients. Because of the relationship to MM,
      Lenalidomide is a promising therapeutic option also for patients with AL amyloidosis. The
      addition of Lenalidomide to Mel-Dex could improve rate of complete response (CR) and organ
      response in patients not eligible for or refused high-dose chemotherapy.
