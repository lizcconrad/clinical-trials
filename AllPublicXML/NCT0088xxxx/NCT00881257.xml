      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      Minnow Medical GRST™ Peripheral Catheter System in the treatment of de novo lesions in the
      superficial femoral artery (SFA) or the popliteal artery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is ≥18 of age.

          2. Patient is Rutherford category 2-4.

          3. De novo single lesion with a diameter stenosis (%DS) of ≥50%

          4. Target lesion is a de novo occlusion that can be successfully pre-dilated resulting in
             a lesion of &lt;99%.

          5. Target lesion stenosis has a length of ≤100 mm based on visual assessment.

          6. Target vessel reference diameter is ≥3.0 mm and ≤7.0 mm based on visual assessment.

          7. Angiographic evidence of distal runoff defined as minimum one patent tibial artery
             with a straight flow to the foot.

          8. Patient is willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to any study
             specific procedure.

          9. Patient is willing and able to comply with specified follow-up evaluations at the
             specified times.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior PTA in the intended target lesion including 10 mm proximal or distal from the
             intended treatment area.

          2. Evidence of thrombus in the target vessel.

          3. Prior ipsilateral or contralateral lower limb arterial bypass.

          4. Treatment of ipsilateral lesions during the index procedure or planned treatment after
             the index procedure.

          5. Target lesion is severely calcified.

          6. Any known allergies and / or intolerances to the following: ASA, Clopidogrel, Heparin,
             contrast agents (that cannot be adequately pre-medicated).

          7. Any planned surgery within 30 days of the study procedure.

          8. Renal failure (serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL).

          9. Female with childbearing potential without a negative pregnancy test.

         10. Patient has had an organ transplant.

         11. Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or device study which
             has not reached the primary endpoint yet or which clinically interferes with the
             endpoints of this study.

         12. In the investigator's opinion, the patient has a severe co-morbid condition(s) that
             could limit the ability to participate in the study.
