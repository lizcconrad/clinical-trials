    <textblock>
      People with heart failure may have low magnesium and low vitamin D levels. They may also have
      abnormally high levels of parathyroid hormones. Magnesium and vitamin D are important
      chemicals that are not routinely measured in blood tests. We are studying how many people
      with heart failure have low levels of magnesium and vitamin D. We are also studying how many
      people with heart failure have overactive parathyroid glands and if that is related to their
      vitamin D levels.

      This is a single-encounter crossectional prevalence study in which demographic information,
      health opinion surveys and labwork are all obtained at one visit. There are no follow up
      visits, however, if abnormal lab results are discovered, participants will be notified via US
      mail.
