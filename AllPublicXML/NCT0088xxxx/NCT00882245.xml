  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic Dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affect 10 to 15% of children
      and 2 to 10% of adults. AD is characterised by an itchy skin eruption and may cover large
      parts of the body. The exact cause is unknown but is thought to be an interplay between
      genetic and and environmental factors. The objective of this study is to determine whether
      SRD441 ointment is a safe and effective therapy for mild to moderate Atopic Dermatitis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects aged 18 or over

          -  Subjects with a history of AD

          -  Written and dated informed consent

          -  Satisfactory medical assessment with no clinical relevant abnormalities.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with current or recurrent disease (except AD) that could affect the site of
             application, the action, absorption or disposition of the investigational product, or
             clinical or laboratory assessments.

          -  Subjects who have medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with trial participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of trial results and, in the
             judgement of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into
             this trial.

          -  Subjects with any skin tattoo, scar, cuts, bruises, or other skin damage, including
             excessive UV exposure, at the possible drug application sites which could impact the
             application of the test agent or confound the local assessments during this study.

          -  Subjects with clinically significant renal and liver parameters, as defined as greater
             than 1.5 x creatinine and 3 x AST ULN (upper limit of normal) respectively.
