  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colon and rectal cancer is the second most prevalent malignant disease in the western world,
      causing significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare sources use. Treating colon and
      rectal cancer with curative intent generally includes resection of the primary tumor. Despite
      its crucial role, surgery by itself induce physiological changes resulting in significant
      immune depression and other physiological perturbations, which may in turn play a significant
      role in the initiation of new metastases and the progression of pre-existing dormant
      metastases. The aim of this study is to assess the use of perioperative medical intervention
      using a combination of a β-adrenergic blocker (Propranolol) and a COX2 inhibitor (Etodolac),
      in order to attenuate the surgically induced immunosuppression and other physiological
      perturbations, aiming to reduce the rate of tumor recurrence and distant metastatic disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients planned for surgery for primary resection of colon and rectal cancer in
             curative intent.

          -  Single colonic or rectal carcinoma, proofed by full colonoscopy and tumor biopsy. If
             colonoscopy failed to reach the cecum, proximal colonic investigation will be made
             using contract enema or CT colonography.

          -  No evidence of metastatic disease prior to surgery. Minimal workup would include
             abdominal CT with IV contrast (or CT+liver US) and chest XR.

          -  Age between 18 and 75 year old.

          -  ASA score of 1-3

          -  The patient is able to understand the study objectives and procedures, able to comply
             with the protocol, and is capable to sign an informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with metastatic disease, known prior to surgery.

          -  Patients in whom metastatic disease is found at surgery will complete the intervention
             phase, followed for additional month for potential complications, and will exit the
             study to allow potential participation in further clinical trials.

          -  Patients in whom surgical resection is planned without curative intent.
