  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether participating in a Mindfulness-Based Stress
      Reduction (MBSR) program increases mindful attention and awareness, and whether anticipated
      changes in mindfulness relate to improved emotional well-being, sleep quality, physical
      symptoms of stress, sense of spirituality, and quality of life following MBSR.

      This study will be conducted among men and women participating in 8-week Mindfulness-Based
      Stress Reduction (MBSR) classes at Duke Integrative Medicine in Durham, North Carolina. The
      central hypothesis of this NIH-funded clinical trial (K99 AT004945, PI: Greeson) is that
      mindfulness meditation training is associated with increased levels of mindfulness and
      improved cognitive-emotional functioning that, together, are associated with reduced
      psychological distress, improved sleep quality, and decreased stress-related physical
      symptoms, including muscle tension, headache, and gastrointestinal complaints. This study is
      designed to examine psychological mechanisms that may explain individual differences in MBSR
      outcomes. This knowledge is important because it will help us better understand who is most
      likely to benefit from mindfulness meditation training, and why. The results from this study
      are expected to elucidate mechanisms underlying the mental and physical health benefits of
      stress reduction, which can help guide clinicians in referring the most suitable patients to
      local MBSR programs.

    <description>Participation will involve online completion of a questionnaire survey before and after the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention. Specifically, research study participants will complete validated self-report measures to assess mindfulness, cognitive-emotional processes, sleep quality, symptoms of stress, sense of spirituality, and quality of life before and after the MBSR intervention.</description>

    <description>The MBSR program consists of 8 weekly classes that last for 2.5 hours each and a commitment to daily meditation practice for the duration of the course. Classes include didactic instruction on mindfulness and its relationship to stress and health, guided meditation practices, and group discussion. Mindfulness meditation practices include awareness of breathing, awareness of emotions, body scan, mindful hatha yoga, mindful walking, mindful eating, mindful listening, and lovingkindness (metta). Participants are expected to practice formal meditation outside of class for 20-45 min per day, 6 days per week. In addition, participants are encouraged apply mindfulness to everyday activities like eating, communicating with others, and hobbies. Written materials and audio CDs with guided meditations and yoga are provided. The course also includes one full day (7-hours) of meditation on a Saturday following the 6th week of class.</description>
