  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether two new psychostimulant medications are more effective,
      tolerable, and acceptable than two older medications for treating attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by impulsiveness,
      hyperactivity, and inattention. It is seen primarily in children and adolescents and is often
      treated with psychostimulant medications. Osmotic-release oral system (OROS) methylphenidate,
      brand name Concerta, and mixed amphetamine salts extended release, brand name Adderall XR,
      are psychostimulant medications that have shown both efficacy (that they can have therapeutic
      benefits) and effectiveness (that they typically have therapeutic benefits in practice). Two
      newer psychostimulant medications—lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, brand name Vyvanse, and
      methylphenidate transdermal system, brand name Daytrana—have shown efficacy but have not been
      tested for effectiveness, nor have they been tested head-to-head against the older
      psychostimulants. This study will test the effectiveness, tolerability (lack of side
      effects), and acceptability (ease of use for patients) of the two newer psychostimulant
      medications and compare them to each other and to the two older psychostimulants.

      Participation in this study will last 6 weeks, although some treatments may continue past the
      end of the study. At enrollment, participants will undergo a series of baseline evaluations.
      These will include interviews and assessments of ADHD symptoms, concurrent psychiatric
      disorders, medical and psychiatric history, family history of mental illness, risk and
      protective factors, other treatments, treatment expectancy of both the youth and parent, and
      vital signs. In consultation with their doctors, participants will be allowed to exclude
      zero, one, or two of the study medications; if they choose to exclude both of the new ADHD
      medications, they will not able to participate in the study. Participants will then be
      randomly assigned to one of the treatments they choose to include. They will receive a
      prescription for the medication and instructions for how to use it from their doctors; the
      study protocol does not specify a particular treatment regimen. Participants will undergo a
      second set of evaluations after 6 weeks of treatment or before, if the treatment ends
      earlier. This will include interviews and assessments similar to those administered at
      baseline as well as evaluation of any medication side effects.

    <measure>Dichotomized Clinical Global Impression-Effectiveness (CGI-E) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at each participant's last visit, which can occur at or before Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-E is the value at which the participant's Therapeutic Benefit and Adverse Impact to the study drug intersect. This number is determined by combining each participant's scores for the degree of Therapeutic Benefit versus the degree to which problems with Tolerability and/or Acceptability adversely impact the subject. Participants are then determined to be Responders or Non-responders to the study medication. For example, a subject who is very much improved (CGI-I=1) or much improved (CGI-I=2) therapeutically and whose adverse impact rating is none (score 1,5) or mild (score 2,6) will be categorized as a Responder. All others whose adverse impact rating is moderate (score 3,7,11,15)or outweighs therapeutic effect (score 4,8,12,16) will be categorized as Non-responders to study medication. The CGI scores are totaled for each participant and a mean score is calculated. A median total score was calculated for each treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at each participant's last visit, which can occur at or before Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I score at the subject's last study visit at or before Week 6, is one of the 3 secondary endpoints that contribute to the primary endpoint (CGI-E). The CGI-I scale will be used to rate improvement in the subject's condition (benefits) since baseline using the following 7-point scale: 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=not changed, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse; 7=very much worse.</description>

    <description>The CGI-A score at the subject's last study visit at or before Week 6 is one of the 3 secondary endpoints that contribute to the primary endpoint (CGI-E). The CGI-A will be used to assess the acceptability of the study medication with respect to the subject's experience with the formulation of medication. The 7-point rating for the CGI-A will be: 1=very high acceptability, 2=high acceptability, 3=above average acceptability, 4=average acceptability, 5=low acceptability, 6=very low acceptability, 7=extremely low acceptability</description>

The FDA maximum dose per day is 70 mg. Afternoon doses should be avoided because of the potential for insomnia. Vyvanse may be taken with or without food. Vyvanse capsules may be taken whole, or the capsule may be opened and the entire contents dissolved in a glass of water. The solution should be consumed immediately and should not be stored.

The off label maximum dose is 108 mg. Longer acting stimulants offer greater convenience, confidentiality, and compliance with single daily dosing, but may have greater problematic effects on evening appetite and sleep.

        <title>Dichotomized Clinical Global Impression-Effectiveness (CGI-E) Scale</title>
        <description>The CGI-E is the value at which the participant's Therapeutic Benefit and Adverse Impact to the study drug intersect. This number is determined by combining each participant's scores for the degree of Therapeutic Benefit versus the degree to which problems with Tolerability and/or Acceptability adversely impact the subject. Participants are then determined to be Responders or Non-responders to the study medication. For example, a subject who is very much improved (CGI-I=1) or much improved (CGI-I=2) therapeutically and whose adverse impact rating is none (score 1,5) or mild (score 2,6) will be categorized as a Responder. All others whose adverse impact rating is moderate (score 3,7,11,15)or outweighs therapeutic effect (score 4,8,12,16) will be categorized as Non-responders to study medication. The CGI scores are totaled for each participant and a mean score is calculated. A median total score was calculated for each treatment group.</description>
