  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if IMC-EB10 is safe for patients with leukemia, and
      also to determine the best dose of IMC-EB10 to give to patients.

      The purpose of this study is to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the anti-FLT3 monoclonal antibody IMC-EB10, administered
      weekly in patients with AML who have failed to achieve complete remission to a standard
      induction regimen, relapsed after response to previous antileukemia therapy, or are not
      eligible for potentially curative or approved salvage options.

    <description>Cohort 1 will receive IMC-EB10 intravenously for 3 weekly infusions, followed by a 1-week observation period. The starting dose in Cohort 1 will be 5 mg/kg. After all patients in Cohort 1 complete the first cycle of therapy, dose escalation for subsequent cohorts will proceed as follows: Cohort 2 - 10 mg/kg, Cohort 3 - 20 mg/kg, Cohort 4 - 30 mg/kg. Patients who experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will not receive further IMC-EB10 treatment, but will continue to be followed on the protocol. Patients may continue to receive IMC-EB10 therapy, in the absence of treatment failure, treatment intolerance, or other withdrawal criteria for additional 28-day cycles at the same dose that they initially received. Dosing for cycle 2 and beyond will be administered on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day treatment cycle</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has acute myeloid leukemia in the bone marrow or blood that has relapsed
             with or without a prior complete remission

          2. The patient is not regarded to be a candidate for a potentially curative, higher
             priority treatment for acute myeloid leukemia

          3. The patient has resolution of all clinically significant toxic effects of any prior
             antitumor therapy and any other study-specific clinical or laboratory parameter
             specified in the entry criteria

          4. The patient has not had major surgery, an open biopsy, a significant injury, and/or
             prior antitumor therapy (except antileukemia therapy) within 21 days prior to the
             first infusion of IMC-EB10

             year. A patient who has basal cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ of the cervix will
             not be excluded from the study

          6. The patient is currently receiving antileukemia therapy. Concurrent treatment with

             criteria

          8. The patient is receiving chronic steroid or other immunosuppressive medications.
             Occasional use of steroid-containing medications, eg, for asthma exacerbation or for
             skin lesions, is permitted

          9. The patient is receiving full-dose heparin (including low molecular weight heparin) or
             warfarin. (The patient is permitted to use low-dose warfarin to maintain patency of
             preexisting, permanent, indwelling I.V. catheters.)

         10. The patient is pregnant (confirmed by urine or serum pregnancy test) or breast feeding

         11. The patient has received treatment with monoclonal antibodies within 6 weeks prior to
             first infusion of IMC-EB10

             antibodies or other therapeutic proteins
