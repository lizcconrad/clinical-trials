  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term follow-up banking protocol that collects medical information and tissue
      (blood, liver and lung) samples for future research; use of data and samples for research
      purposes is overseen by the Tissue Bank Advisory Committee; the purpose of the Bank is to
      further research on alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subject participation includes completion of informed consent, medical questionnaire, and
      email authorization. Subjects may provide a blood sample for alpha-1 antitrypsin genotype,
      phenotype and level. Lung and liver tissue may also be provided if available. Subjects may be
      contacted no more often than annually for updated information.

      This project has a certificate of confidentiality from NIH.
