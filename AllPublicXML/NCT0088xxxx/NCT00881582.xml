  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a distinct lack of published literature on the effect of combination treatment of
      PEG-interferon and ribavirin on post-renal transplantation hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients.
      Small case series have been published utilizing conventional interferon and/or ribavirin and
      the available data is extremely preliminary in nature. A small retrospective series of
      patients treated with Pegylated interferon and ribavirin published recently suggests that the
      treatment may be safe and efficacious. Unpublished reports from a few centers within Saudi
      Arabia also suggest a good safety profile and reasonable efficacy from this form of
      combination treatment.

      The investigators aim to prospectively study the safety and efficacy of PEG-interferon and
      ribavirin combination therapy in post-renal transplant HCV-infected patients. Towards this 40
      patients with histological evidence of liver disease will be recruited and the efficacy of
      the above medications studied.

      The proposed study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PEG-interferon and ribavirin
      combination therapy in the treatment of chronic HCV in renal transplant patients in a way
      that will allow management of such patients in an optimized manner.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients, male and female, aged 18 - 68 years

          -  Post renal transplant patients exceeding one year

          -  Anti-HCV (Abbott HCV EIA 2.0, Abbott Diagnostic, Chicago, IL) positive &gt; 6 months
             AND/OR

          -  Detectable serum quantitative HCV-RNA (Cobas Amplicor HCV Monitor v2.0, Roche
             Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA) with lower limit of detection at 50 IU/mL

          -  Compensated liver disease with the following minimum hematologic and biochemical
             criteria:

          -  Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL

          -  WBC &gt; 3000/mm3 ; granulocyte count &gt; 1,500/mm3

          -  Platelet count &gt; 75,000/mm3

          -  Albumin within normal limits

          -  TFT within normal limits

          -  ANA &lt; 1:320

          -  Ultrasound of the liver obtained within the preceding 6 months of study entry

          -  Liver biopsy prior to entry confirming a histological diagnosis consistent with HCV
             necroinflammatory score (METAVIR) &gt; 1, and fibrosis score &gt;/= 2.
