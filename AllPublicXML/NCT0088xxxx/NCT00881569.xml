  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of CS-7017 designed to allow subjects who completed participation in a
      clinical study of CS 7017 without experiencing disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
      to continue treatment with study drug. Subjects who have not progressed while receiving
      CS-7017 will continue to benefit from longer administration of the agent.
