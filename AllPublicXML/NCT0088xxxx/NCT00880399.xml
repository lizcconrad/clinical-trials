  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6-week, randomised, multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled, fixed dose
      parallel group study to assess the efficacy and safety of orvepitant (30 and 60 mg/day)
      versus placebo in subjects with a diagnosis of a Major Depressive Disorder, whose symptoms
      are considered moderate or severe.

      Following an initial screening visit, subjects fulfilling the study inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will enter a pre-treatment screening phase to permit evaluation of the laboratory
      and ECG assessments and to confirm eligibility for inclusion into the study. This screening
      phase will be a minimum of 7 days, but no longer than 21 days. At the completion of the
      screening period, eligible subjects will be randomised at the baseline visit to receive
      either orvepitant 30mg/day, orvepitant 60mg/day or placebo (equal chance of receiving any of
      the three possible treatments, i.e., a 1:1:1 ratio) for a six-week double-blind treatment
      phase. Those subjects randomised to receive placebo will receive study medication identical
      in appearance to that received by subjects assigned to receive orvepitant 30 or 60mg/day.

      Efficacy will be assessed via standard depression symptom and severity rating scales or
      questionaires. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) will be used as the primary
      measure. Secondary efficacy endpoints include the Quick Inventory of Depressive
      Symptomatology (QIDS-SR) and the Clinical Global Impression- Global Improvement and Severity
      of Illness Scale (CGI-I and CGI-S, respectively).

      Safety will be assessed by monitoring for adverse events (side effects) and through periodic
      laboratory evaluations (blood tests), vital signs assessments (e.g., blood pressure, heart
      rate, temperature) and heart function measurements (electrocardiograms, or ECGs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to test the safety and the anti-depressant effects of
      orvepitant, an investigational antidepressant. Efficacy will be assessed using standard
      depression symptom and severity rating scales (questionaires). The Hamilton Depression Rating
      Scale (HAM-D) will serve as the primary measure of efficacy, and . Secondary efficacy
      endpoints include the Bech Melancholia Scale (sum of items 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, and 13 of the
      17-item HAM-D scale), the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR), the
      Clinical Global Impression- Global Improvement and Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-I and
      CGI-S, respectively), the HAM-D anxiety factor score (sum of items 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 and
      17), the Cognitive and Physical Function Questionnaire (CPFQ) and a morning sleep
      questionnaire.

      Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs or side effects),
      physical examinations (including vital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate), clinical
      laboratory assessments (blood tests), electrical recordings of the heart (electrocardiograms
      or ECG's), the Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS), Sexual Function
      Questionnaire (SFQ), and weight change.

      Blood samples will be taken at different time points to assess blood levels of orvepitant in
      patients, allowing the relationship between amount of orvepitant in the body and efficacy to
      be studied.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the antidepressant efficacy of orvepitant
      (30 and 60mg/day) versus placebo (a &quot;sugar pill&quot;, with no active ingredients). The secondary
      objectives include assessing the safety and tolerability of orvepitant, assessing the profile
      of appearance and disappearance of orvepitant in the body (blood) following administration
      (i.e., assessing how long the drug remains in the body), and lastly to examine the
      relationship between blood levels of the drug and efficacy (i..e, the change in HAM-D total
      score relative to what it was before starting the study medication.

      Following an initial screening visit, subjects fulfilling the study entrance criteria will
      enter a pre-treatment screening phase to permit evaluation of the laboratory and
      electrocardiogram assessments and to confirm eligibility for inclusion into the study. This
      screening phase will be a minimum of 7 days, but no longer than 21 days. During the screening
      period, subjects may undergo up to three different assessments of their depressive symptoms,
      this may occur via a face-to-face interview or via an interview over the telephone. Upon
      completion of the screening period, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned at the
      baseline visit to one of three treatment regimens: orvepitant 30mg/day, orvepitant 60mg/day
      or placebo for a six-week treatment phase. The chances of receiving each of the three
      possible treatments will be equal. Orvepitant will be administered as tablets. Those subjects
      randomised to receive placebo will receive study medication identical in appearance to that
      received by subjects assigned to receive orvepitant.

      During the treatment phase, subjects will be required to return to the clinic at the end of
      Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6. In addition, all subjects will be required to return for a follow-up
      visit 14 days after the last dose of study medication. In addition, all subjects with ongoing
      adverse events at the 14-day follow-up visit will be required to return for a further
      follow-up visit 28 days after the last dose of study medication.

      Male and female outpatients between the ages of 18 to 64 years inclusive with a primary
      diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder will be enrolled into this study. A total of
      approximately 350 subjects are expected to be enrolled at approximately 20 different study
      sites in the U.S. and Canada.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D is designed to measure severity of depressive symptoms in participants with primary depressive illness. The scale is a checklist of items (1: depressed mood, 2: feelings of guilt, 3: suicide, insomnia early, 4: insomnia early, 5: insomnia middle, 6: insomnia late, 7: work and activities, 8: retardation, 9: agitation, 10: anxiety psychic item 10: anxiety psychic, item 11: anxiety somatic, item 12: somatic symptoms gastrointestinal, 13: somatic symptoms general, 14: genital symptoms, 15: hypochondriasis, 16: loss of weight and 17: insight) that are ranked on a scale of 0 to 4 or 0 to 2 (4 and 2: highly severe and 0: not present). The HAM-D total score is calculated by summing individual response scores on the HAM-D questionnaire. The highest possible score is 52, representing most severe measure of depression; lowest possible score is 0, representing no depression. Baseline was Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a &gt;= 50 Percent (%) Reduction From Baseline in HAM-D Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who had 50% or greater reduction from Baseline in their total HAMD score were termed as responders. The HAM-D was designed to measure the severity of depressive symptoms in participants with primary depressive illness. The scale is a checklist of items that are ranked on a scale of 0 to 4 or 0 to 2. Items with quantifiable severity are scored 0 to 4 (4 indicating the greatest severity) or 0 to 2 (2 indicating the greatest severity) with 0 indicating not present. The HAM-D Total Score is calculated by summing the individual response scores on the HAM-D questionnaire. The highest possible score is 52, which represents the most severe measure of depression; the lowest possible score is 0, which represents an absence of depression. The HAM-D is also useful for monitoring changes in depressive symptoms with treatment and in comparing the efficacy of various interventions if the participant requires more than one type of treatment. Baseline was Day 1.</description>

    <description>The CPFQ is a brief self-report scale which is designed to measure cognitive and executive dysfunction in mood and anxiety disorders. The scale comprises 7 questions assessing each of the most common complaints of depressed participants reporting fatigue or cognitive/executive problems. Each question is rated on a scale of 1 to 6, (1 = greater than normal; 2 = normal; 3 = minimally diminished; 4=moderately diminished; 5 = markedly diminished; and 6 = totally absent). The following five areas were included: motivation/interest/enthusiasm; wakefulness/alertness; energy; focus/sustain attention; remember/recall information; find words and sharpness/mental acuity. The total score (sum of individual question scores) ranged from 7 to 42. Lower score 7 represents greater than normal functioning and higher score 42 indicate poorer functioning (worst outcome). Baseline was Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The MSQ is a self-rated scale designed to assess effects on sleep and effects on next day functioning. The following six variables were assessed in order to determine effects on sleep: (1) total sleep time, (2) sleep onset latency, (3) number of nocturnal awakenings, (4) wake time after sleep onset, (5) sleep quality (where poor=1 and excellent= 10) and (6) the refreshing value of the sleep (where poor=1 and excellent= 10). During the conduct of the study, participants self-administered the MSQ via an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) from their home the morning of each clinic visit. Participants were provided paper MSQ diary cards for note taking prior to completing the IVRS call. If a participant did not remember to place the IVRS MSQ call the morning of the clinic visit from home, they were allowed to place the call during in the clinic during their visit. Baseline was Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

    <description>The C-SSRS is a clinician-rated scale that evaluates severity and change of suicidality by integrating both behavior and ideation. It has 3 sections, Suicidal Behavior (SB), Suicidal Ideation (SI) and Intensity of Ideation (II). For SB, participants (par) were scored non-suicidal:0, preparatory acts or behavior communicating ideation:1, aborted attempt:2, interrupted attempt:3 or actual attempt:4 (most severe). For SI, par were scored non-suicidal:0, wish to be dead:1, non-specific active suicidal thoughts:2, active suicidal ideation with associated thoughts of methods without intent:3, active suicidal ideation with some intent to act on suicidal thoughts without clear plan:4, active suicidal ideation with plan and intent:5 (most severe). II scale made of 5 questions measuring frequency, duration, controllability, deterrent and reasons; par received a separate score on most common ideation and on most severe. Total II score is obtained by adding scores from all 5 questions.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) Total Score</title>
        <description>The HAM-D is designed to measure severity of depressive symptoms in participants with primary depressive illness. The scale is a checklist of items (1: depressed mood, 2: feelings of guilt, 3: suicide, insomnia early, 4: insomnia early, 5: insomnia middle, 6: insomnia late, 7: work and activities, 8: retardation, 9: agitation, 10: anxiety psychic item 10: anxiety psychic, item 11: anxiety somatic, item 12: somatic symptoms gastrointestinal, 13: somatic symptoms general, 14: genital symptoms, 15: hypochondriasis, 16: loss of weight and 17: insight) that are ranked on a scale of 0 to 4 or 0 to 2 (4 and 2: highly severe and 0: not present). The HAM-D total score is calculated by summing individual response scores on the HAM-D questionnaire. The highest possible score is 52, representing most severe measure of depression; lowest possible score is 0, representing no depression. Baseline was Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

        <population>The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population comprised of all participants who were randomized and received at least one dose of double blind medication and for whom at least one post-randomization assessment was available.

        <description>Participants who had 50% or greater reduction from Baseline in their total HAMD score were termed as responders. The HAM-D was designed to measure the severity of depressive symptoms in participants with primary depressive illness. The scale is a checklist of items that are ranked on a scale of 0 to 4 or 0 to 2. Items with quantifiable severity are scored 0 to 4 (4 indicating the greatest severity) or 0 to 2 (2 indicating the greatest severity) with 0 indicating not present. The HAM-D Total Score is calculated by summing the individual response scores on the HAM-D questionnaire. The highest possible score is 52, which represents the most severe measure of depression; the lowest possible score is 0, which represents an absence of depression. The HAM-D is also useful for monitoring changes in depressive symptoms with treatment and in comparing the efficacy of various interventions if the participant requires more than one type of treatment. Baseline was Day 1.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Bech Melancholia Scale Total Score (Sum of Items 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, and 13 of the 17-item HAMD Scale)</title>
        <description>The Bech Melancholia is sum of scores on 6 items/questions (item 1: depressed mood, item 2: feelings of guilt, item 7: work and activities, item 8: retardation, item 10: anxiety psychic and item 13: somatic symptoms general) pertaining to melancholia within HAM-D. The items are rated on a scale of 0 to 4 (items 1, 2, 7, 8 and 10) or 0 to 2 (item 13), higher scores reflecting greater severity. The highest possible score is 24, which represents the most severe measure of melancholy; the lowest possible score is 0, which represents an absence of melancholy. Baseline was Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR 16) Total Score</title>
        <description>The QIDS-SR is a self-report rating scale that assesses symptom severity of major depressive disorders. The QIDS-SR utilized during this study contained 16 separate items which correspond to 9 symptom criterion domains: (1) sad mood, (2) concentration, (3) self-criticism, (4) suicidal ideation,(5) interest, (6) energy/fatigue, (7) sleep disturbance (initial, middle, and late insomnia or hypersomnia), (8) decrease/increase in appetite/weight, and (9) psychomotor agitation/retardation. The QIDS-SR total score was calculated using the sum of the domain scores. The highest possible total QIDS-SR score is 27, which represents the most severe measure of depression. The lowest possible score is 0, which represents an absence of depression. Baseline was Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR 16) Total Score</title>
          <description>The QIDS-SR is a self-report rating scale that assesses symptom severity of major depressive disorders. The QIDS-SR utilized during this study contained 16 separate items which correspond to 9 symptom criterion domains: (1) sad mood, (2) concentration, (3) self-criticism, (4) suicidal ideation,(5) interest, (6) energy/fatigue, (7) sleep disturbance (initial, middle, and late insomnia or hypersomnia), (8) decrease/increase in appetite/weight, and (9) psychomotor agitation/retardation. The QIDS-SR total score was calculated using the sum of the domain scores. The highest possible total QIDS-SR score is 27, which represents the most severe measure of depression. The lowest possible score is 0, which represents an absence of depression. Baseline was Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the HAM-D Anxiety Factor Score (Sum of Items 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 17)</title>
        <description>The HAMD anxiety factor score includes 6 items/questions (item 10: anxiety psychic, item 11: anxiety somatic, item 12: somatic symptoms gastrointestinal, item 13: somatic symptoms general, item 15: hypochondriasis and item 17: insight). The items are rated on a scale of 0 to 4 (items 10, 11 and 15) or 0 to 2 (items 12, 13 and 17), higher scores reflecting greater severity. The highest possible score is 18, which represents the most severe measure of anxiety; the lowest possible score is 0, which represents an absence of anxiety. Baseline was Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Global Impression- Global Improvement (CGI-I) Score of 1 (Very Much Improved) or 2 (Much Improved)</title>
        <description>The CGI is a widely accepted measure of illness severity and clinical improvement in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Global improvement (CGI-I) item is rated on a 1-7 scale. The CGI-I assessed scores range from 1 - very much improved to 7 - very much worse. For the CGI-I, the investigator or delegated qualified clinician indicated their assessment of the participant’s total improvement or worsening compared with the individual’s condition at the start of the study whether or not the change was judged to be due to drug treatment. A participant with a CGI-I score of 1 'very much improved' or 2 'much improved' was considered a responder. Percentage of responders are reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Score</title>
        <description>The CGI is a widely accepted measure of illness severity and clinical improvement in a variety of psychiatric disorders. For the CGI-S, an independent site rater assessed the participant’s severity of illness considering (1) their total clinical experience with the particular population being studied and (2) information obtained during the Baseline HAM-D interview with the participant. The severity of illness (CGI-S) item is rated on a 1 to 7 scale such that 1 (normal, not at all ill) and 7 (among the most extremely ill). Higher scores indicate worsening. Baseline was Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Cognitive and Physical Function Questionnaire (CPFQ) Total Score</title>
        <description>The CPFQ is a brief self-report scale which is designed to measure cognitive and executive dysfunction in mood and anxiety disorders. The scale comprises 7 questions assessing each of the most common complaints of depressed participants reporting fatigue or cognitive/executive problems. Each question is rated on a scale of 1 to 6, (1 = greater than normal; 2 = normal; 3 = minimally diminished; 4=moderately diminished; 5 = markedly diminished; and 6 = totally absent). The following five areas were included: motivation/interest/enthusiasm; wakefulness/alertness; energy; focus/sustain attention; remember/recall information; find words and sharpness/mental acuity. The total score (sum of individual question scores) ranged from 7 to 42. Lower score 7 represents greater than normal functioning and higher score 42 indicate poorer functioning (worst outcome). Baseline was Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Morning Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ) Values for Total Sleep Time (TST), Sleep Onset Latency (SOL) and Wake Time After Sleep Onset (WTSO)</title>
        <description>The MSQ is a self-rated scale designed to assess effects on sleep and effects on next day functioning. The following six variables were assessed in order to determine effects on sleep: (1) total sleep time, (2) sleep onset latency, (3) number of nocturnal awakenings, (4) wake time after sleep onset, (5) sleep quality (where poor=1 and excellent= 10) and (6) the refreshing value of the sleep (where poor=1 and excellent= 10). During the conduct of the study, participants self-administered the MSQ via an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) from their home the morning of each clinic visit. Participants were provided paper MSQ diary cards for note taking prior to completing the IVRS call. If a participant did not remember to place the IVRS MSQ call the morning of the clinic visit from home, they were allowed to place the call during in the clinic during their visit. Baseline was Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in MSQ Values for Number of Nocturnal Awakenings</title>
        <description>The MSQ is a self-rated scale designed to assess effects on sleep and effects on next day functioning. The following six variables were assessed in order to determine effects on sleep: (1) total sleep time, (2) sleep onset latency, (3) number of nocturnal awakenings, (4) wake time after sleep onset, (5) sleep quality (where poor=1 and excellent= 10) and (6) the refreshing value of the sleep (where poor=1 and excellent= 10). During the conduct of the study, participants self-administered the MSQ via an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) from their home the morning of each clinic visit. Participants were provided paper MSQ diary cards for note taking prior to completing the IVRS call. If a participant did not remember to place the IVRS MSQ call the morning of the clinic visit from home, they were allowed to place the call during in the clinic during their visit. Baseline was Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in MSQ Values for Sleep Quality (SQ) and Refreshing Value of Sleep (RVS)</title>
        <description>The MSQ is a self-rated scale designed to assess effects on sleep and effects on next day functioning. The score relating to SQ and RVS was measured by items/questions 4 and 5 respectively of the MSQ. The following two variables SQ and RVS were assessed in order to determine effects on sleep. Participants were asked to rate their SQ and RVS on a scale of 1 to 10. This scale has no subscales. The total score for SQ and RVS, both, ranged from 1 to 10 where 1=poor and 10=excellent. Lower scores indicated poor SQ and RVS and higher scores indicated excellent SQ and excellent RVS. During the conduct of study, participants self-administered MSQ via an IVRS from their home the morning of each clinic visit. If a participant did not remember to place IVRS MSQ call the morning of the clinic visit from home, they were allowed to place call during in the clinic during their visit. Baseline was Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</description>

        <description>A HAM-D remitter was defined as a participant with a HAM-D total score less than or equal to 7. The HAM-D was designed to measure the severity of depressive symptoms in participants with primary depressive illness. The scale is a checklist of items that are ranked on a scale of 0 to 4 or 0 to 2. Items with quantifiable severity are scored 0 to 4 (4 indicating the greatest severity) or 0 to 2 (2 indicating the greatest severity) with 0 indicating not present. The HAM-D Total Score is calculated by summing the individual response scores on the HAM-D questionnaire. The highest possible score is 52, which represents the most severe measure of depression; the lowest possible score is 0, which represents an absence of depression. The HAM-D is also useful for monitoring changes in depressive symptoms with treatment and in comparing the efficacy of various interventions if the participant requires more than one type of treatment.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Suicidal Behavior, Ideation, and Most Common Ideation Using the Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a clinician-rated scale that evaluates severity and change of suicidality by integrating both behavior and ideation. It has 3 sections, Suicidal Behavior (SB), Suicidal Ideation (SI) and Intensity of Ideation (II). For SB, participants (par) were scored non-suicidal:0, preparatory acts or behavior communicating ideation:1, aborted attempt:2, interrupted attempt:3 or actual attempt:4 (most severe). For SI, par were scored non-suicidal:0, wish to be dead:1, non-specific active suicidal thoughts:2, active suicidal ideation with associated thoughts of methods without intent:3, active suicidal ideation with some intent to act on suicidal thoughts without clear plan:4, active suicidal ideation with plan and intent:5 (most severe). II scale made of 5 questions measuring frequency, duration, controllability, deterrent and reasons; par received a separate score on most common ideation and on most severe. Total II score is obtained by adding scores from all 5 questions.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Massachusetts Sexual Function Questionnaire (MSFQ)-Males</title>
        <description>The MSFQ is a self report rating scale derived from the Guided Interview Questionnaire for females and males. The questionnaire includes five questions with a score for each question ranging from 1 to 6 (1 = greater than normal; 2 = normal; 3 = minimally diminished; 4=moderately diminished; 5 = markedly diminished; and 6 = totally absent). The following five areas of sexual functioning were included: (1) diminished/absent libido; (2) arousal difficulties; (3) orgasm difficulties/anorgasmia; (4) erectile dysfunction (males only) and (5) degree of sexual satisfaction. A total score (sum of individual question score) was used as a global measure of sexual dysfunction which ranged from 5 to 30, where 5 represents greater than normal functioning and 30 represents poorer function (worst outcome). Baseline was Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values. A negative change from Baseline was considered a positive outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the MSFQ Total Score-Females</title>
        <description>The MSFQ is a self report rating scale derived from the Guided Interview Questionnaire for females and males. The questionnaire includes five questions with a score for each question ranging from 1 to 6 (1 = greater than normal; 2 = normal; 3 = minimally diminished; 4=moderately diminished; 5 = markedly diminished; and 6 = totally absent). The following four areas of sexual functioning were included: (1) diminished/absent libido; (2) arousal difficulties; (3) orgasm difficulties/anorgasmia; and (4) degree of sexual satisfaction. A total score (sum of individual question score) was used as a global measure of sexual dysfunction which ranged from 4 to 24, where 5 represents greater than normal functioning and 24 represents poorer function (worst outcome). Baseline was Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values. A negative change from Baseline was considered a positive outcome.</description>
