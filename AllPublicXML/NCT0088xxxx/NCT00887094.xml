  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies were already performed showing beneficial cardiovascular and metabolic effects
      of physical training for type 2 diabetic patients. However, glucose profile during and
      immediately after a short period of aerobic and/or resistance training was not studied yet.
      Continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) has now been added to the repertoire of
      technological devices useful in the management of patients with diabetes. Such monitoring
      enables clinicians to detect occult hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia not otherwise discernable
      with intermittent testing of blood glucose. The main aim of the present study is to
      investigate continuous blood glucose profile (using CGMS) over 72h, beginning 24h before and
      ending 24h after a single bout of aerobic or aerobic/resistance physical training in type 2
      diabetic patients.
