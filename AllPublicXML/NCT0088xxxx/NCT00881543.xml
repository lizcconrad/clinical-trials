      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the secretion of glucose, insulin, glucagon,
      C-peptide and lipid profile after isocaloric diets with different nutritional compounds (fat,
      protein and carbohydrate food) in drug näive tipo 2 patients.

    <textblock>
      It is well known that there is a progressive deterioration in beta-cell function over time in
      type 2 diabetes (DM2), as indicated by the UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study),
      regardless of therapy allocation, albeit conventional (mainly diet), insulin, chlorpropamide,
      glibenclamide or metformin treatment. Moreover, the pancreatic islet function was found to be
      about 50% of normal at the time of diagnosis, independent of the degree of insulin
      resistance, with the reduction in function probably commencing 10-12 years prior to diagnosis
      and aggravated by increasing fasting plasma glucose levels.

      Optimal metabolic control, especially early intensive glycemic control, plays a role in the
      prevention of progressive beta cell dysfunction and possibly destruction of the betacells
      with worsening of diabetes. Many reports have shown that induction of normoglycemia in DM2
      results in both improved beta cell function and insulin resistance.The major therapeutic
      drawback using native GLP-1 is its very short half-life of less than 2 minutes, following
      exogenous administration, as previously indicated due in part to the protease DDP-IV a
      result, preventing the degradation of native GLP-1 by inhibiting the active of the DDP-IV
      enzyme has emerged as a therapeutic strategy for enhancing endogenous GLP-1 action in
      vivo.Considering that, sitagliptin is the first FDA and ANVISA authorized dipeptidyl
      peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor for diabetes treatment and considering the lack of data about
      DPP-IV inhibitor effect over glucose, glucagon, insulin, C -peptide and fats after isocaloric
      diets with different nutritional composition in drug näive patients with type 2 diabetes, we
      designed this study.

    <description>This arm will begin taking the placebo by a month, after a month will be tested the diets (the same caloric amount with different composition on fat, protein and carbohydrates)making curves of insulin, glucagon, C peptide and glp 1 and lipid when diets are tested (three acute tests with diets). After that, the patient will begin the drug by month (Januvia, 100 mg a day)and repeat all the three curves using the prepared diets to compare with the first month.</description>
