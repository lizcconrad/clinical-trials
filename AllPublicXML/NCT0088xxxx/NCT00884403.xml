  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several large trials report gestational dating by last menstrual period (LMP) overestimates
      gestational age (GA) vs. ultrasound (US) by approximately one week. Previous studies examined
      only term pregnancies. The investigators hypothesize an opposite tendency in women seeking
      abortion. This is an observational study undertaken by chart review.

      Retrospective cohort study by chart review. We propose to review the charts of four thousand
      women obtaining abortion in British Columbia, BC. Data will be extracted from the charts of
      women who obtained abortions between January first 2002 and June 30, 2008 inclusive at two
      abortion clinics in Vancouver, British Columbia: BC Women's Hospital CARE program, and the
      Elizabeth Bagshaw Women's Clinic. Specifically we will record age, parity, date of LMP,
      presence of regular cycles, ultrasound estimation of gestational age, ultrasound
      measurements: crown rump length, bi-parietal diameter, gestational sac diameter if available,
      date of abortion, estimation of gestational age by examination of the products of conception,
      and fetal foot length if available. Further we will record associated factors such as
      contraception at time of conception, intravenous drug use, and regularity of menstrual cycle.
      We will calculate the gestational age at time of abortion by the LMP date, by the ultrasound
      date reported, ultrasound date based on the Hadlock protocol by the reported CRL and
      similarly BPD as well as calculating the gestational age based on the recorded fetal foot
      length.
