  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The acupuncture treatment in this study is particularly aimed at reducing the pain and other
      negative health events such as emotional trauma and disability associated with Fibromyalgia,
      while improving the quality of life and promoting general health.

      It is hypothesized that acupuncture treatment will be effective in reducing pain and
      improving lower body strength and overall functionality more than the sham acupuncture
      treatment in people with Fibromyalgia (FM). The purpose of this study is to compare the
      efficacy of acupuncture with simulated acupuncture in patients with FM using a randomized
      controlled design. More specifically, the objectives of this study are to determine if
      acupuncture can (1) reduce pain, (2) improve lower body strength, and (3) improve overall
      functionality.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must be 18 years or older and can be of either sex.

          2. A confirmed diagnosis of FM (pain for more than three months) will be required to
             participate in the study. If they do not have a diagnosis the study clinician or
             research assistant will examine them and determine their eligibility.

          3. All participants must be willing to provide a written informed consent prior to
             participation and should not have undergone acupuncture treatment in the past.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acupuncture treatment in the past five years.

          2. Unwilling to sign informed consent.

          3. Less than a score of 40 on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire,

          4. Involvement in any litigation currently or in the past,

          5. Simultaneous infection with HIV/Hepatitis B virus.

          6. Severe depression (Beck depression score &gt;21),

          7. History of substance abuse or dependence within the past year, excluding nicotine and
             caffeine.

          8. Serious or unstable cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or hematologic
             illness, symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, or other medical conditions
             (including unstable hypertension, hypo or hyperthyroidism, or psychological conditions
             that in the opinion of the investigators would compromise participation or be likely
             to lead to an adverse response, including injuries or hospitalization, during the
             course of the study. We will get the information from the health/activity
             questionnaire.

          9. Have any DSM-IV Axis (major depression, addiction, anxiety) disorder which, in the
             judgment of the investigators, would interfere with compliance with the study
             protocol.
