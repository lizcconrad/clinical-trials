    <textblock>
      Although cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective intervention for pediatric
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), many people do receive CBT initially. Given this,
      alternative ways of providing CBT need to be identified and tested. With this in mind, the
      proposed study examines the efficacy of a videophone based cognitive-behavioral intervention
      for youth with OCD. A total of 30 youth will be randomly assigned to either videophone
      administered CBT or an abbreviated wait-list control arm. Comprehensive assessments will be
      conducted by trained clinicians at relevant time-points to assess symptom severity and
      impairment.

      Although cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective intervention for pediatric
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), many people do receive CBT initially due, in part, to
      the lack of trained providers and geographic barriers (e.g., distance to such providers).
      Rather, the majority of youth with OCD receive psychiatric medication alone or together with
      unproven forms of psychotherapy. While some serotonergic medications have demonstrated
      utility in pediatric OCD, side effects can be common, response rates are modest at best, and
      symptom remission is rare. Given this, alternative ways of providing CBT need to be
      identified and tested to increase the number of people with access to this form of treatment.
      With this in mind, the proposed study examines the efficacy of a videophone based
      cognitive-behavioral intervention for youth with OCD. A total of 30 youth will be randomly
      assigned to either videophone administered CBT or an abbreviated wait-list control arm.
      Cognitive-behavioral therapy will be based on a demonstrated effective treatment protocol,
      and adapted for videophone administration. Comprehensive assessments will be conducted by
      trained clinicians at relevant time-points (e.g., baseline, post-treatment, follow-up) to
      assess symptom severity and impairment. Should supporting data be found,
      videophone-administered CBT would have the potential to help many more families who would
      otherwise remain untreated or inadequately treated. On a societal level, evaluation and
      dissemination of telehealth interventions such as this will lessen costs related to sustained
      treatment and OCD related impairment.

    <measure>Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS; Scahill et al., 1997). The CY-BOCS is a 10-item Semi-structured Measure of Obsession and Compulsion Severity Over the Previous Week. This Measure Will Serve as the Primary Outcome Index.</measure>
    <time_frame>within one week after treatment condition was concluded</time_frame>
    <description>Items on this scale are summed to arrive at a total score. Scores on this scale range from 0 to 40 with higher scores corresponding to worse symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S; National Institute of Mental Health, 1985). The CGI-S is a 7-point Clinician Rating of Severity of Psychopathology.</measure>
    <time_frame>within one week after treatment condition was concluded</time_frame>
    <description>Scores on this scale range from 0 to 6 with higher scores corresponding to worse symptom severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Improvement (CGI; Guy, 1976). The CGI is a 7-point Rating of Treatment Response Anchored by 1 (&quot;Very Much Improved) and 7 (&quot;Very Much Worse&quot;).</measure>
    <time_frame>within one week after treatment condition was concluded</time_frame>
    <description>Scores on this scale range from 1 to 7. Scores of 1 (very much improved) and 2 (much improved) are grouped together to indicate if a participate has had a beneficial response to the interview. The data represents participants who had a beneficial response to the treatment condition. Scores of 3 (minimally improved), 4 (no change), 5 (minimally worse), 6 (much worse) and 7 (very much worse) are grouped together to indicate that a participant has not had a positive treatment response.</description>

        <description>Scores on this scale range from 1 to 7. Scores of 1 (very much improved) and 2 (much improved) are grouped together to indicate if a participate has had a beneficial response to the interview. The data represents participants who had a beneficial response to the treatment condition. Scores of 3 (minimally improved), 4 (no change), 5 (minimally worse), 6 (much worse) and 7 (very much worse) are grouped together to indicate that a participant has not had a positive treatment response.</description>
