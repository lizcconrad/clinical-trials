  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have a type of cancer called NHL, Multiple Myeloma (MM) or CLL that has come back or
      has not gone away after treatment. There is no standard treatment for the cancer at this time
      or the currently used treatments do not work completely in all cases like these. This is a
      gene transfer research study using special immune cells.

      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease,
      antibodies and T cells, that investigators hope will work together. Antibodies are types of
      proteins that protect the body from bacterial and other diseases. T cells, also called T
      lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including
      tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers; they
      have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.

      The antibody used in this study recognizes a protein on the lymphoma, MM or CLL cells called
      kappa immunoglobulin. Antibodies can stick to lymphoma, MM or CLL cells when it recognizes
      the kappa molecules present on the tumor cells. For this study, the kappa antibody has been
      changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When
      an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These
      chimeric receptor-T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they don't last very long and
      so their chances of fighting the cancer are limited.

      In the laboratory, investigators found that T cells work better if they also add a protein
      that stimulates T cells to grow called CD28. By joining the anti-kappa antibody to the T
      cells and adding the CD28, the investigators expect to be able to make cells that will last
      for a longer time in the body (because of the presence of the CD28). They are hoping this
      will make the cells work better.

      Previously, when patients enrolled on this study, they were assigned to one of three
      different doses of the kappa-CD28 T cells. We found that all three dose levels are safe. Now,
      the plan is to give patients the highest dose that we tested.

      These chimeric T cells (kappa-CD28) are an investigational product not approved by the FDA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To prepare the lymphoma, MM or CLL specific T cells investigators will take 240 ml (up to 16
      tablespoonfuls)of blood from the patient. This would be drawn as 2 (two) separate blood
      collections of 120 ml (up to 8 tablespoonfuls) of blood.

      To get the kappa antibody (with CD28) to attach to the surface of the T cell, investigators
      inserted the antibody gene into the T cell. This is done with a virus called a retrovirus
      that has been made for this study and will carry the antibody gene into the T cell. This
      virus also helps investigators find the T cells in the patient's blood after they're
      injected. Because the patient has received cells with a new gene in them patients will be
      followed for a total of 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene
      transfer.

      Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to grow and accomplish
      their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells in
      circulation. Because of that, if the level of circulating T cells is relatively high or the
      patient has B-CLL, the patient may receive treatment with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine
      (Cy and Flu) prior to the infusion of the T cells. This drug will decrease the numbers of the
      patients own T cells before infusion of the kappa-CD28 T cells. Although investigators don't
      expect any effect on the tumor with the dose that the patient will receive, this drug is part
      of many regimens that are used to treat lymphoma, MM or CLL. If you are already receiving
      chemotherapy, this may not be needed.

      Patients will be given an injection of cells into the vein through an IV line. If s/he
      receives Cy and Flu as stated above, the T cells will be given no sooner than 24 hours
      afterwards. If the patient has recently received other chemotherapy, the T cells will be
      given at least 24 hours after their last chemotherapy. The injection will take about 20
      minutes. Investigators will follow the patient in the clinic after the injection. The
      treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital
      or Houston Methodist Hospital.

      If after a 4-6 week evaluation period after the infusion, the patient seems to be
      experiencing a benefit (confirmed by radiological studies, physical exam and/or symptoms),
      the patient may be able to receive additional doses of the T cells if they wish. These
      additional infusions would be at least 4-6 weeks apart and at the same dose level they
      received the first time or a lower dose. If the patient's circulating T cells are relatively
      high prior to any additional doses of T cells, they may receive Cy and Flu beforehand.

    <description>T cells will be given in a lymphopenic environment utilizing (as needed) lymphodepleting chemotherapy (Cy/Flu) prior to T cell infusion as outlined below:
Patients who are not lymphopenic may receive 3 daily doses of cyclophosphamide (500mg/m2/day) together with fludarabine (30mg/m2) to induce lymphopenia, finishing at least 24 hours before T cell infusion.
Patients with lymphopenia due to current drug therapy may be infused at any time starting at least 24 hours after finishing their current cycle of chemotherapy.
ASCT recipients (relapsed/refractory intermediate grade lymphoma) may be infused 14-60 days after the date of transplant.
T cell dosing is as follows:
Group 1: 2x10^7 cells/m^2 CAR-Kappa
Group 2: 1x10^8 cells/m^2 CAR-Kappa
