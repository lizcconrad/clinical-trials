  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients undergoing cardiac surgery develop excessive postoperative bleeding.
      Cardiopulmonary bypass causes platelet dysfunction. Several studies have documented the
      ability of desmopressin to reduce hemorrhage in a variety of congenital and acquired platelet
      disorders. In this study the investigators will investigate wether desmopressin reduces
      postoperative microvascular bleeding. The investigators will investigate wether desmopressin
      reduces platelet activation as measured by plasma concentration of neutrophil activating
      peptid 2 and by flow cytometry. The primary endpoint of the study will, however, be total
      postoperative bleeding and need for transfusions of blood components after surgery. The need
      for transfusions will be registered during the whole hospital stay. Patient with excessive
      postoperative bleeding (more than 250 ml for one hour, or more than 150ml for two hours
      during the first four hours) will be randomized into two groups and given either desmopressin
      or placebo (0,9% sodium chloride) as an intravenous infusion. Blood samples for plasma
      concentration measurements will be drawn before infusion of desmopressin/placebo, immediately
      after the infusion and 20 hours postoperatively. Postoperative bleeding will be registered
      for 16 hours. The need for any transfusions of blood products will be registered for the
      whole hospital stay.
