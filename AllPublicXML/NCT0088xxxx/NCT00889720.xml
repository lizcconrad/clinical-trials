  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is possible to offer smoking cessation treatment including varenicline to patients
      scheduled for elective surgery. This study will evaluate whether or not this will enable some
      patients to quit smoking for up to 4 weeks prior to surgery and in turn, whether this may
      lead to reductions in post-operative complication such as wound infections.

      Recruitment to this study was terminated (on February 23, 2010) earlier than originally
      planned because recruitment was much slower than expected and therefore the study has already
      achieved its main objective of assessing the feasibility of conducting a larger study of
      similar design to investigate the efficacy of smoking cessation therapy in a pre-surgical
      setting. The decision to end recruitment to the trial was not based on any safety concerns.
