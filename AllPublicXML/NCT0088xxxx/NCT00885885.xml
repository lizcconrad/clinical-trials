    <description>Panitumumab will be administered as a 60-minute ± 15 minutes IV infusion, just prior to administration of chemotherapy at a dose of 6 mg/kg on day 1 of each cycle. If the first infusion of panitumumab is well tolerated (without any serious infusion related reactions) all subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 minutes ± 10 minutes.
A cycle of panitumumab is defined as 14 days.
FOLFOX 4 chemotherapy will be administered on day 1 of each 14-day treatment cycle:
Oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 as a 120 minute infusion on day 1 of each cycle
Folinic acid 200mg/m2 as a 120 minute infusion on days 1 and 2
