  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a leading cause of death in the Western World with medical costs increasing
      annually. There is no cure for diabetes, and blood glucose monitoring is a key component in
      diabetes treatment and management. Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to
      the self-management of diabetes and has become widespread over the past decade. Blood glucose
      determinations are currently done by invasive methods (finger tip pricking), followed by
      measuring the blood drop characteristics.

      The purpose of this trail is to demonstrate the performance and use of GlucoTrack device in
      measuring blood glucose levels.

      The rationale for development of the device is to improve the patient's quality of life by
      providing a device that is easily used and provides a painless measurement method, thereby
      leading to higher compliance, and to better managed diabetes
