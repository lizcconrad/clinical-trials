  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is much evidence that localized low grade inflammatory processes may contribute to the
      microvascular complications of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus including
      sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy. Some biomarkers for inflammation have been found to
      be elevated in diabetes patients and correlations between those biomarkers and the severity
      of diabetic complications have been found in the last years. The relation between this low
      grade inflammation and the microvascular changes observed in diabetic retinopathy is,
      however, not well characterized.

      In the present study patients with different stages of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy
      will be included. Several markers of inflammation will be measured from blood samples. These
      markers will be related to vascular factors including flicker-induced vasodilatation as a
      marker of endothelial dysfunction and perifoveal leukocyte velocity and density as measured
      with the blue field entoptic phenomenon. In addition, the ophthalmologic status of the
      patients will be assessed according to the Modified Airlie House classification.

      A multiple regression model will be employed to study the association between the different
      methods.
