  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a coordinated regional approach to healthy
      skin programs in six remote Aboriginal communities can demonstrate, not only a reduction in
      the burden of scabies and streptococcal skin sores, but also broad health benefits, including
      primary prevention of some chronic diseases that occur at particularly high rates in
      Australian Aboriginal communities.

      The primary objectives of the Program are:

        -  Demonstrate a reduction in scabies and skin sores on a regional basis

        -  Demonstrate the broader public health effects of Healthy Skin Programs, particularly
           those relating to chronic diseases such as rheumatic fever and renal diseases

        -  Build on the existing Indigenous capacity by assisting in the development of new
           knowledge and skills to improve the health and well being of Indigenous communities

        -  Establish the feasibility of incorporating Healthy Skin Programs into existing health
           service delivery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are standard government recommendations for the conduct of healthy skin programs within
      the Northern Territory (NT), where the key component involves a single mass treatment for
      scabies of all residents in the region followed by regular monitoring of skin infections with
      treatment of individuals as new cases arise. The key features of the guidelines include:

        -  Community planning and collaborative effort;

        -  Development of local educational resources;

        -  Single whole community treatment day for scabies with permethrin (5%);

        -  Community &quot;clean up&quot; involving house cleaning, linen and rubbish collection;

        -  Emphasis on housing functionality and &quot;washing kids&quot; to maintain low rates of skin
           sores; and

        -  Regular monitoring of scabies and skin sores, usually in a target group such as children

      Previous programs have been successful in controlling scabies and related skin infections in
      the NT but have been limited to single communities with varying levels of success. In
      collaboration with communities in the East Arnhem Region, we propose to conduct a coordinated
      Healthy Skin Program. By concentrating on one region, the project has an increased likelihood
      of success because reinfection due to mobility between communities will be minimised, and
      because the project will be recognised as a collaboration between multiple communities.

      The program is structured into three distinct components:

        -  Implementation of the program within the participating communities;

        -  Evaluation of the program against specific outcomes; and

        -  Integration of the program into routine service delivery.
