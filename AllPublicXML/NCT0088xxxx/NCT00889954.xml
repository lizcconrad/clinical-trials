  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have advanced stage cancer. This study is a gene transfer research study using
      special immune cells.

      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer:
      antibodies and T cells. Investigators hope that both will work better together. Antibodies
      are proteins that protect the body from diseases caused from infectious diseases and possibly
      cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that
      can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected with germs. Both
      antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers: they both have shown
      promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.

      T lymphocytes can kill tumor cells but there are normally not enough of them or they are not
      able to kill all the tumor cells. We have done research in which we have grown &quot;extra&quot; T
      lymphocytes. We have added genes to those T lymphocytes to help them to recognize tumor
      cells. Although the results have been promising, we are still doing more research in this
      area.

      Antibodies usually circulate in blood and are secreted by other cells of the immune system in
      response to the presence of germs or abnormal cells in the body. The antibody used in this
      study is called anti-HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2). This antibody sticks to
      HER2-positive cancer cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called HER2.

      The patient will give blood to grow T cells on either one to two separate occasions. Then,
      the EBV-specific T cells will be made. These cells will be grown and frozen. To get the HER2
      antibody (and the CD28) and the DNR to attach to the surface of the EBV-T cells, the antibody
      gene and the DNR gene will be inserted into the EBV-T cell. This is done with two viruses
      called retroviruses that have been made for this study. One will carry the antibody gene into
      the T cell and the other the DNR gene.

      When the patient is enrolled on the study, they will be assigned to a dose of HER2-DNR EBV-T
      cells. The subject will be given one dose of cells into the vein through an IV line. The
      injection will take between 1 and 10 minutes. The patient will be followed in the clinic
      after the injection for 1 to 4 hours. The treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and
      Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital.

             disease. If Stage IIIb is not part of the staging system for the individual tumor,
             Stage IV will be used.

             For WHO grade III and IV brain tumors):patients will be eligible, who have recurrent
             or progressive disease after front line therapy.

          2. Karnofsky/Lansky score of 50 or more
