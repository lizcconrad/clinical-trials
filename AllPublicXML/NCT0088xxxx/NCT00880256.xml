  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common, chronic disorder that significantly affects
      quality of life, and results in enormous expenditures each year in the United States. Therapy
      for IBS is generally unsatisfactory, and takes an additive approach whereby medications are
      prescribed according to each type of symptom the patient experiences. Accumulating evidence
      indicates that persons with IBS have a heightened perception of stress, and chronic stress
      has been shown to have a significant impact on IBS symptomatology. Mindfulness involves the
      ability to bring attention to the present moment without judgment; this ability is correlated
      with measures of mental health and decreased stress perception. The clinical literature
      suggests that mindfulness-based interventions may lead to improvement in many disorders
      including chronic pain, stress, anxiety, eating disorders and depressive relapse. The purpose
      of this study is to collect survey pilot data to determine whether an 8-week program of
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) improves symptoms and quality of life for persons
      with IBS. Patients in the 8-week MBSR program are referred as part of their clinical care,
      and we seek approval only to collect survey data before and after the MBSR course. This study
      will evaluate whether there is sufficient evidence of efficacy to warrant a full clinical
      trial of MBSR.

      Aim 1: Apply measures of IBS symptom severity, depression and quality of life before and
      after the MBSR course, to assess whether there is evidence of benefit, and allow calculation
      of standardized effect sizes. Aim 2: Apply a validated measure of mindfulness before and
      after treatment. Aim 3: Explore the relationship between IBS symptoms, mindfulness score, and
      frequency of mindfulness practice.

    <description>The Irritable Bowel Severity Scoring System (IBSSS) provides a measure of the severity of IBS. The measure consists of five questions, which assess severity of abdominal pain, number of days with abdominal pain in past 10 days, severity of abdominal distension, satisfaction with bowel habits, and impact of IBS on life in general. The score on each of the 5 questions ranges from 0 to 100, and the scores are summed with a range of total possible scores from 0 to 500. Higher scores reflect more severe IBS. Total score was used in the analyses.</description>

IBS-QOL has been shown have a high level of content validity and to be responsive to change, and has been used in several outcome studies and clinical drug trials throughout the world.
