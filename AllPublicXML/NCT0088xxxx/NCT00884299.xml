  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by increased oxidative stress
      which aggravates airway and systemic inflammation. Previous studies suggested that dietary
      factors such as ample consumption of antioxidants might have beneficial effects in lung
      function in COPD patients.

      The investigators' primary aim is therefore to investigate prospectively whether a
      nutritional intervention consisted of diet rich in antioxidants such as fresh fruits and
      vegetables, would significantly affect lung function decline in COPD patients compared to a
      free diet.

      Methods: This is a 3-year prospective study, incorporating a run-in period of six months and
      outpatient clinic visits, scheduled every 6 months. Consecutive sampling was used to recruit
      120 patients with COPD. At baseline and at each visit all patients were evaluated for
      respiratory symptoms, dietary habits, medication used and pulmonary function. Patients will
      be randomized either to a diet based on increased consumption of foods containing
      antioxidants (fresh fruits and vegetables), intervention group (IG) or, to a free diet,
      control group (CG).

      The investigators hypothesize that the results from the study will suggest that a diet rich
      in antioxidants may be associated with improvement in lung function in COPD patients. In this
      respect dietary interventions should be considered in the management of COPD.

    <description>Diet with increased consumption of foods containing antioxidants such as fresh fruits, fruit juices and vegetables. Patients in this arm will be seen regularly in the outpatient clinic where there will be informed for the potential beneficial effects of fruits and vegetables in health status by two members of the study team (attending physician and specialist nurse). At baseline and at each visit it is clearly explained to them that the dietary goal is to increase fresh fruit /fruit juices/vegetable consumption of at least one portion per day compared to baseline and to maintain this regime throughout the 3-year study period.</description>
