    <textblock>
      To enhance our capacity to correctly choose the appropriate medication for ADHD patients on
      the first try based on the presence of a particular variant of a gene that could be
      identified on a laboratory test. It is hypothesized that patients with Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) who have failed to respond to methylphenidate medication, but
      do respond to amphetamines, have a higher than expected incidence the allelic variants of the
      SNAP 25 gene associated with ADHD, and mutations of the dopamine system genes DRD1, 2, 4, 5
      and dopamine transporter and COMTand MAOA.

      Previous research has demonstrated that while 75% of patients respond to any stimulant, of
      those who do not 33% will respond to a stimulant of the other class. Based on previous
      research correlating increased mutations in the dopamine system genes DRD1, 2, 4, 5, dopamine
      transporter, COMT, and MAOA with ADHD, we will also be investigating the relationship between
      mutations in these genes and patient response to MPH and amphetamines. This study is a pilot,
      but it was an obvious next step in the studies that are being done on the genetics of ADHD.
      The outcome of this research, whether an association is or is not found, will be of
      considerable interest to researchers internationally, and will demonstrate the value of HELP
      funding in promoting research that can alleviate mental illness in children The study will
      make a significant contribution to appropriate intervention for these children, and promote
      greater awareness that the deficits suffered by children with attention problems is neither
      willful nor a matter of intelligence, but rather a syndrome that can be explained and can be
      modified with appropriate medical care.

      A chi-square test will be conducted to determine whether there is differential representation
      of SNAP 25 among therapeutic methylphenidate responders versus non-responders. Statistical
      comparison will be performed using a two-tailed test at the .05 level of significance.

             able to communicate suitably with the investigator and study coordinator

          4. Patients must have tolerated the drug at therapeutic doses, but have shown a true lack
             of improvement in symptoms

          5. Must have shown clinically significant superiority in improvement in ADHD symptoms on
             amphetamine relative to MPH.
