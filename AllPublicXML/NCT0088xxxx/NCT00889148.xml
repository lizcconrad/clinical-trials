  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty is amongst the most painful procedures postoperatively, and pain
      management can be a challenge. Different measures have been introduced to manage severe
      postoperative pain in these patients. Previous studies have investigated gabapentin in acute
      postoperative pain and demonstrated reduced postoperative pain, postoperative morphine
      consumption, morphine related side effects, and postoperative pain scores. To date, this
      analgesia adjunct has yet to be investigated for total joint arthroplasty patients.

      The study was submitted to Health Canada and has received the letter of no objection. A
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will be conducted. The randomization
      scheme will be prepared and done by the pharmacy department at McMaster University. Ninety
      patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty will be recruited from the preoperative clinic.
      Forty-five patients in each population will be allocated to a gabapentin group and the other
      forty-five patients will be allocated to a placebo group.
