      The purpose of this study is to determine whether starting anastrozole prior to radiotherapy,
      so that it is taken during radiotherapy, decreases local recurrence of breast cancer in
      post-menopausal women in comparison to waiting until after radiotherapy to commence
      anastrozole.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant radiotherapy is well established as the primary modality to enhance local control in
      breast cancer. The use of adjuvant hormone therapy such as tamoxifen has shown to improve
      local control to a relatively minor amount on its own and does enhance local control of
      adjuvant radiotherapy. There is, however, conflicting invitro and clinical data regarding the
      effects or different sequences on tamoxifen and radiotherapy in terms of both local control
      and enhancement of radiotherapy toxicities.

      Aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole are establishing themselves as a class of drug
      superior to tamoxifen for the control of estrogen dependent breast cancers and overall are
      better tolerated with the exception of greater bone loss.

      As the key question is whether the sequencing of the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole alters
      local control by acting as an enhancer of the radiation breast cancer cell kill, it is
      therefore the aim of this study to compare 3 months of anastrozole prior to radiotherapy
      versus 3 months of anastrozole after radiotherapy with a specific objective of reducing the
      baseline ratio of in-field radiotherapy failure from 6% to 3%.

Commencing within 1 week of randomisation, to be administered from a min of 1 week before and a max of 4 weeks before commencement of radiotherapy and continued throughout radiotherapy. After 12 weeks administration of anastrozole according to trial regimen, anastrozole can be continued at the treating clinician's discretion and in accordance with the preference selected at the time of randomisation and stratification. The alternative options to long-term anastrozole are tamoxifen or cessation of anti-oestrogen therapy.</description>
