  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may experience abdominal pain as a result of
      pain signals in the bowel and how these signals are processed in the brain. Studies using
      brain imaging (pictures) have shown that IBS patients with more pain diagnoses (i.e.
      fibromyalgia, migraines, etc.) have greater activity in the regions of the brain responsible
      for the emotional and thought processing of pain signals. This could possibly make bowel
      sensations and bowel difficulties feel abnormal or more noticeable, in turn causing more
      severe IBS symptoms. The purpose of this protocol is to explore the role of pain diagnoses
      and their affect on brain activity in IBS patients. The investigators will also examine the
      use of a medication, desipramine, which is known to affect these brain regions, in IBS
      patients.

    <description>Desipramine 25 mg/day administered in the evening. Dosing may be increased dependent upon side-effects and clinical response to a maximum of 100 mg/day. Absent significant side-effects, all patients are increased at the one week visit to 50 mg/day at bedtime if they have not achieved a report of &quot;Adequate relief&quot;. Thereafter, up to week 4, the daily desipramine dose may be increased weekly by 25 mg up to the 100 mg/d maximum.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  IBS subjects with- and without comorbid somatization features will be recruited from
             the sources highlighted above.

          -  To be eligible, subjects will have to be between 18 and 90 years of age (inclusive)
             and qualify for a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome according to the criteria set
             forth in the Rome III criteria for the Diagnosis of Functional GI Disorders.

          -  IBS patients will then be assessed in terms of comorbid somatization as determined
             using the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15).

          -  For this particular study, only subjects with high somatization (PHQ ≥ 10 or low
             somatization (PHQ ≤5) will be considered for enrollment.

          -  Verification of somatization status will be performed using a formal structured
             interview process (Diagnostic Interview Schedule, DIS).

          -  Persons are eligible to participate without regard to race or ethnicity.

          -  Given sex differences in cerebral responses to noxious stimuli and the greater
             prevalence of IBS in women, only female participants will be sought in this study.

          -  Also, in view brain hemispheric differences between left- and right-hand dominant
             individuals and the greater prevalence of right-handedness, all participants must be
             right-handed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons are excluded from participation for having various psychiatric, medical, and
             other characteristics.

          -  Psychiatric/cognitive exclusions include any of the following: active suicidal or
             homicidal ideation or a history of attempted suicide, current excessive alcohol use or
             other substance abuse disorders, active major depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar
             depression or any psychotic disorder, unwillingness to be randomized or provide
             informed consent, inability to communicate with staff or significant cognitive
             impairment.

          -  Medical and other exclusions include any of the following: renal or hepatic disease or
             impairment, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cardiac arrythmia, cerebrovascular
             disease, or breastfeeding, pregnant, or imminent intention of pregnancy, history of
             seizures or primary neurological disorder, head trauma, brain damage, hyper- or
             hypothyroidism, history or abdominal surgery (other than
             cholecystectomy/appendectomy), or known structural GI disorder (Crohn's disease,
             etc.), contraindication to MRI (metallic implant, pacemaker), or rectal balloon
             distention (e.g., proctitis/colitis).

          -  Exclusions related to medications:

               1. Analgesics (narcotics, NSAIDs; acetaminophen OK)

               2. Muscle relaxants

               3. Psychoactive agents (antidepressants, antipsychotics)

               4. Other medications (phenytoin; amphetamines, prescription weight-loss drugs, or
                  benzodiazepines)

               5. Thyroid medication

               6. Anticholinergic medications or other IBS medications (hyoscyamine, dicyclomine)

               7. Cytochrome p450 substrates

               8. Participation in any clinical trial using any other drug.
