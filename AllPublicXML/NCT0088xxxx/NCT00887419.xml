      This study is for patients who have been approved by their doctors and insurance companies to
      receive spinal cord stimulator implants.

      The goal of this study is to investigate if pain and disability is improved in patients with
      an implant in combination with coping skills training. These patients are compared with those
      with an implant that receive chronic education information and those with an implant that are
      in the control group and receive no additional training or information.

      This study tests the hypotheses that a pain coping skills program in combination with an SCS
      implant can improve short- and long-term outcomes in self-efficacy for coping with chronic
      pain, physical disability, psychological distress, and pain intensity.

      Participants are patients who have been approved by their doctors and insurance companies to
      receive the spinal cord stimulator trial. After patients have been approved, they can be
      enrolled in this study. After completing a baseline evaluation, patients are randomized into
      (1)six individual pain coping skills training sessions(relaxations techniques, communication
      skills, goal setting), (2) six individual chronic pain education sessions (discussion
      approach to etiology and treatment of chronic pain and information on spinal cord stimulator
      implants, or (3) treatment as usual (no study intervention).

      Participants are evaluated prior to or shortly after their surgery, at post treatment, at 6
      month follow-up and at 12 month follow-up. All participants continue their routine medical
      care throughout the study.
