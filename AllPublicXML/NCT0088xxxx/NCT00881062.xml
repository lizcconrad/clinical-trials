      This study was to determine the ADME and metabolites of Proellex following a single oral dose
      of 25 mg.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the absorption, metabolism, and excretion kinetics
      of Proellex and to determine and characterize metabolites present in plasma and urine
      following a single oral dose of 25 mg. The 25 mg dose selected for this study has been
      included in all previous clinical trials. This dose was well tolerated and demonstrated
      efficacy against uterine fibroids and endometriosis.

             psychiatric disorder

          -  History of stomach or intestinal surgery or resection that would potentially alter
             absorption and/or excretion of orally administered drugs

          -  Participation in more than 1 other radiolabeled investigational study drug trial
             within 12 months prior to check-in
