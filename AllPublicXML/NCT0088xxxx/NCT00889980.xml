  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a significant need to develop new and more effective ways to treat melanoma that
      will decrease patient morbidity and mortality. This protocol intends to collect and process a
      portion (&lt; 20% of any node) of lymph nodes from melanoma patients undergoing routine surgical
      SLN resection: the SLN(s) and 1 adjacent non-SLN(s) are planned for study. In addition, blood
      will be drawn at the pre study visit (serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and
      appropriate lineage control tissue will be collected. Material only from already-indicated
      and planned procedures as part of standard medical care will be used. The main goal of this
      study will be to properly collect and process material to be analyzed and explore the
      molecular features melanoma biological samples.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary melanoma with the following Breslow thickness and stage

               -  ≥ 2 mm with ulceration, T3b

               -  ≥ 4 mm without (T4a) or with (T4b) ulceration

               -  Patients with a biopsied tumor that has not been widely resected will also be
                  eligible for study according to the above-specified criteria for tumor thickness
                  and stage.

          -  Age 12 years or older.

          -  Patients must have documented hemoglobin level of 10g/dL or higher. This can be drawn
             on the day of consent, or be documented from a previous visit within the past 30 days

          -  Subjects must have provided written, informed consent prior to any study procedures:
             collection of blood and LN tissue specimens for this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious illnesses that may be considered a contraindication to surgery as determined
             by the physician investigator. If a subject is cleared for surgery as clinically
             indicated (wide excision of the primary melanoma and sentinel lymph node biopsy),
             subject would be eligible.

          -  Any significant psychiatric disease, medical intervention, or other condition, which
             in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or Co-Investigators, could prevent
             adequate informed consent or compromise participation in the clinical trial.

          -  Active infection or antibiotics within one-week prior to study

          -  Systemic steroid or other immunosuppressive therapy administered for more than 10 days
             within 4 weeks of enrollment.
