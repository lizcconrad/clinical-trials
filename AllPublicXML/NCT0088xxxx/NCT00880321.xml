  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BRF112680 is a first-time-in-human study to establish the recommended dose and schedule of
      the orally administered GSK2118436. The recommended dose and regimen will be selected based
      on the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles observed after the treatment of
      subjects with solid tumors. This is a two-part study. Part 1 will identify the recommended
      Part 2 dose using a dose-escalation procedure. Escalation may proceed until either a maximum
      tolerated dose is established, or the toxicokinetic safety limit is reached. The recommended
      Part 2 dose will be expanded to up to 12 patients. Part 2 will explore further the safety,
      tolerability, and clinical activity of GSK2118436 in subjects with BRAF mutation-positive
      tumors. In addition, the effect of GSK2118436 on midazolam will be assessed in a subset of
      patients in Part 2. Biologically active doses will be identified by measurement of
      pharmacodynamic markers in tumor tissue and blood across a range of doses and these doses may
      be explored in Part 2.
