      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. To evaluate the latest effects of TW for IgA nephropathy (IgAN) with asymptomatic
           abnormal urinalysis.

        2. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TW.

      Patients who fit the inclusion criteria will be randomly divided into three groups: TW group
      (TW at dosage of 90 mg/d), ARB group (the control group, valsartan at dosage of 160 mg/d) and
      combined treatment group (TW at dosage of 60 mg/d and valsartan at dosage of 80 mg/d).
