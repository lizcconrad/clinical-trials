  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Sorafenib in combination
      with Temodar and radiation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed high grade glioma
      (glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma and anaplastic oligodendroglioma or
      oligoastrocytoma). The mechanism of action of sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, makes
      it an interesting drug to investigate in the treatment of patients with high grade glioma as
      this agent has anti-angiogenic activity and inhibits other pathways such as Ras,
      Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 (Flt-3), which
      are potential targets against gliomas.

      Up to 18 patients will be included in this phase I study. The primary goal of this study will
      be to establish the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib when used in combination with
      temozolomide and radiation therapy. Secondary goals of this study include: response rate,
      time to treatment failure, 6 month progression-free survival, event free survival and overall
      survival. A correlative study will investigate the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib used in
      combination with radiation therapy and temozolomide.
