  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open label forced dose titration study designed to determine the
      tolerability of curcumin in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This
      study will provide initial tolerability and safety data in pediatric patients with IBD.
      Twenty patients with IBD in remission or with mild disease (score &lt;34 on PUCAI or score &lt;30
      on the PCDAI) on sulfasalazine or mesalamine aged 8 to 18 years will be enrolled into this
      study. Each patient will participate in the study for nine weeks. From this study an
      appropriate dosage will be determined to proceed with a double blinded placebo controlled
      study.

    <description>Initial dosage of 500mg twice a day for 3 weeks. Using the forced dose titration design, dose will be titrated up to 1g twice a day at Week 3 for a total of three weeks and then titrated again to 2g twice a day at Week 6 for three weeks.</description>
