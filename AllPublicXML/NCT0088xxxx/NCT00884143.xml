    <textblock>
      There are different types of hormonal therapy medicines for the treatment of
      hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      evolution of two types of hormonal treatment (the drug called &quot;tamoxifen&quot; and a group of
      medicines called &quot;aromatase inhibitors&quot;) during two time periods of 12 months each, in years
      2006 and 2008, in the northeast Italian regions. The study will include post-menopausal women
      who have initiated hormonal therapy medicines in 2006. The study will also verify the rate of
      implementation of the updated national and international recommendations for the use of
      adjuvant hormonal therapy in the hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer.
