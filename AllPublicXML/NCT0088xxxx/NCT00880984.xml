      Purpose:

      Evaluation of the CAR™ 27 for the creation of compression anastomoses.

      Indication:

      Compression Anastomosis Ring (CAR™ 27) device for creation of circular anastomoses during
      colonic or colorectal resection.

      Study Design:

      Prospective, open labeled study.

      Patient Population:

      Male or female subjects 18 years of age or older who are scheduled for non emergency
      laparoscopic or open colonic or colorectal resections. A temporary loop ileostomy/colostomy
      can be preformed up to the discretion of the surgeon.

      No. of Subjects:

      15 patients estimated up to three months to enroll.

      Duration of Treatment:

      During the operation - creation of the anastomosis.

      Duration of Follow-up:

      Follow-up evaluation will be performed daily while hospitalized, during a post-op clinic
      visit at approximately 1 month (30 days ± 5 days) including a proctoscopic exam and by phone
      after 3 months.

      Endpoints:

      To evaluate the creation of a safe and functioning anastomosis and the occurrence of adverse
      events related to the use of the CAR™ 27 device.
