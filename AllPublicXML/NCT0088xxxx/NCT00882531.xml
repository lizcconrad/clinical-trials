  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A national, multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blind, phase III study in 2 parallel
      groups of isotretinoin versus placebo in patients presenting papular-pustular rosacea
      resistant to standard therapy. A non-balanced group (2 isotretinoin /1 placebo) design was
      selected since, given the nature of the study disease, fewer patients will receive the
      placebo than active isotretinoin.

      Treatment duration for each patient : 4 months, with monthly evaluation Follow-up at 2 months
      and 4 months for patients responsive after 4 months of treatment.
