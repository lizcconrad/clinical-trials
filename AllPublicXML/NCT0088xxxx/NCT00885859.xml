  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a frequently applied therapy in
           chronic pain. Although evidence regarding the effectiveness of TENS in chronic pain is
           inconclusive many patients continue using TENS on long term in daily practice. An
           important question is therefore why some patients respond well and others don't at all.
           In chronic pain evidence for abnormal pain processing (sensitization) has been found in
           several patients groups. The process of sensitization might influence effectiveness of
           TENS as the theoretical working mechanism of TENS is based on the modulation of the
           transmission of nociceptive impulses form peripheral receptors throughout spinal nerve
           system into the brain. In this study we want to study the effect of TENS on pain
           transmission, as measured by contact heat evoked potentials (CHEPS), between
           'responders' and non-responders' after a two weeks TENS treatment. 'Responders' will be
           defined as patients with a pain reduction of ≥ 30% on a VAS after a two week treatment
           period with TENS. Non-responders are patients with a pain reduction &lt; 15%.

        -  Objective: a) Is pain reducing effect TENS in responders based on modulation of pain
           transmission and perception, as measured by CHEPS? b) Is the ability of TENS to modulate
           pain transmission and perception influenced by abnormal pain processing?

        -  Prospective cohort study

        -  Patients with chronic non specific pain (duration &gt; 6 months), above 18 year, will be
           included. Patients are referred from the Pain Clinic of the University Hospital
           Maastricht (MUMC). Exclusion criteria are: a) pain due to cancer, b) the use of a
           cardiac pacemaker, c) pregnancy, d) neurological sensory deficits, e) language and/or
           cognitive inability to complete the health assessment questionnaires f) previous TENS
           for pain relief.

        -  Patients receive a two week treatment period with TENS-treatment, as regular, at home
           after instruction. The frequency is set at 100 Hz and pulse duration at 250 μ sec.
           Patients have to use the TENS daily (minimal 4 times a day for 30 minutes).

      Main study parameters/endpoints are decrease in amplitude of CHEPS in responders versus
      non-responders.

    <description>Patients are instructed how to use the TENS device during the two weeks at home.Self-adhesive reusable electrodes are used to deliver the electrical stimulation. The frequency is 100 Hz, pulse duration 250 μ sec. Stimulus intensity is strong but not unpleasant. The TENS electrodes are attached proximally and distally around the maximum pain point/area. Patients use TENS 4 times daily (30 minutes each time).</description>
