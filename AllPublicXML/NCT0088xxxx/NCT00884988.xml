  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankle fractures are invariably complicated by severe soft-tissue swelling which can
      significantly prevent surgical repair (open reduction and internal fixation - ORIF) of the
      fractured bone for up to two weeks. The delay in surgical treatment can increase the risk for
      local skin and bone complications, as well as for deep venous thrombosis. Lymphomyosot® is a
      non-prescription, homeopathic complex drug which has been used for more than 70 years
      throughout Europe and the U.S., primarily for tissue edema and swelling.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind pilot study evaluating the
      effectiveness of homeopathic combination drug Lymphomyosot® compared to placebo treatment.
      The study will take place at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel. Adult
      patients (age 18 years and older) admitted to the orthopedic department with acute ankle
      fractures which require ORIF repair will be assessed for inclusion in this study.

      The primary outcome measure to be evaluated is the fracture-ORIF waiting period. Other
      measures to be evaluated are: peri-malleolar circumference; pain (as measured by NRS and
      analgesic use); duration of hospital stay; and complications such as poor wound healing,
      blisters, and the development of deep vein thrombosis.
