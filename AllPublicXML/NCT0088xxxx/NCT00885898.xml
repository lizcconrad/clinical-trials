    <textblock>
      In the past, patients suffering from acute respiratory failure had to be treated with Oxygen
      and specific medication, or - if this had not been sufficient - had to be anesthesized and
      had to undergo endotracheal intubation for invasive ventilation. Nowadays, since emergency
      ventilators are available that can be used for non-invasive ventilation, the purpose of this
      study is to investigate if non-invasive ventilation is safe, feasible and effective for the
      treatment of acute respiratory failure and if less patients will need to be intubated
      out-of-hospital as well as in the further course.

      Single center, prospective, randomized, intention-to-treat clinical trial. The study has been
      performed within a two tier EMS system of a major city. Prehospital emergency physicians are
      on scene in every patient enrolled to the study.

      Patients with acute respiratory failure (SaO2 &lt; 90%, respiratory rate &gt; 20/min) were enrolled
      to the study using envelopes for randomisation for either &quot;conventional&quot; (O2 + medication) or
      &quot;NIV.&quot; Vital signs have been documented as well as venous blood gases have been taken every
      10 minutes after treatment has been started.

      Primary endpoints are 28-day mortality, hospital-, ICU- and respirator-days, SAPS, SOFA II
      and complications. Secondary endpoints are out-of-hospital incidence of invasive ventilation,
      effect on SpO2, CO2, respiratory rate, heart rate and blood pressure.
