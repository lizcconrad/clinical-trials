  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to estimate the efficacy and safety of the daily
      administration for 6 months of 5 mg versus 10 mg. A 6 month follow-up of subjects is carried
      out to estimate how the effects of mifepristone are kept in time.

      The hypothesis of this study is that both mifepristone doses reduce the volume of the myoma
      up to 50% in six months treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women, in fertile age or premenopausal status, presenting symptomatic myomaswere randomly
      assigned to receive 5 or 10 mg of mifepristone for six months.

      The decreasing in the prevalence of symptoms attributable to myomas is an important goal to
      achieve under both treatments. Another goal is to maintain for more than 6 months the
      benefits of the treatment with mifepristone.
