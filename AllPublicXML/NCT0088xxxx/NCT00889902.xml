      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. make p16INK4A as a cervical cancer screening of tumor markers, cytology improve existing
           diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, repeatability and validity, so as to effectively
           prompted the early discovery and diagnosis of cervical cancer.

        2. reduce screening costs, screening and benefits into quantitative evaluation, for our
           country to develop cervical cancer prevention and control strategy to provide a reliable
           theoretical basis.

      1. To carry out large-scale prospective randomized controlled clinical study to evaluate
           the &quot;cytological molecular markers Detect + P16INK4A&quot; methods of screening accuracy and
           reliability, as well as the screening method of the biological effects.

        2. Markov set up mathematical model of screening tests to quantify the inputs and the
           evaluation proceeds. With a view to optimize and perfect a simple, convenient, practical
           and efficient program of cervical cancer screening.
