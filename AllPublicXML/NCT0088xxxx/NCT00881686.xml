  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenosine has been proved to be an important mediator of myocardial protection induced by
      ischemic preconditioning. The hypothesis of this study is that adenosine preconditioning can
      provide additional myocardial protection in the setting of pediatric open heart surgery with
      cardioplegia and cardiopulmonary bypass.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adenosine has been used for diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases for many
      years. New progresses in myocardial protection in the settings of acute myocardial infarction
      treatment put forward the its clinical use to a broader field. But the safety and
      effectiveness of its use in myocardial protection in the setting of open heart surgery has
      not been investigated intensively. Our primary results suggested that adenosine
      preconditioning could decrease the release of myocardial serum markers, such as cTnI. This
      study will focus on the safety and effectiveness of adenosine in the field of pediatric
      myocardial protection during surgery repair of congenital heart defects with CPB and
      cardioplegia.
