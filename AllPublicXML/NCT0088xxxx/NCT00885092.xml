    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to clinically evaluate an investigational multi-purpose
      disinfecting solution (MPDS) compared to a commercial MPDS with respect to wettability of
      silicone hydrogel contact lenses.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Ex-Vivo Wetting Angle</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7, Hour 14</time_frame>
    <description>Study lens was removed from the eye according to protocol-specified procedures. The OCA15 (Optical Contact Angle) Instrument was used to observe, record, and calculate contact angle measurements. The wetting angle measurement was recorded in degrees (0-180), and a lower wetting angle measurement indicates a more wettable lens.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Lens Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7, Hour 14</time_frame>
    <description>Lens comfort was assessed by the participant on a 5-point Likert scale prior to any examination. The participant was instructed to select a single response to the statement, &quot;My lenses feel comfortable right now,&quot; with 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = undecided, 4 = agree, and 5 = strongly agree.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Solution-Related Corneal Staining</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7, Hour 14</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal staining was assessed by the investigator using fluorescein dye, a yellow filter, and a slit lamp. Corneal staining was graded on a continuous scale of 0% (no staining in the region) to 100% (staining covers entire region) in 1% increments for 5 corneal regions (central, nasal, temporal, inferior, and superior). Solution-related corneal staining was defined as ≥20% corneal staining area in at least 3 corneal regions of both eyes and is reported as a percentage of total participants.</description>

          -  Must be successfully wearing assigned study lens brand (either ACUVUE® OASYS™ or
             PureVision® contact lenses) for at least 7-10 days, minimum 8 hours a day, prior to
             Visit 1 (screening).

          -  Vision correctable to 20/30 (Snellen) or better in each eye at distance with study
             lenses at Visit 1 (screening).

             of the investigator.

          -  Any corneal surgery, cataract surgery, intraocular lens implants or glaucoma filtering
             surgery within the last 12 months.

          -  Any slit-lamp finding score of 1 (or rated 3 or 4 for limbal and bulbar conjunctival
             injection) at screening or baseline visits.

          -  Corneal staining area assessment ≥ 20% in any corneal region in either eye at
             screening or baseline visit.

          -  Corneal staining graded as 2 (macropunctate) or greater in any corneal region in
             either eye at baseline visit.

          -  Participation in any investigational clinical study within 30 days of baseline visit.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Solution-Related Corneal Staining</title>
        <description>Corneal staining was assessed by the investigator using fluorescein dye, a yellow filter, and a slit lamp. Corneal staining was graded on a continuous scale of 0% (no staining in the region) to 100% (staining covers entire region) in 1% increments for 5 corneal regions (central, nasal, temporal, inferior, and superior). Solution-related corneal staining was defined as ≥20% corneal staining area in at least 3 corneal regions of both eyes and is reported as a percentage of total participants.</description>
