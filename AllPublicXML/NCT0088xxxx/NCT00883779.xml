  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm study will compare the efficacy and safety of sequential treatment with Tarceva or
      placebo, plus platinum-based therapy, as first line treatment in patients with advanced or
      recurrent non-small cell lung cancer. Patients will be randomized to receive gemcitabine
      (1250mg/m2 iv) on days 1 and 8, and cisplatin (75mg/m2) or carboplatin (5xAUC)on day 1,
      followed by Tarceva 150mg/day or placebo from day 15 to day 28 of each 4 week cycle for a
      total of 6 cycles,then followed by Tarceva or placebo monotherapy.The anticipated time on
      study treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size is 100-500
      individuals.

    <time_frame>Randomization until PD or death (assessed at baseline and every 8 weeks thereafter until PD, death or end of study [up to approximately 1.5 years])</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response was evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.0). PD was defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. PFS is the time (in months) between the date of randomization and the date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first. Participants who had neither progressed nor died at the time of data cut-off or who were lost to follow-up were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment where non-progression was documented or last date of follow up for progression of disease, whichever was last. Participants without post baseline tumor assessments who were known to be alive were censored at the time of randomization. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <title>Median Progression Free Survival (PFS) Time</title>
        <description>Tumor response was evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.0). PD was defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. PFS is the time (in months) between the date of randomization and the date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first. Participants who had neither progressed nor died at the time of data cut-off or who were lost to follow-up were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment where non-progression was documented or last date of follow up for progression of disease, whichever was last. Participants without post baseline tumor assessments who were known to be alive were censored at the time of randomization. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

          <description>Tumor response was evaluated according to RECIST (version 1.0). CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the screening sum LD. Responses were confirmed with repeated assessment 4 weeks after initial response was observed.</description>

          <description>Time to symptomatic progression was the time from randomization until the earlier of a clinically meaningful decline from baseline in LCS score, or death on study. LCS scores were obtained from a 7-item questionnaire from the FACT-L (version 4.0). Participants responded to questions such as shortness of breath, cough, tightness in chest, breathing difficulty, appetite loss, weight loss and unclear thinking; on a 5-point scale from 0-4, where 0 = &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 = &quot;very much.&quot; The participants' responses were summed to result in an overall score, scores range on a scale of 0 (most symptomatic) to 28 (asymptomatic); higher score indicates fewer symptoms. A clinically meaningful decline used to determine symptomatic progression in this study was at least a three point decline in LCS score from baseline. Participants without symptomatic progression at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the last FACT-L assessment. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <description>TOI was defined as the sum of the scores of the Physical Well-Being (PWB), Functional Well-Being (FWB), and LCS. PWB, FWB, and LCS scores were obtained from 7-item questionnaires from the FACT-L (Version 4.0). Participants responded to questions on a 5-point scale from 0-4, where 0 = &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 = &quot;very much.&quot; The participants' responses were summed to result in an overall score, scores range on a scale of 0 to 84; higher score indicates better physical aspects of quality of life (QoL). A clinically meaningful decline used to determine deterioration in TOI was greater than or equal to (≥) 6-point decline from baseline. Participants without deterioration in TOI at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the last FACT-L assessment.</description>

          <title>Time to Deterioration in QOL Using FACT-L Version 4.0</title>
          <description>Time to deterioration in QoL is defined as time from randomization until the earlier of a clinically meaningful decline from baseline in Total FACT-L or death on study. Total FACT-L score was defined as the sum of the TOI, SWB and EWB of the FACT-L questionnaires. TOI (PWB + FWB + LCS), SWB and EWB scores were obtained from 7-item (6-item in the case of EWB) questionnaires from the FACT-L (Version 4.0). Participants responded to questions on a 5-point scale from 0-4, where 0 = &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 = &quot;very much.&quot; The participants' responses were summed to result in an overall score, scores range on a scale of 0 to 136; higher score indicates better QoL. A clinically meaningful decline used to determine deterioration in QoL was ≥6-point decline from baseline. Participants without deterioration in QoL at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the last FACT-L assessment. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
