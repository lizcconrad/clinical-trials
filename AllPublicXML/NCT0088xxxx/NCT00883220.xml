  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Learning to self-manage urine flow may help people prevent or minimize persistent
      complications from long-term indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheters.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary catheter users commonly experience adverse health effects, such as urinary tract
      infection (UTI), blockage, dislodgement, and leakage, leading to poor quality of life
      indicators. Catheter-related problems often require health care utilization resulting in
      increased health care costs. Self-management of urine flow is an essential part of self-care
      for people with long-term urinary catheters and may lead to prevention or reduction of
      catheter-related problems and improved quality of life.This study tests the effectiveness of
      a urinary catheter self-management intervention in a randomized trial of 220 patients, with
      12 months of follow-up. The experimental intervention is designed to enhance self-management
      of urine flow in individuals with long-term urinary catheters, with the goal of decreasing
      catheter related complications and enhancing quality of life.
