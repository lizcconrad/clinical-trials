      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Zoledronic acid may stop the growth of tumor
      cells in bone. Giving bevacizumab together with cyclophosphamide and zoledronic acid may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of giving bevacizumab together with
      cyclophosphamide and zoledronic acid in treating patients with recurrent or refractory
      high-risk neuroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the toxicities and feasibility of bolus and metronomic cyclophosphamide
           when given in combination with zoledronic acid with and without bevacizumab in patients
           with recurrent or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

      Secondary

        -  To preliminarily evaluate the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients
           within the confines of a pilot study.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and zoledronic acid IV over 15 minutes on
      day 0 and oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-27 in course 1. In course 2 and all
      subsequent courses, patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 0 and 14,
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and zoledronic acid IV over 15 minutes on day 1, and oral
      cyclophosphamide once daily on days 0 and 2-27. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2
      years* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients may receive up to 13 doses of zoledronic acid.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

    <description>Bevacizumab: Every course will be 28 days. Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg/dose , will be administered intravenously every 14 days beginning on day 0 of the second course.
Cyclophosphamide will be administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus according to the protocol assigned dose level followed by daily oral dosing (25mg/m2/day) without interruption (unless toxicity supervenes).
Zoledronic acid will be administered on day 0 of course 1 and day 1 of course 2 and all subsequent courses in a dose of 4mg/m2 (max 4 mg per dose). On days when zoledronic acid (ZA) and cyclophosphamide (CTX) are given together, CTX should be given first.</description>
