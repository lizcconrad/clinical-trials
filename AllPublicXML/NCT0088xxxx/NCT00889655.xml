  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior to colonoscopies, the colon is cleansed using a laxative. Golytely is approved by the
      FDA for this purpose. Another laxative, called MiraLax, is approved by the FDA to relieve
      constipation, but it is not approved specifically for preparation for a colonoscopy.
      Nonetheless, it is commonly used in clinical practice for this purpose, just as is Golytely.
      The purpose of this study is to compare Golytely and MiraLax in two ways: to see whether one
      is better tolerated by patients than the other and to see whether one more effectively
      cleanses the bowel than the other. The investigators' hypothesis is that these 2 bowel
      preparation methods are equally effective in bowel cleansing, but that patients prefer
      Miralax to Golytely.
