      The purpose of this study is to determine whether women who are offered screening colonoscopy
      will be more likely to schedule and complete this procedure if they are given the option of a
      woman endoscopist.

      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in women. Although there
      are a variety of options for colon cancer screening, colonoscopy is thought to be the best
      modality for women. Despite recommendations by multiple societies, adherence to CRC screening
      among women is suboptimal. One possible barrier to adherence may be the gender of the
      endoscopist. Recent studies have shown that a large proportion of surveyed women would prefer
      a woman endoscopist. These studies suggest that having the option of a woman endoscopist
      would increase adherence to colonoscopy; however, there is no published literature that
      addresses this question.

      Hypothesis

      Women who are offered screening colonoscopy will be more likely to schedule and complete this
      procedure if they are given the option of a woman endoscopist.

      Specific Aims

      Primary

        -  Determine whether the option of a woman endoscopist is associated with increased woman
           patient adherence to screening colonoscopy.

        -  Assess the proportion of women who request a woman endoscopist when this option is made
           available to them.

      Secondary

      * Identify socio-demographic predictors of (a) completing a screening colonoscopy and (b)
      requesting a woman endoscopist (e.g. race/ethnicity, age, health insurance, marital status).
