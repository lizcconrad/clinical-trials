    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>WIQ Walking Distance Scores at Baseline and One Year are presented for subjects who have claudication. The Walking Improvement Questionnaire (WIQ) is a validated method to assess objective improvement in functional walking ability of subjects with intermittent claudication. Difficulty walking a distance was self-assessed at baseline by the patient (prior to treatment) and at the one year follow up visit. Scale ranges from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum), with larger numbers representing better outcomes. An increase in WIQ scores at 1 year represents an improvement over baseline.</description>

        <description>WIQ Walking Distance Scores at Baseline and One Year are presented for subjects who have claudication. The Walking Improvement Questionnaire (WIQ) is a validated method to assess objective improvement in functional walking ability of subjects with intermittent claudication. Difficulty walking a distance was self-assessed at baseline by the patient (prior to treatment) and at the one year follow up visit. Scale ranges from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum), with larger numbers representing better outcomes. An increase in WIQ scores at 1 year represents an improvement over baseline.</description>
