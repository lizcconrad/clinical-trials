      RATIONALE: Genistein may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving genistein before
      surgery may be an effective treatment for pancreatic cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying genistein to see how well it works in
      treating patients with pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine changes in microvessel density of the tumor specimen after 2 weeks of
           treatment with genistein in patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of genistein in these patients by looking at the
           impact of genistein on pancreatic cancer angiogenesis and on the angiogenic factors
           VEGF, CXCL1, CXCL5, and CXCL8.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive neoadjuvant oral genistein once daily for 2 weeks in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive no specific neoadjuvant therapy. In both arms, patients undergo
           surgical resection in week 3.

      Blood, urine, and tissue samples are collected at baseline and at the time of surgery for
      laboratory biomarker studies. Samples are analyzed for VEGF, CXCL1, CXCL5, and CXCL8 by ELISA
      and for genistein by mass spectrometry.

             receive or comply with the study protocol

          -  hypersensitivity to genistein or to any of the excipients of genistein
