    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of social skills training on adolescents
      physical activity levels. For one week at the beginning and end of the study teens will wear
      a BioTrainer to measure their activity levels and also wear a pager to communicate the types
      of activities they are doing throughout the day. For 8 weeks participants will be randomized
      into one of two groups, a social skills training group or a physical activity group.

      The investigators predict that both groups will experience an increase in physical activity
      and social involvement (decrease time spent alone).
