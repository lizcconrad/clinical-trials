  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was an extension to study MA21573 [NCT00750880], which was an open label single
      arm study to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of tocilizumab monotherapy, or
      combination therapy with non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS), in
      patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. Patients who completed the 24
      week core study, and had at least a moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)
      response, were eligible to enter this long-term extension study, and received tocilizumab 8
      mg/kg intravenous (iv) every 4 weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment was 1-2 years,
      and the target sample size was &gt; 500 individuals.

    <description>An AE was considered any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Preexisting conditions that worsened during the study and laboratory or clinical tests that resulted in a change in treatment or discontinuation from study drug were reported as adverse events. A SAE was any experience that: resulted in death, was life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect or was medically significant. The percentage of participants with AEs and SAEs that occurred in the Extension Study grouped according to the number of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) a participant was taking at Core Baseline is presented.</description>

    <time_frame>Core Baseline, Extension Weeks 12, 24, 36 ,48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Patients scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the patient's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the patient's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the patient's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the patient's health status. A positive change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Clinically Meaningful Improvement in Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS28)</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. Clinical meaningful improvement was defined as a ≥ 1.2 unit reduction in DAS28.</description>

The left-hand extreme of the line equals 0 mm, and is described as &quot;no disease activity&quot; (symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and the right-hand extreme equals 100 mm, as &quot;maximum disease activity&quot; (maximum arthritis disease activity).

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Response</title>
        <description>The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient completed questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis, consisting of 20 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities. There are 4 possible responses for each question: 0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty and 3=unable to do. The score for each of the domains is the highest (worst) score in each domain. A patient must have a domain score for at least 6 of 8 domains to calculate a valid HAQ-DI score which is the sum of domain scores, divided by the number of domains that have a score for a total possible score minimum/maximum 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Clinical Remission</title>
        <description>The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient completed questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis, consisting of 20 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities. There are 4 possible responses for each question: 0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty and 3=unable to do. The score for each of the domains is the highest (worst) score in each domain. A patient must have a domain score for at least 6 of 8 domains to calculate a valid HAQ-DI score which is the sum of domain scores, divided by the number of domains that have a score for a total possible score minimum/maximum 0 (best) to 3 (worst). Clinical Remission is defined as a HAQ-DI score &lt; 0.5.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in FACIT-Fatigue Score</title>
        <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Patients scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the patient's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the patient's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the patient's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the patient's health status. A positive change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>
