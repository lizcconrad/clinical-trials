      This is an epidemiological, multicenter, retrospective study to analyze the management of
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in usual clinical practice in Spain. Two groups of patients will be
      analyzed: individuals who have had RA for two years or less (the &quot;early RA&quot; group) and
      individuals who have had RA for more than 2 years and who currently meet the ACR criteria for
      RA (the &quot;established RA&quot; group).
