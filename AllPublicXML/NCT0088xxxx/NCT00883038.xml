    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of experimental (vegetarian) diet compared to
      conventional diet with similar caloric restriction on insulin resistance, body weight and
      body composition in type 2 diabetic patients after 3 month diet program and additional 3
      month diet program combined with intensive exercise.

      Hypothesis: Greater improvement in insulin resistance, greater weight loss without
      compromising the body composition (subjects will lose fat preferentially to lean body mass)
      and differences in the fatty tissue metabolism will be found in the experimental (vegetarian)
      group compared to the control (conventional diet) group despite the similar advise on caloric
      restriction in both diets. The differences between the two groups will increase after an
      intensive physical exercise program.

      Open randomized study. Individuals with type 2 diabetes (n=60) will be recruited through
      newspaper advertisements and through advertisements in the hospital. They will be randomly
      assigned to a low-fat vegetarian diet or a diet following the guidelines of the Study Group
      on Diabetes and Nutrition of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (DNSG) (21)
      with similar caloric restriction (-500 kcal/d). The participants will be followed for 12
      weeks and then for another 12 weeks with the addition of intensive physical exercise. All
      meals during the 6 months will be provided.

    <description>The low-fat vegetarian diet (~10% of energy from fat, 15% protein, and 75% carbohydrate, fiber content 40-50 g/day) consists of vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes and small amounts of nuts. Participants will be asked to avoid animal products and added fats and to favor low-glycemic index foods, such as beans and green vegetables.</description>
