      The objectives of the PROTECT study are:

        -  To assess the role of CT pulmonary angiography in the risk stratification of
           hemodynamically stable patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE).

        -  To assess the role of transthoracic echocardiography in the risk stratification of
           hemodynamically stable patients with acute symptomatic PE.

        -  To assess the role of 2 biomarkers (troponin and brain natriuretic peptide) in the risk
           stratification of hemodynamically stable patients with acute symptomatic PE.

        -  To assess the role of the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) in the risk
           stratification of hemodynamically stable patients with acute symptomatic PE.

        -  To assess the combined role of CT pulmonary angiography, transthoracic echocardiography,
           PESI, troponin I and brain natriuretic peptide in the risk stratification of
           hemodynamically stable patients with acute symptomatic PE.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute symptomatic Pulmonary Embolism (PE) confirmed by:

               -  CT pulmonary angiography positive for PE

               -  Ventilation/ perfusion lung scan with high likelihood of PE (according to PIOPED
                  criteria)

               -  V/Q ventilation/ perfusion lung scan inconclusive for PE or negative CT pulmonary
                  angiography in a patient with thoracic symptoms and a lower limb ultrasound
                  showing a positive diagnosis for deep vein thrombosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindication for CT pulmonary angiography (allergy to iodine contrasts or
             creatinin clearance &lt; 30 ml/min).

          -  Informed consent not obtained.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Life expectancy of less than 3 months.

          -  Hemodynamic unstability defined as SBP &lt; 90 mm Hg, need for cardiopulmonary
             reanimation, need for vasoactive drugs or orotracheal intubation.

          -  Thrombectomy, insertion of filter in the cava vein, or need for fibrinolytic treatment
             for PE episode.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial for treatment of PE.
