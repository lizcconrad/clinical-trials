      The main objectives of this proposal are as follows:

        -  To assess the dynamic uptake and washout of 123-I MNI-388 and MNI 390, a potential
           imaging biomarker for β-amyloid burden in brain, using single photon emission computed
           tomography (SPECT) in similarly aged Alzheimer's (AD) subjects and healthy controls

        -  To perform blood metabolite characterization of 123-I MNI-388 and MNI-390 in healthy and
           AD subjects to determine the metabolic fate and nature of metabolites in assessment of
           123-I MNI-388 and MNI 390 as a single photon computed tomography (SPECT) brain imaging
           agent

      The adaptation of imaging agents like 123-I MNI-388 and 123-I MNI-390 as biomarkers of
      β-amyloid deposition in AD patients for assessing disease requires human validation studies.
      The purpose of this study is to develop and characterize 123-I MNI-388 and 123-I MNI-390 as
      objective biomarkers in AD. The significance of this work lies in applying state-of-art
      quantitative neuroimaging tools to develop a relevant biomarker in living AD patients. In
      this context we propose to investigate the feasibility of applying this technique as an
      imaging biomarker of disease in AD patients.

      Informed consent will be obtained for all subjects. All subjects will undergo a screening
      evaluation including baseline clinical laboratory testing, a baseline physical and
      neurological evaluation and baseline cognitive evaluations. Subjects will be given a bolus
      injection of 123-I MNI-388 and MNI 390 in an antecubital vein. Subjects will undergo serial
      SPECT imaging scans and serial venous plasma sampling for measurement of 123-I MNI-388 and
      MNI 390 in plasma (both protein bound and free) over a period of up to 8 hours. The
      quantitative and visual imaging analyses will be performed by an image-processing specialist
      who will remain blinded to any clinical information.including diagnosis. The primary imaging
      outcome measure will be the brain regional distribution volumes expressed as a brain tissue
      to plasma ratio of the radioligand, 123-I MNI-388 and MNI-390. Time to the peak uptake and
      amplitude of the peak uptake will be evaluated for all brain regions and the results for the
      AD patients and controls will be compared.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Alzheimer's Subject Selection: subjects who have a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate
        Alzheimer's disease will be recruited for this study. The following criteria will be met
        for inclusion of AD subjects in this study:

          -  The participant is 50 years or older.

          -  Written informed consent is obtained.

          -  Participants have a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on National
             Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease
             and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria.

          -  CDR score ≥0.5 and &lt;2.

          -  Modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale score of ≤ 4.
