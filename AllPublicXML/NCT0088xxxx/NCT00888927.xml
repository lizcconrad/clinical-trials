      This study will determine the maximum dose of KW-0761 administered intravenously that can be
      given safely in subjects with previously treated peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) or
      cutaneous T-cell lymphoma(CTCL)and will see if it is effective in treating the disease.

      This Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation clinical study will enroll up to 47
      subjects with previously treated PTCL including CTCL. The study is comprised of a dose
      escalation phase (Phase 1) and a preliminary assessment of efficacy (Phase 2).

      In the dose escalation phase, the starting dose will be 0.1 mg/kg administered i.v. once
      every week for four weeks, followed by a 2-week observation period in the first treatment
      course. Succeeding dose levels will include 0.3 and 1 mg/kg. During the first course of
      treatment if assessments performed at day 29 (end of week 4) indicate that a subject has
      demonstrated an overall CR, the subject may continue on study for up to an additional four
      infusions beyond CR on an every other week infusion schedule. Treatment will then be
      discontinued in order to determine duration of response. If a subject experiences a PR or SD,
      the subject may continue therapy after consultation between the investigator and the medical
      monitor on an every other week infusion schedule until disease progression occurs or other
      withdrawal criteria are met.

          4. &gt;=18 years of age.

          5. completed any prior therapy at least four weeks prior to entry; however, patients with
             rapidly progressive malignant disease may be enrolled prior to this period after
             discussion with the medical monitor.

          6. resolution of all clinically significant toxic effects of prior cancer therapy to
             grade ≤1 by the NCI-CTCAE, v.3.0 excluding the specifications required in 7 and 8
             below.

          7. adequate hematological function: absolute neutrophil count&gt;=1,500 cells/uL and
             platelets &gt;=100,000 cells/uL except in patients with known bone marrow involvement
             where absolute neutrophil count must be &gt;=1,000 cells/uL and platelets &gt;=75,000
             cells/uL.

          8. adequate hepatic function: bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the specific institutional ULN;
             aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase each ≤ 2.5 x ULN or ≤ 5.0 x ULN in the
             presence of known hepatic malignancy.
