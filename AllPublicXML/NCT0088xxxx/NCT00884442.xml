      The present study will be performed to investigate and to compare the in-vivo performance of
      the two investigational products Gen-nifedipine extended release, (previously referred to as
      Gen-Nifedipine XL (Genpharm ULC, Canada)) and Nifedipine(Bayer Healthcare AG manufactured as
      Adalat® XL®, Adalat® LA, Adalat® Crono, Adalat® OROS) by comparing their pharmacokinetic
      parameters after oral single dose administrations in the fasted and fed state.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past, several attempts have been made to develop nifedipine formulations with
      pharmacokinetic characteristics similar to the unique characteristics of nifedipine GITS. A
      new extended release nifedipine tablet based on an osmotically active system for once a day
      administration has been registered under the trade name Gen-nifedipine extended release,
      (previously referred to as Gen-Nifedipine XL (Genpharm ULC, Canada)) in Canada.

      According to the product monograph of Gen-nifedipine extended release, (previously referred
      to as Gen-Nifedipine XL), this tablet consists of a semipermeable membrane surrounding an
      osmotically active drug core. After contact with water from the GI tract osmotic pressure in
      the core increases, releasing the active drug at a controlled rate through an orifice in the
      tablet membrane. The functional principle of this nifedipine tablet seems to be quite similar
      to the one of the GITS system.

      However, especially in case of modified release formulations, various factors can affect the
      absorption and the systemic availability of the drug. Two important factors are i) the drug
      release rate from the dosage form and ii) the gastrointestinal transit rate, which in turn
      has an influence on the site of absorption. Especially food intake and the caloric content of
      a meal can affect drug transit time, luminal dissolution and drug permeability. Thus, the
      prandial state may have a significant impact on the in vivo behaviour of such formulations as
      a whole and particularly on the drug bioavailability.

      For GITS formulations, such as Adalat® XL®, Adalat® LA, Adalat® Crono, Adalat® OROS, earlier
      studies have demonstrated that no significant influence of concomitant food-intake occurs.
