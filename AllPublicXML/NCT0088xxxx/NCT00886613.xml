  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study in two parts (Part A and Part B) to evaluate the responsiveness of various biomarkers
      of immunity to Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) following repeated immunizations with heat
      treated VZV vaccine V212 or with Zostavax™.

      The enrollment of participants into this study was conducted in 2 parts, Part A and Part B.
      The first 42 eligible participants were enrolled into Part A of the study. In Part A, the
      reaction of the VZV skin test at baseline was evaluated at both 48 and 72 hours post
      administration of the VZV skin test reagent and saline (in opposite arms), with 2 examiners
      performing the reading at each timepoint; all subsequent skin test readings in Part A were
      performed at 48 hours post administration. After all skin test reactions were obtained at
      baseline for the 42 subjects in Part A, an interim analysis was performed (1) to assess the
      frequency of baseline negative skin tests in order to confirm that the planned sample size
      (N=120) was adequate for an evaluation of the effect of vaccination on the VZV Skin Test, and
      (2) to assess the frequency of baseline positive skin tests at 72 hours relative to 48 hours
      (post administration) in order to determine the preferred time for evaluation of the skin
      test reaction.

      The interim analysis from Part A confirmed the study sample size, an additional 78 subjects
      were enrolled into Part B to achieve the planned sample size (N=120). The study procedures
      for Part B of the study were identical to those in Part A with the following exceptions: (1)
      baseline skin test readings were performed only once, at either 48 or 72 hours (post
      administration) to accommodate the scheduling of clinic visits, and (2) only one examiner was
      needed for the skin test reading at baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All eligible participants, regardless of treatment group, were administered three injections
      of the varicella antigen (VZV Skin Test reagent), once at baseline before the first
      vaccination, a second time before the second vaccination, and a third time approximately 14
      days after the second vaccination. Reactions to the skin test were assessed by the same
      examiner for each participant to the greatest extent possible.

    <description>Participants were given the VZV skin test prior to vaccination. For the baseline VZV skin test, they were administered VZV skin test reagent and saline in opposite arms, and assessed for a skin reaction around the injection site. The skin reaction assessed was erythema (redness of skin) and induration (palpable, raised, hardened area) around the injection site, which was marked with a ball point pen. The longest dimension to the closest 1 mm was measured. Participants with a reaction measure &lt; 5mm for saline and &lt; 5mm for the VZV antigen were considered to have a negative baseline skin test.</description>

    <time_frame>48-72 hours after administration of skin test at 14-17 days postdose 2</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with a positive VZV skin test after 2 vaccine doses was determined. Participants with a negative VZV skin test reaction at baseline were evaluated for VZV immunogenicity by a final VZV skin test administered 14 days after dose 2 of vaccination.
For the VZV skin test participants were injected intradermally with the VZV skin test reagent, and reaction to the skin test was assessed after 48-72 hrs. A skin reaction (erythema and induration) around the injection site measuring &gt;= 5mm for the VZV antigen was considered a positive skin test.</description>

    <time_frame>48 hours and 72 hours post administration of baseline skin test</time_frame>
    <description>Prior to vaccination, participants were administered a baseline VZV skin test for which the skin test reagent and saline were injected in opposite arms. The skin reaction (erythema and induration) around the injection site was assessed at 48 hours and at 72 hours. The reaction was marked with a ball point pen and the longest dimension closest to 1 mm was measured. Participants with a reaction measure &lt; 5mm for saline and &lt; 5mm for the VZV antigen were defined as having a negative baseline skin test; and a measure of &gt;= 5mm for the VZV antigen were defined as having a positive skin test.</description>

    <description>The number of participants with all serious and nonserious adverse events, and vaccine-related serious and nonserious adverse events, from 1-28 days post any vaccination dose was determined to assess safety. Non serious adverse events include injection-site adverse events as well as systemic adverse events post vaccination. Vaccine-related events include all events that were possibly, probably or definitely related to the vaccine according to the investigator. Participants with injection site adverse events due to administration of VZV skin tests are not included.</description>

    <description>Participants were given the VZV skin test prior to vaccination. For the baseline VZV skin test, they were administered VZV skin test reagent and saline in opposite arms. The skin reaction (erythema and induration) to saline was marked with a ball point pen. The longest dimension to the closest 1 mm was measured.

The skin reaction (erythema and induration) to saline was marked with a ball point pen. The longest dimension to the closest 1 mm was measured. Participants with a reaction measure &lt; 5mm for saline had a negative reaction for saline, and measure &gt;= 5mm for saline had a positive reaction for saline at baseline.</description>

        <description>Number of participants with a positive VZV skin test after 2 vaccine doses was determined. Participants with a negative VZV skin test reaction at baseline were evaluated for VZV immunogenicity by a final VZV skin test administered 14 days after dose 2 of vaccination.
For the VZV skin test participants were injected intradermally with the VZV skin test reagent, and reaction to the skin test was assessed after 48-72 hrs. A skin reaction (erythema and induration) around the injection site measuring &gt;= 5mm for the VZV antigen was considered a positive skin test.</description>
