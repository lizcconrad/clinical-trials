      The primary objective of this prospective study is to assess the burden of disease associated
      with RSV infection, as measured/determined by rates of outpatient medically attended LRI,
      emergency room visits and hospitalization among preterm infants (32-≤36 wGA) during RSV
      season, and its medical/health consequences, as measured by wheezing events, the infant's
      first RSV season, up to May 2009.
