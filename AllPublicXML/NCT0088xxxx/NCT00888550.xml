  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two standards of care exist with regards to posterior splinting post-operatively. The
      proponents of splinting feel the additional immobilization decreases the stress on the soft
      tissue, subsequently preventing or limiting pain while improving early range of motion (ROM).
      The opposing belief is that the splinting is without therapeutic benefit and that early
      mobilization is beneficial. With regards to both practices, the surgeon's practice is
      anecdotally based on past experience.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the results obtained with and without posterior
      splinting after intramedullary (IM) nailing for tibia fractures in order to provide evidence
      based reasoning to guide future practice.
