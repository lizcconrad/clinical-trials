      Background:

        -  An absence seizure is a type of seizure that usually begins in childhood and goes away
           by early adulthood. Scientists do not yet know where absence seizures begin in the
           brain. Some evidence suggests that these seizures begin in the thalamus, a structure
           deep in the brain, but other studies suggest that they begin in the frontal cortex, at
           the front part of the brain.

        -  Magnetoencephalography is a type of brain scanning procedure that is useful in
           determining information about what happens to the brain during epileptic seizures.
           Understanding where absence seizures come from may help doctors find new treatments for
           them.

      Objectives:

        -  To gain a better understanding of which parts of the brain are affected in absence
           seizures.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients 7 to 35 years of age who have been diagnosed with absence seizures.

      Design:

        -  Procedures are for research purposes only, not to diagnose or treat a particular medical
           condition.

        -  Two outpatient visits to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center: evaluation
           and scanning.

        -  Researchers will evaluate potential participants with a medical history, physical
           examination, and electroencephalography (EEG). These tests will be performed under
           another protocol, 01-N-0139.

        -  Patients will undergo magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
           of the brain. The study procedures will be performed one time; however, an MEG or MRI
           scan may need to be repeated for technical reasons. Researchers will not do more than
           two MEG or MRI scans.

        -  The MEG will record very small magnetic field changes produced by the activity of the
           brain. An EEG will be recorded at the same time as the MEG.

        -  The MRI will use a magnetic field to take pictures of the inside of the brain.

        -  The MEG will take 3 hours to complete (2 hours for preparation, 1 hour in the scanner).
           The MRI will take approximately 1 hour.

      Objective:

      This protocol will test the hypothesis that the 3-Hz spike-wave discharges seen in absence
      epilepsy originate in the thalamus. We will use an emerging modality, magnetoencephalograpy
      (MEG), to test this hypothesis.

      Study Population:

      33 patients with absence seizures.

      Design:

      This is a non-invasive imaging study that involves a 275-channel whole head MEG recording and
      a structural MRI for co-registration of MEG data.

      Outcome Measure:

      The primary outcome measure is the source localization of spike-wave discharges on
      magnetoencephalography.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Age 7-35

               2. Absence of seizures based on clinical and electroenecephalography data. Patients
                  who have other seizure types (myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic) in addition to
                  absence seizures may be included.

               3. Patients who have other neurologic disorders may be included, as long as they are
                  able to consent/assent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Contraindications to MEG studies (Dental braces, permanent retainers, metal dental
             caps/crowns/fillings)

          2. Contraindications to MRI studies (such as pacemakers, cochlear devices, surgical
             clips, metallic implants, orthopedic pins, shrapnel, permanent eyeliner, vagus nerve
             stimulator)

          3. Claustrophobia or anxiety disorders exacerbated by MRI

          4. Pregnancy

          5. Inability to provide consent/assent
