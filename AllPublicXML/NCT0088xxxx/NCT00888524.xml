      Objectives: To evaluate the effect size on non-specific chronic low back pain (CLBP) of
      evidence-based physiotherapy (EBP) with and without the addition of deep water running (DWR)
      on pain, physical disability and general health state.

      Materials and methods: Randomized, double-blind, controlled trial (therapists and assessors)
      involving 46 persons with CLBP over 15 weeks with two interventions, presented three times a
      week. Each group received EBP (personalized exercise program, manual therapy and health
      education) while one group performed supplementary 20 min sessions of DWR at the
      individualized aerobic threshold. Measurements were made pre and post intervention for pain,
      disability and general health. Range of motion of lumbar spine in the sagittal plane, maximum
      isometric strength and muscle endurance of lumbar and hip extensors was assessment.
