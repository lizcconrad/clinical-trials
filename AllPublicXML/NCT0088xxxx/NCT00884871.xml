    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of surgically-induced weight
      reduction, as achieved by laparoscopic gastric banding or sleeve gastrectomy, on pelvic floor
      disorders such as stress urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, anal incontinence, and
      pelvic organ prolapse in severely, morbidly and super-obese women using a prospective,
      observational study design.
