    <textblock>
      This research study, Development of Algorithms for a Hypoglycemic Prevention Alarm, is being
      conducted at Stanford University Medical Center and the University of Colorado Barbara Davis
      Center. It is paid for by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.

      The purpose of doing this research study is to understand the best way to stop an insulin
      infusion pump from delivering insulin to prevent a subject from having hypoglycemia.
      Nocturnal hypoglycemia is a common problem with type 1 diabetes. This is a pilot study to
      evaluate the safety of a system consisting of an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor
      communicating wirelessly with a bedside computer running an algorithm that temporarily
      suspends insulin delivery when hypoglycemia is predicted in a home setting.

    <textblock>
      After the run-in phase, there is a 21-night trial in which each night is randomly assigned
      2:1 to have either the predictive low-glucose suspend (PLGS) system active (intervention
      night) or inactive (control night).

      Three predictive algorithm versions were studied sequentially during the study.

    <measure>Percentage of Nights With CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) Sensor Values &lt; 60 mg/dL</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Nights with CGM sensor values &lt; 60 mg/dL were considered to be undesirable. A Kalman filter-based model algorithm predicted whether the sensor glucose level would fall below 80 mg/dL and would suspend insulin delivery as needed. Participants may have received treatment using one or more of the following algorithms: Algorithm 1 had a hypoglycaemic prediction horizon of 70 minutes; algorithm 2: 50 minutes; algorithm 3: 30 minutes.</description>

    <description>The pump suspension system consists of the Revel CGM device communicating with a laptop computer that contains the hypoglycemia prediction algorithm. During the 21 night study period, the laptop is placed at the bedside and turned on by the participant at bedtime and off on arising in the morning.The laptop contains a randomization schedule (2:1) that indicats whether the hypoglycemia prediction algorithm will be in operation that night (Predictive Low Glucose Suspend Algorithm ON) or will not be activated (Predictive Low Glucose Suspend Algorithm OFF), to which the participant is blinded.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Nights With CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) Sensor Values &lt; 60 mg/dL</title>
          <description>Nights with CGM sensor values &lt; 60 mg/dL were considered to be undesirable. A Kalman filter-based model algorithm predicted whether the sensor glucose level would fall below 80 mg/dL and would suspend insulin delivery as needed. Participants may have received treatment using one or more of the following algorithms: Algorithm 1 had a hypoglycaemic prediction horizon of 70 minutes; algorithm 2: 50 minutes; algorithm 3: 30 minutes.</description>
