  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study will evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and optimal timing of two
      injections at three dose levels of the tgAAC09 vaccine in healthy volunteers. Study
      volunteers will receive two intramuscular injections of tgAAC09 or placebo at Months 0 and 6
      (groups A, C, E and G) or at Months 0 and 12 (groups B, D and F) and be followed for a total
      of 18 months following the first injection with the exception of group G in which volunteers
      will be followed for 12 months after the first injection (6 months after the second
      injection). This study will explore whether boosting is possible, and compare a shorter and
      more practical six-month time interval with a twelve-month time interval.

      The study design will also assess the effect of the presence of anti-AAV2 capsid neutralizing
      antibodies at the time of vaccination on the safety and immunogenicity of tgAAC09. Since the
      prevalence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AAV2 capsid is high (IAVI and Targeted
      Genetics, data on file), this protocol amendment adds Group G which is composed of volunteers
      who have documented pre-existing anti-AAV2 capsid neutralizing antibodies titers ≤ 1/8. This
      will assure that there are sufficient numbers of volunteers with and without antibodies for a
      useful comparison.
