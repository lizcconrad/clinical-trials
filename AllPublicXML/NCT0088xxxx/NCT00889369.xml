    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to characterize a range of brain activation symptoms
      associated with major depression in peri- and post-menopausal women. Also, assessing brain
      activation before and after the treatment might help to uncover some mechanisms associated
      with the pathophysiology of depression and menopause.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women approaching menopause and during the post-menopausal years appear to be at greater risk
      for developing major depressive episodes. Moreover, this period in life has been associated
      with significant functional impairment due to the presence/severity of vasomotor symptoms
      (hot flashes, night sweats), cognitive complaints, and poorer quality of life. In light of
      recent controversies involving the use of hormone therapies, most physicians and patients are
      seeking nonhormonal strategies to alleviate menopause-related physical and emotional
      complaints. Duloxetine has been shown to improve major depressive disorder (MDD) and
      menopause-related symptoms. To date, the effects of this agent on brain structure and
      functioning in midlife women with MDD have not been explored. The present study aims to
      investigate the effects of duloxetine on brain structure and functioning when used for the
      treatment of a major depressive episode in menopausal women using anatomical magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI). In addition, the investigators will
      examine whether the impact of treatment with duloxetine on vasomotor symptoms, cognition, and
      quality of life modulate the putative changes in brain structure and functioning.
