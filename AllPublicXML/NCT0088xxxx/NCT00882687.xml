    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether SAR 1118 at three different concentrations,
      compared to placebo, is effective in the prevention of the signs and symptoms of allergic

    <measure>Ocular Itching at Day 7 (7 Minutes Post Conjunctival Allergen Challenge [CAC 6])</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 7 (7 minutes post CAC 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular Itching was evaluated by participants and graded with Ophthalmic Research Associates, Inc. (ORA) Scale with the score ranged from 0 to 4 (0=none; 0.5=intermittent tickle in the cornea; 1=intermittent tickle more than just the cornea; 1.5=intermittent all-over tickling sensation; 2=mild conscious itch without desire to rub; 2.5=moderate, diffuse continuous itch with desire to rub; 3=severe itch with desire to rub; 3.5=severe itch improved with minimal rubbing; 4=incapacitating itch with an irresistible urge to rub) with 0.5 point increments allowed, and lower scores indicates lesser ocular itching. CAC is an initial titration challenge to determine the appropriate allergen and lowest concentration of allergen that produced a positive bilateral allergic response for each subject, defined as ≥ 2 score (0-4 point scale) in ocular itching and conjunctival redness within 10 minutes of the last titration of allergen.</description>

        <title>Ocular Itching at Day 7 (7 Minutes Post Conjunctival Allergen Challenge [CAC 6])</title>
        <description>Ocular Itching was evaluated by participants and graded with Ophthalmic Research Associates, Inc. (ORA) Scale with the score ranged from 0 to 4 (0=none; 0.5=intermittent tickle in the cornea; 1=intermittent tickle more than just the cornea; 1.5=intermittent all-over tickling sensation; 2=mild conscious itch without desire to rub; 2.5=moderate, diffuse continuous itch with desire to rub; 3=severe itch with desire to rub; 3.5=severe itch improved with minimal rubbing; 4=incapacitating itch with an irresistible urge to rub) with 0.5 point increments allowed, and lower scores indicates lesser ocular itching. CAC is an initial titration challenge to determine the appropriate allergen and lowest concentration of allergen that produced a positive bilateral allergic response for each subject, defined as ≥ 2 score (0-4 point scale) in ocular itching and conjunctival redness within 10 minutes of the last titration of allergen.</description>
