  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assist in the early detection of influenza resistant to antivirals and will
      monitor the clinical outcome of adults and children infected with influenza according to
      subtype and susceptibility. Participants clinically diagnosed with influenza will undergo a
      rapid diagnostic test and viral sampling at Baseline and on Days 3, 6, and 10. Participants
      will be clinically managed according to local guidelines and the decision to treat/not treat
      will be at the discretion of the Investigator.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Genotypic Resistance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and post-Baseline (Days 3, 6, 10)</time_frame>
    <description>Samples were analyzed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pre-defined mutations in viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) were noted, the presence of which was defined as genotypic resistance. The number of participants with genotypic resistance at Baseline was reported. The number of participants with genotypic resistance post-Baseline was determined by a collective count of all participants who had a resistance mutation at least once on Days 3, 6, and/or 10. (Hereafter, &quot;H&quot; stands for hemagglutinin and &quot;N&quot; stands for neuraminidase in abbreviations of viral subtype such as H1N1, H1N1pdm09, and H3N2.)</description>

    <description>Pre-defined mutations in viral RNA were noted, the presence of which was defined as genotypic resistance. Treatment-emergent resistance was defined as the presence of genotypic or phenotypic resistance from a post-Baseline sample in the setting of a previously non-resistant Baseline sample. The percentage of participants with treatment-emergent resistance was reported by study year for participants with H3N2 or H1N1pdm09 infections. Only data with evaluable participants were reported.</description>

    <measure>Total Daily Symptom Score According to Global Assessment by the Investigator Among Adults Treated With Oseltamivir</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1, 6, 10</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms were assessed on Days 1, 6, and 10. The Investigator rated seven symptoms of fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, cough, aches/pains, headache, and fatigue on a scale of 0 (absent/no problem) to 3 (severe/major problem). The global score was calculated as a sum of all individual symptom scores. Global scores may range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating worse or more pronounced symptoms.</description>

Phenotypic resistance was defined as 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) more than 10-fold higher than the median value for all viruses of the same subtype. Treatment-emergent resistance was defined as the presence of genotypic or phenotypic resistance from a post-Baseline sample in the setting of a previously non-resistant Baseline sample. Susceptible viruses were those that did not exhibit treatment-emergent resistance. The percentage of participants with mild or absent symptoms on Day 6 was reported and stratified by resistant and susceptible viruses.</description>

        <description>Pre-defined mutations in viral RNA were noted, the presence of which was defined as genotypic resistance. Phenotypic resistance was defined as IC50 more than 10-fold higher than the median value for all viruses of the same subtype. Treatment-emergent resistance was defined as the presence of genotypic or phenotypic resistance from a post-Baseline sample in the setting of a previously non-resistant Baseline sample. Susceptible viruses were those that did not exhibit treatment-emergent resistance. The mean viral load from each sample was expressed in log10 vp/mL and stratified by resistant and susceptible viruses.</description>

The Investigator rated seven symptoms of fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, cough, aches/pains, headache, and energy/tiredness on a scale of 0 (absent/no problem) to 3 (severe/major problem). The global score was calculated as a sum of all individual symptom scores. Global scores may range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating worse or more pronounced symptoms.</description>
