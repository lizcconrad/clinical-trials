      The objectives of this study are to characterize the clinical performance and wear mechanisms
      of all-ceramic posterior crowns. The wear rate of all-ceramic crowns and opposing enamel in
      selected patients will be quantified. The relationship of each subject's maximum clenching
      force and wear rate will also be analyzed.

    <textblock>
      High strength ceramics have been used in dentistry for constructing fixed partial denture.
      Their advantages are their acceptable fracture resistance, excellent biocompatibility,
      moderate opacity, etc. Because the increase in demand for more esthetic restoration, various
      ceramic materials have been used as a core material for several all-ceramic systems. Their
      properties have been investigated extensively in many in vitro studies. Currently, there are
      not much results regarding clinical performance and wear mechanism of ceramic-based
      prosthesis and more information are required for future research.
