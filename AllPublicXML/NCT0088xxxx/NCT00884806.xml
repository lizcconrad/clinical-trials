    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal staining was assessed by the investigator using fluorescein dye, a yellow filter, and a slit lamp. Corneal staining was graded on a continuous scale of 0% (no staining in the region) to 100% (staining covers entire region) in 1% increments for 5 corneal regions (central, nasal, temporal, inferior, and superior). Solution-related corneal staining was defined as ≥20% corneal staining area in at least 3 corneal regions of both eyes.</description>

    <measure>Mean Lens Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Lens comfort was assessed by the participant on a 5-point Likert scale prior to any examination. The participant was instructed to select a single response to the statement, &quot;Over the previous 2-3 hours, my lenses felt comfortable,&quot; with 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = undecided, 4 = agree, and 5 = strongly agree.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older.

          -  Wear contact lenses a minimum of 8 hours per day for at least 7-10 days prior to Visit
             1 (screening visit).

          -  Vision correctable to 20/30 (Snellen) or better in each eye at distance with contact
             lenses at Visit 1.

          -  Must discontinue contact lens wear for at least two consecutive days before Visit 2
             (baseline visit).

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any medical condition (systemic or ophthalmic) that may, in the opinion of the

             the study.

          -  Known sensitivity or intolerance to any protocol-specified contact lens solutions, eye
             drops, or products containing similar ingredients (e.g., generic products).

             of the investigator.

             surgery within the last 12 months.

          -  Any slit-lamp finding score of 1 (or rated 3 or 4 for limbal and bulbar conjunctival
             injection) at screening or baseline visits.

          -  Corneal staining area assessment ≥ 20% in any corneal region in either eye at baseline
             visit.

          -  Corneal staining graded as 2 (macropunctate) or greater in any corneal region in
             either eye at baseline visit.

          -  Participation in any investigational clinical study within 30 days of baseline visit.

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
