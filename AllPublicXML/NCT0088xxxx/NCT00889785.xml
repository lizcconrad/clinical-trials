      The proposed research will test a new comprehensive disease management intervention with
      adolescents who have type 2 diabetes using a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Adolescents
      subjects with a history of Type 2 Diabetes and a parent caregiver will be consented,
      enrolled, and randomly assigned to either an 6-month intervention (N=44) or a &quot;usual care&quot;
      comparison (N=44). Recruitment will take place within the Vanderbilt Eskind Pediatric
      Diabetes Clinic. The intervention will include participation in a comprehensive disease
      management program that includes: (1) application of treatment algorithms, (2) phone
      assessment from a diabetes nurse practitioner and dietician to assess barriers and promote
      problem solving, treatment adherence and management, and (3) a behavioral
      Internet-administered self-management problem solving component. Outcomes include
      self-reported self-management behaviors (exercise, diet, medication adherence, etc.), blood
      pressure, weight/BMI, and glycated hemoglobin (A1C).
