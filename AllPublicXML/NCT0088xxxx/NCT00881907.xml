  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the investigators study is to characterize the composition of the hard and
      soft tissues present in root canals of teeth previously diagnosed with necrotic pulps and
      incomplete root formation and treated with a triple antibiotic regeneration protocol. The
      investigators hypothesis is that treatment of teeth with necrotic pulps and immature apices
      with triple antibiotic paste will stimulate continued root formation by the deposition of
      dentin at the root apices. The primary outcome measure will be histological identification of
      mineralized tissue and adherent cells in the apical third of these teeth.

    <textblock>
      'Regeneration' as referred to in this protocol refers to the stimulation of continued root
      formation by the deposition of apical tissues subsequent to disinfection of a necrotic root
      canal and its contents and creation of a scaffold upon which cells can proliferate. While the
      proposed treatment protocol is currently being used in clinical practice and has been shown
      to be successful in case reports and case series, the nature of the proliferating apical
      tissues remains unknown. Thus, this study is uniquely positioned to address a critical gap in
      knowledge in the regeneration of a functional pulp-dentin complex. Moreover, results obtained
      from pediatric cases may well provide the essential foundation of knowledge for endodontists
      to apply this knowledge to the more difficult situation of regenerating the pulp-dentin
      complex of the full mature permanent tooth.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient Inclusion Criteria:

               -  Healthy volunteers ages 10-60 with a non-restorable (as determined by referring
                  dentist), permanent tooth with a necrotic pulp and incomplete root development.

               -  Persons who seem to be cooperative with dental treatment and able to indicate
                  willingness to obtain treatment and participate in the study and who are capable
                  of verbally expressing dissent.

               -  Parents who express understanding of study treatments and consent to treatment
                  for their child of the regenerative procedure.

               -  Healthy patients (ASA Class I or II physical status) with no systemic health
