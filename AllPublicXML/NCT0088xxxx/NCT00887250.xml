  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a 4 week placebo period, patients were randomized to Placebo or Losartan 50 mg arms,
      after 6 weeks non-responders were up titrated to 100 mg losartan for the remaining 6 weeks.
      This study evaluated if losartan is more effective than placebo in lowering sitting diastolic
      blood pressure and is well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.
