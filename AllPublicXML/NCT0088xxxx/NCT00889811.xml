  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent several clinical trials, remote preconditioning showed very powerful myocardial
      protection. However, the myocardial protective effect by remote preconditioning was not
      evaluated on the patients undergoing off pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery (OPCAB).

      The investigators hypothesized that the lower limb remote preconditioning could protect the
      myocardium during the OPCAB. In this study, the investigators will try to evaluate whether
      remote preconditioning could induce myocardial protection on the OPCAB patients.

    <textblock>
      In recent two clinical trials on the patients undergoing cardiac surgery, remote
      preconditioning showed very powerful myocardial protection by simple and safe procedures such
      as the brief inflation of pneumatic tourniquet on the upper or lower limb. However, despite
      these impressive results, the clinical studies are lacking yet. Moreover, two previous
      studies were done on the cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Considering different
      mechanism, level of myocardial injury and the increasing popularity of OPCAB, we need the
      clinical study on remote preconditioning with the OPCAB patients.

      In this study, we will conduct randomized controlled clinical trials in which the remote
      preconditioning was induced by lower limb ischemia with double-blinded technique. Myocardial
      injury will be assessed by postoperative serum troponin I levels and they will be compared
      with those of control group.
