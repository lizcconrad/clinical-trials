    <textblock>
      The neurological basis of tinnitus is uncertain when there is no evidence of damage to the
      peripheral auditory system. However, neuroimaging studies of tinnitus patients show
      hyperactivity in several cortical regions, especially the auditory cortices and middle
      temporal regions. A potentially promising treatment modality for tinnitus is repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). rTMS involves the application of frequent, repeated
      magnetic stimuli to the skull to induce electrical activity in the underlying cortical areas
      of the brain. When the magnetic device is placed on the skull, the resultant magnetic field
      passes through the skull and induces a small secondary current in the cortex. It has been
      hypothesized that the effect of the frequency used in rTMS differentially influences cortical
      activity with low-frequency (1Hz) stimulation decreasing and high-frequency stimulation
      (10-20 Hz) increasing cortical activity.

      Currently, reports on treating tinnitus with rTMS have focused on low-frequency stimulation
      of the left auditory cortex, an area that has been demonstrated to be hyperactive in
      tinnitus. The benefits of low-frequency auditory cortex stimulation are time limited however.
      Converging data implicate structures of the brain that are important for mood and attention
      as playing a role in the maintenance of tinnitus; suggesting an alternative rTMS treatment
      approach that targets these structures. A growing number of studies demonstrate involvement
      of the prefrontal cortex in the generation and maintenance of tinnitus. rTMS stimulation in
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in association with stimulation in the temporoparietal
      cortex has been shown to increase the durability of the TPC stimulation. The independent
      effect of rTMS stimulation to the DLPFC is not known. Studies in depression suggest that
      increasing the intensity and duration of stimulation has beneficial treatment effects.
      However, the field is new and more work is needed to assess the effectiveness of this
      treatment, predictors and correlates of response, and safety.

      Herein, we propose an open-label pilot study investigating the effectiveness of rTMS
      stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, an area known to be important for mood and
      attention, in the treatment of tinnitus

          <title>Average Change (Baseline-End of Treatment) Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI)</title>
          <description>Patient self-reported Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) The mean change (95% CI) in THI scores (Baseline - End of Treatment). Measures tinnitus severity, or how much tinnitus interrupts their life. The THI scores range from 0-100. 0 being no interruption, 100 being severe interruption in their life from tinnitus.</description>
