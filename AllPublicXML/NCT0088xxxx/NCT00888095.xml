  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of two different targets of deep brain
      stimulation: caudal Zona incerta and Nucleus subthalamicus. The present study will
      investigate the effects of DBS using a blind, randomized and stratified design in patients
      with Parkinson's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a severe neurological movement disorder comprising the triad of
      symptoms of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. It can be effectively treated with
      dopaminergic replacement therapy in the early course of the disease; however, after 5-10
      years medical therapy is insufficient in the majority of patients. Since the early 90s the
      implantation of electrodes into the Nucleus subthalamicus (STN), (deep brain stimulation;
      DBS) has been established. DBS in PD- patients provides a definite and longlasting relief of
      motor symptoms and impaired quality of life compared to optimized medical treatment (Deuschl
      et al. 2006). Conventionally, electrodes are implanted into STN but other targets such as the
      pedunculopontine nucleus or the Zona incerta (ZI) have been reported to be useful.
      Importantly, the ZI has a key role in connection loops from the basal ganglia, thalamic
      regions and cortex. Retrospective studies of DBS-treated patients show relief of symptoms in
      DBS- treated PD patients, with the contacts of the electrodes being located to the ZI (Voges
      et al., 2002; Hamel et al., 2003a, 2003b). However, no prospective randomized studies
      analysing the effect of bilateral DBS comparing the targets of the caudal ZI (cZI) and STN
      are available. Therefore, the present study will investigate the effect and tolerance of DBS
      in both targets in a blind, randomized and stratified design in a total of 70 PD patients
      (see below for inclusion end exclusion criteria). The impairment of movement and quality of
      life will be assessed via established scales. Effects, tolerance and side effects of DBS will
      be monitored closely and re-assessed for a period of twelve months. Primary study criteria
      include UPDRS-III and quality of life.
