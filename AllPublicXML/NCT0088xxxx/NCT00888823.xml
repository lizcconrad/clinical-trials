  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new type of treatment called stereotactic radiotherapy has recently been developed in hopes
      of improving the success of the treatment and improving the convenience to patients, while
      reducing the side effects. This study is developing stereotactic radiotherapy as a
      state-of-the-art treatment for lung cancer patients.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Objectives

        -  To determine the efficacy of hypofractionated, image guided radiotherapy in treating
           patients with lung tumours, with the primary outcome being local control at one year.

        -  To determine the toxicity of high dose, small field,hypofractionated radiotherapy to the
           lung, based on the RTOG and CTCAE scales.
