  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of the investigational study product and
      see how well it works to relieve signs and symptoms of children with mild to moderate Atopic
      Dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema, in comparison to that of a similar marketed product.
      This study was conducted to assess the safety of the investigational new study product and
      how well it works to treat AD in children, by making AD visually better, and reducing the
      amount of itch.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled trial in children 2 to
      12 years of age with mild to moderate AD. A sufficient number of subjects were screened to
      ensure that approximately 80 subjects were randomized, to yield 70 completed subjects.
      Subjects were randomized to one of the two treatment groups: the J&amp;J Device or Atopiclair®.
      All subjects were to return to the clinical site for clinical assessments at baseline (Day 1)
      and at Days 3, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 43 after initial investigational product application. The
      investigational products were used topically during the duration of the study.
