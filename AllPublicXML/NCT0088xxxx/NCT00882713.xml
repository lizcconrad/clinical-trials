  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of once monthly
      administration of subcutaneous Mircera for the maintenance of hemoglobin levels in dialysis
      patients with chronic renal anemia. Patients will receive subcutaneous Mircera at a starting
      dose of 120, 200 or 360 micrograms every 4 weeks, calculated from the last weekly dose of
      epoetin or darbepoetin alfa previously administered. Subsequent doses will be adjusted to
      maintain hemoglobin levels within the target range. Treatment duration is 56 weeks, and the
      target sample size is 200 individuals.

        <description>Percentage of participants requiring any dose adjustment during DTP (Week 1 to Week 16) and EEP (Week 17 to Week 24) is reported. The dose adjustments (increase or decrease) were required: if a single Hb concentration was either &gt; or = 13 g/dL or &lt; or = 9 g/dL; if the difference of 2 consecutive Hb concentrations was &gt; or =2 g/dL; if the values of scheduled Hb assessments on the day of administration of C.E.R.A. and on the previous study visit were both out of range of 10.5 to 11.5 g/dL, the difference between the reference value (mean of Hb concentrations based on the Hb assessments at Weeks -4, -3, -2, -1, and 0) and the most recent value was &gt;1 g/dL; if the values of the scheduled Hb assessments on the day of administration of C.E.R.A. and on the previous study visit were both out of the range 10 to 12 g/dL. Dose adjustment could be made at any time at the discretion of the clinician if clinically warranted.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants were administered C.E.R.A. intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks for 44 weeks. The starting dose of C.E.R.A. (120, 200, or 360 mcg) was based on the dose of epoetin alfa or beta administered in the week preceding the switch to C.E.R.A. Subsequent doses were adjusted to maintain the individual participant's hemoglobin (Hb) value within a range of +/- 1.0 g/dL of the reference Hb concentration and between 10.50 and 12.50 g/dL.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants were administered C.E.R.A. intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks for 44 weeks. The starting dose of C.E.R.A. (120, 200, or 360 mcg) was based on the dose of epoetin alfa or beta administered in the week preceding the switch to C.E.R.A. Subsequent doses were adjusted to maintain the individual participant's hemoglobin (Hb) value within a range of +/- 1.0 g/dL of the reference Hb concentration and between 10.50 and 12.50 g/dL.</description>
