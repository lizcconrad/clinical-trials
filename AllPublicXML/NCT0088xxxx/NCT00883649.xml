  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a nutritional supplement in
      post-menopausal women age 40 or older with moderate to severe dry eyes. This study is being
      conducted to determine if signs and symptoms of dry eye will improve with the use of this
      nutritional supplement.

             hepatic, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurological disease, cancer, AIDS, or
             cerebral dysfunction) that could, in the judgment of the investigator, jeopardize
             subject safety or interfere with the interpretation of the results of the study

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any components of the study or procedural medication

          -  Anticipated contact lens wear during the study

          -  Initiation, discontinuation or change in dosage of antihistamines, cholinergic agents,
             beta-blocking agents, tricyclic or SSRI antidepressants, phenothiazines, or topical or
             systemic acne rosacea medications in two months prior to enrollment, or anticipated
             change in dosage during course of study

          -  Topical ophthalmic medications within prior 4 weeks, or anticipated use of same during
             the study (except artificial tears)

          -  Use of Coumadin or Plavix within prior 2 weeks, or anticipated use of same during
             study. Stable dosing of aspirin 325mg or 85 mg per day is permitted.
