      The purpose of this study is to determine the oral dose level at which the investigative
      drug, Proellex, is able to suppress endogenous progesterone in women. It is believed that
      giving Proellex in the early/mid-luteal phase of the cycle will suppress the effects of
      endogenous progesterone triggering the end of the cycle and inducing menstruation as happens
      naturally
