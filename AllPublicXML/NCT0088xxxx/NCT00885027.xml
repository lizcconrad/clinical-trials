      This is an exploratory study, to evaluate the improvement in terms of quality of life that
      can be reached by a group of outpatients with BPH ( Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ) and
      nocturia when they are under treatment with Secotex Ocas.

      This study will explore, the progress in terms of quality of life that can be reached by a
      group of outpatients with BPH ( Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) and nocturia treated with
      Secotex OCAS®.

      This is a not controlled study, &quot; before and after type&quot;, which will consist of an
      assessment, of the quality of life for outpatients with BPH symptoms including nocturia,
      through the use of the Spanish version of the Nocturia Quality-of-life (NQoL) questionnaire,
      at three different moments:

        1. Before to start Secotex OCAS® treatment.

        2. Thirty (30) days after first visit and starting Secotex OCAS® treatment

        3. Ninethy (90) days after first visit and starting Secotex Ocas® treatment
