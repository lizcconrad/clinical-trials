  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done because we want to learn if hemin can increase the production of
      heme oxygenase 1. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is an enzyme which protects cells from physical,
      chemical, and biologic stress. Hemin is produced from red blood cells and is approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration for treating acute porphyria, which is an inherited condition
      caused by an enzyme deficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1) degrades heme, protects cells against oxidative stress, and is
      beneficial in several experimental models but has not been pharmacologically activated in
      humans. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of hemin on HO-1 activity
      in healthy subjects. Hemin is the most powerful inducer of HO-1. Hemin is FDA-approved to
      treat acute intermittent porphyria. In addition, hemin has also been used to treat
      thalassemia intermedia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and to control liver allograft failure due
      to recurrence of erythropoietic prototheria. Our hypothesis is that compared to placebo,
      hemin will increase HO-1 in humans. Ten healthy subjects will be randomized to hemin (n = 5,
      Panhematin®, Ovation Pharmaceuticals, 3 mg/kg i.v. in 25% albumin) or placebo (n = 5, 25%
      albumin) infusion. HO-1 activity will be assessed before and after (4, 6, 24, and 48 hours)
      infusions.

    <description>Hemin (Panhematin®, Ovation Pharmaceuticals, Deerfield, IL) will be administered through a large-caliber peripheral vein at a dose of 1.25 mL/kg and at a rate of 60 mL/hour. To enhance stability, Panhematin® will be diluted in ~ 132 mL of 25% albumin to obtain a hemin concentration of 2.4 mg/mL.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        1. Healthy non pregnant not breast feeding, and non-smoking subjects aged 18 - 65 years
             old without clinical evidence of significant cardiovascular, gastrointestinal,
             hematological, neurological, psychiatric or other disease that may interfere with the
             objectives of the study and/or pose safety concerns. No symptoms of functional GI
             disorder as assessed by a validated questionnaire.

          2. No medications except for stable doses of oral contraceptives or thyroid
             supplementation. Because ascorbic acid can induce HO-1 activity, multivitamins will
             need to be discontinued for 1 week before and for the duration of the study.

          3. No intolerance or allergy to eggs

          4. Able to provide written informed consent before participating in the study

          5. Able to communicate adequately with the investigator and to comply with the
             requirements for the entire study

          6. Screening weight &lt; 96 kg
