  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity in children is a serious disease that is associated with increased mortality and
      decreased life expectancy. A simple tool used to assist in controlling portions (and
      therefore calorie intake) at mealtime would be of benefit in promoting weight maintenance
      and/or loss. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a family intervention
      using a portion control tool to help control weight in obese children. The investigators
      hypothesize that the use of portion control tools by the parents and child will result in a
      greater decrease in the child's BMI over a 6 month period compared with the control group.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of a portion
      control tool to help improve body mass index in obese children over a 6 months period. This
      study will also assess whether this weight control strategy results in improvement of blood
      pressure, waist circumference, and biomarkers of obesity including plasma visfatin,
      adiponectin, fasting lipid profile and apolipoprotein B, liver function tests and fasting
      insulin and glucose. Both the intervention and the control group will receive a one hour
      session of standard dietary counseling from a registered dietician at baseline regarding
      healthy eating habits, appropriate portion sizes and the Canada Food Guide. The duration of
      this study will be 6 months. Baseline measurements will be taken at the initial visit and
      again at 3 months and 6 months. Each participants' height and weight will be measured, and
      BMI will be calculated. Waist circumference and blood pressure will also be measured. A blood
      sample will be drawn at baseline and 6 months for a fasting lipid profile, fasting insulin,
      and glucose levels. Measurement of plasma visfatin and adiponectin levels using ELISA will be
      carried out.
