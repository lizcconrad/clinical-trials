    <textblock>
      PTSD is a common consequence of war, for soldiers and civilians. PTSD results in
      hyperarousal, avoidance, numbing, and re-experiencing, causing persistent decreased quality
      of life. Mindfulness involves the ability to bring attention to the present moment without
      judgment; this ability is correlated with measures of mental health. Within health care,
      mindfulness is taught as an 8-week course called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR).
      MBSR is unstudied for PTSD. We propose to assess the feasibility of MBSR as an intervention
      for PTSD, since it may affect hypervigilance, avoidance, and reactivity associated with this
      disorder.

      Specific Aims: Aim 1: Assess the feasibility of recruiting and retaining a sample of veterans
      with PTSD to complete a study protocol that involves randomization to usual care or usual
      care plus MBSR. Aim 2: Apply measures of PTSD symptom severity, depression and quality of
      life before and after randomization, to assess whether there is evidence of benefit and
      whether MBSR warrants further study for PTSD, and allow calculation of standardized effect
      sizes. Aim 3: Apply a validated measure of mindfulness before and after treatment. Aim 4:
      Explore the relationship between PTSD symptoms, mindfulness score, and frequency of
      meditation practice.
