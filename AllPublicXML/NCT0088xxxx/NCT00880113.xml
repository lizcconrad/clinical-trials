  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Less than 10% of all ischemic stroke patients are treated by intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)
      as most present later than the accepted 3 hour time window. Intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT)
      is possible 3-6 hours post ictus, but is infrequently used. Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) with
      a MERCI device is a new intervention possibility but lacks large randomized studies. Although
      it is desirable to treat more stroke patients, clinical information and plain CT alone are
      insufficient to discriminate which patients are most likely to benefit or be harmed from
      treatment. Advanced imaging techniques can help predict patient outcome and provide the
      necessary information to weigh expected benefit against associated risk of treatment.
      Visualizing the penumbra, the hypoperfused tissue at risk of infarction around the
      irreversible infarct core, is one way of identifying patients most likely to benefit from
      intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based selection of patients with sufficient
      penumbra for thrombolysis is possible, however, MR has less 24-hour availability than CT in
      the acute setting. Plain CT is mostly used to exclude intracerebral hemorrhage, and can
      easily be extended with CT perfusion (CTP) and CT angiography (CTA). CTP compares well to MRI
      for imaging penumbra and infarct core, and it is faster and more feasible than MRI. Other
      image findings such as infarct core size and leakage of the blood-brain-barrier
      (permeability) on CTP, and site and extent of the occlusion and collateral circulation on CTA
      also influence stroke outcome but have not been combined in one study to assess their
      combined predictive value.

      Hypothesis:

      The investigators hypothesize that combined CTP and CTA parameters can predict patient
      outcome in acute ischemic stroke.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute neurological deficit caused by cerebral ischaemia

          -  Admission &lt; 9 hours after onset of neurological deficit

          -  NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of at least 2

          -  No absolute contraindications against intravenous contrast

          -  Informed consent from patient or family after admission scan

          -  Patients who awaken with stroke symptoms can only be included if they went to sleep
             without any stroke symptoms and the time from going to sleep until imaging is less
             than 9 hours

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Neurological deficit caused by another diagnosis than cerebral ischaemia (such as
             intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage or tumor)

          -  Patients with known contrast allergy or kidney failure

          -  Patients with the known combination of renal insufficiency and heart failure (New York
             Heart Association (NYHA) IV) will be excluded for the CTP and CTA scan at 3 days; they
             will have a non-contrast CT (NCCT) at that time.
