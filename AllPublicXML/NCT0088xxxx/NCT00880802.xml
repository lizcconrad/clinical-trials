      Study Objectives

      The following items will be prospectively assessed.

      Primary Endpoints

        1. For patients presenting with clinical suspicion of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS), high
           sensitivity-cardiac Troponin I (hs-cTnI) provides improved diagnostic accuracy for ACS
           (including Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and/or Unstable Angina (UA)) within the
           first two (2) hours after emergency department presentation when compared to currently
           available troponin assays.

        2. For patients presenting with clinical suspicion of ACS, hs-cTnI provides improved
           prognostic information with regard to 180 day event rates of Major Adverse Cardiac Event
           outcomes, including cardiac deaths which are defined as all deaths except those that are
           clearly non-cardiac in nature (e.g. trauma), when compared to a currently available
           troponin assay.

      Secondary Endpoints

        1. For patients presenting with clinical suspicion of ACS, using the rate of rise of
           hs-cTnI over time between presentation and 2 hours (delta hs-cTnI) allows for the
           differentiation between ACS and other disease states.

        2. For patients presenting with clinical suspicion of ACS, hs-cTnI provides improved
           sensitivity for detecting AMI within the first two (2) hours after presentation when
           compared to a currently available troponin assay.

        3. For patients presenting with clinical suspicion of ACS, hs-cTnI provides improved
           negative predictive value for ruling out ACS (AMI or UA) within the first 2 hours after
           presentation when compared to a currently available troponin assay.

        4. For alternative endpoints of cardiac mortality, and for alternative censor time points
           of 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year, hs-cTnI provides improved prognostic information when
           compared to the currently available troponin assay.

        5. In cases where the emergency physician has limited diagnostic confidence, hs-cTnI AMI
           diagnostic accuracy will be superior to local hospital standards for AMI determination.

        6. In cases where the emergency physician has limited diagnostic confidence, the slope for
           the hs-cTnI between presentation and 2 hours will add diagnostic accuracy for ACS
           diagnosis over and above local hospital standards for ACS determination.

        7. For patients presenting with clinical suspicion of ACS, the difference in diagnostic
           accuracy for ACS (including AMI and/or UA) using hs-cTnI measurement from time of onset
           of symptoms to emergency department presentation (e.g. 3 hours instead of 6 hours) will
           be evaluated to assess any variation.

      This study will evaluate the ability of a high sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) assay
      to detect and to rule-out high-risk ischemic cardiac injury in emergency room patients
      experiencing signs and symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).
      Cardiovascular disease is still the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality among
      industrialized nations. In the U.S., there are nearly 100 million adults who suffer from
      cardiovascular disease. Over 5 million patients present to emergency departments (EDs)
      annually with a chief complaint consistent with ACS. A majority of these patients are found
      to be experiencing non-cardiac chest pain (about 70-82% of patients). Myocardial infarction
      (MI, including non-ST-segment elevation MI [NSTEMIs = about 6-10% of patients] and ST-segment
      elevation MI [STEMIs = about 2-5% of patients]) occurs in about 8-15% of these patients.
      Unstable angina (UA), which is often a precursor condition to MI, accounts for 10-15% of
      patients. Together, MI plus UA combine to define ACS (= about 18-30% patients).

      MI is caused by rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque in a coronary artery, leading to
      platelet aggregation and thrombus formation to an extent that oxygenation of the myocardial
      tissue is completely interrupted (i.e., total occlusion), with the occurrence of some degree
      of myocardial necrosis. High concentrations of cardiac enzymes and proteins (e.g., cardiac
      troponin I or T [cTnI or cTnT], CK-MB, myoglobin) are observed in blood as the result of
      significant irreversible injury to cardiac tissue distal to the site of rupture and secondary
      to arterial occlusion. Current assays can detect STEMIs and NSTEMIs but, by definition of the
      2007 AHA/ACC updated guidelines for NSTEMI and UA, the NSTEMI threshold is defined as the
      99th percentile upper reference limit [URL] of a cardiac troponin (cTn) assay's reference
      range in a healthy subject population, and they cannot detect what is currently labeled
      &quot;unstable angina (UA)&quot; or ischemia without necrosis. In addition, it typically takes 4-6
      hours, after ischemic symptoms begin, for the cardiac troponin to rise above the current
      commercial assay NSTEMI threshold (i.e., the upper reference limit [URL] = the 99th
      percentile upper reference limit). These issues expose a sensitivity problem with current
      generation cTn assays, including the most sensitive tests available.

      UA is also associated with plaque rupture but only partial coronary artery occlusion occurs,
      resulting in ischemic pain but no (or unmeasureable) necrosis. No rise is observable in
      cardiac marker levels on currently available assays (best limit of detection [LOD] of ~0.01
      ng/mL [10 pg/mL] and best URL of ~0.03 ng/mL [30 pg/mL]). Since there is no test currently
      available that accurately diagnoses UA, many UA patients are discharged home in the midst of
      a high-risk ischemic event. (Note: Ischemia modified albumin [IMA] is on the market but is
      not widely used due to its poor specificity.) The negative predictive value of the diagnostic
      test is important in this regard, as increases in sensitivity may be offset if there are also
      increases in false positive results.

      As many as 2% (30,000 patients) to 4% (60,000 pts) of patients with MI or UA (~750,000 MI
      patients + ~750,000 UA patients = ~1.5 million total patients at risk) are inadvertently
      discharged from the ED with an associated short-term mortality of 10% to 26% (Duseja and
      Feldman 2004). Missed acute cardiac ischemia is one of the major causes of malpractice
      litigation against emergency physicians (Duseja and Feldman 2004). Even though chest pain
      (and other symptoms consistent with ACS) patients represent only 6% of the ED patient volume,
      it has been estimated that 20% of ED-related malpractice dollars are expended for ischemic
      heart disease complications (Rusnak, et al 1989). Therefore, the misdiagnosis of ischemic
      cardiac injury is of great importance from a human-life and economic perspective.

      In the typical hospital ED today, cardiac biomarkers are drawn and the results are back to
      the ED physician within about 1.5 hours (i.e., therapeutic turnaround time [TTAT]; &quot;vein to
      brain&quot; time). Some hospitals have moved to point-of-care devices (with relatively low
      sensitivity [URL = 0.080 ng/mL]) that can give results within 10-15 minutes and, on the other
      extreme, some EDs that are still dependent on the central laboratory have a therapeutic
      turnaround time of 2-4 hours. Most chest pain patients that continue to have discomfort and
      other cardiac symptoms are held in the ED or chest pain (observation) unit for 6 to 23 hours,
      before discharge, allowing serial cardiac markers to be drawn. Therefore, keeping these time
      points in mind, a highly sensitive (e.g., URL = 0.003 ng/mL) and precise cTn assay (e.g.,
      &lt;20-30%CV) that takes &lt; 1 hour to give a result may be very useful for any hospital ED.

      Time is important but, in the case of ischemic heart disease, accurate information is more
      important and is potentially life-saving. The information that the assay would give to the ED
      physician would allow for accurate diagnosis of what is currently labeled &quot;UA&quot; and not
      discharge a patient who actually requires close monitoring, treatment, or follow-up at a
      cardiologist's office. Also, the diagnosis of an MI could be made much earlier (with high
      sensitivity and specificity) than the 4-6 hours after ED presentation that it takes for cTn
      to be detected by current assays.

      With no cardiac marker assay available that can diagnose &quot;UA&quot; with appropriate accuracy and
      precision, development of a cost-effective, timely (&lt; 1 hr assay time) cardiac troponin assay
      that allows accurate measurement of cTn at concentrations that are 10-100 fold below the best
      of the current assays' detection limits has the potential to improve ACS patient care. It
      will allow diagnosis of ischemic injury in &quot;UA&quot; patients in the ED so they can be admitted
      appropriately to the hospital instead of being sent home to experience a possible cardiac
      event or death. With current therapeutic capabilities (e.g., LMWHs, beta-blockers,
      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, other anti-platelet agents) that are known to lower the
      risk of future cardiac events and mortality, it can be expected that the earlier detection of
      MI and diagnosis of &quot;UA&quot; may lead to reductions in morbidity and mortality in ACS patients.

      The need for a highly sensitive assay for cardiac troponin is predicated on the observation
      that the URL of the true reference range in nominally healthy subjects is significantly below
      the concentrations that current assays can measure. A new nanoparticle-based, highly
      sensitive cTnI assay (i.e., nano-assay) appears to offer a significant technological
      advantage over the current macroparticle-based, sensitive assays. The new highly sensitive
      assay's LOD is ~800 fg/mL (800 fg/mL = 0.8 pg/mL = 0.0008 ng/mL) for cardiac troponin I, as
      compared to 10 pg/mL (0.010 ng/mL) for the most sensitive cTnI assay currently on the market.
      The new assay has an imprecision (%CV), at the LOD, of &lt;20-30%, as compared to &gt;&gt;30% at the
      LOD for the most sensitive cTnI assay currently on the market. The URL of the reference range
      in healthy subjects for the new assay is about 2.8 pg/mL (0.0028 ng/mL), compared to 30 pg/mL
      (0.030 ng/mL) for the most sensitive cTnI assay currently on the market. Under these
      differences in analytical performance, it is likely that the majority of patients with what
      is currently labeled &quot;UA&quot; will reveal detectable troponin concentrations that exceed the
      nano-assay's threshold limit (i.e., 2.8 pg/mL = 0.0028 ng/mL) on the nanoparticle-based,
      highly sensitive cTnI assay but non-detectable levels of troponin on the current
      macroparticle-based, sensitive cTnI assays.

      In a pilot study, banked serial serum samples of ten NSTEMI patients from the Hospital of the
      University of Pennsylvania ED were evaluated on a research version of the nano-assay. These
      serial samples were &quot;troponin-negative&quot; on an older laboratory assay (laboratory assay URL =
      0.6 ng/mL = 600pg/mL) for the first 1-3 blood draws. Samples from these patients at
      presentation, 90min, and 180min were measured by a current sensitive assay (Siemens [Dade
      Behring] Stratus CS) sensitive assay URL = 0.070ng/mL = 70pg/mL) and by the experimental
      highly sensitive assay (highly sensitive assay URL=0.0028 ng/mL = 2.8 pg/mL). None (0%), two
      (20%), and ten (100%) of the ten NSTEMI patients were found to be cTnI positive at
      presentation on the laboratory, sensitive, and highly sensitive assays, respectively. All 10
      patients measured at &gt;35pg/mL on the highly sensitive assay at presentation. Three of the
      patients remained &quot;cTnI negative&quot; for &gt;180 min on the current sensitive assay.

      In another research study, samples from 100 chest pain patients with known ACS (i.e., 50
      NSTEMI and 50 &quot;UA&quot; patients) were evaluated. Comparison was made between the laboratory
      device and the highly sensitive nano-assay with a URL of 0.0028 ng/mL (2.8 pg/mL). Using the
      current laboratory assay (Siemens [Dade Behring] Dimension; URL = 0.100 ng/mL = 100 pg/mL),
      the 50 NSTEMI patients were cTnI negative on the first draw, and the 50 &quot;UA&quot; patients were
      cTnI negative throughout their stay in the ED and/or hospital. At presentation (t = 0 hrs), 7
      hrs, and 24 hrs, none (0%) of the &quot;UA&quot; patients were found to be positive for cTnI on the
      laboratory instrument. Using the nano-assay with the same &quot;UA&quot; patients' serum samples, 48%,
      64%, and 82% were positive for cTnI at presentation, 2 hrs, and 7 hrs, respectively. For the
      NSTEMI patients at presentation (t = 0 hrs), 7 hrs, and 24 hrs, none (0%), 56%, and 98%,
      respectively, of the patients were found to be positive for cTnI on the laboratory
      instrument. Using the nano-assay with the same NSTEMI patients' serum, 76%, 98%, and 100%
      were positive for cTnI at presentation, 2 hrs, and 7 hrs, respectively.

      These preliminary results demonstrate the potential strength of this highly sensitive cTnI
      assay to reveal an abnormal [cTnI] at ED presentation that may progress to MI (i.e., NSTEMI
      or STEMI) and to detect acute ischemic insult that may not progress to MI (i.e., &quot;UA&quot;). This
      high sensitivity protein assay may enhance the clinical utility of testing for ACS in the ED
      and other cardiac care settings (e.g., earlier detection leading to directed therapies,
      improve risk stratification, earlier rule-out of non-cardiac-related chest pain [NCCP],
      detection of re-infarction).

      The definition of myocardial infarction used in this study will be the meaning that was
      recently updated and published in the November 27, 2007 issue of Circulation (Thygesen, et al
      2007). Page 18 of this study protocol contains this definition. The definition is based on
      cardiac troponin as the biomarker of choice with any value above the 99th percentile of an
      assay's reference range population considered abnormal. Therefore, if the nano-assay's URL is
      much lower than the current assay's URL, all values that are above the nano-assay's URL but
      below the current assay's URL that were considered &quot;UA&quot; on the current assay should now be
      considered myocardial infarction when measured on the nano-assay. This may result in the &quot;UA&quot;
      category being removed as an ACS categorization.

      There are also recent studies (Zethelius, et al 2006; Waxman, et al 2006) that show very low
      cTnI values (&lt;30-40 pg/mL) can predict future cardiac events and mortality in the
      asymptomatic elderly male population (&gt;70 years) and in symptomatic ED patients with cTnI
      levels that remain in the reference (normal) ranges of current assays. A highly sensitive
      assay that could detect &quot;silent&quot; cardiac damage in these cTnI ranges in the cardiologist's
      office and ED settings could be a predictor of future risk that could direct appropriate
      therapeutics and preventative care.
