  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immediately following birth, preterm infants face a period of stressful environmental inputs,
      which may have negative consequences on early brain development and subsequent
      neurobehavioral outcomes. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of training parents in
      reducing stressful experiences early in life. The investigators hypothesized that this
      intervention would insulate preterm infants from the harmful effects of acute and chronic
      stress, which in turn would result in enhanced brain development. The primary aim of the
      current study was to investigate if this intervention was associated with improved brain
      development measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at term-equivalent age. A secondary
      aim was to assess some possible short-term medical benefits.

      A randomized controlled trial of a parental sensitivity training program involving 45 women
      with infants born &lt; 30 weeks gestational age. The intervention consisted of 10 individual
      sessions in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Post-intervention, at term-equivalent
      age (40 weeks postmenstrual age), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed to evaluate
      brain structure and development. Quantitative volumetric techniques were used to estimate
      overall and regional brain volumes for different tissue types including cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF), cortical grey matter (CGM), deep nuclear grey matter (DNGM), unmyelinated white matter
      (UWM) and myelinated white matter (MWM). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to evaluate
      the integrity and maturation of white matter by apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and
      fractional anisotropy (FA).

    <description>The parent sensitivity training program was delivered in NICU (9 sessions) with a home-booster session. Therapists worked with parents following a manualized protocol. Targets of intervention included: recognizing signs of infant stress, &quot;shut-down&quot; mechanisms, alert-available behavior, motor behaviors, facial expressions,posture/muscle tone; graded stimulation; how to optimize interactions; touch, movement and massage; &quot;kangaroo care&quot; (nesting infants skin-to-skin against their mother); vocal, visual and multi-sensory stimulation; normalizing parental feelings; challenging dysfunctional thinking, and diary keeping.</description>
