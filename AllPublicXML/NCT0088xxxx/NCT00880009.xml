  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study of bosutinib administered in combination with letrozole versus
      letrozole alone in post-menopausal women with breast cancer. This is a 2-part study. Subjects
      in part 1 will receive bosutinib and letrozole daily, and will be closely monitored for 28
      days. The second part will proceed with subjects receiving a dose that is determined to be
      safe based on the safety evaluation of the first part. Eligible subjects will be randomly
      assigned to receive either bosutinib daily combined with daily letrozole, or daily letrozole
      alone for a specified period of time. Subjects will be followed up for survival after study
      drug discontinuation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was terminated on 19 April 2009 due to unfavorable risk benefit ratio of Bosutinib
      in combination with Letrozole including one confirmed Hy's law case. 37.5% of patients had
      treatment related liver events with the majority of severe events resulting in permanent
      study treatment discontinuation.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on Independent Radiologist</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 2 Baseline, every 8 weeks up to 2 to 6 weeks after last dose</time_frame>
    <description>Time in weeks from date of randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. PFS: calculated as (first event date minus the date of randomization plus 1) divided by 7. Tumor progression: determined from oncologic assessment data (where data meet the criteria for progressive disease [PD]), or from adverse event (AE) data (where the outcome was &quot;Death&quot;). PFS assessed by independent radiologist was to be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 1 Baseline up to 28 days after the last dose</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 2 Baseline, every 8 weeks up to 2 to 6 weeks after last dose</time_frame>
    <description>Time in weeks from date of randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. PFS: calculated as (first event date minus the date of randomization plus 1) divided by 7. Tumor progression: determined from oncologic assessment data (where data meet the criteria for PD), or from AE data (where the outcome was &quot;Death&quot;). PFS assessed by investigator was to be reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 2 Baseline, every 8 weeks up to 2 to 6 weeks after last dose</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with objective response based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Confirmed PR defined as greater than or equal to &gt;=30 percent (%) decrease in sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD according to RECIST. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study &gt;=4 weeks after initial documentation of response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 2 Baseline until death or up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time in weeks from randomization to date of death due to any cause. OS was calculated as (the death date minus the date of randomization plus 1) divided by 7. Death was determined from adverse event data (where outcome was death) or from follow-up contact data (where the participant current status was death).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 2 Baseline, every 8 weeks up to 2 to 6 weeks after last dose</time_frame>
    <description>Time in weeks from the first documentation of objective tumor response to objective tumor progression or death due to any cancer. Duration of tumor response was calculated as (the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to cancer minus the date of the first CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed plus 1) divided by 7. DR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response.</description>

    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer (FACT-B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 2 Baseline, Week 12, 24, 52, 2-6 weeks after the last dose</time_frame>
    <description>FACT-B is used for assessment of health-related quality of life (QoL) in participants with breast cancer. It consists of 36 items, summarized to 5 subscales: physical (7 items), functional (7 items), social/family (7 items); all 3 ranged from 0 to 28, emotional (6 items) ranging from 0 to 24, and additional concerns on breast cancer subscale (9 items) ranging from 0 to 36; high subscale score represents a better QoL. All single-item measures ranges from 0='Not at all' to 4='Very much'. Total possible score ranged from 0 to 144. High scale score represents a better QoL.</description>
