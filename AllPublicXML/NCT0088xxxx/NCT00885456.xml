    <textblock>
      The objective of the Program of Rehabilitative Exercise and Education to avert Vascular
      Events after Non-disabling stroke and Transient ischemic attack (PREVENT) Trial is to
      determine whether the timely delivery of secondary stroke prevention strategies will reduce
      modifiable vascular risk factors in two groups of people who have survived NDS or TIA. One
      group will receive a comprehensive education and exercise program (PREVENT); the other group
      will receive usual care (USUAL CARE). We will measure modifiable vascular risk factors in
      both groups. We will also compare the effects of PREVENT vs USUAL CARE on exercise capacity,
      walking endurance, and daily physical activity. In addition, we will compare thinking
      ability, depression, achievement of personal goals for healthy behavior, and health-related
      goal attainment and health-related quality of life. Finally, we will compare outcomes in
      urban and rural settings as well as costs of the PREVENT program and USUAL CARE in order to
      assess sustainability of the PREVENT program.
