      The study is being conducted to explore the safety and effectiveness of a new chemical
      entity, BGC20-1531, in subjects with a history of migraine. In this study subjects will treat
      a total of three migraine attacks with two different doses of BGC20-1531 and placebo, with at
      least one week wash out period between doses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine headache is estimated to affect 10-20% of the world population and is listed by the
      World Health Organisation in the top 20 causes of disabling conditions, and in the top four
      neurological disabling conditions. The most common therapies for acute migraine are
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and triptans. However, many migraine sufferers
      do not experience sufficient relief from these treatments or cannot tolerate their
      gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and other side-effects.

      Prostaglandin PGE2-induced sensory nerve sensitisation, neuropeptide release and cerebral
      vascular dilatation is thought to underlie migraine pain, particularly via activation of the
      EP4 receptor subtype. BGC20-1531 is an orally available EP4 receptor antagonist which
      inhibits prostaglandin-induced vasodilation of cranial blood vessels via a selective blockade
      of EP4 receptors reducing inflammation and migraine pain. As EP4 receptors are discretely
      localised, the overall safety profile of EP4 receptor antagonists may be improved compared to
      triptans and NSAIDs.
