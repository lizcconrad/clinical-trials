      The rapid and durable remission of type II diabetes mellitis following the gastric bypass
      operation challenges the current concepts about the etiology of the disease. The surgery,
      which excludes food from the stomach, duodenum, and proximal jejunum, is quickly followed by
      a durable drop in glucose and insulin levels. As a result, 4 out of 5 diabetic, morbidly
      obese individuals who undergo the operation return to a long-term euglycemia with a
      prolongation of life and a reduction of health care costs.

      The investigators at East Carolina University and those at Johnson and Johnson propose to
      further complete the profile of the upper gut by extending their observation to three
      additional human models. The investigators will study patients having the gastric band
      procedure, the gastric sleeve procedure, and those who have a gastric bypass but have a PEG
      tube inserted later.
