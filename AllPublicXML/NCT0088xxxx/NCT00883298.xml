      Primary objective - to determine the 6-month progression free survival (PFS) of adult
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme/gliosarcoma treated with bi-weekly
      temozolomide plus (Avastin) bevacizumab.

      Secondary objectives - to determine radiographic response including specialized MRI
      sequences, safety and overall survival of adult patients with with recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme/gliosarcoma treated with bi-weekly temozolomide plus bevacizumab (Avastin).
      Additionally, tumor DNA (MGMT) analysis as it relates to survival will be evaluated.

      This is a phase II study of the combination of Avastin and temozolomide for patients with
      recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Avastin is administered intravenously at a dose of 10
      mg/kg on days 1 and 15 every 28 days and temozolomide is administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2
      on days 1-5 and 15-19 every 28 days (one cycle). Patients will have a baseline MRI, an MRI
      scan after the first cycle and every other cycle after that. If there is no evidence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, patients will receive one year of therapy. If
      there is evidence of added benefit (eg: tumor regression), patients can stay on treatment
      longer than one year, per investigator discretion.
