  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if automated telephone monitoring will enhance existing
      quitline services, such as Alere Wellbeing's Quit For Life program, and help people quit
      smoking. If successful, this intervention could be incorporated into existing quitline
      protocols and delivered to millions of people who are trying to quit smoking.
