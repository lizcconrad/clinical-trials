  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MDMA releases dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine in the brain. Serotonin uptake
      inhibitors have been shown to interact with 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and to
      decrease its psychoactive and cardiovascular stimulant effects. This finding indicates that
      MDMA acts in part by releasing serotonin through the serotonin uptake site. However, in vitro
      studies show that MDMA binds more potently to the norepinephrine uptake site that to the the
      serotonin or dopamine uptake transporter. In addition, norepinephrine uptake site blockers
      such antidepressant drugs attenuate some of the behavioral effects of MDMA in animals. These
      preclinical data indicate that norepinephrine may also contribute to the response to MDMA in
      humans. To test this hypothesis this study evaluates the interacting effects of the selective
      norepinephrine transporter inhibitor reboxetine on the subjective and cardiovascular
      stimulant effects of MDMA in healthy volunteers.

      The study will use a randomized double-blind cross-over design with four experimental
      sessions. Reboxetine (8 mg) or placebo will be administered the night before the experimental
      session and 1 h before the administration of MDMA (125 mg) or placebo to 16 healthy
      volunteers. Subjective and cardiovascular responses and plasma samples for pharmacokinetics
      will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments.

      We hypothesize that the highly selective norepinephrine uptake inhibitor reboxetine will
      attenuate subjective and especially heart rate and blood pressure responses to MDMA. Such a
      result would indicate that norepinephrine is critically involved in the pharmacology of MDMA
      and may provide helpful in the use and development of treatments for Ecstasy intoxications.
