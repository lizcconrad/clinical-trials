        Patients that are scheduled for a biopsy at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. The patients

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a lesion on mammogram, ultrasound or breast MRI that measured &lt; 15 mm in
             diameter, is considered suggestive or highly suggestive of malignancy according to the
             Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System Atlas criteria (BIRADS 4b, 4c or 5), and is
             scheduled for biopsy (needle biopsy and/or surgical biopsy).

        OR

          -  Have a lesion on mammogram, ultrasound or breast MRI that measured &gt; 15 mm in
             diameter, is known to be malignant and is scheduled for surgery.

          -  Patient age &gt; 18 years of age.

          -  Have a negative pregnancy test on the first day of the study, or must be
             postmenopausal or surgically sterilized.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded if they have a small lesion (&lt; 15 mm) and have undergone
             prior needle biopsy of the lesion (such biopsy may effectively remove all or part of
             the lesion and angiogenesis associated with wound healing might confound imaging
             results with 99mTc-NC100692).

          -  Patient's pregnancy is not negative on the first day of the study, or the patient is
             unable to complete the pregnancy test

          -  Patient is unable to sit on a chair for 40 minutes
