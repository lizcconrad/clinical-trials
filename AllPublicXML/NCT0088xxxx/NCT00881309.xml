      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  To access the efficacy of TW compared to Aza in the maintenance therapy for lupus
           nephritis

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of TW versus Aza in the maintenance therapy
           for lupus nephritis

      Tripterygium (TW) is a Chinese traditional patent drugs in treating chronic
      glomerulonephritis. It has been used to treat lupus nephritis for many years with less side
      effects. We compare the efficacy and safety of TW vs Aza in the maintenance therapy of lupus
      nephritis.
