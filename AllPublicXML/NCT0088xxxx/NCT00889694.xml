    <textblock>
      This study is a 12-week, randomized, placebo and positive drug controlled clinical trial to
      investigate whether tripterygium capsule is effective and safe in treating patients with
      ankylosing spondylitis. The investigators expect that the tripterygium capsule is more
      effective than placebo and has few adverse effects.
