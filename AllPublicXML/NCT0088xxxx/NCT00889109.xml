  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder dislocations are common and may result in functionally disabling instability.
      Disruption of the shoulder capsuloligamentous complex during shoulder dislocation is related
      to poor proprioceptive and stabilizing capabilities of the joint. It has been demonstrated
      that surgical restoration of the normal glenohumeral capsular tensioning improves the
      proprioceptive capability of the shoulder and plays an important roll in restoring shoulder
      stability.

      Several studies compared the proprioceptive capabilities of the shoulder between different
      surgical procedures, however only few have used the &quot;dynamic unrestricted 3-dimensional arm
      movement model&quot; that has been shown to be more appropriate for assessment of glenohumeral
      proprioception. To our knowledge, no previous study has compared proprioception measures of
      the glenohumeral joint following arthroscopic versus open repair for anterior shoulder
      instability, using the 3-dimensional unrestricted arm movement model.
