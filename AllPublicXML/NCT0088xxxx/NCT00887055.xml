  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the morphology (shape) of the intracardiac
      electrograms(EGM) from patients with a resynchronization therapy device.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      morphology of EGM during loss of capture in either right ventricle (RV) or left ventricle
      (LV) at different AV delays and LV offsets and during exercise. These EGM signals will be
      used to design and develop improved automatic threshold and automatic capture algorithms for
      CRT defibrillators (CRT-D). As well, the data collected from the study will be used to to
      develop other automatic algorithms for CRT-D, such as pacing parameter optimization.
