    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well elesclomol sodium and paclitaxel work in treating
      patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer
      that has returned after a period of improvement (recurrent) or is persistent. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as elesclomol sodium and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Elesclomol sodium may also help paclitaxel work better by
      making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the antitumor activity of elesclomol (elesclomol sodium) and paclitaxel in
      patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer
      primarily through the frequency of objective tumor responses.

      II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of elesclomol and paclitaxel in this
      cohort of patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
      elesclomol and paclitaxel.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and elesclomol sodium IV over 1
      hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: Patients who are currently on treatment must not be dosed with elesclomol sodium after
      12/31/2015. All other study procedures, with the exception of elesclomol sodium
      administration and paclitaxel administration, should continue in accordance with protocol
      requirements. Any treatment given after 12/31/2015, including continuation of paclitaxel,
      will be considered off study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

               -  Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: serous
                  adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma,
                  undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial

          -  All patients must have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria
             in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1; measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be
             recorded); each lesion must be &gt;= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT),
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or &gt;= 20 mm
             when measured by chest x-ray; lymph nodes must be &gt;= 15 mm in short axis when measured
             by CT or MRI

          -  Patients must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess response on this
             protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be
             designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is
             obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation
             therapy

          -  Patients must not be eligible for a higher priority Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)
             protocol, if one exists; in general, this would refer to any active GOG phase III
             protocol for the same patient population

          -  Patients must have a GOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          -  Patients must have baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels =&lt; 0.8 x upper limit of

               -  Patients should be free of active infection requiring antibiotics (with the
                  exception of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [UTI])

               -  Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at
                  least one week prior to registration

               -  Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including biological and
                  immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to
                  registration

          -  Prior therapy

               -  Patients must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for
                  management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another
                  organoplatinum compound; this initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal
                  therapy, high-dose therapy, consolidation, non-cytotoxic agents or extended
                  therapy administered after surgical or non-surgical assessment

               -  Patients must have NOT received any additional cytotoxic chemotherapy for
                  management of recurrent or persistent disease, including retreatment with initial
                  chemotherapy regimens; (Note: optimal evaluation of the safety and efficacy of
                  new chemotherapy regimens is best performed in patients with minimal prior
                  therapy; non-investigational therapy, such as retreatment with platinum and/or
                  paclitaxel, is non-curative in the setting of recurrent disease, and can
                  generally be safely administered to patients following participation in a phase
                  II trial)

               -  Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, one additional
                  non-cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease according
                  to the following definition:

               -  Non-cytotoxic (biologic or cytostatic) agents include (but are not limited to)

                  signal transduction

               -  Patients must be considered platinum resistant or refractory according to
                  standard GOG criteria, i.e., have had a treatment-free interval following
                  platinum of less than 6 months, or have progressed during platinum-based therapy

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/mcl

          -  Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcl

          -  Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN

          -  Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) less
             than or equal to 3 x ULN

          -  Alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN

          -  Neurologic function: neuropathy (sensory and motor) less than or equal to Common

          -  Cautions and prohibited medications/treatments

               -  Since elesclomol is a substrate for cytochrome P450 family 2, subfamily C,
                  polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9), cytochrome P450 family 2, subfamily D, polypeptide 6
                  (CYP2D6), cytochrome P450 family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 19 (CYP2C19), and

             also excluded if their previous cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy

          -  Patients who have received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity
             or pelvis OTHER THAN for the treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
