  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, controlled, repeat dose, single center
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeat application of RT001 in at least 30
      subjects with moderate to severe lateral canthal lines. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio (RT001 Dose A or vehicle control).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female/male ages 30 to 55

          2. Bilateral lateral canthal lines rated as moderate or advanced.

          3. Willing to refrain from any product that affects skin remodeling or a product that may
             cause an active dermal response in the treatment area beginning at screening through
             Week 6.

          4. Women of child baring potential must practice and be willing to continue to use an
             effective method of birth control.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Muscle weakness or paralysis in the area receiving treatment.

          2. Active skin disease or irritation at treatment areas.

          3. Undergone any procedures that may affect the lateral canthal region during the past 12
             months prior to screening.

          4. Previous treatment with botulinum toxin (any serotype) in the head or neck area within
             9 months prior to Baseline (Day 0).

          5. Use of topical steroid on either of the treatment areas or use of medications that
             suppress the immune system 30 days prior to screening and continuing through End of
             Study (Week 6).

          6. Any abnormality on the electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening or any history of
             clinically significant arrhythmia, unstable angina, myocardial infarction or
             congestive hear failure.
