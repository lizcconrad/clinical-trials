    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center study to evaluate the use of CopiOs Pericardium Membrane,
      a bovine xenograft, with use of Puros Cancellous Particulate Allograft, for the augmentation
      of localized alveolar ridge defects on either the maxilla or mandible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the use of CopiOs Pericardium Membrane (CopiOs Pericardium), a bovine
      xenograft, with the use of Puros Cancellous Particulate Allograft (Puros Cancellous), a
      mineralized allograft, for the augmentation of localized alveolar ridge defects in edentulous
      sites. The purpose of the study will be to determine placement time, ease of use, stability,
      esthetics and to clinically evaluate the efficacy of the list products. A biopsy will be
      taken from a subset of the patient population, at one investigational site, to evaluate the
      grafted site's formation of new bone. The study hypothesis is that if CopiOs Pericardium and
      Puros Cancellous are used, the a single, localized alveolar ridge defect will clinically
      improve at an edentulous site.

    <description>The primary outcome measure of the study was the average change in ridge width from baseline (pre operative/pre grafting) to 6 months post surgery. The ridge measurements were taken using ridge mapping calipers and recorded for each patient at baseline and 6 months. Baseline measurements were taken at the site of greatest ridge width deficiency as determined by the investigator and repeated at the same location for subsequent measurements. A radiographic template with a radiopaque foil was utilized to standardize clinical and radiographic measurements for each patient.</description>

          -  Patients taking steroid medications or undergoing other immunosuppressive therapy

             candidate for this study or which are contraindicated in the Directions for Use.

          -  Note: Careful consideration should be given to alternative therapies prior to
             performing bone grafting in patients who have severe endocrine-induced bone diseases
             (e.g.hyperparathyroidism), or who are undergoing current therapy with drugs that

        <title>Change in Horizontal Ridge Widths From Baseline to 6 Months</title>
        <description>The primary outcome measure of the study was the average change in ridge width from baseline (pre operative/pre grafting) to 6 months post surgery. The ridge measurements were taken using ridge mapping calipers and recorded for each patient at baseline and 6 months. Baseline measurements were taken at the site of greatest ridge width deficiency as determined by the investigator and repeated at the same location for subsequent measurements. A radiographic template with a radiopaque foil was utilized to standardize clinical and radiographic measurements for each patient.</description>
