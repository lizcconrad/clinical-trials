      The purpose of this research study is to determine if it is possible to deliver high dose
      radiation in one week while also giving the drug capecitabine for the treatment of pancreatic
      cancer prior to surgery, to determine if this treatment can be given safely for the treatment
      of pancreatic cancer prior to surgery and, to determine if this treatment can improve the
      local control pancreatic cancer prior to surgery compared to historical controls of standard
      treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Phase I: To determine the feasibility and tolerability of radiation therapy for
           pancreatic cancer delivered with high dose external beam radiation in a one week
           accelerated schedule with concurrent capecitabine

        -  Phase II: To demonstrate a grade 3 or greater (any) toxicity rate of less than 20%

      Secondary

        -  To determine local control and recurrence patterns of pancreatic cancer relative to a
           standard regimen of 50.4 Gy as seen in historical controls

        -  To determine the pathologic response rate

        -  To determine the progression-free survival

        -  To determine the surgical morbidity

        -  To determine 30-day post-operative mortality after pancreatic resection

    <measure>Neoadjuvant Short-Course Photon Radiation Therapy Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) [Phase I]</measure>
    <time_frame>within 3 weeks of the start of chemoradiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Neoadjuvant short-course photon radiation therapy MTD in combination with capecitabine 825 mg/m2 orally BID for ten consecutive weekdays, beginning on the morning of the first day of radiation therapy is determined by the number of patients who experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). See subsequent primary outcome measure for the DLT definition. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which fewer than one-third of patients experience a DLT. If none of 3 initial patients or only 1 of 6 patients have a DLT on dose level 3 then 6 additional patients are treated at this dose. If during this expansion, the rate of DLT exceeds 30% then the next lower dose level is declared the MTD. If no DLTs are observed, the MTD is not reached.</description>

    <measure>Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) [Phase I]</measure>
    <time_frame>within 3 weeks of the start of chemoradiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>DLT occurring within 3 weeks of the start of chemoradiation therapy was defined as: Grade 3 non-hematologic or hematologic toxicity requiring interruption of &gt;7 days (d) of chemo or &gt;3d chemoradiation; Grade 4 non-hematologic; Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia; Treatment-related death; Delays in surgery &gt;3 weeks due to treatment-related toxicity. A 30% increase in any surgical complication rate beyond those previously established rates (readmission rate: 16%; pancreatic fistula/intra-abdominal abscess/infection rate: 27%, major intra-abdominal bleeding requiring return to OR: 1.6%, delayed gastric emptying: 4.4%, and superficial wound infection rate: 8%) was also considered a DLT.</description>

    <measure>Grade 3-5 Toxicity Rate [Phase II]</measure>
    <time_frame>within 3 weeks of the start of chemoradiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>All Grade 3-5 events based on CTCAEv3 related to the accelerated dose (attribution possible, probable, definite) as reported on case report forms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Local Recurrence Rate [Phase II]</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was assessed radiologically at baseline and after treatment every 6 months for first 2 years and annually in years 3-5.</time_frame>
    <description>Local recurrence rate is defined as the proportion of patients with evidence of tumor recurrence within the radiation field based on RECIST criteria. Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or appearance of new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pathologic Response Rate [Phase II]</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed after resection; Patients underwent resection of their pancreatic cancer up to 3 weeks after completion of chemoradiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Pathologic response rate is the proportion of patients with the pathologic specimen absent any viable tumor cell. Pathological review of the pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen will be performed according to the AJCC Staging Classification, 6th edition. Initial gross evaluation and identification of resection margins will be performed jointly by the surgeon and the pathologist.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) [Phase II]</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was assessed radiologically at baseline and after treatment every 6 months for first 2 years and annually in years 3-5.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time from study entry to documented disease progression (PD) or death. Per RECIST 1.0 criteria: progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. Patients alive whose disease had not progressed are censored at date of last disease evaluation</description>

It was recommended that patients undergoing R0 or R1 resections receive adjuvant treatment with 4-6 cycles of gemcitabine-based therapy per institutional policy, to start 4 to 10 weeks after the operation.</description>

        <description>Neoadjuvant short-course photon radiation therapy MTD in combination with capecitabine 825 mg/m2 orally BID for ten consecutive weekdays, beginning on the morning of the first day of radiation therapy is determined by the number of patients who experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). See subsequent primary outcome measure for the DLT definition. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which fewer than one-third of patients experience a DLT. If none of 3 initial patients or only 1 of 6 patients have a DLT on dose level 3 then 6 additional patients are treated at this dose. If during this expansion, the rate of DLT exceeds 30% then the next lower dose level is declared the MTD. If no DLTs are observed, the MTD is not reached.</description>

Chemotherapy:
Capecitabine was given orally 825 mg/m2 BID (total 1650 mg/m2 per day) for ten consecutive weekdays, beginning on the morning of the first day of radiation therapy.
Patients underwent resection of their pancreatic cancer 1-3 weeks after the completion of chemoradiation. It was recommended that patients undergoing R0 or R1 resections receive adjuvant treatment with 4-6 cycles of gemcitabine-based therapy per institutional policy, to start 4 to 10 weeks after the operation.</description>

        <description>Progression-free survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time from study entry to documented disease progression (PD) or death. Per RECIST 1.0 criteria: progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. Patients alive whose disease had not progressed are censored at date of last disease evaluation</description>
