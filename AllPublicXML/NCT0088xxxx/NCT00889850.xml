  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will be conducted in order to compare the bioavailability of 40 mg
      Esomeprazole Mepha (Mepha Ltd., Switzerland) and of INexium 40 mg MUPS tablets (AstraZeneca,
      France) under single dose fasted and fed conditions.

      The study will be conducted as a combined single dose study under fasted and fed conditions
      in a 2x2-period cross-over design with a wash out phase of at least 6 treatment-free days
      between administrations.

      -  The primary objective of the single dose fasted part of the study is to compare the rate
           and extent of absorption of esomeprazole from 40 mg Esomeprazole Mepha capsules (Test)
           with 40 mg Esomeprazole INexium MUPS tablets (Reference) after single dose
           administration under fasted conditions, determined by use of AUC0-tlast and Cmax
           obtained from esomeprazole plasma concentrations.

        -  The primary objective of the single dose fed in combination with the fasted part of the
           study is to compare the maximum concentration of esomeprazole determined after 40 mg
           Esomeprazole Mepha capsules (Test) single dose administration under fed conditions in
           comparison with 40 mg Esomeprazole INexium MUPS tablets (Reference) after single dose
           administration under fasted and fed conditions.
