  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As HIV/AIDS is spreading in malaria-endemic countries, many patients here will need
      concomitant treatment for both infections. Effective combination treatments are available for
      both malaria (artemisinin-based combination treatments, ACTs) and HIV/AIDS (antiretroviral
      combination treatments, ARTs), and these treatments are presently recommended for concomitant
      use by ministries of health in many endemic countries, including Tanzania. However,
      theoretically some of these drugs may be involved in harmful interactions with each other, as
      they share common cytochrome enzymes involved in their metabolism. Such interactions could
      lead to less effective treatments and/or adverse effects, as a consequence of reduced or
      increased drug levels, respectively. Only little clinical and pharmacological information is
      however yet available to guide clinicians and policy-makers on this issue.

      The main aim of the InterACT study in Tanzania is to conduct a series of detailed
      observational studies of clinical and paraclinical safety, therapeutic efficacy and
      pharmacokinetic interactions between the currently nationally recommended first-line
      treatment for malaria, artemether-lumefantrine, and first-line antiretroviral treatments,
      primarily nevirapine-based combinations, for HIV/AIDS. The studies will be conducted among
      patients with uncomplicated malaria, who attend the HIV/AIDS Care and Treatment Clinic and
      Muheza Designated District Hospital in Muheza, north-eastern Tanzania, which is an area
      characterized by intense transmission of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and with a prevalence
      of HIV around 8-10%. The study is expected to inform guidelines for the treatment of malaria
      in patients with HIV/AIDS in Tanzania, and elsewhere.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with confirmed P. falciparum infection in the
             presence of either measured fever (&gt; 37.5Â°C) or a history of fever within the previous
             24 hours; for HIV-positive patients also afebrile patients are eligible in the
             presence of other symptoms of malaria (e.g., coughing, diarrhea, headache, nausea,
             body weakness, body pain).

          -  Not being pregnant or lactating.

          -  Absence of history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions to any of the
             study medicines being evaluated.

          -  For HIV-positive patients on cART, successful adherence to treatment without prominent
             adverse events for a period of a minimum of six weeks prior to the date of enrollment
             will be required.

          -  Easy access to the health facility (travel time &lt; 1 hour) and the ability to attend
             the stipulated follow-up visits.

          -  Informed consent provided by the patient or by a parent/guardian

             disease).
