      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting
      toxicity of liposomal paclitaxel plus capecitabine in Chinese patients with advanced gastric
      carcinoma.

      There are clinical trials showed that taxane is optional for the treatment of gastric cancer.
      Liposomal paclitaxel has different pharmacokinetic features comparing with conventional
      taxane. This study is designed to find the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity
      of liposomal paclitaxel combined with capecitabine in Chinese patients with advanced gastric
      carcinoma.
