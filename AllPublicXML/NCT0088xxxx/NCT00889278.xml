      The purpose of this study is to determine if higher absolute lymphocyte count in the infused
      stem cell autograft (A-ALC) will lead to an improved antibody response to post-transplant
      immunization with Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine and permit effective immunization at 6
      months post-transplant in lymphoma patients receiving Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell
      Transplantation.

      Infectious diseases remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who receive
      high-dose chemotherapy followed by Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation
      (APBSCT). Infectious disease complications of transplantation might be reduced by effective
      post-transplant immunization but reconstitution of the immune system may take months to years
      after transplantation and responses to immunization are often attenuated in this setting.
      Correlates of improved immune reconstitution and response to immunization after
      transplantation would be important to identify. It has been recently shown that higher
      absolute lymphocyte count in the infused stem cell autograft (A-ALC) and higher ALC at day
      +15 after stem cell infusion (ALC-15) are independently associated with improved overall
      survival after APBSCT. The mechanism of this association is unclear, but this finding
      suggests that improved immune responses to immunization might also be achieved with this
      approach making it possible to immunize at 6 months instead of at one year. This hypothesis
      has never been evaluated.

      Survival following APBSCT is improved with a higher A-ALC and ALC-15. It is postulated that
      the higher lymphocyte numbers correlate with improved immune surveillance and destruction of
      minimal residual disease. Thus, one must consider the probability higher A-ALC will confer
      improved response to T-cell dependent immunization early after transplant.
