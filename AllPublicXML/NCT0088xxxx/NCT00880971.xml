  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several important international randomized trials have shown that postoperative chemotherapy
      contributed to the improvement on 5 year survival rate by about 4% for patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer after complete resection. But the overall survival rate was
      relatively low and the local recurrence was still the dominant failure pattern for stage IIIA
      (N2) disease even these patients received the postoperative chemotherapy. Several
      meta-analyses have shown that postoperative radiotherapy has no effect on the survival
      improvement for patients with non-small lung cancer after complete resection. However,
      sub-group analysis based on the same dataset of these meta-analyses showed that the
      postoperative radiotherapy with conventional radiotherapy might be beneficial for stage IIIA
      (N2) disease. The 3D conform radiotherapy can increase the radiation dose to the target
      volume while decreasing the dose to risk organs comparing with the conventional radiotherapy.
      So it is expected that postoperative 3D conform radiotherapy after postoperative chemotherapy
      will improve the local control and overall survival rate for stage IIIA (N2) non-small cell
      lung cancer. Here, the investigators designed a phase III randomized trial to compare the
      three years overall and disease free survival rate in patients with completely resected stage
      IIIA (N2) non-small cell lung cancer who receive the chemotherapy alone or the chemotherapy
      plus 3D conform radiotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary: To determine whether administering chemotherapy (four cycles of NP regimen) plus 3D
      conform thoracic radiotherapy (50 Gy, 2 Gy once daily over 5 weeks) will improve 3-year
      survival compared with chemotherapy (four cycles of NP regimen) alone in patients with
      completely resected stage IIIA (N2) non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary: To compare treatment-related toxic effects, failure-free survival, and the
      patterns of failure.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study. Patients are stratified according to
      histology (squamous cell vs other), number of mediastinum lymph nodes, and whether N2 disease
      has been diagnosed before operation.

      Arm I: Patients undergo 3D conform thoracic radiotherapy (50 Gy, 2 Gy once daily over 5
      weeks) after postoperative chemotherapy of four cycles of NP regimen.

      Arm II: Patients undergo postoperative chemotherapy of four cycles of NP regimen.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6
      months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
