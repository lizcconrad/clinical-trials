  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to determine whether regular endurance exercise and/or body weight influence
      the way our nervous and vascular systems respond during the metabolism of meals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To begin to examine this question we recruited healthy endurance-trained (high fit, HF) and
      normally active (average fit, AF) subjects. It is well characterized that chronic endurance
      training results in enhanced peripheral insulin sensitivity. Therefore, our rationale was
      that inclusion of two healthy subject groups, with distinct differences in insulin
      sensitivity, would allow us to investigate how enhanced insulin sensitivity influences
      insulin-mediated changes in central sympathetic outflow. Direct measurements of central
      sympathetic outflow to skeletal muscle (i.e., MSNA) were recorded, and a mixed meal was used
      as a physiological method to evoke robust and sustained increases in MSNA, which have been
      primarily attributed to insulin. We hypothesized that HF subjects would have a greater MSNA
      response, for a given plasma insulin concentration, following consumption of a mixed meal
      (i.e., greater central insulin sensitivity).
