      The purpose of this study is:

        -  To determine the accuracy of intraarticular placement with the transpatellar tendon
           approach as compared to the suprapatellar approach. Patients undergoing knee arthroscopy
           will be consented for study of the injection of the fluid into the joint prior to portal
           placement or commencement of knee replacement. Patients will be randomized to receive
           injections via the transpatellar tendon or superolateral approach. Using injectable
           contrast and fluoroscopy, the placement of injections into the knee will be evaluated
           for accuracy. Injection attempts with contrast fluid that uniformly coats the articular
           surface on sagittal and coronal radiographs will be counted as successful. A
           concentration of contrast fluid in extraarticular fat will be counted as a failure.

      Hypothesis: The rate of accuracy of intraarticular placement of the needle tip via the
      transpatellar tendon approach to knee aspiration is greater than that of the superolateral
      approach.

        -  To determine the distribution of contrast material with the transpatellar tendon and
           superolateral apporaches. Using a previously described evaluation technique of dividing
           the knee into seven compartments, sagittal and coronal fluoroscopy images will be
           evaluated to determine the distribution of contrast fluid.

      Hypothesis: Contrast injected into the knee via the trasnpatellar tendon approach will
      penetrate as many compartments of the knee as contrast injected via the superolateral
      approach.
