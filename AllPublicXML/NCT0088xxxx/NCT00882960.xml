    <textblock>
      Goal of the research will be to demonstrate a reduction in reported pain following the
      atomization and intra-nasal administration of Fentanyl versus the reduction in pain achieved
      from intravenous Fentanyl. It is hypothesized that pain should be reduced following fentanyl
      administration using the intra-nasal atomization equal to the intravenous delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, pre-hospital providers have the ability to administer analgesia to patients
      through only intravenous routes. Often times patients have been exposed to the elements,
      present with poor anatomy, or are in such a position that makes establishing intravenous
      impractical or impossible. The lack of delivery method than prevents the patients from
      receiving humane and indicated pain medication. In patients who access is achieved, they are
      first subjected to a painful procedure that often will be repeated within twenty-four hours
      by most hospital policies and than subjects them to potential infection risk, being often
      times in less than aseptic conditions.

      The goal of the study will be to test the method of administration of pain medication using
      atomization through an intra-nasal route as compared to the current standard of drug
      administration intravenous. The medication to be administered will be Fentanyl, a previously
      established and approved pre-hospital analgesic medication. As with any drug there are
      potential risks associated with unknown side effects or allergies, the risk would not be
      enhanced given the use of a different delivery device. Specific risks associated with the use
      of this delivery route would include but not be limited to potential soft tissue injuries,
      epistaxis, and aspiration

      The study will measure reduction in pain following the delivery of atomized fentanyl via
      intra-nasal administration as compared with intravenous. We will ask participants to quantify
      their pain using the Wong-Baker FACES pain scale (previously established valid instrument of
      pain assessment) and assign a number to the pain they are feeling. The drug will than be
      administered using the atomizer and two subsequent reports of pain using the same scale will
      be taken along with vital signs.
