        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men or women 18 years of age or older

          2. Confirmed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type I or II (both, insulin or non-insulin
             dependent)

          3. Subjects who have moderate to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), as
             defined by ETDRS criteria, and diffuse DME within 300 microns from the center of the
             macula in the study eye (with or without cystoid changes) confirmed by FA.

          4. Retinal thickness must be at least 250 microns in the central subfield, as shown by
             OCT

          5. Best-corrected visual acuity between 60 and 15 letters measured with ETDRS charts
             (approximately 20/63 to 20/500 with Snellen charts)

          6. Woman of child-bearing potential must not be pregnant or lactating, must have a
             negative pregnancy test at screening (serum). Both men and women are required to
             practice an adequate method of birth control

          7. Able and willing to sign an approved informed consent form and return for all
             scheduled study visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with macular or perimacular edema secondary to an etiology other than
             diabetes mellitus

          2. Subjects with concurrent retinal diseases or conditions in the study eye (including
             conditions requiring urgent PRP), glaucoma (or ocular hypertension), retinal vascular
             occlusion, exudative age-related macular degeneration (drusen permitted), tear (rip)
             of the retinal pigment epithelium, a vitelliform-like lesion of the outer retina (e.g.
             pattern dystrophies or basal laminar drusen), idiopathic parafoveal telangiectasis or
             retinal-lesion anastomosis

          3. Subjects who have any additional ocular disease or condition which could compromise
             treatment safety, visual acuity or interfere with assessment of the macular edema,
             such as ocular inflammation, amblyopia, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, media
             opacity, cataract

          4. Subjects who have diffuse DME with severe capillary non-perfusion (avascular zone
             diameter &gt;1,000 microns)

          5. Allergy to fluorescein dye

          6. Subjects who had intraocular surgery, photocoagulation, intravitreal or subfoveal
             injection, topical or systemic steroids or who received any experimental treatment as
             part of another clinical trial within the last 3 months of the study start (in case of
             Anecortave within the last 6 months, any panretinal photocoagulation prior to study
             start)

          7. Subjects with uncontrolled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin Hb A1c &gt;12%)

          8. Subjects with systolic blood pressure higher than 180 mm Hg or diastolic above 100 mm
             Hg, with or without anti-hypertensive treatment

          9. Subjects with congestive heart disease or any unstable cardiac condition

         10. Subjects with clinically significantly impaired renal function (serum creatinine &gt;2.0
             mg/dL) and/or moderate to severe hepatic impairment (subjects with &gt;2.5 times the
             upper limit of the normal range for aspartate transaminase [AST], alanine transaminase
             [ALT], or total bilirubin)
