    <description>Participants assigned to fill out the e-PAQ-PF prior to their clinic visit. Participants will arrive early to clinic appointment and fill out e-PAQ-PF. Results will be given to clinician and participant. After their visit they will complete the post visit questionnaire.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants assigned to complete the e-PAQ-PF after their clinic visit. Pre-visit participants will sign consent form - but otherwise will receive no study interventions. Post-visit they will fill out e-PAQ-PF and post visit questionnaire.</description>

    <description>Participants will fill out the e-PAQ-PF prior to their clinic visit. The e-PAQ-PF has 4 dimensions (urinary, bowel, vaginal, sexual) and asks about symptoms severity, bother of symptoms, and impact on quality of life. A copy of the results will be given to their clinician and the participant.</description>
