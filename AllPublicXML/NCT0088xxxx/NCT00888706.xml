  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether individualized social activities, physical
      resistance training and walking, and a combination of both are effective in improving
      nighttime sleep in elders with dementia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elders with cognitive impairment usually do not a get a good night's sleep and wake up often
      during their sleep at night. Increased daytime individualized social activity and physical
      resistance training with walking have the potential to increase nighttime sleep in elders.
      This can lead to a better quality of life, a decrease in caregiver burden and decrease in
      nighttime falls for this population and associated fiscal savings.

      Consent forms for this RCT, were written in large print, followed all the guidelines of the
      Institutional Review Board of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, and assured
      the participants that their participation in the study was voluntary.

    <description>The group participated in high intensity PRT to the hip and arm extensors (three sets of eight repetitions per muscle per group, approximately 40 minutes) plus 10 minutes of warm-up and 10 minutes of cool-down on Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoons for one hour (between 2-5pm).
