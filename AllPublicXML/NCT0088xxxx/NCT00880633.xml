        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be identified retrospectively through an existing Indiana University
             Medical Center EUS database and pathology database.

          -  Patients with and without biliary stents will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that were suspected to have ampullary tumors but who were ultimately found to
             have a normal ampulla will be excluded.
