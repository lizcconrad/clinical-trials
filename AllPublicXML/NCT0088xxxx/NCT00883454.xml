      Estimation of functional liver reserve in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in
      cirrhosis is of paramount importance to properly select candidates for surgical resection.
      Together with the value of bilirubin, the presence/absence of ascites and esophageal varices,
      and the rate of residual liver volume, which are our current parameters to measure functional
      liver reserve, the investigators sought to investigate the value of preoperative
      cholinesterases (CHE) in predict postoperative adverse outcome after hepatic resection for
      HCC.

        The records of approximately 245 consecutive patients who were referred at our Unit because
        of HCC were reviewed. Among those, 191 (78%) were submitted to surgery, and 181 (74%) were
        resected. The patients excluded from surgery were addressed to symptomatic treatments
        because of advanced disease or impaired liver functional reserve, or to percutaneous
        ablation therapy according to our policy. Among resected patients, there were 145 (80%) men
        and 36 (20%) women, with median age of 67 years (range 36-87 years).
