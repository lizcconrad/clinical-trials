      Purpose:

      Hemodialysis-dependent patients with an end-stage renal disease (ESRD) suffer from a number
      of distressing symptoms, such as pain, poor mental health, fatigue, sleep disturbance and
      pruritus. These negatively influence health-related quality of life in ESRD patients, and
      some of them result in increased mortality and hospitalization. Acupuncture is a widely
      employed treatment on several chronic disease or condition. Adjunctive use of acupuncture
      with conventional treatment could be a possible therapeutic option to establish an optimal
      care for ESRD patients who experiences co-morbid conditions or complications of hemodialysis.
      Due to its non-pharmacologic feature, the effects of acupuncture without involving altered
      pharmacokinetics and drug-interactions in hemodialysis patients, might be another strong
      point compared to other pharmacological interventions. However, little information is
      available for the effects and the safety of acupuncture for symptomatic care of hemodialysis
      patients.

      Thus, the investigators propose whether acupuncture could be a effective and safe therapeutic
      modality for a number of patient-reported symptoms in hemodialysis-dependent patients with
      ESRD.

      This trial is a case-series, with a nested-qualitative study at the end of follow-up.
      Acupuncture treatment will be provided biweekly for 6 weeks, namely total 12 sessions, and
      follow-up period will be 4 weeks after the end of treatment. Changes of symptoms, quality of
      life and occured adverse events will be assessed during study procedure. Patients who agreed
      joining qualitative research will be interviewed about their experiences of acupuncture in
      detail.

    <description>Acupuncture treatment will be provided according to traditional korean medicine (TKM) theory which focuses on patient's individual symptoms and conditions. 10-12 needles will be inserted into acupuncture point on the body except one arm where arteriovenous fistula is located for hemodialysis access. Needle retention time will be 30 minutes with intermittent manual stimulation to elicit de-qi sensation. Biweekly treatment will be conducted at non-dialysis access day or before hemodialysis at dialysis-access day for 6 weeks.</description>
