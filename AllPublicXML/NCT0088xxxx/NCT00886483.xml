  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurofeedback is increasingly advocated for treatment of ADHD despite a thin evidence base.
      The numerous open and partially controlled studies suffer serious design flaws. In
      particular, there is no published double-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT), which would
      control for experimenter and participant biases. The primary aim of this R34 pilot study is
      to conduct a small-scale pilot with 39 8-12 year-olds with ADHD to prepare for such a larger
      RCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-nine boys and girls aged 6-12 with rigorously diagnosed DSM-IV ADHD not currently
      taking medication will be twice-randomized: first to active neurofeedback (n=26) vs. sham
      neurofeedback (n=13), and simultaneously to 2 vs. 3 times a week treatment frequency (at
      least 18 in each frequency, 12 active and 6 sham) for 40 treatments. At treatment 24, major
      assessments will include measures of satisfaction and blinding, and subjects will be given
      the option of switching to the opposite treatment frequency for the remaining 16 treatments
      to generate a practical measure of schedule palatability. Major assessments (at baseline,
      treatment 12, treatment 24, treatment 40, and follow-up) will include measures of symptoms,
      functional impairment, academic performance/achievement, and neuropsychological tests of
      attention, vigilance, and executive functioning. Every 3 treatments parents will rate ADHD
      symptoms and every 6 treatments teachers will rate, to track the response curve over time.
      Baseline EEG arousal and ADHD subtype will be examined as possible moderators. By determining
      the optimal frequency and number of treatments and demonstrating feasibility of double
      blinding, this pilot study should pave the way for a definitive large RCT of neurofeedback.

    <description>The necessary duration of treatments was examined via identifying the number of treatments at which improvement stabilized, as shown visually on graphs of parent-rated ADHD symptoms from the SNAP-IV (0-3 scale, lower score is better) for those participants in the Active Neurofeedback who completed 40 treatment sessions.The Sham group is not included in this outcome.</description>

    <description>In the active neurofeedback condition, the intervention is active neurofeedback (actual neurofeedback) either twice weekly or three times a week (randomized to frequency), with the same amount of total treatment over 40 sessions, varying only in frequency. Neurofeedback will be via the CyberLearning technology, using videogame race car speed and steering as feedback governed by EEG theta-beta ratio through the interface. the game controller is used in the usual fashion, but maximal speed is capped by the threshold theta-beta ratio, which changes from minute-to-minute by fuzzy logic based on the previous minute's ratio. If theta power exceeds a threshold, the rumble function of the controller comes on as a warning. The feedback is transparent to the patient, who just plays the videogame.</description>

    <description>The sham condition will appear identical to the neurofeedback in all aspects: equipment, duration, frequency, and videogame choices. The only difference is that the interface module will be pre-programmed to give random feedback rather than contingent on the participant's brainwave power spectrum.</description>

        <title>Feasibility of Double-blind, Sham-controlled Design #1. Recruitment Number</title>
        <description>The feasibility of the double-blind, sham-controlled design was examined in 3 ways, this first way was via the number of participants recruited.</description>

            <title>Neurofeedback</title>
            <description>In the active neurofeedback condition, subjects will receive accurate neurofeedback either twice weekly vs. three times a week, with the same amount of total treatment over 40 sessions, varying only in frequency.</description>

            <title>Sham Neurofeedback</title>
            <description>The sham condition will appear identical to the neurofeedback in all aspects: equipment, duration, frequency, and videogame choices. The only difference is that the interface module will be pre-programmed to give random feedback rather than contingent on the participant's brainwave power spectrum.</description>

          <title>Active Neurofeedback</title>
          <description>In the active neurofeedback condition, subjects will receive accurate neurofeedback either twice weekly vs. three times a week, with the same amount of total treatment over 40 sessions, varying only in frequency.</description>

          <title>Sham Neurofeedback</title>
          <description>The sham condition will appear identical to the neurofeedback in all aspects: equipment, duration, frequency, and videogame choices. The only difference is that the interface module will be pre-programmed to give random feedback rather than contingent on the participant’s brainwave power spectrum.</description>
