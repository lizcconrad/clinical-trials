    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of a fourth fractional booster dose of
      sanofi pasteur's IMOVAX Polio injected intradermally (using the Mantoux technique) as booster
      dose between 15 to 18 months of age, in terms of immunogenicity and safety.

      Objectives:

        -  To describe in each group the immunogenicity of IMOVAX Polio administered intradermally
           or intramuscularly, one month after the booster dose given at 15-18 months of age in
           toddlers previously primed with three doses of IMOVAX Polio vaccine during the IPV25
           study.

        -  To describe in each group the safety of the booster dose of IMOVAX Polio vaccine
           administered intradermally or intramuscularly.
