      This study intends to observe the epidemiology of pregnancy and growth of adolescent mothers
      and their child in their first year on the development and growth ambulatory at Brasilia
      University Hospital (HUB).

      The study hypothesis is that adolescent growth is disturbed by a pregnancy in this age.
      Another hypothesis is that their child's growth and development could be obstructed.
