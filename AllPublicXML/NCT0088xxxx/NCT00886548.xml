      The purpose of this study is:

        -  To study the clinical usefulness of nurse-performed ultrasound and echocardiographic
           examinations in a cardiac intensive care unit.

        -  To study reproducibility of nurse-performed ultrasound and echocardiographic
           examinations in a cardiac intensive care unit.

        -  To study which ultrasound measure that best correlate with the amount of pleural
           effusion.

      For a period of 1 year patients in our cardiac intensive care unit will be recruited to
      nurse-drive ultrasound and echocardiographic examinations, after informed consent. Nurses
      underwent a training programme and their skills are approved by cardiologist. Our department
      does not always have a cardiologist on duty and indication for nurse-driven ultrasound
      examination is decided by the doctor responsible for the treatment, who not always are
      trained in echocardiography/ultrasound. We aim to study the described hypothesis.
