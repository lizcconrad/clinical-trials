  <brief_summary>

      Background:

        -  Diffusely infiltrating pontine glioma (DIPG) or supratentorial high-grade glioma (HGG)
           are brain tumors that are often difficult to treat. It is very difficult to get
           chemotherapy agents to tumors in the brain, and researchers are looking for new methods
           to directly treat these types of cancer.

        -  IL-13 is an immune molecule normally occurring in the body. Patients with gliomas appear
           to have significant amounts of the IL-13 receptors in their brain tumors. An
           experimental drug, IL13-PE38QQR, combines a bacteria toxin with human IL-13 to allow the
           toxin to enter and destroy the tumor cell. Early clinical studies suggest this treatment
           may prolong survival of patients with these types of brain tumors.

        -  A technique called convection-enhanced delivery (CED) uses continuous pressure to push
           large molecules through the membranes protecting the brain to reach brain tumors. This
           technique can treat a tumor more directly than with traditional methods.

      Objectives:

        -  To test the safety and feasibility of giving IL13-PE38QQR directly into regions of the
           brain in pediatric patients with DIPG or HGG, using CED.

        -  To determine the most appropriate dose of IL13-PE38QQR to treat DIPG or HGG.

        -  To determine the effects of this experimental therapy on the tumor.

        -  To evaluate the physical changes in the tumor before and after the therapy.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients who are less than 18 years of age and have been diagnosed with either DIPG or
           with supratentorial HGG that has not responded well to standard treatments.

      Design:

        -  Patients will be admitted to the hospital and will receive a magnetic resonance imaging
           (MRI) scan to show the exact location of the tumor. A small plastic tube will be
           inserted surgically into the tumor area, and IL13-PE38QQR and a MRI contrast agent
           (gadolinium DTPA) will be infused into the area.

        -  MRI scans will monitor the process, and the tube will be removed after surgery.

        -  Doses will be adjusted over the course of the study.

        -  Patients who respond well to treatment may be eligible to receive a second infusion, no
           sooner than 4 weeks after the first treatment.

        -  Post-treatment visits:

      Clinic visits 4 and 8 weeks after the treatment, and then every 8 weeks for up to 1 year.

        -  Physical examination with neurological testing, an MRI, and standard blood and urine
           tests.

      Objective: The primary purpose of this study is to test the safety and feasibility of giving
      a new experimental agent, called IL13-PE38QQR, directly into regions of the brain in patients
      with diffusely infiltrating pontine glioma (DIPG) or with recurrent or progressive
      supratentorial high-grade glioma (HGG) using a technique called convection-enhanced delivery
      or CED. CED uses continuous pressure to push large molecules through the membranes protecting
      the brain to reach brain tumors. At the same time, we can watch where the molecules go in the
      brain by attaching a tracer, gadolinium-DTPA, to the IL13-PE38QQR, which can then be seen in
      the brain with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Because we do not know the best dose to use
      in patients with DIPG or HGG, we will give increasing amounts of IL13-PE38QQR to small groups
      of patients with each type of brain tumor, known as a dose escalation study. Secondary
      purposes of this study include determining the effects of this experimental therapy on the
      tumor, and evaluating the physical changes in the tumor before and after the therapy.

      Study Population: Twenty-right pediatric patients with recurrent or progressive DIPG or
      supratentorial HGG that have undergone standard treatment and who meet all the Inclusion and
      Exclusion Criteria may be enrolled. Eighteen patients will receive treatment; an additional
      ten patients may be screening failures or unevaluable.

      Design: We propose a Phase I single institution, open label, dose escalation (doses of 0.125,
      0.25 and 0.5 micrograms/ml), safety and tolerability study of IL13-PE38QQR infused via CED
      into patients with either DIPG (up to 9 patients) or recurrent HGG (up to 9 patients).
      IL13-PE38QQR will be administered to regions of tumor determined by radiographic findings.
      Escalating dose levels will be evaluated in the following dose cohorts (3 patients per
      Cohort): Cohort 1 = 0.125 micrograms/ml, Cohort 2 = 0.25 micrograms/ml and Cohort 3 = 0.5
      micrograms/ml.

      Outcome Measures: To assess the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of CED of
      IL13-PE38QQR, we will use detailed clinical and radiographic examinations. These will be
      performed at baseline and on post-infusion days 1, 28 and 60. After post-infusion day 60,
      clinical and radiographic studies will then be performed every 8 weeks until imaging or
      clinical evidence of recurrence/progressive disease or new treatment is initiated.

          -  Diagnosis: recurrent or progressive:

               1. DIPG

               2. HGG

          -  Patients undergoing surgical resection must have measurable/evaluable disease prior to
             study entry.

          -  Histopathologic Diagnosis

               1. A histopathologic diagnosis is not required for patients with DIPG but a biopsy
                  may be recommended if the patient has an atypical presentation or atypical
                  findings on MR-imaging.

               2. Histopathologic confirmation for patients with HGG is required. If necrosis is
                  suspected based on MR-imaging and Nuclear Medicine scans, biopsy or surgical
                  resection for confirmation of disease progression may be required.

          -  Prior Therapy

               1. Patients must have received at least standard doses of radiation (i.e., greater
                  than 54 Gy).

               2. Surgery/biopsy - Patients must be more than 2 weeks from any neurosurgical
                  procedure and cleared by the Principal Investigator before undergoing CED.

               3. Radiation - Patients must be more than 4 weeks from last fraction of radiation to
                  the target site

               4. Chemotherapy - Patients must not be on concurrent chemotherapy. The last dose of
                  chemotherapy must be greater than 2 weeks prior to CED and the patient must have
                  recovered from any toxic effects of prior therapy (to less than Grade 2 or
                  baseline).

               5. Biologic therapy - Patients must be greater than 7 days from biologic therapy.

               6. Investigational therapy - Patients must be greater than 30 days from any
                  investigational therapy.

          -  Patients must be healthy enough to tolerate surgery and general anesthesia in the
             opinion of the primary investigator. This includes, but is not limited to:

               1. Adequate baseline organ function, including an age-adjusted normal serum
                  creatinine OR a creatinine clearance greater or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73m(2),
                  total bilirubin less than 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and direct
                  bilirubin within normal limits. Patients with elevated SGPT (up to 5 times ULN)
                  will be eligible if the elevation is attributed to steroid treatment.

               2. If neurological deficits are present, they must be stable for at least 1 week
                  prior to registration.

          -  Patients must be able to undergo MR-imaging with gadolinium-based contrast
             administration (e.g. no ferrous-containing implants, no pacemakers, no allergy to
             contrast, etc).

          -  All patients or their legal guardians must sign a document of informed consent
             indicating their understanding of the investigational nature and the potential risks
             associated with this study. When appropriate, pediatric patients will be included in
             all discussions in order to obtain verbal and written assent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
