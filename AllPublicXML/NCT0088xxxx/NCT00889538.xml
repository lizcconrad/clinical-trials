  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of glutathione alone or glutathione, vitamin C and NAC treatment in children with
      autism who also have severe behavior problems. The investigators hypothesis is that children
      with autism will show improvement in both learning capabilities and behavior with either
      glutathione, or glutathione, vitamin C and NAC therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, double-blind, randomized pilot study in children and
      adolescents with autism and severe behavior disorders. All subjects will undergo initial
      screening procedures to determine eligibility. They will then be randomized to either 8 weeks
      of placebo or 8 weeks of glutathione or glutathione, vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine. They
      will receive intravenous treatment weekly and will have ongoing behavioral studies during
      this period. Following 8 weeks of therapy, they will have a week without treatment then will
      cross-over to the alternate therapy for weekly intravenous infusions and behavioral testing.
      In addition to baseline hematology and chemistries, baseline oxidized and reduced glutathione
      will be measured. These parameters will be repeated at the end of each 8 week course of
      therapy.
