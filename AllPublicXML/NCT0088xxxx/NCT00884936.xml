  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a blinded, prospective, single-center, clinical study conducted in Japanese
      female subjects between the ages of 20-75 years. This design uses skin biopsy samples from
      environmentally exposed areas and unexposed (control) areas within the same subjects to
      assess the gene expression profile from three different age groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the skin aging study is to investigate changes in gene expression
      patterns that occur during the aging process.
