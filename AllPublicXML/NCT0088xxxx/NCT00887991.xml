  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised controlled trial investigating the performance of two, 'state of the
      art' electric breast pumps in mothers who have delivered preterm infants. The main data
      collection period will be up to day 10 post delivery data. Data collected will include a
      record of the weight of milk produced during the first 10 days and a short questionnaire to
      find the mothers' opinions of the pumps used. On Day 5 a timed and weighed expression of 15
      minutes will be carried out. After the first 10 days, mothers will be asked to collect brief
      information on their continuing use of their pumps and subsequent duration of breast and
      bottle feeding, mothers will be contacted at 3 and 6 months post-term
