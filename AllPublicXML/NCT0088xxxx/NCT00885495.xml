      This is a phase I, open-label, controlled drug interaction study to determine the effects of
      darunavir plus ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A
      (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, rosuvastatin, in HIV-1-seronegative subjects.

      Twelve HIV-negative healthy volunteers will be randomized to one of two groups. Group 1 would
      receive rosuvastatin 10mg daily (Treatment A) in interval 1 for 7 days, followed by a washout
      period of at least 7 days. In interval 2, darunavir/ritonavir 600/100mg bid (Treatment B)
      would be administered for 7 days, followed by another 7 day washout period. Lastly, in
      interval 3 subjects will administer darunavir/ritonavir and rosuvastatin (Treatment C) for
      total of 7 days. Group 2 will administer Treatment B in interval 1 for 7 days, followed by a
      washout period of 7 days, then treatment A in interval 2 for 7 days followed by another 7 day
      washout period. Group 2 would then co-administer rosuvastatin and darunavir/ritonavir for the
      last 7 days. Intensive PK sampling will be performed on day 7, 21 and 35 following a meal.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Absence of HIV-1/HIV-2 infection as documented by a licensed ELISA test kit within 21
             days prior to study entry.

          2. Male or female subjects, aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 60 years

          3. Weight ≥50 kg and a Body Mass Index ([BMI], weight in kg divided by the square of
             height in meters) ≥18.0 and ≤ 35.0 kg/m2. Refer to Appendix I.

          4. Informed Consent Form (ICF) signed voluntarily before the first trial-related
             activity.

          5. Able to comply with protocol requirements.

          6. Healthy on the basis of a medical evaluation that reveals the absence of any
             clinically relevant abnormality and includes a physical examination, medical history,
             vital signs, and the results of blood tests and a urinalysis carried out at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History or evidence of current use of alcohol, barbiturate, amphetamine, recreational
             or narcotic drug use, which in the investigator's opinion would compromise subject's
             safety and/or compliance with the trial procedures.

          2. Currently active significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurologic,
             psychiatric, metabolic, renal, hepatic, respiratory, inflammatory, or infectious
             disease, that in the opinion of the investigator would represent a contraindication to
             study enrollment.

          3. Creatinine clearance of ≤ 60mL/min.

          4. Currently significant diarrhea, gastric stasis, or constipation that in the
             investigator's opinion could influence drug absorption or bioavailability.

          5. eruptions, drug allergies, food allergy, dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, or urticaria,
             that in the opinion of the investigator would represent a contraindication to study
             enrollment.

          6. Previously demonstrated clinically significant allergy or hypersensitivity to any of
             the excipients of the medications administered in the trial.

          7. History of significant drug allergy such as, but not limited to, sulphonamides and
             penicillins. Prezista is a sulphonamide. The potential for cross-sensitivity between
             drugs in the sulphonamide class and Prezista in HIV-negative subjects is unknown.

          8. Use of concomitant medication, including investigational, prescription, and
             over-the-counter products and dietary supplements with the following exceptions:
             aspirin, acetaminophen, anti-histamines such as diphenhydramine, inhalers for asthma,
             daily multivitamins, mineral supplements and hormonal oral contraceptives. Concomitant
             medication other than those listed above must have been discontinued at least 7 days
             before study entry.

          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential without use of effective nonhormonal birth
             control methods, or not willing to continue practicing these birth control methods for
             at least 30 days after the end of the treatment period; Note: Estrogen-based hormonal
             contraception may not be reliable when taking Prezista, therefore to be eligible for
             this trial, women of childbearing potential should either:

               -  use a double barrier method to prevent pregnancy (i.e., using a condom with
                  either diaphragm or cervical cap);

               -  use non-estrogen hormonal based contraceptives in combination with a barrier
                  contraceptive (i.e., male condom, diaphragm or cervical cap, or female condom);

               -  use a intrauterine device in combination with a barrier contraceptive (i.e., male
                  condom, diaphragm or cervical cap, or female condom);

               -  be not sexually active, or have a vasectomized partner (confirmed sterile).

             Women with tubal ligation are required to use one non-hormonal contraceptive method.

             Women who are postmenopausal for at least 2 years, and women with total hysterectomy
             are considered of non-childbearing potential.

         10. A positive pregnancy test or breast feeding at screening.

         11. Participation in an investigational drug trial within 90 days prior to the first
             intake of trial medication.

         12. Donation of blood or plasma within 60 days preceding the first trial-related blood
             drawing.

         13. Subjects with the following laboratory abnormalities at screening as defined by the
             Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events
             (&quot;DAIDS grading table&quot;) and in accordance with the normal ranges of the trial clinical
             laboratory:

               -  serum creatinine grade 1 or greater (≥ 1.1 x upper limit of laboratory normal
                  range [ULN]);

               -  lipase or pancreatic amylase grade 1 or greater (≥ 1.1 x ULN);

               -  hemoglobin grade 1 or greater (≤ 10.9 g/dL)

                  greater (≥ 1.25 x ULN);

               -  total bilirubin grade 1 or greater (≥ 1.1 x ULN),

               -  any other laboratory abnormality of grade 2 or above
