          2. ability to provide informed consent,

          3. elective CABG with or without single or multivalve repair or replacement, and/ or

          4. single or multivalve repair or replacement requiring CPB and sternotomy (to include
             subjects who are undergoing first time or redo cardiac surgery).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. concomitant surgery (e.g. carotid endarterectomy),

          2. emergent surgery,

          3. current steroid use,

          4. insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM),

          5. cardiac surgery without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (e.g. off-pump CABG),

          6. current use of positive intravenous inotropic agents,

          7. serious intercurrent illness (endocarditis, sepsis, active malignancy requiring
             treatment) or active infection,

          8. known substance abuse,

          9. receipt of an investigational drug or device within 30 days prior to surgery,

         10. known allergy to any of the following: GLP-1, fentanyl, midazolam, isoflurane,
             propofol, morphine, heparin or protamine,

         11. Sulfonylurea medication administration on morning of surgery (such as, tolbutamide,
             tolazamide (Tolinase), chlorpropamide (Diabinese). glipizide (Glucotrol, Glucotrol
             XL), glyburide (Micronase, Glynase PresTabs, and DiaBeta), glimepiride (Amaryl),

         12. Major end organ dysfunction defined as:

               1. Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 30% by left ventriculography
                  or echocardiogram (within 90 days prior to randomization), current use of
                  positive intravenous inotropic agents, preoperative use of intra-aortic balloon
                  pump (IABP), left ventricular assist device (LVAD), or extracorporeal membrane
                  oxygenation (ECMO);

               2. Renal: preoperative serum Creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL;

               3. Hepatic: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine transferase (ALT) &gt; 2.5 x
                  upper limit normal;

               4. Hematologic: preoperative hematocrit (HCT) &lt; 30%, platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3,
                  history of (or family history of) bleeding or clotting disorder;

         13. Patients with a history of or risk factors for acute pancreatitis (i.e. ethanol abuse,
             gall stones) will be excluded from this study,

         14. Pregnant or breastfeeding females, or

         15. any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the
             safety of the subject or would preclude the subject from successful completion of the
             study.
