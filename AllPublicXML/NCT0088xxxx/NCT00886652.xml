  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) can change the respiratory dynamics and performance of
      the inspiratory and expiratory muscles, affecting ventilatory capacity. This was a
      randomized, controlled, open study to test the impact of a physiotherapeutic program of
      aerobic exercises on respiratory muscle strength, in patients with adolescent idiopathic
      scoliosis. Patients with AIS were randomly assigned to the aerobic exercise-training program
      group or the no treatment group. There was a significant increase in Pimax and Pemax in the
      group which received physiotherapy.

      Study Design: This was a randomized, controlled, open study to test the impact of a
      physiotherapeutic program of aerobic exercises on respiratory muscle strength, in patients
      with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Objective. To analyze, by means of maximum
      respiratory pressure measurements, the conditioning of the respiratory muscles after four
      months of aerobic exercise training. Summary of Background Data. AIS can change the
      respiratory dynamics and performance of the inspiratory and expiratory muscles, affecting
      ventilatory capacity.

      Methods: Patients with AIS, aged between 10 and 20 years, were randomly assigned to the
      aerobic exercise-training program group or the no treatment group. They were evaluated for
      respiratory muscle strength before and after the treatment period, by means of a manometer,
      and radiographs of the chest and spine. The physical therapy exercise protocol consisted of
      three weekly sessions, including stretching, aerobic exercises (first mild and then
      accelerated) and relaxation techniques, for a period of four months.

    <description>The patients of the Exercise group were submitted to a four-month physiotherapy protocol, with three weekly sessions of 60 minutes each, accompanied by a physiotherapist, and consisting of warm-up, aerobic exercise on an electric treadmill, and then winding down and relaxation.
Each patient in this group was therefore submitted to an average of 48 sessions of exercises, always carried out at the same physiotherapy center.</description>

    <description>Three weekly sessions, with an interval of one day between each, lasting 60 minutes each, and divided into three separate stages: - A 10-minute warm-up (stretching and low intensity aerobic exercises such as slow, gradual walking); - 40 minutes of aerobic exercise on an electric treadmill, with the work intensity maintained at a 60% to 80% of the maximum heart rate; - 10 minutes of winding down and relaxation (stretching exercises, low energy expenditure aerobics and relaxation techniques).</description>
