  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is connected with an increased morbidity and mortality. In addition,
      quality of life is diminished due to palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness and syncope. AF is
      frequently associated with valvular and coronary disease. In the AF patients undergoing
      valvular or coronary surgery the arrhythmia almost always relapses. For symptom control
      anti-arrhythmic drugs and cardioversion are used but breakthrough arrhythmias and side
      effects of the drugs happen frequently. For more effective symptom control &quot;add-on&quot;
      arrhythmia surgery is being advocated. However, at present the investigators do not know
      whether add-on arrhythmia surgery indeed affects morbidity and quality of life.

      The hypothesis being studied is that add-on arrhythmia surgery in patients with AF undergoing
      valvular or coronary surgery improves quality of life, establishes chronic sinus rhythm and
      reduces perioperative and long-term morbidity associated with AF.

      Multicentre prospective parallel randomised controlled trial. In total 150 patients with
      documented atrial fibrillation (chronic and paroxysmal), were randomly assigned by a central
      computer system to undergo cardiac surgery with add-on surgery or without. This assignment
      was blinded to patients and all medical personnel except for the surgical team during total
      follow up. Patients completed quality of life questionnaires, comprising the RAND 36-item
      Health Survey 1.0 (SF-36), Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 (MFI-20) and EuroQoL (EQ-5D
      and VAS) at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months following operation.

    <description>Adjuvant anti-arrhythmic surgery consists of a beating heart epicardial &quot;box&quot; isolation of all pulmonary veins using microwave energy (Flex 4 or Flex 10 ablation probes and Microwave generator by Guidant/Afix, Fremont, CA, USA). The surgical ablation procedure is the first step during surgery and is performed before institution of cardiopulmonary bypass allowing off-pump beating heart ablation. In addition excision or exclusion of the left atrial appendage is performed in both the treated as the control group.</description>

    <description>The surgical ablation procedure is the first step during surgery and is performed before institution of cardiopulmonary bypass allowing off-pump beating heart ablation. The off-pump beating heart ablation procedure is performed according to a specific box lesion surrounding the pulmonary veins, using microwave energy. Afterwards cardiac surgery is performed as usual in both treatment arms.</description>
