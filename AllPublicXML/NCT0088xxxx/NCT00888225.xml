      Epi-X is a multicentered randomized controlled clinical trial of chronic lateral
      epicondylitis with parallel group design and two phases. In the first phase physical exercise
      treatment is given in the intervention group and expectance in the reference group. In phase
      2 eccentric exercise versus concentric is tested.

      Chronic lateral epicondylitis is defined as the presence of a &quot;tennis elbow&quot; for more than 3
      months. It is a common condition in the general population and often results in long-term
      sick-leave. The etiology is unknown. A large number of treatments have been tried but none is
      generally accepted. However, in Achilles tendinitis a new treatment has been shown effective.
      It consists of eccentric exercise, i.e. work during stretching rather than shortening of the
      muscle (concentric exercise). The latter is currently the most common treatment method.

      This project is a randomised controlled clinical trial of eccentric versus concentric
      exercise in 205 patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis. Pain and muscle strength were
      recorded at start of treatment and after 1,2,3,6 and 12 months. Activities of daily life
      (ADL) and well-being were recorded at start of treatment and after 3, 6 and 12 months. In
      addition, blood specimens for a number of neural peptides have been sampled. Moreover, the
      involvement of the peripheral nervous system in the elbow area has been examined in a
      subsample of patients. A biopsy from 20 patients per treatment group and from 20 healthy
      subjects, and a positron emission tomography (PET) scan of 23 patients were performed to
      allow qualitative and quantitative examination of neural fibres, peptides and receptors. The
      health economy of the two treatments will be investigated using data from this project and
      from available registers.
