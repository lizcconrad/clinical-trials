  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza (flu) viruses change continuously, therefore also the parts of viruses used in
      influenza vaccines can vary from year to year. In Europe, manufacturers/marketing holders of
      these vaccines are required to be involved in ongoing clinical trials and to present the
      results to the competent authorities each year. The current study is a phase IIIa clinical
      trial with a commercially available vaccine (Influvac®) supplied in pre filled syringes. It
      is part of the ongoing clinical trial program for Influvac® and will be done to assess the
      immunogenicity and safety and tolerability of next season's trivalent influenza subunit
      vaccine in two groups of subjects in good health: subjects aged &gt;= 18 and &lt;= 60 years and
      subjects &gt;= 61 years of age (elderly).
