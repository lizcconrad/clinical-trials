    <textblock>
      This is a study for patients with head and neck cancer who will be receiving chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy for their disease. The purpose of this study is to see if the investigators
      can use genetic differences between patients to select the right drug to use with radiation
      therapy. This type of genetic testing is called pharmacogenetics.

      Currently there are two drugs used to treat head and neck cancer that have provided a benefit
      when given with radiation compared to radiation alone in previous studies. These two drugs
      are cisplatin and cetuximab (Erbitux).

      In this trial, the investigators will test whether genetic differences between patients can
      be used to pick which drug they should receive. A recent study that looked back to see how
      well patients with head and neck cancer responded to treatment with cisplatin showed that
      genetic differences in a few genes were associated with who did and who did not survive their
      cancer. The investigators are taking that finding and using it to test patients for these
      genetic differences to determine whether they should receive cisplatin or cetuximab. In other
      words, the investigators are trying to take what is essentially a flip of the coin choice
      between these two drugs, and instead use individual patient's genetic differences to make-and
      hopefully improve- this choice.

      Treatment-naive patients with locally advanced, non-metastatic (Stage III to IVB) squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck who are candidates for concurrent chemoradiotherapy as
      primary therapy with curative intent will be enrolled. Patients will be genotyped for
      variations at four SNP loci in 3 genes involved in DNA nucleotide excision repair (ERCC1,
      ERCC2, and XRCC1). Patients with 3 to 8 variants will receive cisplatin, while patients with
      2 or fewer variants will receive cetuximab.
