      This is an open label, single arm, phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral
      sapacitabine administered twice daily for 5 consecutive days every week for 2 weeks followed
      by 7-day rest in patients who have had one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced Non-Small
      Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

          -  Adequate renal function

          -  Adequate liver function

          -  At least 3 weeks from prior systemic treatments including investigational anti-cancer
             therapy; at least 7 days from prior radiation therapy; and have recovered from prior

             in the past 5 years with the exception of adequately treated in situ cervical cancer,
             and basal or squamous cell skin cancer; patients who received only hormonal therapy in
             the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting in the past 5 years may participate in this study
