      In suspecting pancreatic cancer, dynamic phase pancreatic CT is the most effective tool in
      diagnosis and staging. In addition, magnetic resolution image, endoscopic ultrasonography,
      endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, angiography can be performed.

      After introduction of functional image, PET has been suggested in the role of diagnosis and
      staging of pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, recently fused images of PET and CT were
      available.

      In this study, the researchers evaluate the role of integrated PET-CT in patients with
      pancreatic cancer and analysis the cost-effectiveness of the integrated PET-CT.

      Compared to dynamic phase pancreatic CT, integrated PET-CT will be evaluated for sensitivity,
      specificity and accuracy of diagnosing and staging pancreatic cancer while the gold standard
      for pancratic cancer is operative specimen. If the operation can't be performed, EUS-FNA of
      the pancreatic mass or lymph node and additional imaging modality will be preferred to
      laparotomy.
