    <textblock>
      The effects of using Community Development Teams to increase the number of counties that
      successfully implement and sustain Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care programs is studied
      in a randomized trial in 40 California counties. MTFC is an alternative to group or
      residential placement for youth with severe conduct and emotional problems referred from the
      juvenile justice and child welfare systems.
