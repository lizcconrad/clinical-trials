  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention to reduce
      sexual risk behaviors and enhance HIV-preventive behaviors among female sex workers (FSWs) in
      Yerevan, Armenia. The study design is a randomized controlled trial of 120 FSWs aged 18 and
      over recruited through Hope and Help NGO. Participants will complete an interviewer
      administered questionnaire collected at baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-up.

      Subsequently, participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention condition or
      a wait-list control. Those randomized to the intervention condition will receive a 2-hour
      one-on-one intervention session emphasizing HIV knowledge, self-efficacy, and condom use
      behaviors. They will also receive a 10-15 minute booster session at 3-month follow-up. The
      comparison condition is wait-listed, but have the choice of participating in the intervention
      program upon completion of the study.

      The main outcome measure includes consistent condom use, defined as condom use during every
      episode of vaginal intercourse with clients. Other outcome measures are condom application by
      FSW and HIV- preventive behaviors such as condom use self-efficacy, knowledge of HIV
      transmission dynamics,perceived barriers to condom use and condom use errors.

      Results from this pilot study are expected to inform a larger trial to be implemented with
      FSWs in Armenia, in an effort to devise gender and culturally relevant intervention programs
      to prevent HIV transmission in this vulnerable population.
