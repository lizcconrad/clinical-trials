  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to identify a brief screening evaluation for MS patients that is
      sensitive and specific to the MS population and which correlates with the findings of our
      standard-of-care neuropsychological assessments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy five randomly identified patients will be evaluated. Consenting patients will perform
      a Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and have the MS Center´s standard neuropsychological
      assessment performed. Tests comprising the standard assessment will be the RBANS (Randolph,
      1998), Multiscore Depression Inventory, Cross and Clock Drawings. The selfreported Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI-II) will also be obtained. An Expanded Disability Status Scale
      (EDSS) will be recorded for each patient. The RBANS consists of six scales labeled (1)
      Immediate Memory, (2) Visuospatial/ Constructional, (3) Language, (4) Attention, (5) Delayed
      Memory, and (6) Total. Depression will be assessed by the BDI and the MultiScore Depression
      Inventory.

      The SDMT will be administered using standard instructions either orally or in writing. Use of
      the established norms for the SDMT will be used to determine if the MS patient is
      demonstrating some cognitive dysfunction. Scores less than 1.0 to 1.5 standard deviations
      below mean are suggestive of cerebral dysfunction. The results will be controlled for age,
      gender, and educational level.

      Additionally, the results of the 75 patient assessments will be reviewed to see the
      concordance between the results of the SDMT and the Neuropsychological Battery. The
      association of cognitive dysfunction as identified by the SDMT will be correlated with each
      of the six RBANS scales and other parameters of the cognitive aspects of the Battery.
      Statistical analysis will determine the sensitivity and specificity of the SDMT in
      determining abnormalities as well as an optimum cutpoint. This analysis will indicate
      possible cognitive problems and the need for further testing and, potentially, intervention.
