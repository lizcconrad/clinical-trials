  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, phase 1/2 study of continuous weekly
      paclitaxel and escalating doses of intermittent or continuous OSI-906 in patients with
      recurrent/relapsed ovarian and other solid tumors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase 1 dose escalation portion will establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in
      patients with advanced solid tumors. Once the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is established
      for both schedules, the phase 2 study will begin. Patients with relapsed/recurrent epithelial
      ovarian cancer will be randomized 1:1:1 to 3 treatment groups.
