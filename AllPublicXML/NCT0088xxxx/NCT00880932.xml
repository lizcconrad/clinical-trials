      The hypothesis is that a newly formatted electronic alert that requires the prescriber to
      pause and enter a specific &quot;reason for override&quot; on this alert, will cause prescribers in the
      intervention group to be significantly less likely to prescribe the combination of warfarin
      and NSAID than prescribers in the control group.

    <description>This intervention was not targeted to patients with a disease but to the providers. The intervention was not a drug but a customized electronic alert, requesting the prescriber to specify a &quot;reason for override&quot; whenever the combination drugs of warfarin and NSAID were ordered together.</description>

    <description>The control group was not patients but the providers. Providers in the control group continued with the standard practice of receiving passive alerts in the form of message boxes warning the provider not to prescribe the combination drugs warfarin and NSAID.</description>
