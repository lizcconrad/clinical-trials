  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether escitalopram is safe, well tolerated, and
      effective in the treatment of HIV-infected patients with generalized anxiety disorder.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are twice as prevalent among HIV-infected patients as they are in the
      general population. Approximately 25%-40% of HIV-infected patients have anxiety disorders;
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic disorder and post-traumatic Stress Disorder being the
      most frequent. Non-adherence to anti-retroviral medications is commonly seen in patients with
      HIV with GAD.The role of specific selective serotonin reuptake (SSRIs) in the treatment of
      HIV-patients with GAD is unclear. Escitalopram has been used in the treatment of GAD in the
      general population. It has been shown to be safe in HIV-patients with a tolerable side-effect
      profile. However, whether it can improve GAD in HIV-infected patients has not yet been
      investigated.

    <measure>Change From Randomization to End of Treatment in Scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-A is administered by an interviewer who asks a series of questions related to symptoms of anxiety. The interviewer then rates the individual on a five-point scale for each of the 14 items. Seven of the items specifically address psychic anxiety and the remaining seven items address somatic anxiety. The total anxiety score ranges from 0 to 56, lower scores are better. Change from randomization to end of treatment in scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)is measured.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes From Randomization to End of Treatment in Scores on the Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Scoring
The BDI consist of twenty-one questions about how the subject has been feeling in the last week. Each question has a set of at least four possible answer choices, ranging in intensity as follows:
(0) I do not feel sad.
I feel sad.
I am sad all the time and I can't snap out of it.
I am so sad or unhappy that I can't stand it.
A value of 0 to 3 is assigned for each answer and the total score is compared to a key to determine the depression's severity. The standard cut-offs are as follows:[6] 0-9: indicates minimal depression 10-18: indicates mild depression 19-29: indicates moderate depression 30-63: indicates severe depression.
Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change From Randomization to End of Treatment in Scores for the Clinical Global Impression(CGI-S and CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Scale for scoring:
Clinical Global Impression(CGI-S)
= Normal, no symptoms
= Borderline ill
= Mildly ill
= Moderately ill
= Markedly ill
= Severely ill
= Most extremely ill
Clinical Global Impression(CGI-I)-improvement since treatment
very much improved
much improved
minimally improved
no change from baseline
minimally worse
much worse
very much worse</description>

    <time_frame>baseline to 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Trail Making Test (TMT)Results for TMT are reported as the number of seconds required to complete the task. Higher scores reveal greater impairment.
Average =29 seconds, Deficient &gt; 78 seconds</description>

    <measure>Changes From Randomization to End of Treatment in Scores on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE),a low score less than or equal to 23 indicates cognitive impairment and the need for further evaluation; normal cognitive function = 27-30, mild cognitive impairment = 21-26, moderate cognitive impairment = 11-20, and severe cognitive impairment = 0-10. The highest possible score is 30.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes From Randomization to End of Treatment in Scores on the Sheehan Disability Scores (SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Scoring:
Participants rate the extent to which work, social life, and home life are impaired by his or her symptoms. A 10 point scale is used where 0= not impaired and 10 is highly impaired indicating. The three aspects of life can be summed up into a single dimensional measure of global functional impairment that indicates 0= not impaired and 30 = highly impaired. Scores of 5 or greater are on any of the three scales are considered significant.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to End of Treatment in Scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)</title>
        <description>The HAM-A is administered by an interviewer who asks a series of questions related to symptoms of anxiety. The interviewer then rates the individual on a five-point scale for each of the 14 items. Seven of the items specifically address psychic anxiety and the remaining seven items address somatic anxiety. The total anxiety score ranges from 0 to 56, lower scores are better. Change from randomization to end of treatment in scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)is measured.</description>

        <title>Changes From Randomization to End of Treatment in Scores on the Beck Depression Inventory</title>
        <description>Scoring
The BDI consist of twenty-one questions about how the subject has been feeling in the last week. Each question has a set of at least four possible answer choices, ranging in intensity as follows:
(0) I do not feel sad.
I feel sad.
I am sad all the time and I can't snap out of it.
I am so sad or unhappy that I can't stand it.
A value of 0 to 3 is assigned for each answer and the total score is compared to a key to determine the depression's severity. The standard cut-offs are as follows:[6] 0–9: indicates minimal depression 10–18: indicates mild depression 19–29: indicates moderate depression 30–63: indicates severe depression.
Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.</description>
