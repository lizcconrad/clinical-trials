  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to check the efficacy of a new oral medical drug treatment, namely
      Cabergoline, for the treatment of Cushing Disease due to pituitary adenoma.

      Background: Cabergoline is a Dopamine 2 receptor agonist. Corticotroph adenoma has shown to
      have the D2 receptor in in vitro studies.
