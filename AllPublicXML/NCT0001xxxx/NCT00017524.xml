      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of AG2037 in treating patients who have
      advanced, metastatic, or recurrent solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxic effects of AG2037 in
           patients with advanced, metastatic, or recurrent solid tumor.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerance of this drug in these patients.

        -  Assess the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Document any antitumor effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive AG2037 IV weekly on weeks 1-3. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of AG2037 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-60 patients will be accrued for this study.
