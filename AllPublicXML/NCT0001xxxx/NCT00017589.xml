      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin can locate tumor cells and
      either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.
      Oblimersen may help gemtuzumab ozogamicin kill more cancer cells by making cancer cells more
      sensitive to the drug.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining oblimersen and gemtuzumab
      ozogamicin in treating older patients who have relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the complete response rate of elderly patients with relapsed CD33-positive
           acute myeloid leukemia treated with oblimersen and gemtuzumab ozogamicin.

        -  Determine the overall response rate and duration of response of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-7 and 15-22 and gemtuzumab ozogamicin
      IV over 2 hours on days 4 and 18.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-100 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
