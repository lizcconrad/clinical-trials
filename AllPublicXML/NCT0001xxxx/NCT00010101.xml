      RATIONALE: Genetic studies may help in understanding the genetic processes involved in the
      development of some types of cancer.

      PURPOSE: Genetic study to understand how genes may be involved in the development of brain
      tumors in young children.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the frequency and type of deletions and mutations of the INI1 gene in infants
           with embryonal central nervous system tumors.

        -  Compare the gene expression profiles in infants with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors
           vs medulloblastoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tumor samples are analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for deletions of INI1
      gene in chromosome band 22q11.2. Tumors without demonstration of deletions of INI1 gene by
      FISH are examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based microsatellite analysis for loss
      of heterozygosity using markers that map to 22q11.2.

      DNA from tumor tissue is analyzed for mutations in the exons of the INI1 gene. Isolated
      matched normal DNA may be analyzed for identification of germline mutations. Parental DNA may
      be analyzed to identify inherited germline mutations of the INI1 gene.

      The patient's physician may receive the results of the genetic testing. The results do not
      influence the type or duration of treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 25 months.

        Tissue samples from infants (&lt; 3 years old) with histologically confirmed primary
        intracranial CNS medulloblastoma/PNET, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, or choroid plexus
        carcinoma and with no prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or treatment from any other
        investigational agent will be used for this research study. Patients who meet the
        eligibility criteria, are treated at a PBTC institution that has IRB approval of this
        study, and consent to the usage of stored tumor specimens for the study objectives
        constitute the study population.
