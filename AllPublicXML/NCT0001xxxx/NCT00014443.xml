      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to
      the tumor.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining topotecan and thalidomide in
      treating patients who have recurrent or refractory malignant glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine tumor response rate, duration of response, time to disease progression, and
           overall survival of patients with recurrent or refractory malignant glioma treated with
           topotecan and thalidomide.

        -  Determine safety and tolerance of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive topotecan IV continuously on days 1-21 and oral thalidomide daily
      on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
