      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-247550 in treating patients who
      have recurrent metastatic stomach cancer that has been previously treated with chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the clinical activity of BMS-247550 in terms of response rate in
      patients with recurrent metastatic gastric cancer previously treated with a fluoropyrimidine
      or platinum regimen. II. Determine the safety of this drug in this patient population. III.
      Determine the duration of response, time to progression, and survival of patients treated
      with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive up to 4 additional
      courses after CR. Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-58 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
