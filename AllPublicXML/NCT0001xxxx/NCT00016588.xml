          -  Have a CD4 count of 50 cells/mm3 or more.

          -  Have a negative pregnancy test.

          -  Agree to use 2 forms of barrier birth control while on the study and for 30 days

          -  Have had treatment with any of the following types of anti-HIV drugs: nucleoside
             reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g.,
             adefovir dipivoxil or TDF), protease inhibitors, or nonnucleoside reverse
             transcriptase inhibitors.

          -  Have received a vaccination within 30 days before study entry.

          -  Have had a new AIDS-defining illness diagnosed within 30 days before study entry.

          -  Are taking any of the following: drugs that may cause kidney problems, including
             aminoglycoside antibiotics, cidofovir, cisplatin, foscarnet, intravenous (IV)
             amphotericin B, IV vancomycin, oral and IV ganciclovir, and valganciclovir;
             probenecid; chemotherapy; steroid drugs; interleukin-2; or investigational drugs.

          -  Are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Have difficulty taking, absorbing, or tolerating drugs by mouth, as may be shown by
