      OBJECTIVES:

      The objectives of this study are to test the Diaphragm Pacing Stimulation (DPS) System for
      treating chronic ventilatory insufficiency in persons with respiratory muscle paralysis. The
      hypothesis being tested in the clinical trial is that laparoscopic stimulation of the
      diaphragm at the motor point with intramuscular electrodes is safe and effective in providing
      significant ventilatory support to individuals who are otherwise dependant on a mechanical
      ventilator. Patients in our initial study group have all suffered from high-level spinal cord
      injury and were full-time dependant on positive pressure mechanical ventilation prior to
      inclusion.

      System: NeuRx RA/4 Diaphragm Pacing Stimulation System

      Summary:

      The NeuRx-RA/4 is intended to be used by individuals that have sustained a spinal cord
      injury, requiring aid with respiration. The device connects to the diaphragm which delivers
      current to stimulate muscle contractions to aid in respirations.

      This device currently holds an Investigational Device Exemption No. G920162 in the United
      States and is currently undergoing clinical trials at University Hospitals (Cleveland),
      Shepherd Center (Atlanta) and Vancouver (Canada).

      Introduction:

      The purpose of the study is to determine if a new, investigational diaphragm pacing system
      can provide part or full time respiratory support to spinal cord injured persons who normally
      need a mechanical ventilator. Patients with high-level spinal cord injuries typically
      experience chronic ventilatory insufficiency due to respiratory muscle paralysis; these
      patients must be supported predominantly through positive pressure mechanical ventilation
      with a ventilator.

      The diaphragm pacing system (NeuRx-RA/4) provides an electrical signal to the motor point of
      the muscle that causes the diaphragm to contract and allows patients to breathe more
      naturally.

      Synapse Biomedical, in conjunction with Case Western Reserve University and University
      Hospitals of Cleveland, are evaluating activating the diaphragm with percutaneous
      intramuscular electrodes implanted laparoscopically. This eliminates any direct contact with
      the phrenic nerve, allows all circuitry and electronics to remain outside the body, and
      provides direct, selective activation to each hemidiaphragm.

      The NeuRx RA/4 Diaphragm Pacing Stimulation (DPS) System has been implanted in over 25
      individuals with high-level spinal cord injury, resulting in over 20 years of cumulative
      active implantation time. The longest term patient was implanted March 6, 2000 and has been
      using the DPS System as his sole means of respiratory support for over five years. With the
      exception of the second patient, who does not meet our revised inclusion criteria and has
      gained no benefit from the implant, all of the remaining patients have been able to achieve
      significant tidal volumes with the DPS System. Based on the current results, the NeuRx RA/4
      DPS System has demonstrated safety and efficacy in patients with high-level spinal cord
      injury.

      Given the results to date the study has demonstrated preliminary efficacy in this patient
      population. With no unexpected significant adverse events reported the NeuRx RA/4 DPS System
      has performed reliably and safely in this patient population.

      Device Description: The NeuRx RA/4 Respiratory System is manufactured by Synapse Biomedical.
      The NeuRx RA/4 System comprises the following components: an external, battery powered
      Stimulator Device, an associated Programmer/Controller, Intramuscular Electrodes, associated
