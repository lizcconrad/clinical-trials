    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to see if Z-100 (an investigational drug) treatment is safe in
      HIV patients who have never received treatment for their HIV, who have not been taking highly
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least 8 weeks, or who have been stable on their
      current first or second HAART regimen for at least 12 weeks.

          -  Have received treatment but have discontinued HAART for at least 8 weeks prior to
             screening, have had stable viral loads on at least 2 separate time points at least 1
             month apart including screening, and have had stable CD4 levels on at least 2 separate
             time points at least 1 month apart including screening.

          -  Use birth control while on the study and during the follow-up period.

          -  Have viral loads of 2,000 to 55,000 copies/ml within 2 weeks of randomization.

          -  Have CD4 counts of greater than 350 cells/mm within 2 weeks of randomization.

          -  Have a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks of randomization (women able to
             have children).

        Exclusion Criteria
