    <textblock>
      The project is intended to modify the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) for manual
      wheelchair users. It will determine if the new measure is a better measure of community
      independence for manual wheelchair users than the FIM. During the Phase 1 of the study it
      will then use this new measure to determine whether a home exercise program increases
      functional independence in wheelchair users. In Phases II and III of the study 120 manual
      wheelchair users will participate to test and validate the new measure and to test the
      effectiveness of therapeutic exercise. Subjects will range in age from 20 to 79 yrs. and have
      a variety of disabilities.
