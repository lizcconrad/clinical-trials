      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Enzyme products such as Wobe-Mugos E may help to reduce the side
      effects of multiple myeloma therapy. It is not yet known if chemotherapy is more effective
      with or without Wobe-Mugos E in treating multiple myeloma.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy with or
      without Wobe-Mugos E in treating patients who have stage II or stage III multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the long-term survival of patients with chemotherapy-naive stage II or
      III multiple myeloma treated with standard melphalan and prednisone with or without adjuvant
      Wobe-Mugos E. II. Compare the effect of these two regimens on the reduction of the side
      effects from chemotherapy in these patients, using 2 quality of life questionnaires. III.
      Compare the effect of these two regimens on tumor response rate and new metastasis
      development in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral melphalan and oral
      prednisone on days 1-4. Patients also receive adjuvant enzyme therapy with oral Wobe-Mugos E
      3 times daily beginning prior to or on day 1 of the first course of chemotherapy. Arm II:
      Patients receive melphalan and prednisone as in arm I. Patients also receive an oral placebo
      3 times daily as in arm I. Treatment continues for a minimum of 12 months to up to 4 years in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients continue on melphalan and prednisone on a
      4-week course until achieving maximum response or plateau phase and then receive 2 additional
      courses of therapy. Quality of life is assessed at baseline; at 1, 3, and 6 months and every
      6 months for up to 4 years during study; and then at end of study. Patients are followed for
      survival for 1 month after completing the study and all patients receive the enzyme product.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients (125 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 1.5 years.
