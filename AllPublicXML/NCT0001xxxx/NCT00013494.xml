  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For hemiplegic, stroke patients wheelchair transfers is a critical, safety-related area of
      physical function.

      This project will develop a personalized training and clinical assessment instrument based on
      the Video-Based F-PAT (Functional Performance Assessment and Training.) The objectives of the
      study are: (1) Enhance the pilot F-PAT web site to allow clinicians password-protected access
      to the digitized video and assessment information; and (2) train an Occupational Therapist
      collaborator to create the personalized videotapes for patients to take home with them. This
      study has the dual goal of evaluating the effectiveness of the personalized training
      videotapes and the effectiveness of the video-based assessment methodology.

      For people who have become hemiplegic as a result of a stroke, a critical safety-related
      retraining area for physical functions is wheelchair transfers. In addition, to incorporate
      the relatively unsupervised home care into the rehabilitation process, clinicians require a
      better means to assess functional gains and provide effective training tools. Our goal is to
      develop a personalized training and clinical assessment instrument based on the Video-Based
      F-PAT (Functional Performance Assessment and Training) which relies on the manipulation of
      digitized videoclips. Our development objectives are (1) to enhance the pilot F-PAT web site
      to allow clinicians password-protected access to the digitized video and assessment
      information; and (2) to train an Occupational Therapist collaborator to create the
      personalized videotapes for patients to take home with them. Our clinical objective is to
      implement a 2-year evaluation of the F-PAT design concept with 30 subjects, divided in 3
      groups, who as patients undergo acute rehabilitation at the VA Comprehensive Rehabilitation
      Center and are discharged to their homes or a sub-acute facility. This study has the dual
      goal of evaluating the effectiveness of the personalized training videotapes and the
      effectiveness of the video-based assessment methodology.

      The study will divide the subjects into three treatment groups to compare the effectiveness
      of accepted practice, generic videotape, and personalized videotape home-based instruction
      for clients and care providers. Comparison of outcomes will be done using videotape of task
      performance before release from the acute therapy program and at the follow-up evaluation one
      month later. The subjects will be evaluated by a blinded physiatrist viewing and rating
      digitized videoclips of task performance on the F-PAT web site. This study will determine if
      personalized videoclip-based instructional material is effective, and if videoclip
      comparisons by a clinician is an effective diagnosis and assessment instrument. If it is not
      possible for logistical reasons for a subject to return to the clinic for the follow-on
      evaluation, the F-PAT team will visit the subject's home and perform the videotaping on-site.
      The remainder of the evaluation with input from the physiatrist will occur subsequently at
      the clinic.
