      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of PS-341 in treating patients who have
      metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of PS-341 in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive PS-341 IV over 3-5 seconds twice weekly for 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every
      3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-19
      months.
