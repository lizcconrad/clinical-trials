      Dementia illness often co-exists with painful medical conditions associated with aging (e.g.,
      degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis, skin ulcers, back pain, headaches, cancer, or
      angina). While the standard practice is pain assessment for all patients, the elderly with
      dementia have special needs for assessment, management, and evaluation. When they are unable
      to verbalize pain, objective measurement of their discomfort are possible manifestations of
      pain. No research relates systemic pain treatment with reduction of negative problematic
      behaviors in patient dementia.

      Background:

      Dementia illness often co-exists with painful medical conditions associated with aging (e.g.,
      degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis, skin ulcers, back pain, headaches, cancer, or
      angina). While the standard practice is pain assessment for all patients, the elderly with
      dementia have special needs for assessment, management, and evaluation. When they are unable
      to verbalize pain, objective measurement of their discomfort are possible manifestations of
      pain. No research relates systemic pain treatment with reduction of negative problematic
      behaviors in patient dementia.

      Objectives:

      The objectives of this research are (1) to elucidate the relationships between pain,
      discomfort, and agitation; and (2) to determine the influence that pain management has on
      decreasing the outcomes of discomfort, agitation, and confusion in nursing home residents.

      Methods:

      This study used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Each
      treatment arm lasted two weeks. The crossover point occurred without washout. One arm was
      acetaminophen 650 mg qid and placebo qid PRN. The other arm was placebo qid and acetaminophen
      650 mg qid PRN. Sites involved in the study included the Jewish Home for the Aged in San
      Francisco; Golden Gate Healthcare Center in San Francisco; Palo Alto VA Health Care System;
      Nursing Home Care Unit at Livermore. Patients were included who: are &gt; 55 years; have severe
      dementia; have a documented painful condition not requiring opiates or a current medication
      regimen; unable to report pain consistently or reliably; be present and accept treatment for
      study duration; have &gt; 1 episode of agitation per day. Patients with schizophrenia or severe
      Parkinsonï¿½s are excluded. A research assistant (blind to treatment arm) tested each patient
      for discomfort, agitation, and confusion at baseline and two times per day on two days of the
      week for four weeks. Nurses rated patients for agitation each shift. Instruments included the
      Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, the Discomfort Scale, and the Confusion Assessment
      Method. Repeated measures analyses examined effect of treatment on the three behaviors
      (agitation, confusion, and discomfort).

      Status:

      The study is complete. Final report was submitted to HSR&amp;D in August 2001.
