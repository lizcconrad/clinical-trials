      This study will try to identify and treat feeder vessels in age-related macular degeneration.
      The macula is the part of the retina in the back of the eye that determines central or best
      vision. In macular degeneration, leaking blood vessels under the macula lead to loss of
      central vision. These vessels branch out tree-like from one or more feeder vessels. Instead
      of treating all the abnormal branching vessels, this study will try to find and close only
      the feeder vessels, thereby depriving the abnormal vessels of nutrition. The vessels will be
      closed with laser beam treatment.

      People 50 years of age and older with macular degeneration and visual acuity worse than 20/50
      in the study eye and the same or better vision in the other eye may be eligible for this
      study. Candidates will undergo fluorescein angiography to try to locate feeder vessels. For
      this procedure, a yellow dye is injected into an arm vein. The dye travels to the blood
      vessels in the eyes, and pictures of the retina are taken using a camera that flashes a blue
      light into the eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina,
      indicating possible blood vessel abnormality.

      Before laser treatment, participants will have a complete eye examination, including
      measurement of visual acuity, evaluation of the front part of the eye with a slit lamp
      microscope, examination of the retina with an ophthalmoscope, and measurement of eye pressure
      using a tonometer.

      During the laser treatment phase of the study, participants will have indocyanine green
      angiography-a procedure similar to fluorescein angiography, but using a green dye-to
      photograph the retina and identify feeder vessels. If feeder vessels are located, laser beam
      treatment will begin. For this procedure, the eye is anesthetized with numbing drops. A
      special contact lens is then placed on the eye for the laser treatment. The number of
      treatments depends on how well the individual patient responds, but usually between two and
      eight treatments are required.

      The indocyanine green angiogram will be repeated after the laser beam treatment to determine
      if the feeder vessels have been successfully closed. If the vessels remain partially open, a
      repeat application will be done, followed by another indocyanine green angiogram to check the
      results.

      Patients will be checked in the clinic after 1 week to see if additional treatment is needed.
      If so, re-treatment will be done in a week. If no re-treatment is required, follow-up visits
      will be scheduled 2, 3, and 6 weeks after treatment, 3 and 6 months after treatment, and
      every 6 months after that for 2 years to evaluate treatment results. The evaluations will
      include fluorescein angiograms and other examinations that were done before starting
      treatment. If abnormal vessels are still present or growing, repeat treatments will be
      applied following the same procedure.

      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the most common cause of blindness in
      patients over the age of 60. Most vision loss in this disease results from sequelae of
      choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) formation. CNVM is usually composed of well-formed
      neovascularization and occult (less well-formed) neovascularization. While clinical trials
      have shown that some patients, mostly those with well-formed CNVM, may benefit from laser
      photocoagulation or photodynamic therapy, at present there is no treatment for patients who
      have combined CNVM lesions (both well-formed and occult) whose area of occult
      neovascularization is greater than 50% or who have other presentation of CNVM such as
      pigment-epithelial detachment or neovascular fibrosis.

      Retinal histopathology of patients with choroidal neovascularization has revealed that areas
      of CNVM are usually fed by a few smaller choroidal feeder vessels originating from the
      choroid or choriocapillaris. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that closure of these feeder
      vessels would infarct the large CNVM complex. Until recently, identification of these feeder
      vessels has been difficult but new high speed indocyanine imaging of the choroid (Phi-motion)
      indocyanine green angiography (ICG) has allowed for more precise detection of these vessels.
      We will test this hypothesis by utilizing Phi-motion ICG to identify choroidal feeder vessels
      in patients with CNVM not amenable to approved treatments. If feeder vessels are identified,
      then pulse-diode laser photocoagulation will be used to attempt closure of these vessels. The
      study is designed to provide information on the feasibility of standardizing this procedure
      and estimating its potential efficacy. The primary outcome will be a greater than 50%
      reduction in the area of leakage from the neovascular component as determined by fluorescein
      angiogram. Secondary outcomes will include a complete resolution of leakage measured by
      fluorescein angiography, the number of repetitive laser treatments undergone, the number of
      patients eligible by fluorescein angiogram but without identifiable feeder vessels, and the
      number of patients with vision loss, from baseline, of 15 letters or more, 30 letters or
      more, or are reduced to less than 5 letters read. All adverse events regardless of severity
      or relatedness to the therapy will be collected and summarized. Assessment of all outcomes
      will be made at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post laser treatment, and 24 months
      after enrollment. This study will give investigators some insight into this technology and
      the feasibility of this treatment in patients with various forms of neovascular AMD. In
      addition, the results of the study will provide the foundation for larger studies of this
      therapy.

               1. To participate in this study, the patient must understand and sign the protocol
                  informed consent.

               2. Age greater than or equal to 50 years.

               3. In at least one eye, diagnosis of AMD defined by the presence of drusen larger
                  than 63 microm and the presence of choroidal neovascularization under the fovea
                  determined by the Principal Investigator and defined as any one of the following
                  fluorescein angiographic features:

                    1. Early stippled hyperfluorescence of flat retinal pigment epithelium with
                       ill-defined boundary and little or mild leakage in the late frames of the
                       fluorescein.

                    2. Irregular elevation of the retinal pigment epithelium that does not exhibit
                       discrete or bright hyperfluorescence in the early transit phase of the
                       angiogram. Stippled hyperfluorescence may be present. Late frames may show
                       persistent fluorescein staining or leakage within a sensory retinal
                       detachment overlying this area.

                    3. Early well-defined lacy hyperfluorescence with late frames that show
                       persistent fluorescein staining or leakage.

                       progressive filling during the study and persistent leakage/staining of the
                       space. This may be associated with a &quot;notch&quot; at the borders, areas of more
                       localized leakage at the edge or irregular filling of the area with discrete
                       areas of blockage.

                    5. Early hyperfluorescence with late frames that shown progressive staining and
                       leakage into surrounding tissue. The eligible eye will be considered the
                       study eye. If both eyes are eligible, the eye with the worse visual acuity
                       will be considered the study eye.

               4. Patient must have at least one potential feeder vessels in the study eye
                  identified using Phi-motion ICG.

                  the macular area according to standard clinical practice can be obtained.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Choroidal neovascularization, in the study eye, associated with other ocular diseases
             such as pathologic myopia, ocular histoplasmosis or posterior uveitis, etc.

          2. Presence of geographic atrophy under the fovea in the study eye.

          3. Decreased vision, in the study eye, due to retinal disease not attributable to CNVM,
             such as nonexudative forms of ARM, geographic atrophy, inherited retinal dystrophy,
             uveitis or epiretinal membrane.

          4. Decreased vision, in the study eye, due to significant media opacity such as corneal

          7. Allergy to shellfish, iodine or previous iodine containing dyes.

          8. Medical problems that make consistent follow-up over the treatment period unlikely
             (e.g. stroke, severe MI, terminal carcinoma).

          9. Current use of or likely need for systemic or ocular medications known to be toxic to
             the lens, retina or optic nerve, such as:
