      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining oxaliplatin with capecitabine
      in treating patients who have colorectal, appendix, or small bowel cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine when administered with
           oxaliplatin in patients with colorectal, appendiceal, or small bowel cancer.

        -  Determine the clinical toxic effects associated with this regimen in these patients.

        -  Characterize the molecular profile of tumor tissue obtained prior to study entry for
           determinants of sensitivity to this regimen in this patient population.

        -  Characterize the molecular profile of a surrogate normal tissue (bone marrow aspirate)
           obtained prior to treatment and assess any potential drug-associated induction of DNA
           damage and inhibition of thymidylate synthase with a repeat bone marrow aspirate during
           therapy.

        -  Assess any clinical activity of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of capecitabine.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 followed by oral capecitabine twice
      daily on days 1-5 and 8-12. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 106 patients will be accrued for this study within 36 months.
