      This randomized clinical trial will determine the efficacy of physicians providing weight
      control advice to their overweight and obese patients in primary care practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled physicians are randomly assigned to receive brief training in either: 1) behavioral
      weight control intervention or 2) obesity education. Enrolled patients are asked to see their
      physician for 2 weight control consultations during the year to discuss their weight and
      physical activity. Regardless of the training the physician receives, the weight control
      advice is tailored to the individual patient. Patients include men and women between the ages
      of 21 - 70 years, with a Body-Mass Index of 27 or greater, and they have met medical and
      other study eligibility criteria in order to safely participate. As a participant in the
      trial, all patients are asked to attend an initial baseline assessment, and two follow-up
      assessments; 3 and 12 months after their first weight control consultation visit with their
      physician in order to evaluate any changes in their weight, waist circumference, physical
      activity, eating patterns, and mood. The findings of this important study will shed light
      upon the role physician advice may have in helping overweight and obese patients lose weight
      and become more physically active.
