  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project has four primary objectives: 1) Determine if blind rehabilitation improves the
      quality of life of legally blind veterans; 2) Determine the relationship between quality of
      life and visual function; 3) Determine if factors, such as cognitive status, level of
      depression, age and the presence of additional medical conditions besides vision loss,
      intervention of blind rehabilitation extends beyond the visually impaired individual and
      improve the quality of life of their primary caregiver (e.g. spouse, partner, family member
      or friend.)
