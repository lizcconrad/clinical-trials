  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of the drug riluzole on Parkinson's disease symptoms and
      on dyskinesias (involuntary movements) that develop as a result of long-term treatment with
      levodopa. Riluzole blocks the action of the chemical messenger glutamate, thought to be
      involved in producing Parkinson's symptoms. The drug is currently approved to treat
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, another neurologic condition.

      Patients with relatively advanced Parkinson's disease between 20 and 80 years of age may be
      eligible for this 4-week study. Participants will have a complete medical history and
      physical examination, and a detailed neurological evaluation. The evaluations will include
      blood tests and an electrocardiogram, and possibly brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT
      scan, and chest X-ray.

      Participants will, if possible, stop taking all antiparkinsonian medications except levodopa
      (Sinemet) for one month before the study begins and throughout its duration. For the first 1
      to 3 days, patients will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center to undergo a levodopa
      &quot;dose-finding&quot; procedure. For this study, patients will stop taking their oral Sinemet and
      instead will have levodopa infused through a vein for up to 8 hours/day. During the
      infusions, the levodopa dose will be increased slowly until either 1) parkinsonian symptoms
      improve, 2) unacceptable side effects occur, or 3) the maximum study dose is reached.
      Symptoms will be monitored frequently to find two infusion rates: 1) one that is less than
      what is needed to relieve symptoms (suboptimal rate), and 2) one that relieves symptoms but
      may produce dyskinesias (optimal rate).

      When the dose-finding phase is completed, treatment will begin. Patients will take riluzole
      or placebo (a look-a-like pill with no active ingredient) twice a day, along with their
      regular Sinemet, for 3 weeks. (All participants will receive placebo at some time during the
      study, and some patients will receive only placebo throughout the entire 4 weeks.) At the end
      of each week, patients will be readmitted to the hospital and receive the previous week's
      dose of riluzole or placebo in combination with a levodopa infusion at the rate determined in
      the dose-finding phase of the study. The procedure for the infusion will be the same as that
      for the dose-finding phase. The dose of riluzole will be increased until the optimum dose has
      been achieved or until side effects occur (at which time the dose will be lowered or the drug
      stopped).

      Throughout the study, parkinsonian symptoms and dyskinesias will be evaluated using
      standardized rating scales and blood samples will be drawn periodically to measure drug
      levels.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the acute effects of a nonselective inhibitor of
      glutamate mediated synaptic transmission on the severity of parkinsonian signs and
      levodopa-associated motor response complications in patients with moderately advanced
      Parkinson's disease. In a controlled proof-of-principle clinical trial, the efficacy of the
      glutamate release inhibitor riluzole will be assessed through the use of validated motor
      function scales. Safety will be monitored by means of frequent clinical evaluations and
      laboratory tests.

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Males and females between the ages of 20-80 are eligible for study. Women must be either at
        least one year post-menopausal, or using an adequate contraceptive method for at least one
        month prior to and during participation in this study. All will carry the diagnosis of
        idiopathic Parkinson's disease based on the presence of a characteristic clinical history
        and neurological findings. All will have relatively advanced disease with
        levodopa-associated motor response complications, including peak-dose dyskinesias and
        wearing-off fluctuations.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The presence or history of any medical condition that can reasonably be expected to subject
        the patient to unwarranted risk. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities
        including liver enzyme elevations more than two times the upper limit of normal, or
        neutropenia (wbc less than 3000).

        Parkinson's disease patients exhibiting diphasic or end-of dose dyskinesias or disabling
        dystonia will be excluded. Patients who are unable to be treated with levodopa/carbidopa
        alone or with a single, relatively short-acting dopamine agonist will also be excluded.

        Patients with a form of parkinsonism other than idiopathic PD or with a diagnosis of
        dementia (MMSE less than 24) or major psychiatric disorder (UPDRS [Part I Item 3] greater
        than or equal to 2).

        Patients with unacceptable prior/concomitant medications will also be excluded.

        Since the influence of any investigational compound on the unborn child and reproductive
        organs is unknown, pregnant women and those not practicing effective means of birth control
        will be excluded as well.

        Patients with prior bilateral surgical intervention for the treatment of parkinsonian
        symptoms, i.e. deep brain stimulation, pallidotomy, fetal tissue transplantation as well as
        patients must at risk for hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, and/or myocardial ischemia
        secondary to intravenous levodopa challenge will be excluded.
