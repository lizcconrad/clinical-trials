      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as PET and MRI scans, may help to measure a patient's
      response to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This diagnostic trial is studying how well PET and/or MRI scans work in assessing
      changes in tumor blood supply in patients receiving antiangiogenesis therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the ability of positron emission tomography (PET) to assess the effect of
           therapy directed against tumor vasculatures on tumor blood flow and tumor blood volume
           in patients enrolled on a treatment protocol evaluating a therapeutic modality effecting
           the tumor associated vasculature.

        -  Evaluate the ability of PET to assess the effects of this type of therapy regimen on
           tumor uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the effects of
           therapy directed against the tumor vasculature on tumor blood flow and tumor vascular
           density in these patients.

        -  Compare the findings on PET and/or MRI with those obtained from conventional CT in this
           patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a diagnostic study conducted concurrently with a therapeutic modality study.

      Patients have magnetic resonance imaging and/or positron emission tomography (PET) scans
      performed prior to start of therapy, 6 weeks and 16 weeks following the initiation of
      therapy, and 6 weeks following the completion of therapy. Each scan requires about 1-3 hours.
      Patients receive up to 3 different PET scans including tumor blood flow scan with H2015,
      tumor blood volume scan with 11CO, and glucose uptake scan with fludeoxyglucose F 18.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 145 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
