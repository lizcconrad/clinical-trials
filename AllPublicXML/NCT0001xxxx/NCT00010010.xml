      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      exemestane plus goserelin may fight breast cancer by reducing the production of estrogen.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of exemestane and goserelin in treating
      premenopausal women who have metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous
      tamoxifen.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of exemestane and goserelin in premenopausal women with
      hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer after tamoxifen failure. II. Determine the
      toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the hormonal profile of patients
      treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the predictive value of HER-2, epidermal growth
      factor receptor, and estrogen receptor for response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral exemestane daily on days 1-28 and goserelin subcutaneously on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
