  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death in the elderly. Silent
      myocardial ischemia (SI) is a manifestation of CAD in which there is a transient alteration
      in myocardial perfusion, function, and/or electrical activity not accompanied by chest pain.
      Mental and emotional stress, in particular hostility and anger are potent inducers of SI,
      Individuals with SI are at a 3-5 fold higher risk for the development of angina, myocardial
      infarction and death than subjects without SI.

      The hypothesis of this study is that older individuals with occult cad, mental stress/
      emotional arousal (anger) increases sympathetic nervous system activity resulting in
      vasoconstriction thereby eliciting transient episodes of SI. Therefore an aerobic exercise
      intervention that reduces the response to anger/hostility and improves vascular compliance
      will decrease the ischemic burden in SI patients. The specific objectives are: To determine
      if non-smoking older individuals with exercise-induced SI have increased vasoreactivity
      (blood pressure, heart rate) responses to the laboratory presentation of mental stressors,
      decreased vascular compliance and brachial artery endothelial reactivity compared to matched
      non-ischemic controls; 2) To perform a randomized clinical trial that will examine the
      effects of 9 months of aerobic exercise training versus usual care on vasoreactivity,
      vascular compliance and ischemic burden on Holter monitor. Older individuals without a
      history of overt CAD will be recruited and evaluated for the presence of exercise-induced SI.
      Baseline cross-sectional comparisons of vasoreactivity and cardiovascular function will be
      performed between those with SI and non-ischemic controls. The individuals with SI will be
      enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of exercise vs usual care. Exercise treadmill testing
      with measurement of maximal aerobic capacity will be used to determine fitness. Vasoactivity
      will be quantified during a mental stress test with real time 2d echo imaging. Vascular
      function will be assessed using high frequency ultrasound measurements of flow-mediated
      brachial artery endothelial reactivity.
