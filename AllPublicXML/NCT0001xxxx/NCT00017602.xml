      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Oblimersen may increase the effectiveness of dexamethasone by
      making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. It is not yet known if dexamethasone is more
      effective with or without oblimersen in treating multiple myeloma.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of dexamethasone with or
      without oblimersen in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the time to disease progression in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple
           myeloma treated with dexamethasone with or without oblimersen.

        -  Compare the duration of response and objective response rate in patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Compare the proportion of patients without disease progression after 6 months and the
           proportion of patients who have not discontinued treatment after 6 months in these two
           patient groups.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to response to prior therapy (relapsed vs refractory), prior autologous stem cell
      transplantation (yes vs no), and number of prior therapy regimens (1-2 vs 3-6). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I

        -  Induction: Patients receive oblimersen (G3139) IV continuously on days 1-7 and 15-21 and
           oral dexamethasone daily on days 4-7, 11-14, and 18-21.

        -  Maintenance: One week after completion of induction therapy, patients with stable or
           responsive disease receive G3139 IV continuously on days 1-7 and oral dexamethasone
           daily on days 4-7. Courses repeat every 3 weeks for a maximum of 1 year in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Arm II

        -  Induction: Patients receive oral dexamethasone daily for 4 days on weeks 1-3.

        -  Maintenance: One week after completion of induction therapy, patients with stable or
           responsive disease receive oral dexamethasone daily for 4 days. Courses repeat every 3
           weeks for a maximum of 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
