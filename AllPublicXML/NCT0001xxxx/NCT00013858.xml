  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine the effects of prenatal exposure to environmental
      contaminants on cognitive and behavioral development and physical growth in two groups of
      Inuit infants-one in Northern Quebec; the other in Greenland.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to prevailing weather patterns and ocean currents, certain environmental contaminants are
      transported to the Arctic region. The Inuit are among the most heavily exposed populations on
      earth due to the prevalence of these contaminants in traditional foods that comprise a large
      portion of their diet. The contaminants assessed in this study include polychlorinated
      biphenyls (PCBs), methylmercury, selenium, organochlorine pesticides, and lead. These
      contaminants are measured in umbilical cord blood samples obtained at birth, milk samples
      obtained from breast-feeding mothers and, in the case of mercury, hair samples obtained from
      the mothers. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are also assessed in these samples to examine
      the degree to which these nutrients may protect against adverse effects attributable to these
      contaminants.
