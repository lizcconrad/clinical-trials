      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.
      Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells
      from growing. Combining vaccine therapy with biological therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness in combining vaccine therapy and biological
      therapy in treating patients who have relapsed prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the optimal (in terms of antibody response) and safe dose range of
           glycosylated MUC-2-Globo H-KLH conjugate vaccine with adjuvant GPI-0100 in patients with
           biochemically relapsed prostate cancer.

        -  Assess post-immunization changes in prostate-specific antigen levels and other objective
           parameters of disease in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of GPI-0100.

      Patients receive glycosylated MUC-2-Globo H-KLH conjugate vaccine with adjuvant GPI-0100
      subcutaneously weekly on weeks 0-2, 6, 14, and 26 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression.

      Cohorts of 5 patients receive escalating doses of GPI-0100 until the optimal dose, based on
      antibody response, is reached.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.
