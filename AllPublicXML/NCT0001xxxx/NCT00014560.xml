      RATIONALE: Antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing
      substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of antibody therapy in treating patients
      who have refractory or relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of bispecific antibody
           4G7xH22 in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic
           lymphocytic leukemia.

        -  Assess the clinical toxicity of this antibody in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of bispecific antibody (BsAb) 4G7xH22.

      Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on day 1 and BsAb 4G7xH22 IV over 2
      hours on day 2. Treatment repeats weekly for a total of 3 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BsAb 4G7xH22 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks, monthly for 3 months, and then periodically for 1
      year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients will be accrued for this study.
