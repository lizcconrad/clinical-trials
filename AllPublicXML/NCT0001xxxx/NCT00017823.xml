      by the hands instead of needles) can help nausea and vomiting in persons with HIV/AIDS.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial (a study to evaluate effectiveness in a small number of patients).
      Patients will get 4 acupressure treatments and will wear acupressure wristbands for 1 week.
      Patients will write down all drugs they take and will make a note of when they get nausea and
      vomiting. They also will give written answers to different questions. No drugs will be given
      as part of this study. Patients will be paid for participating.
