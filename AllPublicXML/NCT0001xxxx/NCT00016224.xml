      RATIONALE: Drugs such as thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by stopping blood
      flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating women who have
      epithelial ovarian cancer that has not responded to previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the time to progression of disease in patients with platinum-refractory or
           resistant ovarian epithelial carcinoma treated with thalidomide.

        -  Evaluate the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-15 months.
