      Background:

      It is estimated that the VHA is caring for nearly 40 percent of all HIV-infected veterans. To
      benefit from recent improvements in anti-HIV therapy, patients need to take their medications
      consistently.

      Objectives:

      Optimizing health for HIV patients requires excellent adherence to antiretroviral medication
      regimens. However, its unclear how best to incorporate adherence education and support
      programs into VA HIV outpatient care. We implemented and evaluated a pharmacist program (ACE)
      and a Pager reminder program to support adherence in veterans with HIV.

      Methods:

      We used a quasi-experimental design with pre-post evaluation at four VA Centers. Three
      treatment conditions (ACE, Pager, Usual Care) were rolled-in sequentially over two study
      phases, allowing for group comparisons between conditions. ACE is a multi-component
      manualized 4-session, individual patient education and support program by trained
      pharmacists. The Pager intervention used alphanumeric pagers to remind patients of dosing
      times. Electronically-monitored medication adherence (MEMS), self-report questionnaires, and
      pharmacy refill records were collected. Qualitative site interviews were collected before and
      after interventions to assist with program evaluation. Multilevel mixed models were used to
      analyze main study outcomes over time. Secondary analyses compared subgroup who actually
      received all ACE sessions (�as treated�) to controls.

      Status:

      Project has been completed and Final Report submitted to HSR&amp;D CO.
