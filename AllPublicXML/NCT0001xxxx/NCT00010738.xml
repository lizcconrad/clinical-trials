      To study the effects of Transcendental Meditation on Coronary Heart Disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of acute cardiac events -
      specifically, identification of the roles that arterial vasomotor dysfunction and autonomic
      nervous system imbalances play in the pathophysiologic cascade during such acute events -
      provides a platform for new mechanistic investigation of the interplay of psychosomatic
      stress and CHD (coronary heart disease). Preliminary evidence further suggests that
      Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) practices, such as the Transcendental Meditation
      (TM) technique, can not only reduce stress but also reduce acute cardiac events in patients
      with CHD. Based on these and related data, we propose a randomized, blinded, controlled study
      of the effects of one CAM practice, the TM technique, compared to a control group, on the
      primary outcomes of (1) arterial vasomotor dysfunction (brachial artery reactivity); (2)
      autonomic nervous system imbalances (heart rate variability); (3) transient myocardial
      ischemia (ST-segment depression); and (4) the secondary outcomes of psychological stress and
      quality of life (anger, hostility, anxiety, depression, perceived health, disease-specific
      symptoms, and life stress/social resources).
