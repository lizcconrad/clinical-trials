    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating patients who have
      myelodysplastic syndrome. Thalidomide may improve the immune system's ability to fight
      myelodysplastic syndrome

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether thalidomide improves cytopenias in patients with myelodysplastic
      syndromes.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine whether this
      regimen down regulates the peripheral blood levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon
      gamma, and interleukin-12 and whether these changes correlate with clinical response in these
      patients.

      IV. Determine whether this regimen alters the peripheral blood T-cell subset distribution and
      whether these changes correlate with clinical response in these patients.

      V. Determine the effect of this regimen on bone marrow microvessel density and whether these
      effects correlate with clinical response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prognosis
      (favorable vs unfavorable). (Favorable stratum closed to accrual 12/28/01)

      Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily. Treatment continues for 5 years in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 1 year and then annually for 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-58 patients (10-29 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 20 months. (Favorable stratum closed to accrual 12/28/01)
