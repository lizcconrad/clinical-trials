      The goal of this study is to establish the mechanism(s) of progression of primarily spinal
      syringomyelia (PSS). Our preliminary study of syringomyelia emphasized syringomyelia
      associated with craniocervical junction abnormalities (CCJAS), such as the Chiari I
      malformation. This new protocol will expand the scope of our investigation to include
      primarily spinal syringomyelia (PSS), which is defined as syringomyelia not associated with
      craniocervical junction abnormalities (CCJAS). Etiologies of primarily spinal syringomyelia
      include 1) intradural scarring which is post-traumatic, post-inflammatory, or post-operative,
      2) intradural-extramedullary masses such as arachnoid cysts or meningiomas, and 3)
      extramedullary-extradural spinal lesions such as cervical spondylosis or spinal deformity.

      Our hypothesis is the following: Primarily spinal syringomyelia (PSS), results from
      obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow within the spinal subarachnoid space; this
      obstruction affects spinal CSF dynamics because the spinal subarachnoid space accepts the
      fluid that is displaced from the intracranial subarachnoid space as the brain expands during
      cardiac systole; in the case of primarily spinal syringomyelia (PSS), a subarachnoid block
      effectively shortens the spinal subarachnoid space, reducing CSF compliance and the capacity
      of the spinal theca to dampen the subarachnoid CSF pressure waves produced by the brain
      expansion during cardiac systole; the exaggerated spinal subarachnoid pressure waves occur
      with every heartbeat and act on the spinal cord above the block to drive CSF into the spinal
      cord and create a syrinx. Presyringomyelia, a recently described state of spinal cord edema
      associated with progressive myelopathy and obstruction in CSF flow, is a precursor stage to
      syringomyelia that is consistent with this hypothesis. Because of the importance of this
      condition to the pathophysiology of syringomyelia, we will also study patients with
      presyringomyelia in this protocol. After a syrinx is formed, the enlarged subarachnoid
      pressure waves compress the external surface of the spinal cord, propel the syrinx fluid, and
      promote syrinx progression.

      Many neurosurgeons at prominent academic centers routinely use syrinx shunts to treat
      primarily spinal syringomyelia. This study should provide data that a surgical procedure that
      opens the spinal subarachnoid space corrects the underlying pathophysiology and resolves the
      syrinx and that invasion of the spinal cord is unnecessary.

      Objective: The goal of this study is to establish the mechanism(s) of progression of
      primarily spinal syringomyelia (PSS), the type of syringomyelia that is associated with
      pathology in the spinal column and not at the craniocervical junction. Our hypothesis is that
      when a lesion obstructs the spinal subarachnoid space, it shortens the segment of spinal
      canal that dampens the CSF pressure waves that are produced with each heartbeat and creates
      enlarged spinal subarachnoid pressure waves that act on the spinal cord above the block to
      drive CSF into the spinal cord and create a syrinx. After a syrinx is formed, enlarged
      subarachnoid pressure waves compress the external surface of the spinal cord, propel the
      syrinx fluid, and promote syrinx progression.

      Study Population: Subjects will have primary spinal syringomyelia associated with 1)
      intradural scarring which is post-traumatic, post-inflammatory, or post-operative, 2)
      intradural-extramedullary masses such as arachnoid cysts or meningiomas, and 3)
      extramedullary-extradural spinal lesions such as cervical spondylosis or spinal deformity, or
      4) an intramedullary tumor.

      Design: Subjects will have testing before and after standard surgical therapy of
      syringomyelia. Testing includes measurement of CSF pressure, neurologic examination,
      CT-myelography, and MR scanning. Results of CSF pressure measurements before surgery will be
      compared to measurements from normal controls that were previously studied. The effect of
      surgery on CSF pressure, neurologic examination, CT-myelography, and MRI scans will be
      evaluated.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is cervical CSF pulse pressure, which is the
      amplitude of the CSF pressure wave, compared to normal values. Secondary outcomes measures
      include change in CSF pulse pressure, neurologic examination, CT-myelography, and MRI scans
      between before and after surgery.

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        To be eligible to participate in this research study, the subject must:

        Be 18 years of age or older.

        Have syringomyelia documented by MRI.

        Have evidence of neurological deterioration related to syringomyelia or spinal cord tumor.
        Prior surgery for syringomyelia does not result in exclusion from study.

        Be able to comprehend the risks of testing and therapy and to give informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will not eligible to participate in this research study if:

        They are pregnant (because X-rays might injure a fetus).

        They cannot have an MRI scan as determined by a radiologist.

        They have a problem with bleeding that cannot be corrected.

        They are unable to understand the risks of the testing and surgical therapy.

        Their blood test for HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) is positive, because a positive HIV
        test would increase your risk of infection from research testing.

        They have syringomyelia which developed after meningitis, because we have found that
        laminectomy and duroplasty is ineffective in this setting
