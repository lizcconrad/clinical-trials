  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether adding an inter-generational component to an
      existing social network-based lay health advisor intervention increases its effectiveness in
      mobilizing a Native American community to respond to heavy metal contamination from lead and
      zinc mining.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ottawa County, Oklahoma, the site of the research, was heavily mined for zinc and lead in the
      first half of this century. Mine tailings containing heavy metals are stored in large piles
      up to 200 feet in height. Ottawa County is home to 8 Indian tribes and much of the mine waste
      is on tribal land. Specifically, the study will: a) integrate existing Native American youth
      programs with the existing lay health advisor intervention (Society of Clan Mothers and
      Fathers) to form an inter-generational intervention, b) expand the existing lay health
      advisor intervention to address cadmium in addition to lead, c) use participatory research
      methods to involve tribal youth and adults in an air monitoring study, d) assess the extent
      to which the intervention contributes to belief, attitude and behavior changes that will
      reduce heavy metal exposure and absorption in Native American children; and e) assess the
      contribution of the intervention to creating changes in organizational, community, tribal and
      government (city, county, state, federal) capacity to address heavy metal contamination in
      Ottawa County, Oklahoma.
