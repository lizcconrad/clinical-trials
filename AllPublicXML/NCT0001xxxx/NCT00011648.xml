  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how often people with sickle cell anemia develop
      pulmonary hypertension a serious disease in which blood pressure in the artery to the lungs
      is elevated.

      Men and women 18 years of age and older with sickle cell anemia may be eligible for this
      study. Participants will undergo an evaluation at Howard University s Comprehensive Sickle
      Cell Center in Washington, D.C. or at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,
      Maryland. It will include the following:

        -  medical history

        -  physical examination

        -  blood collection (no more than 50 ml., or about 1/3 cup) to confirm the diagnosis of
           sickle cell anemia, sickle cell trait or beta-thalassemia (Some blood will be stored for
           future research testing on sickle cell anemia.)

        -  echocardiogram (ultrasound test of the heart) to check the pumping action of the heart
           and the rate at which blood travels through the tricuspid valve.

      Following this evaluation, a study nurse will contact participants twice a month for 2 months
      and then once every 3 months for the next 3 years for a telephone interview. The interview
      will include questions about general health and recent health-related events, such as
      hospitalizations or emergency room visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder and the most common genetic disease
      affecting African-Americans. Approximately 0.15% of African-Americans are homozygous for
      sickle cell disease, and 8% have sickle cell trait. Acute pain crisis, acute chest syndrome
      (ACS), and secondary pulmonary hypertension are common complications of sickle cell anemia.
      Mortality rates of sickle cell patients with pulmonary hypertension are significantly
      increased as compared to patients without pulmonary hypertension. Recent studies report up to
      40% mortality at 22 months after detection of elevated pulmonary artery pressures in sickle
      cell patients. Furthermore, pulmonary hypertension is thought to occur in up to 30% of clinic
      patients with sickle cell anemia.

      This study is designed to determine the prevalence and prognosis of secondary pulmonary
      hypertension in adult patients with sickle cell anemia, and to determine whether genetic
      polymorphisms in candidate genes contribute to its development or response to treatment.
