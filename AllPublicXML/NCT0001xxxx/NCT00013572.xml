      The purpose of this study is to determine the best way to administer the candidate HIV
      vaccine, ALVAC HIV-1 (vCP205).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy adult volunteers are assigned randomly to either a vaccine or placebo group.
      Injections are received either intramuscularly, intradermally, or by delivery under the skin
      of the volunteer's own white blood cells which have had dendritic cell reinfusion. Volunteers
      are vaccinated at 0, 1, 3, and 6 month time points. Volunteers are closely monitored for 1
      hour after vaccination and keep a diary of symptoms for 1 week post-immunization. Volunteers
      undergo leukopheresis at the start of the study and after the last vaccination at Walter Reed
      Army Medical Center. Volunteers receive compensation benefits.
