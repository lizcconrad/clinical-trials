    <textblock>
      This study will examine differences in how the brain processes English and Korean in native
      Korean speakers who are fluent and non-fluent in English as a second language. It is thought
      that people who are non-fluent in a second language process the second language differently
      from their native language-using different areas of the brain and requiring additional
      working memory. The study will increase understanding of language acquisition, brain
      plasticity and bilingualism.

      Native Korean speakers between 18 and 50 years of age with English as a second language may
      be eligible for this study. Three groups of individuals will be enrolled: 1) less fluent
      bilinguals - those who have lived in the United States for at least 1, but less than 2 years
      and studied English after age 12 and who have a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language)
      score above 550; 2) fluent bilinguals with early acquisition - those who were exposed to
      English before age 7 and lived in the United States after that; and 3) fluent bilinguals with
      late acquisition - those who were exposed to English after age 12 and lived in the United
      States after age 10. People with a history of head injury or neurological or thought
      disorder, left-handed people, and people who cannot read the material used in the study will
      be excluded from the study.

      Participants will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning while reading words in
      English or Korean; while translating from one language to the other; and while answering
      questions about the meaning of words in each language. MRI uses a strong magnetic field to
      image brain tissue. The patient lies on a table that slides into a narrow metal cylinder,
      which is the scanner. The head is restrained gently with foam padding to limit movement. The
      patient can see out of the scanner through a mirror and is in contact with the technician via
      an intercom at all times during the procedure. The scans measures blood flow to different
      parts of the brain, providing information about what brain regions are being used during the
      tasks performed. Another scan will be done to obtain a detailed picture of the brain's
      structure.

      This study will evaluate the usefulness of MRI in identifying brain areas involved in
      processing different languages and increase knowledge about how illness affects brain
      function. It may help plan treatment for bilingual patients who must undergo brain surgery
      for uncontrolled epilepsy or who have a neurological disorder affecting different languages
      with varying degrees.

    <textblock>
      This protocol will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the
      localization of verbal working memory and translation systems in normal volunteers who speak
      English as a second language. Several important issues in areas such as language acquisition,
      cortical plasticity, and bilingualism will be advanced by an increased understanding of how
      multiple languages are represented in the brain. There are also an increasing number of
      bilingual patients who need to undergo surgical intervention, particularly for uncontrolled
      epilepsy, or suffer from a variety of neurological disorders affecting different languages to
      varying degrees. It is very important to accurately assess and localize language functions in
      these patients. This study will identify cortical areas activated by the immediate
      translation of words and sentences between native and second languages, as well as
      differences in verbal working memory systems between two languages. It will also evaluate
      differences in verbal working memory and translation systems among subjects with different
      proficiency and different age at acquisition of their second language. This study will
      advance our understanding of the cortical representation that underlies multiple language
      functions.
