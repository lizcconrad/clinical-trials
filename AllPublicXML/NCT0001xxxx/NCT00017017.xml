      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of CT-2103 in treating patients who have
      recurrent ovarian epithelial or fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate and time to treatment failure in patients with recurrent
           ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma treated with
           CT-2103.

        -  Determine the tolerability and safety of the previously established dose and schedule of
           CT-2103 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive CT-2103 IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      If no more than 1 of the first 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity, then the
      remaining patients receive a higher dose of CT-2103.

      Patients are followed between 1-3 months and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
