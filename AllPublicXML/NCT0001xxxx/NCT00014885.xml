  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project studies the relationship between lead exposure and academic achievement in
      college students. Most studies of the neurobehavioral effects of lead have focused on
      performances at the low end of the distribution. There is evidence that lead affects outcome
      across the entire distribution. This is a retrospective cohort study of subjects whose
      cognitive function is adequate to gain admission to college. We will use x-ray fluorescence
      to measure bone lead concentrations in undergraduate college students and test the hypothesis
      that achievement scores are related to early lead exposure. Early lead exposure has been
      shown to have measurable effects on academic performance and neurobehavioral outcomes at 18
      years of age. Should an effect be found in this study, the spectrum of lead toxicity would be
      expanded to include subjects with above average function.
