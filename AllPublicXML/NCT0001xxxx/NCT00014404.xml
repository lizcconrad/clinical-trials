  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development of cancer. The use of celecoxib may be an effective way to prevent the further
      development of precancerous lesions in the mouth.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of different regimens of
      celecoxib in treating patients who have precancerous lesions in the mouth.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of celecoxib, in terms of clinical response and
      histological response, in patients with oral premalignant lesions. II. Evaluate the safety of
      chronic multiple dosing of celecoxib in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to premalignant risk (early vs advanced). Patients in each stratum
      are randomized to 1 of 3 treatments arms. Arm I: Patients receive lower-dose oral celecoxib
      twice daily. Arm II: Patients receive higher-dose oral celecoxib twice daily. Arm III:
      Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. Treatment continues in all 3 arms for 12 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 18, 24,
      and 26 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 84 patients (42 per stratum, 14 per arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 6 months.
