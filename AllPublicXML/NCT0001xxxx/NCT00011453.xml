  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are investigating the role of an enzyme (NQO1) in protection against the bone marrow
      toxicity of the occupational and environmental toxicant benzene. All of the proposed studies
      involve use of human bone marrow cells in-vitro to define mechanisms of NQO1-mediated
      protection. Cells are obtained from healthy volunteers and protocols have undergone IRB
      review and approval.
