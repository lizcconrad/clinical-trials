  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis remains associated with a high mortality (approximately 22% per year) and many
      complications despite improvements over the last twenty years. Several nephrologists have
      suggested that increasing the frequency and amount of dialysis will result in improved
      outcomes. In fact, various forms of daily dialysis have been performed in over 300 patients
      in the last 30 years with improvements in blood pressure, quality-of-life, bone disease, and
      other complications of renal failure. Whether this form of treatment can be expanded to the
      220,000 Americans on hemodialysis is unknown. The primary outcome of this study is to
      determine the effectiveness of nocturnal dialysis in hemodialysis patients in St. Louis. If
      the pilot study is effective, then participation in a larger, multicenter trial is expected.
      The endpoints measured are use of antihypertensive medications, improvement in secondary
      hyperparathyroidism and use of phosphorus binders, quality-of-life measured by SF-36 surveys,
      and improvement in physical function as measured by maximal oxygen uptake.
