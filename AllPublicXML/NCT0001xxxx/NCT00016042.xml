      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune
      system and stop cancer cells from growing. Combining chemotherapy with biological therapy may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of fluorouracil combined with biological
      therapy in treating patients who have metastatic kidney or colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of fluorouracil and interleukin-12-primed activated T
      cells (12ATC) with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interferon alfa in patients with metastatic
      renal cell cancer or colorectal cancer. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 12ATC in
      this patient population. III. Determine the clinical response of patients treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of interleukin-12-primed activated T cells (12ATC).
      Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5 and undergo
      leukopheresis on day 6 to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Patients treated
      at dose level 3 also undergo leukopheresis on day 7. The PBMC are treated with monoclonal
      antibody anti-CD3, interleukin-12 and interleukin-2 to form 12ATC. Patients receive
      chemo/immunotherapy comprising fluorouracil IV continuously over 24 hours on day 13 and
      GM-CSF and interferon alfa SC on days 17, 19, 21, 24, 26, and 28. Patients receive 12ATC IV
      over 15-30 minutes on days 31, 34, 38, 41, 45, and 48 and interferon alfa SC on days 35, 42,
      and 49. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 12ATC until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 weeks, every 3 months
      for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-18 patients will be accrued for this study.
