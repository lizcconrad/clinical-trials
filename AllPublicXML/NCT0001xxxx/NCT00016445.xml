      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of growth hormone on height, height velocity, body
      weight, and lean body mass in patients with cystic fibrosis.

      II. Determine the effect of growth hormone on pulmonary function in these patients.

      III. Determine the impact of this drug on the quality of life in these patients.

      IV. Determine if the clinical response from this drug is sustained in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive growth hormone subcutaneously (SC) daily for 1 year during the first
      year only.

      Arm II: Patients receive growth hormone SC daily for 1 year during the second year only.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 6 months for 2 years.
