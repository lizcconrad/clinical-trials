      Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of
      immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system
      recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of
      bryostatin 1 combined with sargramostim in treating patients who have refractory myeloid
      cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of continuous intravenous infusion bryostatin-1
      when given in combination with GM-CSF.

      II. To describe and quantify the frequency of toxicity of the combination of continuous
      intravenous infusion bryostatin-1 and subcutaneously administered GM-CSF.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the impact of the combination of bryostatin-1 and GM-CSF on the
      differentiation and cell cycle distribution of myeloid cells in vivo.

      II. To describe the impact of the combination of bryostatin-1 and GM-CSF on T lymphocyte
      populations.

      III. To assess the pharmacokinetics of continuous infusion bryostatin-1.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bryostatin 1.

      Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV continuously and sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously once
      daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease stabilization or improvement may
      continue treatment for up to 12 courses.

      Cohorts of 2 patients receive escalating doses of bryostatin 1 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 30% of patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The diagnosis of MDS must be confirmed by a bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy
             revealing refractory anemia, or primary refractory leukopenia or thrombocytopenia with
             morphologic features of MDS; patients with 5q- syndrome are ineligible; patients with
             RA and RARS are eligible provided they are transfusion dependent. Patients with
             chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL) are eligible; allogeneic BMT will be the
             treatment priority for patients with HLA-matched siblings; MDS patients for whom
             intensive chemotherapy has failed to achieve remission will be candidates for this
             trial if the chemotherapy was administered &gt; 1 month prior to enrollment, and
             performance status is adequate; patients are also eligible having previously
             progressed on other institutional trials, including phenylbutyrate and ATRA or
             5'-azacytadine

          -  Patients must have a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy confirmed diagnosis of relapsed
             AML within 4 weeks of registering for this trial; patients will be eligible only if
             their WBC is &lt; 30 x 103/:l and stable for at least 7 days, and if they are unlikely to
             require cytotoxic therapy during the duration of the trial; patients may not have APL

          -  Newly diagnosed patients may be considered for this trial provided they do not qualify
             for potentially curative intensive chemotherapeutic regimens; patients with APL are
             not eligible for this trial; patients who have refused chemotherapy for untreated AML,
             or who are deemed to be poor candidates medically for AML induction chemotherapy, but
             otherwise meet the criteria list below may enroll on this trial

          -  Patients with accelerated or myeloid blast phase CML are eligible if their blast count
             is &lt; 30 x 103/:L and stable for at least 7 days; patients previously treated for
             chronic phase CML will be eligible for this protocol; patients may also have undergone
             treatment for acceleration or blastic phase provided this is not within 2 weeks of
             enrollment and they meet all the eligibility criteria

          -  All patients with PNH will be eligible provided they are experiencing symptoms
             associated with their disease; in particular, patients experiencing life-threatening
             complications of their illness, including abdominal, central vein or cerebral
             thromboses, active infections, as well as recurrent, symptomatic hemolytic crises and
             do not have other treatment options are encouraged to consider participation

          -  JHOC confirmed and documented diagnosis of either AML, MDS, CML in accelerated or
             blast phase or PNH

          -  Patients must have relatively stable bone marrow function for more than ten days prior
             to enrollment on the study; WBC count doubling within this time period would indicate
             unstable bone marrow function

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1, 2

          -  Patients must have central intravenous access; acceptable access include: PICC lines,
             hickman and hohn catheters, and port-a-caths

          -  Patient or caregiver must be willing to perform subcutaneous injection

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Total serum bilirubin =&lt; 1.6 mg/dL, unless secondary to hemolysis

          -  SGOT/SGPT each &lt; 2 times the upper limit of normal unless disease related (i.e., PNH,
             extramedullary disease)

          -  Hemoglobin should be at least 8 gm/dL at the time of protocol entry; patients may
             receive transfusions to achieve this level

          -  Patients must not have received treatment for their myeloid disorder within 2 weeks of
             beginning the trial; treatments include the use of chemotherapy, hematopoietic growth
             factors, and biologic therapy such as monoclonal antibodies; the exception is the use
             of hydroxyurea for patients with WBC &gt; 10 x 103/:L; this duration of time appears
             adequate for wash out due to the relatively short-acting nature of most anti-leukemia
             agents

          -  Patients must have recovered from all toxicities (to grade 0 or 1) associated with
             previous treatment

          -  Patients must not have any clinical symptoms of active CNS disease; if CNS disease is
             suspected, patient must have LP with negative cytology

          -  Patients must not have evidence of pulmonary leukostasis (i.e., the clinical syndrome
             associated with symptomatic shortness of breath or hypoxia which is directly
             attributed to an elevated white blood cell count and the resulting capillary ischemia)
             or disseminated intravascular coagulation (i.e., the clinical syndrome associated with
             systemic intravascular clotting which is directly attributed to excessive
             procoagulants that overwhelm the inhibitory arm of the coagulation cascade)

          -  All women of potential child bearing must have negative serum B-HCG and use an
             effective means of birth control throughout the trial period

          -  Patients must be able to provide informed consent and to return to clinic for adequate
             follow up as required by the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of RA with 5q- syndrome

          -  Leukemia with blast count &gt; 30 x 103/:L, uncontrolled with hydroxyurea

          -  APL

          -  CML in lymphoid blast phase

          -  ECOG performance status &gt;= 3

          -  Patients with untreated positive blood cultures or radiographic evidence of active
             infections

          -  Patients with active CNS disease

          -  Patients with a previous history of intolerance to GM-CSF

          -  Pregnant or lactating women are not eligible for this protocol; all patients with
             child-bearing potential must use effective contraception

          -  Patients who have received bryostatin-1 in the past are not eligible for this protocol
