      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop cancer cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining UCN-01 with chemotherapy may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of fludarabine when
      given with UCN-01 in treating patients with recurrent or refractory low-grade lymphoma or
      leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxic effects of fludarabine when administered
           with UCN-01 in patients with recurrent or refractory low-grade or indolent lymphoid
           malignancies.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the activity of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fludarabine.

      Patients receive UCN-01 IV over 72 hours on days 1-3 alone during course 1 and over 36 hours
      on days 1-2 during courses 2-7. Patients also receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes
      beginning on day 1 and continuing for up to 5 days during courses 2-7. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fludarabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 6 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every
      6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed recurrent or refractory low-grade or indolent lymphoid
             malignancies requiring systemic therapy, including the following:

               -  Grade I or II follicular small cleaved cell lymphoma

               -  Small lymphocytic lymphoma/leukemia subtypes (chronic lymphocytic leukemia)

               -  Mantle cell lymphoma

               -  Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia

               -  Lymphoplasmacytoid

               -  Marginal zone (nodal, extranodal, or splenic subtypes)

               -  Hairy cell leukemia

          -  Transformed indolent subtypes allowed provided 1 of the following criteria are met:

               -  Previously treated with a doxorubicin-containing regimen

               -  No rapidly progressing disease that threatens vital functions

          -  Measurable disease

          -  No active leptomeningeal or parenchymal CNS lymphoma NOTE: A new classification scheme
             for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of
             &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former terminology of &quot;low&quot;,
             &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former
             terminology.
