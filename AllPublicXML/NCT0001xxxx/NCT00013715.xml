  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the U.S., morbidity associated with human rhinovirus (RV) infection represents a major
      health problem. In asthmatics, up to 80% of asthma exacerbations are associated with upper
      respiratory infections. Despite evidence that environmental oxidant pollutants, such as
      ozone, may increase the severity of viral disease, the mechanisms underlying such an effect
      have not been identified. This study will test the hypothesis that exposure of allergic
      asthmatic subjects to ambient levels of ozone directly enhances viral disease by increasing
      infectivity and intensifying virus-induced inflammation.

      In mild asthmatics, the study will investigate: (1) if exposure to ozone will enhance the
      viral infective process in the nasal epithelium, (2) the effect of ozone exposure on
      RV-induced inflammatory gene expression, mediator release and inflammatory cell influx into
      the upper and lower airways, and (3) the interactive effects of ozone and RV on airway
      reactivity. This information will improve our understanding of the risk associated with
      oxidant pollutant exposure in this population of individuals in whom RV infection may
      represent a significant health concern.

      <textblock>
        Subjects recruited will be non-asthmatic controls or mild allergic asthmatics using
        beta-agonists, mostly on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis. Selection criteria will include good general
        health by medical history and physical examination, no history of smoking, and the absence
        of respiratory infection in the preceding 6 week period. Subjects will undergo serologic
        testing and must have a negative test for neutralizing antibodies to RV16 to participate in
        all but one study of the project.
