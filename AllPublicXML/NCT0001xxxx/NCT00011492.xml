  <brief_summary>

      This purpose of this protocol is to evaluate and identify patients who may be eligible for
      actively enrolling NIH clinical research protocols for head and neck cancer; or provide
      standard evaluations and treatment necessary for patients with head and neck cancers enrolled
      in other NIH clinical protocols that do not include such treatment. Participants screened
      under this protocol will not be required to join a research study; the decision will be
      voluntary.

      Patients with head and neck cancer may enroll in this study. Participants may undergo various
      tests, described below, to determine their eligibility for participation in a specific
      clinical trial. Other tests may also be required, depending on the protocol or treatment for
      which the patient is being considered:

        -  Blood tests About 3 to 5 tablespoons of blood will be drawn for routine tests, HLA
           typing and hepatitis and HIV screening.

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) This imaging procedure uses a powerful magnetic field
           to produce pictures of parts of the body in small section views. The test does not use
           radiation and may be done with or without a contrast dye material.

        -  Computerized tomography (CT) This procedure uses x-rays to produces three-dimensional
           images of body organs in small section views. A contrast dye may or may not be used.

        -  Positron emission tomography (PET) PET scans allow the doctor to see the activity of
           cells in specific body tissues. It requires injection of a radioactive material that
           attaches to a sugar fluid. The fluid goes to very active cells, such as cancer cells,
           revealing tumors.

        -  Pulmonary function tests These tests use a machine the patient breathes into to measure
           the volume of air the patient can move in and out of the lungs.

        -  Arteriogram, or angiogram The anatomy of the blood vessels can be seen using this
           procedure, which involves placing a small catheter (plastic tube) into an artery and
           injecting a contrast solution. Special X-rays are then taken to show the blood vessels.

        -  Endoscopy This procedure is done to evaluate the mouth and throat. A tube with a light
           on the end and special fibers is inserted down the throat to allow the surgeon to
           examine the throat and, if needed, biopsy a piece of tissue for microscopic study. The
           test is usually done under general anesthesia in the operating room.

        -  Biopsy A piece of tissue or tumor is removed for examination under the microscope. When
           a biopsy is done in the neck area, a small amount of anesthetic is injected into the
           area of the biopsy. The biopsy may be done with 1) a small needle to pull out some
           tissue, 2) a cookie-cutter-like instrument to punch out a small piece of tissue, or 3) a
           small knife to cut out a piece of tissue. A knife biopsy may be done in the operating
           room or the clinic depending on the location of the biopsy and precautions required.

      When the tests are done, the physician will discuss the results with the patient. Patients
      eligible for a research study will be offered participation. For those not eligible for a
      study, other therapies will be discussed and the patient will return to the care of his or
      her primary physician. In special circumstances, patients may be offered standard
      non-experimental treatment at NIH.

      This protocol will provide a means for screening potential candidates for head and neck
      surgery branch protocols. No investigational treatments will be administered in this
      protocol. The PI may, however, approve a patient who has been determined to be ineligible for
      HNSB protocols to undergo standard treatment because they present a unique clinical
      experience for maintaining skills of HNSB physicians and clinical fellows.
