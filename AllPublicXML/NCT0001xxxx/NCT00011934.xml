      RATIONALE: Biological therapy may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow
      and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of the chemotherapy used
      in treating chronic myeloid leukemia. Bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace
      immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation,
      chemotherapy, and biological therapy in treating patients who have chronic myeloid leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the one year event-free survival in patients with chronic phase
      chronic myeloid leukemia receiving sargramostim (GM-CSF)-treated autologous bone marrow
      transplantation followed by GM-CSF and interferon alfa. II. Determine the toxicity of this
      regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo harvesting of autologous bone marrow. A portion of the cells are
      treated ex vivo with sargramostim (GM-CSF) for 3 days. Patients then receive myeloablative
      chemotherapy with busulfan and cyclophosphamide on days -9 to -2 according to the preparative
      regimen protocol. Patients undergo sargramostim (GM-CSF)-treated autologous bone marrow
      transplantation on day 0. Patients receive GM-CSF subcutaneously daily on days 5-180, and
      interferon alfa daily on days 90-180. Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 6
      months for 2 years, and then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-19 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) by
        cytogenetic and/or molecular analyses No more than 10% blasts on blood and bone marrow
        morphology Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome positive Ph chromosome-negative CML allowed if
        evidence of the BCR-ABL rearrangement by molecular or FISH analyses or evidence of the P120
        protein Duration of CML less than 3 years, unless cytogenetic remission to interferon has
        been achieved Failed to obtain and maintain a complete cytogenetic remission on a prior
        trial of interferon therapy Absence of detectable PH-negative cells in bone marrow or blood
        after 6 months of therapy Lack of a progressive increase in Ph-negative cells between 6 and
        12 months of therapy Less than 50% Ph-negative cells after 12 months of therapy Absence of
        complete cytogenetic remission after 24 months of therapy Inability to tolerate prior
        interferon therapy No accelerated phase or blast crisis CML, chronic myelomonocytic
        leukemia, or juvenile CML Concurrent enrollment on the busulfan and cyclophosphamide
        preparative regimen protocol
