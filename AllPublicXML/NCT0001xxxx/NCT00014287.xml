      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Giving the drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine given directly into the
      bladder in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intravesical gemcitabine in patients
      with recurrent or refractory superficial bladder cancer. II. Determine the dose-limiting
      toxicity and other toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Assess any responses
      in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive intravesical
      gemcitabine that is left in the bladder for 2 hours and then removed on day 1. Treatment
      continues every 7 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of intravesical gemcitabine until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every
      3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study.
