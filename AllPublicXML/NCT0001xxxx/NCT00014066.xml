      RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses light and drugs that make cnacer cells more sensitive to
      light to kill tumor cells. Brachytherapy uses radiation to damage tumor cells. Photodynamic
      therapy combined with brachytherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy plus brachytherapy
      in treating patients with recurrent lung cancer that is blocking the lung passages.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility, toxicity, and effectiveness of combination therapy
      with Photofrin PDT and HDT brachytherapy in patients with endobronchial obstructions from
      lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is not a randomized study. Photofrin solution is administered slowly as a bolus
      injection over 3-5 minutes on day 1. Bronchoscopy is performed under general anesthesia 48
      hours after Photofrin injection. Light is transmitted from the laser to the tumor via quartz
      fiber optics (interstitial or surface PDT). Another bronchoscopy is performed 48 hours after
      PDT treatment to clean out any tissue debris left after PDT treatment. HDR brachytherapy is
      performed using prescribed dose of radiation for 5-10 minutes to designated positions. Repeat
      bronchoscopy is performed 3-4 weeks post HDR brachytherapy and a second HDR brachytherapy
      treatment may be given. Patients are followed every 3 months until death, or for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 16 patients will be entered over 1.5 years.
