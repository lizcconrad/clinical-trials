  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetic differences in response to brain injury may reasonably be expected to play a role in
      the initial consequences of traumatic brain injury and in the rate of recovery from such
      injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polymorphisms in the Apolipoprotein E gene encode functional variants which differentially
      determine the rate at which neuronal repair can occur, and are associated with differences in
      expression of neurodegenerative processes, including traumatic brain injury. It is proposed
      that the accuracy of prediction of outcome after head injury will be significantly increased
      by inclusion of APOE genotype alone, or in combination with other variables such as severity
      of head injury, cognitive, electroencephalographic or neuroradiologic measures, or treatment
      strategies.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients enrolled in the DVHIP are subject to the following recruitment criteria:

          1. Mild, moderate or severe closed head injury, where the cut off between mild and
             moderate is defined by GCS&lt;12. PTA&gt;24 hrs or - foca cerebral contusion on CT/MRI or
             Loss of Consciousness (LOC) &gt; 12 hours.

             Note: the definition of mild, moderate or severe head injury differs widely between
             centers and is absolutely not critical for the work proposed as we will use continuous
             measures of severity throughout.

          2. Within three months of first assessment. (In practice, patients may be recruited after
             3 months. We will deal with this issue by covarying the time from injury to first
             assessment in our analyses).

          3. Rancho Los Amigos cognitive level of 5-7 at first assessment.

          4. Volunteer informed consent signed by patient of family.

          5. Military or veterans health care beneficiary.

          6. Age 17-55

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unwillingness to participate in rehabilitation program or cooperate with
             investigators.

          2. History of prior severe traumatic brain injury of other severe neurologic or
             psychiatric condition, such as psychosis, stroke, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord
             injury.
