  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C (HCV) is a chronic viral illness leading to progressive liver damage that has
      emerged as a major public health issue in the United States. While HCV affects all population
      groups, individuals with a history of intravenous drug use form the largest known risk group.
      Between 90 and 100 percent of long term intravenous drug use will eventually test positive
      for HCV, and there is substantial risk that even short term experimentation will result in
      infection. Studies suggest that HCV will be the major cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer in
      the next century. Currently, approved therapy includes recombinant interferons, which lead to
      sustained remission in a minority of patients. However, patients abusing other substances,
      including alcohol, are not eligible for interferon therapy. The need for investigation into
      other potential therapies is clear. Current practice patterns in the Far East include the use
      of traditional herbal remedies for symptomatic chronic viral hepatitis. This study is
      intended to examine the effect of commonly used herbal remedies for the treatment of
      symptomatic HCV.
