    <textblock>
      This study will explore the possible effectiveness of levetiracetam in patients with bipolar
      illness who have not responded adequately to standard treatments. Levetiracetam was recently
      approved to treat seizures. Other drugs in the same class as levetiracetam, including
      carbamazepine and valproate, are widely recognized as substitute medications for lithium or
      are used as an adjunct to it, and other anticonvulsants have also shown promise in improving
      bipolar symptoms.

      Patients with bipolar illness whose manic, depressed or unstable moods are not adequately
      controlled by their current treatment and who have not responded previously to two standard
      treatments (i.e., lithium, valproate, carbamazepine or neuroleptics) may be eligible for this
      study.

      Participants will take levetiracetam starting at 500 mg daily. If this dose is well
      tolerated, it will be increased to 500 mg twice a day. Every 3 days, doses may be increased
      until the target dose of 3000 mg/day is reached. Higher doses, not to exceed 4000 mg/day, may
      be tried in patients who do not respond fully to the lower doses. Patients and observers will
      use standard ratings to evaluate the patients' response to therapy during the 8-week study.
      If, after 8 weeks, the results appear promising, patients may continue treatment for an
      additional 6 months to evaluate longer-term effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Almost all of the approved anticonvulsant compounds (with the exception of gabapentin and
      tiagabine) have now been suggested to have acute antimanic or more long-term mood stabilizing
      properties. Carbamazepine and valproate have gained a widely recognized role in treatment
      algorithms of bipolar illness, and lamotrigine has shown promising antidepressant effects.
      Levetiracetam (Keppra® (Registered Trademark)) is the most recently approved anti-epileptic
      drug available, and deserves pilot exploration in bipolar illness for a variety of reasons.
      These include: its positive side-effects profile; it is a derivative of the nootropic agent
      piracetam which has memory-enhancing properties in animal studies; it likely has a unique
      mechanism of action since it is not active on most of the traditional excitatory and
      inhibitory neurotransmitter systems; it is not active on traditional anticonvulsant models
      such as pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) or maximum electroshock (MES) seizures, but is able to stop
      both the development and completed phase of amygdala-kindled seizures; and it is not
      metabolized by hepatic enzymes and thus has few adverse pharmacokinetic interactions.

      We propose pilot exploration of levetiracetam as an adjunctive agent in patients with bipolar
      illness who are inadequately responsive to routine psychopharmacological agents for bipolar
      illness. At the NIMH we will study a maximum of 10 acutely depressed, 10 manic, and 10
      cycling patients enrolled in Protocol 97-M-0039. We would start at Levetiracetam doses of 500
      mg/day, and not to exceed 4000 mg/day. Response will be based primarily on the percentage of
      patients showing &quot;much&quot; or &quot;very much&quot; improvement on the GCI-BP score in each of the three
      groups as augmented by the percentage decrement on cross-sectional scales such as the
      Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) in
      conjunction with prospective ratings on the NIMH-LCMp. Should preliminary evidence of
      efficacy be observed in this open add-on clinical trial, more systematic controlled studies
      will then be designed for confirmation of promising target areas of efficacy.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients meeting DSM -IV criteria for bipolar I, bipolar II, bipolar NOS, and
        schizoaffective illness-bipolar type will be eligible for study. They will be enrolled in
        approved Protocol #97-M-0039 and thus will not have H.I.V. and will have provided consent
        for all of the rating forms utilized in this study.

        Patients with inadequate response to two standard agents (i.e., lithium, valproate,
        carbamazepine, or neuroleptics) in the treatment of bipolar illness will be eligible for
        open adjunctive levetiracetam.

        If serum creatinine is above normal, a creatinine clearance will be preformed; this must be
        above 85 in order for a patient to be eligible for this study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Women of child-bearing age who are not on an active method of birth control or who are
        likely to become pregnant will be excluded.

        Men or women with significant renal disease will also be excluded.

        For the depressed phase, patients will have an IDS score of 18 or greater, an LCM
        depression score of low moderate or greater, and a GCI-BP severity score of moderate or
        greater for more than 2 weeks, i.e., the DSM-IV durational criteria.

        For the hypomanic/manic phase, patients will have an YMRS score of 8 or greater, an LCM
        mania rating of mild or greater, and a CGI-BP severity score of moderately ill or greater
        for 7 days or more.

        Those in the cycling group would meet the severity criteria for depression and mania. They
        would have four or more mood &quot;switches,&quot; and have an overall illness rating on the CGI-BP
        severity score of moderate or greater.
