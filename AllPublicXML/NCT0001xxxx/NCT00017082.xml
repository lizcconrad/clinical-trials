      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating patients who
      have recurrent metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the overall response rate, onset and duration of partial and
      complete responses, and duration of stable disease in patients with recurrent metastatic
      colorectal cancer treated with oxaliplatin. II. Determine the overall survival of patients
      treated with this drug. III. Determine the proportion of patients with tumor-related
      symptomatic improvement and time to tumor-related symptomatic worsening in patients treated
      with this drug. IV. Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this
      drug. V. Determine the proportion of patients achieving stable disease when treated with this
      drug. VI. Determine the safety of this drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes on day
      1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression.
      Patients are followed at 30 days and then every 8 weeks for 10 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent metastatic
        adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum Not amenable to potentially curative treatment (e.g.,
        inoperable metastatic disease) Must have received 2, and only 2, prior chemotherapy
        regimens for metastatic or recurrent disease, including the following: First-line therapy
        with bolus or continuous infusion fluorouracil (5-FU) (with or without leucovorin calcium)

        or within 6 months of completion of first-line therapy Second-line therapy with irinotecan
        or after adjuvant 5-FU and leucovorin calcium treatment failure Progressive disease by CT
        scan or MRI during or after first-line treatment as above OR during or within 6 months of
        completion of adjuvant chemotherapy as above AND during second-line irinotecan or after
        adjuvant treatment failure as above At least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion At least
