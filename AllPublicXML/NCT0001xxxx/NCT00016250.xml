      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of two different regimens of
      Ro 31-7453 in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory metastatic colorectal
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the objective disease rate of patients with recurrent or refractory metastatic
           colorectal cancer treated with two dose schedules of Ro 31-7453.

        -  Compare the safety and tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the response duration in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the time to progression and time to treatment failure in patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profiles of Ro 31-7453 and its major metabolites in these
           patients.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one
      of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral Ro 31-7453 twice daily on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every
           21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral Ro 31-7453 twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats
           every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 28 days and then every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 160 patients (49 per treatment arm plus 61 additional
      patients in the arm determined to be most effective) will be accrued for this study within 1
      year.
