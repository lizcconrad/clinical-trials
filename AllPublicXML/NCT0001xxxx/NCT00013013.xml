      Among veterans, smoking is the single most important risk factor for preventable mortality
      and morbidity, and studies suggest a higher prevalence of smoking among veterans than the
      general population. The VHA has encouraged adoption of the AHCPR Guideline for Smoking
      Cessation, yet most hospitals have poorly developed smoking cessation programs.

      Background:

      Among veterans, smoking is the single most important risk factor for preventable mortality
      and morbidity, and studies suggest a higher prevalence of smoking among veterans than the
      general population. The VHA has encouraged adoption of the AHCPR Guideline for Smoking
      Cessation, yet most hospitals have poorly developed smoking cessation programs.

      Objectives:

      The present study is designed to investigate the effectiveness of an organizational strategy
      to increase compliance with the AHCPR guideline. Short term goals of the study include
      increasing the rate of identification of smokers and increasing the delivery of brief smoking
      cessation interventions. Long term goals include reducing tobacco consumption among veterans.

      Methods:

      Twenty VAMCï¿½s with active primary care clinics have been randomly assigned to either control
      (usual practice; UP) or intervention (organizational support; OS) groups. The intervention
      hospitals receive staff training and site consultation; all hospitals will receive the AHCPR
      guideline. Rate of identification of smokers in the medical record, smoking cessation rates,
      provision of smoking cessation services (e.g., NRT, counseling), and costs of NRT will be
      determined via telephone interviews with patients, chart review, and electronic records.

      Status:

      Baseline data collection is nearly complete, and the intervention period will be complete in
      September, 2000. We have completed telephone surveys with approximately 4500 veterans.
      Analysis of study data is ongoing, and manuscript preparation will begin within the next few
      months.
