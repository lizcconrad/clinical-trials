      RATIONALE: Genetic studies may help in understanding the genetic processes involved in the
      development of some types of cancer.

      PURPOSE: Genetic study to learn more about genes involved in the development of central
      nervous system tumors in young children.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Identify known genes that have significantly different levels of expression, using
           microarray gene chip analysis, in infants with newly diagnosed metastatic vs
           non-metastatic embryonal central nervous system tumors.

        -  Determine the protein expression of genes identified by microarray analysis that are
           involved in cellular functions that regulate angiogenesis, invasion, or metastasis in
           this patient population.

        -  Determine the quantity of gene expression of the confirmed translationally expressed
           genes using semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tumor samples are analyzed using microarray gene chip analysis. Differentially expressed
      genes are evaluated for protein expression by standard immunohistochemistry and/or Western
      blot analysis, and gene expression is further quantified by semi-quantitative polymerase
      chain reaction.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 80-100 patients (20-25 with metastatic disease and 60-75
      with non-metastatic disease) will be accrued for this study within 4-5 years.
