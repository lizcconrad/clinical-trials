      RATIONALE: Ketoconazole may suppress the production of hormones and may interfere in the
      growth of prostate cancer cells. Alendronate sodium may be effective in preventing bone
      metastases and bone pain associated with prostate cancer. It is not known if ketoconazole is
      more effective with or without alendronate sodium.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ketoconazole with or without
      alendronate sodium in treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether there is any evidence that ketoconazole plus alendronate
      sodium produces acceptable disease responses as compared with ketoconazole alone in patients
      with androgen-independent metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      II. Characterize the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and assess the bone marrow
      concentrations of both agents.

      III. Assess matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibition potential of alendronate sodium by
      monitoring markers of angiogenesis, MMP breakdown, and changes in hydroxyproline.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are randomized to one of
      two treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive a single oral dose of ketoconazole on day 1. Patients begin taking
      ketoconazole 3 times per day on day 8.

      Arm II: Patients receive a single oral dose of alendronate sodium on day 1 and a single oral
      dose of ketoconazole on day 3. Patients begin taking alendronate sodium once every morning
      and ketoconazole 3 times per day on day 8.

      Treatment continues on both arms in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Patients who experience a clinical complete remission (CR) receive treatment for
      an additional 60 days beyond documentation of a clinical CR.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      A total of 72 patients (36 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.

        Androgen independent with at least 1 bone lesion that is felt to be associated with
        metastatic disease Refractory disease must be demonstrated after the withdrawal of
        flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide, or any other antiandrogen Clinically progressive
        disease for at least 1 month documented by rising PSA levels, at least 1 new metastatic
        deposit on Tc-99 bone scintigraphy, increasing measurable disease, or new areas of
        malignant disease Patients with PSA-negative disease (i.e., PSA less than 10 ng/mL) must
        have positive CT scans of soft tissue disease that can be used for disease staging, bone
        scan, or some other form of documentable disease progression (i.e., rising carcinoembryonic
