  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This community-based project, called the Together for Agricultural Safety project, was
      developed to help farmworkers reduce their exposure to dangerous agricultural chemicals (such
      as pesticides) through education and social marketing. The project is a partnership of
      university researchers and the Farmworkers Association of Florida. After collecting extensive
      data from farmworkers, health providers and farm owners about primary means of pesticide
      exposure we are collaboratively developing an intervention that will reduce pesticide
      exposure by educating workers and owners about: the need to have adequate washing facilities;
      to wash hands frequently; to obey reentry intervals; to change work clothes after work to
      prevent child exposure and more.
