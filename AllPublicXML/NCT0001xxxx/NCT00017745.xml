  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Neuromuscular Diseases Section (NDS) is conducting research on certain inherited
      myopathies and neuropathies, disorders that lead to disability and sometimes death. NDS,
      along with other groups, has identified some disease-causing genes. The National Institutes
      of Health Clinical Center proposes new research to identify additional hereditary
      neuromuscular diseases and conduct genetic studies in order to localize, clone, and
      characterize the diseases.

      An expected 50 patients with known or suspected inherited myopathy or neuropathy and their
      families will be recruited for this study. If travel to the Clinical Center is impossible,
      investigators may come to them to do the tests. Ten to twenty cubic centimeters of blood will
      be drawn for DNA extraction and genotyping. Some abnormal movements of muscle atrophy will be
      documented by videotaping. If necessary, diagnostic laboratory and radiographic studies will
      be done to confirm diagnosis. Because the diseases are hereditary, blood may also be drawn
      from family members. The family will be counseled and the participants invited back annually
      to investigate the progression of the disease.

      Each participant will be evaluated by a history and initial neurological exam. Up to another
      20 mL of blood will be drawn for routine blood studies. Other medical care procedures may
      include a chest x-ray, EKG and echocardiogram, CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic
      resonance imaging) scan, pulmonary function tests, and physical therapy assessment. Possible
      research procedures may include MR spectroscopy, nerve conduction study, electromyography,
      muscle or nerve biopsy, and lumbar puncture.

      The researchers have decided not to inform the family if nonpaternity or adoption is
      discovered by the DNA genotyping. Also, because a carrier of the disease gene may not
      necessarily develop the disease, family members will not be informed if they are carriers.

      The goal of this protocol is to identify families with inherited neuromuscular disorders,
      evaluate disease manifestations to establish an accurate clinical diagnosis by using newest
      technological advances and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Studies of
      inherited myopathies in large families with good genealogical records are especially
      valuable. Patients with diseases of known molecular basis will be genotyped to conduct
      analysis of phenotype/genotype correlation. Patients with diseases of unknown or incomplete
      genetic characterization will be studied with a hope of contributing to the identification of
      specific disease-causing genes and to genetic mechanisms responsible for a specific disorder.
