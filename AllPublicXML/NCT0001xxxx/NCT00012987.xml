    <textblock>
      Smoking is a serious and common health risk among veterans. Given the press of national
      initiatives and local incentives to improve smoking cessation care in response to VA
      performance measures, this study tests a widely applicable approach to clinical practice
      guidelines implementation, namely evidence-based quality improvement, which is directly
      relevant to the translation of efficacious treatments into enhancements in VA health care
      policy and practice. Evidence-Based Quality Improvement (EBQI) focuses on improved provider
      adherence to smoking cessation guidelines and a decrease in patient smoking rates in a manner
      designed to produce short- and long-term health improvements and cost benefits at the
      organizational level.

      Background:

      Smoking is a serious and common health risk among veterans. Given the press of national
      initiatives and local incentives to improve smoking cessation care in response to VA
      performance measures, this study tests a widely applicable approach to clinical practice
      guidelines implementation, namely evidence-based quality improvement, which is directly
      relevant to the translation of efficacious treatments into enhancements in VA health care
      policy and practice. Evidence-Based Quality Improvement (EBQI) focuses on improved provider
      adherence to smoking cessation guidelines and a decrease in patient smoking rates in a manner
      designed to produce short- and long-term health improvements and cost benefits at the
      organizational level.

      Objectives:

      Adherence to smoking cessation guidelines requires practice changes at the patient, provider,
      and system levels to achieve optimal quit rates. The objective of this study was to evaluate
      the effectiveness of evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI)�an expert-designed and locally
      implemented clinical reorganization of smoking cessation care�on changes in smoking cessation
      (SC) practice among primary care providers and health outcomes among veteran smokers.

      Methods:

      An evidence-based quality improvement intervention comprising provision of physician and
      patient educational materials, local priority setting with leadership and providers, and
      local adaptation of expert-designed protocols was implemented in experimental VA primary care
      practices (n=9). VA control sites (n=9), matched on size and academic affiliation, received
      smoking cessation guideline copies. We randomly sampled, consented, screened and surveyed
      primary care patients at all 18 sites (n=1,941 smokers) and used computer-assisted telephone
      interviewing to assess sociodemographics, health status, function, and smoking behavior,
      attitudes and treatment experience. Post-intervention 12-month follow-up interviews were
      completed using the same measures (n=1,080). We used multiple imputation using hotdeck
      techniques and applied both enrollment and attrition weights to the patient-level data. We
      used weighted logistic regression to evaluate intervention effects, controlling for
      patient-level predictors of quit attempts and quit status (e.g., level of addiction,
      readiness to change, age, health).

      Status:

      The project is completed. Analysis is ongoing for manuscripts.
