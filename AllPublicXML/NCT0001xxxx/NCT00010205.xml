  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of benzoylphenylurea in
      treating patients with advanced cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose of benzoylphenylurea
      in patients with advanced malignancy.

      II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral benzoylphenylurea weekly for 6 weeks. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of benzoylphenylurea until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.
      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
