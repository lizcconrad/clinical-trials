      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether a new drug for schizophrenia is
      better for the maintenance treatment than a standard drugs currently prescribed. The new
      medication is called quetiapine and it will be compared with a standard medication called
      haloperidol decanoate. The study will determine if quetiapine causes fewer problems than
      haloperidol with side effects such as stiffness and restlessness and whether it costs the VA
      more or less to treat patients with quetiapine. In addition, blood samples will be collected
      every three months to determine if certain chemicals in the blood can influence the outcome
      of the subjects' illness.
