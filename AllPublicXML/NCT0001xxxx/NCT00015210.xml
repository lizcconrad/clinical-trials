  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of nefazodone (Serzone )
      in depressed cocaine dependent subjects. This is a hypothesis-testing study which will
      explore whether cocaine usage will be reduced in the nefazodone treatment group compared to a
      placebo control group.
