      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-247550 in treating patients who
      have prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the prostate-specific antigen response to BMS-247550 in patients with
           hormone-refractory prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the overall survival and progression-free survival rate in patients treated
           with this drug.

        -  Determine the objective response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial
           responses) in those patients with measurable disease treated with this drug.

        -  Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete
      response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-9
      months.
