  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether a drug called T-20 can slow or prevent a rapid return of HIV
      in the blood when HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) is stopped temporarily. HAART
      is a multi-dose regimen that is very effective in suppressing HIV and perhaps slowing or
      halting progression of the viral infection towards AIDS. However, this treatment is not
      problem-oriented. It cannot completely rid the body of virus, and long-term therapy carries a
      risk of toxicity (harmful side effects). Moreover, the treatment is difficult to adhere to
      because of the many pills and capsules that must be taken daily. When patients stop taking
      HAART, their viral levels climb again. This study will see if T-20 can prolong the time it
      takes for HIV blood levels to rise in patients who stop HAART temporarily. The results may
      provide insight into possible new HAART-sparing treatments.

      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older who have received HAART for at least 1 month
      may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical
      examination, blood and urine tests and possibly a chest X-ray and electrocardiogram (EKG).

      Participants will receive either 100 Mg. of T-20 twice a day or 200 Mg. once a day, injected
      under the skin, and their normal HAART regimen for 3 days. (Patients or a caregiver will be
      taught how to give the T-20 injections.) On the fourth day, HAART will be stopped and all
      patients will receive 100 Mg. of T-20 twice a day for 6 weeks. Blood will be drawn weekly
      from the second to the sixth week after stopping HAART to check viral levels and CD4+ T cell
      counts. At the end of the 6 weeks, T-20 will be stopped and HAART will be restarted. Patients
      will then be evaluated once a month until their viral level is less than 50. The final clinic
      visit will be one month after this time.

      In addition to blood draws, patients will undergo leukapheresis before beginning T-20 and
      possibly again when they restart HAART and at the end of the study. For this procedure, whole
      blood is collected through a needle placed in an arm vein, similar to donating blood. The
      blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its components. The white cells are
      then removed, and the red cells, platelets and plasma are returned to the body, either
      through the same needle used to draw the blood or through a second needle placed in the other
      arm. The white cells are used to study T cell function and levels and to detect hidden virus.

      Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) effectively suppresses HIV replication,
      it is now clear that it cannot completely eradicate HIV from infected individuals. We have
      also recently begun to appreciate more fully the scope of toxicities and inconveniences
      associated with HAART medications leading to difficulties with adherence. Thus, long-term use
      of HAART may be problematic in many HIV-infected individuals. These realizations have led to
      a search for strategies to shift the focus from eradication to suppression of HIV replication
      while reducing toxicity and enhancing compliance. One approach to achieve these goals is to
      attempt to find strategies that allow for prolonged periods off HAART medications. Recently,
      Trimeris corporation has developed T-20, an inhibitor of HIV fusion to T-cells, a step
      required to spread virus from cell to cell. This new class of therapy, which has little
      recognized toxicity, could be used to allow patients to discontinue HAART medications for
      prolonged periods of time. In this intent to treat pilot study, we propose to evaluate the
      ability of T-20 to slow or prevent rebound of plasma HIV RNA when HAART medications are
      interrupted for a single 6 week period. The information obtained through this investigation
      could provide important insights into novel therapeutic strategies for HIV infection.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Documentation of HIV-1 infection by licensed ELISA test kit and confirmed by a second
             method (e.g. Western Blot).

          2. Absolute CD4+ T-cell count of greater than or equal to 300/mm(3) within 30 days before
             randomization (For patients who are status post-splenectomy, also CD4+ T-cell greater
             than 20 percent)
