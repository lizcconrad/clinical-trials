  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how people with high triglycerides metabolize and
      absorb bile acids, compounds made in the body from cholesterol.

      This project has two objectives: A) To define the mechanism of impaired bile acid absorption
      in hypertriglyceridemia (specifically we will determine if the active or passive component of
      absorption is abnormal) and B) to determine the contribution of an alternative pathway of
      bile acid synthesis which begins with 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol. Because 27-hydroxylase
      is present in endothelial cells as well as liver, this pathway may play a role in removal of
      cholesterol from incipient atherosclerotic plaque.
