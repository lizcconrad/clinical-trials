      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of carboxyamidotriazole in treating
      patients with refractory or recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the clinical outcome in patients with ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or
           primary peritoneal cancer treated with carboxyamidotriazole.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral carboxyamidotriazole daily beginning on day 1. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
