      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of decitabine in treating patients who have
      unresectable lung or esophageal cancer or malignant mesothelioma of the pleura.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose of decitabine in
           patients with unresectable primary small cell or non-small cell lung cancer,
           unresectable esophageal cancer, or malignant pleural mesothelioma.

        -  Measure the expression of NY-ESO-1 in tissue samples of these patients before and after
           receiving this drug.

        -  Assess the serologic response to NY-ESO-1 in these patients before and after receiving
           this drug.

        -  Measure the expression of p16 tumor suppressor gene in these patients before and after
           receiving this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study for each stratification group. Patients are
      stratified according to number of prior therapies (2 or fewer vs 3 or more).

      Patients receive decitabine IV continuously on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 5 weeks for
      2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      stable or responding disease after completion of the second course receive 2 additional
      courses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of decitabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined for a particular
      stratum, additional patients from that stratum are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed for 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 72 patients (36 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
