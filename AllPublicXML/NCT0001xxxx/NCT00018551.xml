  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal neoplasia is the second most common cancer in the United States and other Western
      countries with about 140,000 newly diagnosed cases per year in the United States with a
      mortality rate of about 40%. The identification of a specific natural or synthetic compound
      with the ability to reverse or suppress the process of colon carcinogenesis would have
      profound implication in the development of colorectal adenomas and their subsequent
      transformation to colon cancer. Furthermore, the establishment of a correlative relationship
      between biomarkers of cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and adenoma recurrence
      would provide pivotal data required to elucidate cell signaling mechanisms in future colon
      cancer chemoprevention trials.
