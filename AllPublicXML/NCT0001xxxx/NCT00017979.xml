    <textblock>
      This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation to examine how the brain controls
      movement by sending messages to the spinal cord and muscles and what goes wrong with this
      process in disease. Normal healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 65 years may be
      eligible to participate.

      In transcranial magnetic stimulation, an insulated wire coil is placed on the subject's scalp
      or skin. Brief electrical currents are passed through the coil, creating magnetic pulses that
      stimulate the brain. During the stimulation, participants will be asked to tense certain
      muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. The electrical activity of the muscle will
      be recorded on a computer through electrodes applied to the skin over the muscle. In most
      cases, the study will last less than 3 hours.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of voluntary inhibition of
      movement, using either negative motor imagery or Go/NoGo reaction task, on cortical
      inhibitory mechanisms. Intracortical inhibition (ICI) and silent period (SP) are two major
      cortical inhibitory mechanisms demonstrated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
      Alterations in these inhibitory mechanisms have been extensively studied in various
      situations, but the influence of voluntary inhibition has not been elucidated yet. In normal
      volunteers, therefore, we plan to determine if voluntary inhibition of movement influences
      these cortical inhibitory mechanisms. The primary outcome measures would be any changes in
      motor evoked potential (MEP) size and intracortical inhibition (ICI) parameters.
