      RATIONALE: Some tumors need growth factors produced by the body's white blood cells to keep
      growing. Drugs such as ZD 1839 may interfere with the growth factors and cause tumor cells to
      die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ZD 1839 in treating patients who have
      metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of ZD 1839 in patients with metastatic renal cell
      cancer. II. Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug.
      III. Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral ZD 1839 once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for at least 1
      month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
