      Primary Objectives: Determine the association between level of spinal cord injury (SCI) with
      chronic respiratory symptoms, measures of pulmonary function, and respiratory illness, both
      cross-sectionally and longitudinally.

      Intervention: None

      Study Abstract: This study is using a standardized method to assess respiratory function in
      SCI in order to determine the association between level of SCI with chronic respiratory
      symptoms, measures of pulmonary function, and respiratory illness, both cross-sectionally and
      longitudinally.

      A community-based mail survey was made of 1147 subjects (42% response rate; 2 mailings,
      n=485). Additional subjects injured &gt;1 year ago underwent testing at the West Roxbury VAMC
      (FVC, FEV1, TLC and subdivisions, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP/MEP), and
      completed a health questionnaire based on the ATS DL-78 respiratory questionnaire. Between
      10/94-9/98, a cross-sectional cohort of 361 subjects with chronic SCI were tested. Multiple
      logistic regression was used to examine predictors of respiratory symptoms and chest illness
      determined from the questionnaire.

      From the community-based mail survey, SCI with complete cervical injury (CC) the odds
      reporting ?any wheeze? relative to lower SCI levels (odds ratio (95%CI)) was 3.34
      (1.75-6.40), p&lt;0.001, and for ?persistent wheeze? was 2.41 (1.11-5.22), p=0.023. The odds of
      reporting chronic cough or phlegm were not increased (p=0.40 and 0.07 respectively). Active
      cigarette smoking was the strongest predictor of respiratory symptoms. In a subset of
      subjects tested at our VAMC, the odds of CC SCI of reporting chest illness resulting in time
      off work, indoors at home, or in bed over 3 years before questionnaire completion relative to
      incomplete injury was 3.00 (1.12-8.01), p=0.029. For 1 PPD current smokers the risk of chest
      illness was 3.91 (1.71-8.95), p=0.001, for subjects who smoked post injury but quit within
      the previous 10 years the odds was 3.00 (1.00-8.97), p=0.05. For other former smokers the
      odds were not significantly increased. Subjects who reported ?persistent wheeze? were nearly
      3 times as likely to have reported a chest illness (p=0.036). After using a wheelchair, 31%
      of CC subjects reported breathlessness, compared to 15% with complete high thoracic, and 11%
      of lower injuries (p=0.04 trend). Subjects who were not wheelchair athletes, even when lung
      function and SCI level were noted, were twice as likely not to report breathlessness compared
      to athletes (p=0.032). Subjects with SCI were able to produce reproducible spirometry.
      Analysis of the effect of SCI level on lung function is in progress, as are analyses
      examining predictors of chest illness in the workers tested to date.

      We have developed a method to assess respiratory function in SCI. Using these methods,
      complete cervical SCI have been found to experience more wheeze and breathlessness than
      others with SCI, and are more likely to report a chest illness. However, active cigarette
      smoking was the most important predictor of chest illness and respiratory symptoms rather
      than injury level or completeness. Therefore, it is likely that SCI based smoking cessation
      programs would result in significantly reducing respiratory morbidity in this population. The
      introduction of exercise programs might also result in a decreased prevalence of
      breathlessness in complete cervical SCI.
