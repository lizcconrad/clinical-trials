      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      women who have breast cancer that is metastatic or cannot be treated with surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate in women with locally unresectable or metastatic breast
           cancer treated with docetaxel, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as second or
           third-line chemotherapy.

        -  Evaluate the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and leucovorin calcium IV over 1 hour
      followed by fluorouracil IV over 5 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for
      2-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 44 months.
