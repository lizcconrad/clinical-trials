    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to make valganciclovir available, before it is approved for
      marketing, to HIV-infected patients who have cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis (eye infection)
      and cannot take drugs by injection. This study also will look at the safety of using
      valganciclovir as starting and/or ongoing therapy.

      CMV can cause serious AIDS-related infections in patients with HIV. Drugs that are effective
      against CMV eye infections can be given only by injection; this calls for a thin tube to be
      placed into a vein in the chest so that the patient is not put through getting too many
      needle sticks. An experimental drug, valganciclovir, is similar to 1 of these approved drugs,
      ganciclovir, but is more convenient and easier to use since it can be taken by mouth. Once in
      the body, valganciclovir changes to ganciclovir. Studies have shown that valganciclovir
      tablets can result in the same level of ganciclovir in the blood as ganciclovir injection.

      CMV causes sight- or life-threatening opportunistic infections in people with AIDS.
      Intravenous agents including ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir are presently approved as
      treatments for CMV retinitis within this population. Ganciclovir and foscarnet induction and
      maintenance therapy require daily infusions and usually require the use of long-term
      indwelling central venous catheters. Although the treatment interval of cidofovir is longer,
      administration necessitates the use of pre-hydration and probenecid in order to avoid a risk
      of renal toxicity. Oral ganciclovir is an alternative to the intravenous formulation for the
      maintenance treatment of CMV retinitis. However, because blood levels achieved after oral
      ganciclovir are low compared to intravenous, oral ganciclovir cannot be used for induction
      therapy. In an attempt to improve the bioavailability of ganciclovir, valganciclovir was
      developed. Valganciclovir is a ganciclovir prodrug which, when administered orally, is
      rapidly converted to the active compound ganciclovir during a first-pass process, with the
      majority of hydrolysis occurring pre-systemically. Studies have shown that valganciclovir
      tablets allow systemic exposure of ganciclovir comparable to that achieved with recommended
      doses of intravenous ganciclovir.

      Patients undergo an ophthalmologic exam by an ophthalmologist and safety and other laboratory
      tests to establish eligibility. No specific visits are requested by the drug usage plan
      following enrollment; however, patients should be seen for safety and/or clinical assessments
      and medication dispensation at periodic visits, consistent with standard of care. An
      ophthalmologic exam should be performed again at Week 3 (no later than Week 4), at the end of
      the induction treatment phase consistent with standard of care in order to ensure adequate
      response to therapy. Valganciclovir is provided on a monthly basis and only as long as the
      patient is assessed and information provided in a timely manner. This supply will be
      terminated 1 month subsequent to when the drug is available by prescription, unless otherwise
      decided.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Are 18 years of age or older.

          -  Are HIV-positive.

          -  Have active CMV retinitis, shown by an eye exam by an eye doctor, that needs
             treatment.

          -  Have had problems when drugs were given by injection, such as difficulty in finding a
             vein or problems (blood clots, vein inflammation, or infection) caused by injection
             devices.

          -  Agree to use effective methods of birth control (i.e., barrier methods) during the
             study and for 90 days after taking the study drug. Females who can have children must
             have a negative pregnancy test before entering the study.

          -  Stop breast-feeding before starting the study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Have developed CMV retinitis after a transplant.

          -  Have kidney disease and need hemodialysis.

          -  Are taking part in another drug study, unless approved by the study doctor.

          -  Take experimental drugs, or have taken them within 30 days before study entry, unless
             approved by the study doctor.

          -  Take drugs not allowed on the study, including foscarnet, cidofovir, and probenecid.

          -  Are not able to follow study procedures, including visits to the eye doctor and the
             study doctor.
