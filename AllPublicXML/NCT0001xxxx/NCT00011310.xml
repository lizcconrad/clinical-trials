  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess cardiac rate and respiratory responses and rhythm after
      workplace exposure to combustion particulates. A repeated measurement study is being
      performed on acute boilermakers (apprentices and journeymen). A stratified analysis is then
      done on those with and without chronic bronchitis, after adjustment for relevant covariates.

      Population-based epidemiologic studies of communities in the United States have revealed a
      consistent association between ambient particulate air pollution and increases in morbidity
      and mortality. The observed increases result from both respiratory and cardiovascular
      diseases. Similar associations have been observed for rates of hospital admissions for
      respiratory and cardiovascular diseases for subjects over age 65. These ambient exposures are
      to low levels of particulates, many times lower than occupational exposures faced by workers
      in a variety of industries, including manufacturing, construction, transportation and
      electric-power generation. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the role of
      occupational exposure to particulates in the development of respiratory and cardiac responses
      in boilermakers. We will employ a detailed, continuous-exposure assessment to PM2.5 with
      repeated measures of biologic and physiologic markers of response. Specific hypotheses to be
      tested will include: (1) occupational exposure to fuel-oil ash particulates induce airway
      inflammation as reflected in increased expired NO, and airflow obstruction as reflected in
      decreases in peak flow (PEFR) and FEV1; (2) particulate exposure will result in acute changes
      in cardiovascular function, as reflected in changes in heart rate, heart-rate variability and
      blood pressure; (3) particulate exposures result in increased serum fibrinogen levels, a
      known risk factor for cardiovascular disease; and (4) chronic bronchitis predisposes
      particulate-exposed workers to changes in cardiac function. The results of this study will
      have important implications for preventive efforts aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality
      from occupational exposure to respirable particulates.
