  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether a therapeutic exercise program for improving motor
      coordination in locomotor tasks in post-stroke, hemiparesis patients will result in CNS
      recovery. The study will develop relationships between the improved motor performance and
      motor coordination during the locomotor task and the functional effects of the exercise
      program(e.g., gait variables.)

      Primary objective of this study is to determine whether a therapeutic exercise program which
      targets the functional recovery of persons with the post-stroke hemiparesis results in CNS
      recovery (improved motor coordination). They will determine whether motor coordination during
      a locomotor task is improved after an exercise program. They will then develop relationships
      between the improved motor performance and motor coordination during the locomotor task and
      the functional effects of the exercise program(e.g., gait variables) Overall goal is to
      develop a more rational basis for the design of stroke rehabilitation programs which target
      individuals most likely to recover and which are based on physiological principles. This
      study will supplement an NIH funded randomized clinical trial to evaluate a post-stroke
      exercise program designed to increase balance, strength, and endurance. Study will include
      60-70 prospective patients enrolled in the randomized clinical trial at Kansas University
      Center on Aging. between Oct 1999 and Oct 2001.
