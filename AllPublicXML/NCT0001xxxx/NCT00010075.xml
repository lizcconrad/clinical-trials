      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      older women who have metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the survival without degradation of quality of life in elderly women with
           metastatic breast cancer treated with leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and
           mitoxantrone.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of response and survival without
           progression, in these patients.

        -  Determine the tolerance of these patients to this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive mitoxantrone IV and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1. Patients
      then receive fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a
      maximum of 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after 3 courses, and at treatment completion.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for this study.
