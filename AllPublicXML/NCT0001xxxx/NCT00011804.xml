    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of topiramate to treat pain caused by lumbar
      radiculopathy, or sciatica. Sciatica results from damage to the lumbar nerve roots, typically
      causing back pain and sharp, shooting pain down one or both legs. Although sciatica is
      common, there are no good treatments for it. Topiramate belongs to a group of medications
      commonly used to treat pain caused by nerve damage.

      Patients between 18 and 75 years of age who have had sciatica pain daily for at least 3
      months may be eligible for this study. (This is taken from the first paragraph of the
      Qualification Criteria in the consent form. The inclusion criteria on page 6 of the protocol
      say &quot;low back pain of 3 months duration or longer present at least 5 out of 7 days a week&quot;
      and signs and symptoms of lumbar radiculopathy. Which is correct?)

      Participants will provide a medical history, as well as occupational and social information.
      They will undergo a standard neurological examination, including a test of cognitive
      (thinking) abilities, muscular function, reflexes and a sensory examination. The latter
      involves testing with a pin placed on the surface of the skin. Participants will also have
      routine blood tests and will fill out questionnaires on their daily functioning and
      psychological well being. Additional procedures may include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      scans and possible referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation of depression or emotional
      difficulties.

      This &quot;cross-over&quot; study consists of two parts. In one part, patients will receive topiramate
      and in the other, an active placebo. An active placebo is a drug that does not work for the
      problem being studied but whose side effects are like those of the test drug. Diphenhydramine
      (Benadryl) is the active placebo used in this study. Diphenhydramine is an allergy medication
      with very mild side effects, such as drowsiness. During both parts of the study-topiramate
      and placebo-patients will keep a daily log in which they rate their pain, record other
      procedures they undergo, such as injections and manipulations, and record medication side
      effects.

      In the first week of the study, patients will remain on their current medications and record
      pain levels once a day. After the first week, they will begin taking the study drugs-either
      topiramate in increasing doses ranging from 50 to 400 mg. or diphenhydramine in doses ranging
      from 6.25 to 50 mg. The drug doses will be increased gradually over 4 weeks to minimize
      possible side effects. Increases will continue until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.
      Patients will continue on the highest tolerated dose for two weeks and then be tapered off
      gradually over 12 days. They will remain off drugs completely for a 2-day washout period and
      then begin the next treatment. Those who took topiramate for the first part will take
      diphenhydramine for the second part and vice versa.

      A study nurse will call patients twice a week throughout the study to check for problems and
      answer questions. A physician will see patients 6 weeks after the start of each treatment.
      During the last visit, at the end of the study, patients will repeat the questionnaires they
      filled out at the beginning of the study. Patients and their doctors will be informed of the
      medications that were effective in each individual's care.

      Irritation or damage to lumbar nerve roots referred to as lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica is
      a very common clinical entity with a lifetime prevalence of 1-3% in the adult population.
      Lumbar radiculopathy typically causes back pain and sharp, shooting pain in the leg(s).
      Despite its prevalence and disabling characteristics, sciatica has never been selectively
      studied in drug trials. We propose to study the anti-epileptic drug topiramate, which
      combines multiple potential analgesic actions including sodium channel blockade, GABA
      agonist-like effects and AMPA/kainate glutamate receptor blockade. Patients will include men
      and women of all ethnic backgrounds between the ages of 18 and 75 who have had signs and
      symptoms of sciatica for 3 months or more.

      The design is a double-blind, two period cross-over study comparing topiramate to placebo.
      Patients will be called twice a week to individually titrate doses of topiramate towards a
      maximum of 800 mg per day and monitor side effects. The primary outcome measures in this
      study will be the daily pain scores in the low back, in the leg and combined. Patients'
      quality of life and activities of daily living will be secondary outcome measures as assessed
      by the SF 36, Oswestry, and Beck questionnaires. Sixty five patients will be enrolled in this
      study and the duration of the study will be 17 weeks, including one week baseline, four week
      escalation, two week maintenance and two week wash out for topiramate and placebo
      respectively.
