      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of exatecan mesylate in treating patients
      who have metastatic stomach cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective response rate of patients with previously untreated metastatic
           gastric cancer treated with exatecan mesylate (DX-8951f).

        -  Determine the time to tumor progression in this patient population when treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the survival at 6 and 12 months in this patient population when treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in this patient
           population.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in the plasma of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive exatecan mesylate (DX-8951f) IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
