      Congestive heart failure is a serious health problem in the United States and is associated
      with excessive morbidity and mortality. Several classes of medications have been shown to
      improve mortality in patients with CHF. Despite this these medications are widely under
      prescribed. Guidelines have been shown to improve patient outcomes and several guidelines on
      the management of CHF have been published. Implementation of guidelines is challenging and
      most strategies have focused on changing physician behavior. Patient-based interventions have
      been shown to be effective in implementing guidelines on CHF but they have been very labor
      intensive. A computer based intervention to implement CHF guidelines, if effective, would be
      beneficial.

      Background:

      Congestive heart failure is a serious health problem in the United States and is associated
      with excessive morbidity and mortality. Several classes of medications have been shown to
      improve mortality in patients with CHF. Despite this these medications are widely under
      prescribed. Guidelines have been shown to improve patient outcomes and several guidelines on
      the management of CHF have been published. Implementation of guidelines is challenging and
      most strategies have focused on changing physician behavior. Patient-based interventions have
      been shown to be effective in implementing guidelines on CHF but they have been very labor
      intensive. A computer based intervention to implement CHF guidelines, if effective, would be
      beneficial.

      Objectives:

      Patients with CHF consume a significant proportion of healthcare resources, with
      exacerbations of CHF being the second most common reason for medical admission to VA medical
      centers. Therefore, the main objective is to understand the impact of a tailored education
      message program designed for direct use by patients on medical resource use. Other objectives
      include understanding the tools impact on patient compliance and quality of life.

      Methods:

      Patients have been randomized to one of two groups: 1) intervention group or the 2) control
      group. The intervention group receives the tailored education messages program. This program
      assesses patientsï¿½ beliefs about compliance with medications, diet, and self-monitoring.
      Based on identified barriers to compliance, intervention patients receive a tailored
      educational message to dispel these beliefs and improve compliance. The control group
      interacts with a generic healthcare website. Patients in both groups are monitored for
      hospitalization; emergent care visits, compliance with prescribed treatment and quality of
      life

      Status:

      Project work is ongoing.
