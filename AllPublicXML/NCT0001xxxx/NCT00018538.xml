  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is a common occurrence in the aging population, with one in ten men destined
      to develop the disease. 40% of patients with prostate cancer experience a recurrence after
      definitive treatment. This study addresses the as-yet unresolved problem of the optimal
      management of early recurrence as manifested by increase in the accepted marker for this
      disease, PSA. Vitamin D, an agent with cell-differentiating properties, has been shown to
      inhibit angiogenesis and cause differentiation of prostate cancer cells in the laboratory and
      to affect PSA favorably in clinical studies of patients with advanced prostate cancer. This
      study will assess the effects of vitamin D in patients with sub-clinical biochemical relapses
      of prostate cancer as indicated by rising PSA but low tumor burdens, with the potential for
      developing an approach to this problem that will delay or prevent progression.

        Patients will be males with three successive rises in PSA after achieving a nadir
        post-definitive therapy. The following criteria must be met: pathologically confirmed
        prostate cancer, completion of definitive treatment in the form of local external beam
        radiation or definitive surgery and three successive rises in PSA with no clinical evidence
        of disease.
