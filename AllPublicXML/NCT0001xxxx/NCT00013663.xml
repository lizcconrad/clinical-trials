  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if HIV-specific canarypox vaccine and/or
      interleukin-2 (IL-2) will control viral load (amount of HIV in the blood) after HIV treatment
      is withdrawn for a certain time period.

      Step I: In addition to continuing HAART, patients are randomized into 1 of the following 4
      arms:

      A: Immunization placebo; B: Immunization with the canarypox HIV-vaccine (vCP1452); C: Daily
      low-dose IL-2 + immunization placebo; or D: Daily low-dose IL-2 + canarypox HIV-vaccine
      (vCP1452). Patients on Arms A, B, C, and D receive vaccine (or vaccine placebo) injections at
      Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12. Patients on Arms C and D receive IL-2 by self-injection. HAART is not
      provided as part of this study.

      Step II: Patients on all arms (A, B, C, and D) who meet inclusion criteria advance to Step II
      and interrupt HAART for a minimum of 12 weeks. The efficacy of these immunological therapies
      will be determined by monitoring the dynamics of viral rebound upon cessation of antiviral
      therapy. After 12 weeks of Step II, patients whose viral load remains below 30,000 copies/ml
      remain on Step II, off HAART, and continue weekly viral load monitoring. Patients will not
      terminate Step II or resume HAART unless and until their viral load increases to more than
      30,000 copies/ml on 3 successive determinations, or their CD4 count decreases to less than
      200 cells/mm3 or less than 50 percent of the baseline CD4+ T cell concentration on 2
      successive occasions.

          -  Are more than 18 years old.

          -  Have been receiving their current HAART (2 or more anti-HIV drugs in combination) for
             more than 6 consecutive months.

          -  Have a CD4 count of 200 cells/microL or more within the 12 months prior to entering
             the study and 400 cells/microL or more on 2 occasions at least 2 weeks apart within 30
             days of entry.

          -  Have never had a viral load higher than 2 million molecules/ml and have had the viral
             load controlled with HAART to less than 50 molecules/ml on 2 occasions at least 2
             weeks apart within 30 days of entry.

          -  Have not had virologic failure on the current HAART regimen.
