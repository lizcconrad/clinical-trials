  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are testing a new combination of medicines, to determine if they could be used to treat
      cystic fibrosis (CF). Subjects with CF who have two copies of the most common mutation
      (change) found in patients with CF called DF508. CF is caused by a lack of chloride movement
      in the nose, sinuses, lungs, intestines, pancreas and sweat glands. We are conducting this
      study to determine the safety of using a combination of two medicines, Phenylbutyrate and
      Genistein, to improve the ability of the cells lining the nose to regulate movement of salt
      (chloride) and water in people with CF.

      Phenylbutyrate has been extensively used to treat patients with rare metabolic diseases
      (which are very different from CF), Phenylbutyrate is an investigational drug for the purpose
      of this study. Genistein is a naturally occurring substance that is found in food products
      such as soy and tofu, but is also an investigational drug for this study. Both drugs may be
      able to restore normal chloride movements in body organs and glands. We will be studying salt
      and water in the nose movement by a technique called nasal transepithelial potential
      difference (NPD).

      Subjects will be randomized to receive either the Phenylbutyrate or placebo tablets for 1
      week, with a 2 out of 3 chance of receiving Phenylbutyrate at a standard adult dose, with
      visits on study days 1, 4, and 7. The study will last an additional 2 weeks to determine
      whether the effects of the Phenylbutyrate or Placebo persist for any length of time, with
      visits on study days 14 and 21. Every participant will receive the Genistein during the NPD
      on days 1 and 7. The dose of Genistein used will not be escalated and will be the same for
      every participant.

      Safety evaluations at each visit will include a history, and physical exam and mental status
      exam, blood and urine tests, and lung function tests. The main physiologic outcome of the
      trial will be the assessment of salt and water transport NPD. In this way, we will assess
      whether genistein enhances the effect of phenylbutyrate to improve chloride transport in the
      nose by topical application of genistein to the nasal mucosa during the NPD procedure on
      study days 1 and 7.
