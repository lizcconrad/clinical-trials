  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary term goal of these research efforts has been to enhance the functional status,
      comfort and quality of life of edentulous patients by evaluating clinical procedures, denture
      designs and adjunctive therapies based upon a clear understanding of: (1) oral functional
      impairments caused by the loss of teeth and subsequent tissue changes; (2) neurophysiological
      mechanisms associated with oral functions; (3) metabolism of oral tissues; and (4)
      interactions between biological and psychological processes and denture characteristics. The
      primary purpose of the proposed clinical outcome study is to compare the relative efficacies
      of three different combinations of implant-supported maxillary and mandibular prostheses with
      traditional complete dentures for edentulous patients. Completion of this study will
      determine the relative cost-effectiveness of the implant-supported denture treatments for use
      in the general population of edentulous patients.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Completely edentulous veterans with clinically acceptable conventional dentures.

          -  Both male and female applicants will be accepted and the prospective participants will
             be from 35 to 80 years of age.

          -  Patients who have been completely edentulous for at least two years and have
             clinically acceptable conventional dentures, which have been worn for at least 6
             months.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Verified history of medical conditions such as connective tissue disorders, blood
             dyscrasias, uncontrolled endocrine disorders, active tuberculosis, AIDS, leukemias,
             Hodgkins, liver disfunction, osteoporosis, chronic nephritis, any chronic condition
             with life expectancy of less than five years as well as patients on long-term
             steroids, anticoagulants, and radiation therapy.

          -  Extremely poor oral hygiene. Oral hygiene condition will be assessed from the amount
             of food debris, plaque and calculus in their present dentures.

          -  Insufficient mandibular or maxillary bone height to accommodate 10 mm long implants in
             potential implant sites.

          -  Presence of temporomandibular joint dysfunction and evidence of severe bruxism.

          -  Physician determines a contraindication for oral surgery.

          -  Candidate expresses reservations about participating for at least three years.
