  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to aggressively treat insulin resistance and its clinical
      manifestations when they first appear in childhood, and to prevent the subsequent progression
      towards impaired glucose tolerance and type-2 diabetes. In the process of this clinical
      trial, we will learn more about the early manifestations of insulin resistance, its
      treatment, and its relationship to obesity and type-2 diabetes through parallel in-vivo and
      in-vitro studies.
