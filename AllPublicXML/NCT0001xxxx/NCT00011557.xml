      Investigators intend to determine the ultimate usefulness of functional magnetic stimulation
      (FMS) as an assistive device for voiding in patients with SCI.

      Thirty six persons will be recruited and will undergo an 8 week protocol for conditioning of
      the bladder. The investigators propose to: investigate the changes in bladder function in
      response to long-term bladder conditioning by FMS; further optimize the FMS technology and
      parameters for effective bladder emptying in SCI; evaluate the role of the external sphincter
      muscle fatigue by FS in facilitating bladder emptying; critically evaluate the relative
      response of FMS data to existing information using functional electrical stimulation;further
      develop criteria that will be used to predict which SCI patients are optimally suitable for
      FMS; establish a comprehensive stimulation criteria that will reflect the safety and
      effectiveness of structures associated with the bladder that are exposed to the
      electro-myographic field.
