      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. ISIS 3521 may help kill more cancer cells by making tumor cells
      more sensitive to chemotherapy. It is not yet known if carboplatin and paclitaxel are more
      effective with or without ISIS 3521.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of carboplatin and
      paclitaxel with or without ISIS 3521 in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the overall survival of patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell
      lung cancer treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel with vs without ISIS 3521. II. Compare
      the time to tumor progression and time to treatment failure in patients treated with these
      regimens. III. Compare the overall (complete plus partial) response rate in patients with
      measurable disease treated with these regimens. IV. Compare the percentage of patients with
      non-measurable, evaluable disease who have a complete response after treatment with these
      regimens. V. Compare the duration of response in patients with a complete or partial response
      after treatment with these regimens. VI. Compare the safety of these regimens in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to tumor stage (IIIB vs IV) and prior brain metastases (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours
      and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 0. Arm II: Patients receive ISIS 3521 IV continuously
      on days 0-14 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 3.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients with stable or responsive disease receive 6 courses of treatment. Patients
      with responsive disease may receive additional courses of treatment. Patients are followed at
      1, 2, 4, and 6 months and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 600 patients (300 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 15 months.

        metastases, or malignant pleural or pericardial effusion) No CNS metastases other than
        lesions locally treated with surgery or radiosurgery, provided there was no evidence of CNS
        progression for at least 4 weeks after completion of treatment No prior or concurrent brain
