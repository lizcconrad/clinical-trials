      This study will test whether inhaling nitric oxide gas can improve blood flow to the heart,
      ventricular function, exercise tolerance in patients with coronary artery disease and chest
      pain that has not improved with medical or surgical therapy.

      Patients with coronary artery disease who have chest pain despite treatment with medicines
      and angioplasty or surgery may be eligible for this study. Those enrolled will receive
      monetary compensation for their participation in this study.

      The duration of the study is 5 days, with 2 testing periods lasting 2 days each. During one
      of the periods, the study participants will breathe nitric oxide mixed with room air through
      a face mask during the tests. During the other period, the participants will breathe room air
      alone through a face mask during the tests. At least 1 day will separate the treatment
      periods. During each of the 2 treatment periods (nitric oxide and room air), participants
      will undergo 4 tests to determine whether the treatment improves the heart's response to
      stress with increased heart rate and contraction. Approximately one hour before each of the
      tests, participants will breathe either nitric oxide mixed with room air or room air alone
      through the face mask, and continue the inhalation treatment while each test is being
      performed. The face mask will be removed at the end of each test.

      On the morning of the first day of each treatment period, participants will have a special
      echocardiogram with imaging of the heart. The echocardiogram will be performed during an
      infusion of dobutamine, a medicine that increases heart rate and contraction, and serves to
      stress the heart. This manner of stress testing is commonly used in hospitals around the
      country to determine if walls of the heart are receiving sufficient blood supply. That
      afternoon, participants will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the heart.
      The MRI will determine the heart's blood flow and contraction while receiving the same dosage
      of dobutamine as was used earlier in the day. On the morning of the second day of each
      treatment period, participants will exercise on a treadmill until moderately uncomfortable
      chest pain is reported. Later that morning, participants will undergo cardiac
      catheterization. For the cardiac catheterization, a long tube (catheter) will be placed into
      a vein of the neck once the skin is numbed with xylocaine. This tube will be positioned
      within the right atrium of the heart and into a tube-like structure called the coronary
      sinus, where venous blood exits the heart muscle. A small catheter will also be placed in an
      artery of the upper forearm after the skin has been numbed with xylocaine. Blood samples will
      be taken to allow us to measure the amount of nitric oxide transported in the blood. The
      blood samples will be drawn (through the tube in the heart and through the small tube in the
      artery) at the beginning of the study and during infusion of dobutamine to stress the heart.
      The dose of the dobutamine infusion will be the same dose used in the previous day's stress
      studies.

      After the completion of the first treatment period, we will stop testing for at least one
      day. Participants will begin the second treatment period with the inhalation treatment not
      received during the first treatment period.

      Although medical therapy and revascularization procedures are effective for relief of chest
      pain symptoms in many patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), others either do not
      respond to or tolerate medical therapies, or have failed attempts at revascularization. For
      this growing number of patients, there is a need for novel therapeutic approaches. The
      purpose of this protocol is to test the effectiveness of nitric oxide (NO) inhalation therapy
      for the relief of inducible myocardial ischemia in patients with CAD who have failed
      conventional attempts at medical and revascularization management. Our hypothesis is that
      enriched NO transport in blood from the lungs and delivery to the coronary vasculature with
      NO inhalation will improve blood flow to the myocardium during stress by dilating coronary
      arteries and arterioles. The primary end-point of this study is improvement in treadmill
      exercise duration during NO inhalation compared with exercise duration during room air
      breathing, with secondary end-points selected to provide mechanistic insight as to relief of
      inducible ischemia by NO, including effects on: 1) arterial delivery and myocardial
      extraction of NO transport molecules, 2) myocardial perfusion, and 3) global and regional
      myocardial contractility. This clinical trial is randomized, double-blind, and placebo (room
      air)-controlled in design, with CAD patients treated with NO (or room air) breathing for
      approximately 1 hour before each stress test, followed by crossover to the alternate therapy
      after two days of testing. Demonstration of benefit from NO inhalation could result in an
      important therapeutic option for CAD patients with few alternatives for the relief of
      myocardial ischemia.
