      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients
      who have metastatic melanoma that has not responded to previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the clinical response to immunization using gp100:44-59 antigen peptide plus
           gp100:209-217 (210M) and MART-1:26-35 (27L) antigen peptides in patients with metastatic
           melanoma who are HLA-DRB1*0401 and HLA-A0201 positive.

        -  Determine the clinical response to immunization using gp100:44-59 antigen peptide alone
           in patients with metastatic melanoma who are HLA-DRB1*0401 positive but HLA-A0201
           negative.

        -  Determine the immunologic response in patients treated with these regimens as measured
           by changes in T-cell precursors from before to after treatment.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity profiles of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to one of three immunization groups based on HLA-A0201 status
      and prior gp100:209-217 (210M) antigen peptide immunization:

        -  Group 1 (HLA-A0201 positive and no prior gp100:209-217 [210M] antigen peptide): Patients
           receive gp100:44-59 and gp100:209-217 (210M) antigen peptides emulsified together in
           Montanide ISA-51 (ISA-51) subcutaneously (SC) and gp100:44-59 and MART-1:26-35 (27L)
           antigen peptides emulsified together in ISA-51 SC.

        -  Group 2 (HLA-A0201 positive and prior gp100:209-217 [210M] antigen peptide): Patients
           receive treatment as in group 1.

        -  Group 3 (HLA-A0201 negative and no prior gp100:209-217 [210M] antigen peptide): Patients
           receive gp100:44-59 antigen peptide emulsified in ISA-51 SC alone.

        -  All groups: Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 doses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response after 4 doses
           receive a maximum of 2 additional doses. Patients with stable disease or minor, mixed,
           or partial response after 4 doses receive a maximum of 12 additional doses. Patients
           with no response after 4 doses receive immunization with the same peptides and
           interleukin-2 IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours for a maximum of 12 doses beginning 1 day
           after each immunization.

      Patients are followed at 3-4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45-75 patients (15-25 per immunization group) will be accrued
      for this study within 2 years.
