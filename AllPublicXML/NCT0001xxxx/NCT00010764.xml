  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM), one of the most common rheumatic conditions, is a condition of unknown
      etiology characterized by widespread muscle pain and stiffness. Treatment is generally
      unsatisfactory and most randomized, controlled treatment trials have been unable to
      demonstrate a sustained effective intervention. A single, brief trial of electroacupuncture
      demonstrated remarkable improvement among patients with FM, although lasting effects were not
      evaluated. Nonetheless, the recently published National Institutes of Health Consensus
      Development Statement on Acupuncture says &quot;musculoskeletal conditions such as fibromyalgia,
      myofascial pain ....are conditions for which acupuncture may be beneficial&quot;. Thus, 96
      patients will be recruited from a referral clinic for fatigue for a 12 week (24 treatments)
      trial. These patients will be randomized into 3 control groups and 1 &quot;true&quot; acupuncture
      group. The control groups will consist of a group receiving acupuncture treatment for an
      unrelated condition (morning sickness), a group receiving needle insertion at non-channel,
      non-point locations, and a &quot;true&quot; placebo group. This latter group will have acupuncture
      needle guides tapped on the skin, then needles tapped. Thus, the specific aims of this study
      are to 1) evaluate the short and long term efficacy and side effects of a 12 week randomized,
      controlled trial of bi-weekly acupuncture in the treatment of FM; 2) establish the most
      useful and scientifically sound control group for studies of acupuncture using FM as a model
      for conditions characterized by chronic pain; 3) use both subjective and objective measures
      of overall health and pain to determine the optimal time length of treatment; and 4) examine
      the concordance of allopathic and acupuncture-based measures of outcome. For the purposes of
      this study, subjects will be asked to complete a unique set of study measures at enrollment,
      at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and then again at 1 and 6 months post-treatment. Our primary outcomes
      will be patient global assessment, subjective pain, and mean number of tender points.
      Secondary outcomes will be pain threshold, analgesic use, physician global assessment,
      functional status, sleep, psychological distress, and fatigue. Thus, this trial will have
      both immediate and longer term implications for the scientific study of acupuncture as well
      as the clinical care of the estimated 5 million patients with FM in the US. From a
      methodological point of view, the proposed trial will establish the most appropriate methods
      for choosing a control group should larger trials be conducted, suggest the optimum duration
      of treatment, and evaluate the utility of diverse allopathic and alternative outcome
      measures. Of equal importance, however, this research will test and potentially establish the
      effectiveness of acupuncture.
