    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a patient's white blood cells may make the body build an immune
      response to kill cancer cells. Interleukin-12 may kill cancer cells by stopping blood flow to
      the tumor and by stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Combining
      vaccine therapy with interleukin-12 may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy combined with
      interleukin-12 in treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that has not
      responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether immunization with prostate-specific membrane antigen-pulsed autologous
           peripheral blood mononuclear cells and interleukin-12 can promote specific T-cell
           priming in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive prostate-specific membrane antigen-pulsed autologous peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and interleukin-12 SC on days 1, 3, and
      5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3-9 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 37 weeks.
