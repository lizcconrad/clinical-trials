  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Williams syndrome is a disease in which supravalvular aortic stenosis, an elfin facies,
      mental retardation and other congenital defects are sometimes associated with abnormal
      vitamin D and calcium metabolism. Whereas some patients have been reported to show increased
      sensitivity to vitamin D or an exaggerated response of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D {25(OH)D} to
      administration of vitamin D and to have hypercalcemia caused by increased circulating
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D{1,25(OH)2D} in infancy and early childhood, most patients have normal
      calcium metabolism and normal values for circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D. We propose to
      carry out further studies of vitamin D metabolism to elucidate the mechanism(s) for abnormal
      vitamin D metabolism. We will determine the response of serum 1,25(OH)2D to administration of
      1,25(OH)2D3. Measurement of the 1,25(OH)2D in the patients compared to normal subjects will
      be the primary outcome.
