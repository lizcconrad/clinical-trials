      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal doxorubicin in treating
      children who have refractory solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the tolerance to and toxicity profile of doxorubicin HCl liposome
      (Lipodox) at standard doxorubicin doses and doses of Lipodox that were tolerable in adults
      administered every 3 weeks in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors.

      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients if dose-limiting
      toxicity is observed at doses of 105 mg/m2 or less.

      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. IV. Assess the
      cardiotoxicity of this drug in children who have previously been treated with free
      doxorubicin and in children who have not previously received doxorubicin.

      V. Evaluate the feasibility of using cardiac MRI functional imaging as a screening tool for
      the quantitative assessment of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.

      VI. Determine if serum troponin t levels are a useful biomarker for doxorubicin-induced
      myocardial damage.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive doxorubicin
      HCl liposome IV over 60 minutes. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a maximum of 10 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 4-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin HCl liposome until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which at least 2 of 4 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      A total of 21-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
