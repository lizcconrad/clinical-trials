  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether changes in diet and behavior lessen the number of
      times HIV-positive people get diarrhea (soft or loose stools).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial (a study to evaluate effectiveness in a small number of patients).

      Patients will be randomized (like tossing a coin) to 1 of 2 groups:

      Group 1: Patients will go on a specific diet and will be taught new behavior skills.

      Group 2: Patients will be taught ways to take care of themselves and will be given general
      nutrition information.

      Patients also will be grouped based on the cause of their diarrhea (food absorption problems
      or anti-HIV medication side effects). Patients will make a note of when they have bowel
      movements and will write down all food and drugs they take for the entire study. They will be
      interviewed at entry and at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 8, 16, and 24. Patients will be paid for
      participating in this study.
