    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to make tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) available to
      HIV-infected patients who have failed other anti-HIV drug combinations, who have few
      treatment choices available, and whose disease may get worse. This study will allow patients
      to obtain tenofovir DF before it is approved for marketing.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Are HIV-positive.

          -  Have a viral load (level of HIV in the blood) of at least 10,000 copies/ml by PCR
             within the previous 2 months.

          -  Have a CD4 count of 100 cells/mm3 or lower within the previous 2 months. Patients with
             a CD4 count above 100 and as high as 200 cells/mm3 may also be eligible if they had an
             opportunistic (AIDS-related) infection within the past 90 days.

          -  Have failed treatment with at least 2 protease inhibitors (PIs) or at least 1 PI plus
             a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI).

          -  Are not able to get effective treatment with a combination of currently approved
             anti-HIV drugs.

          -  Are at least 18 years old.

          -  Have a negative serum pregnancy test.

          -  Are willing to use a barrier method of birth control (both males and females) while on
             the study and for 30 days after taking the drug.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Have or have had kidney disease or bone disease.

          -  Are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Abuse alcohol or drugs.

          -  Are taking, or have taken within 7 days of enrolling in the study, adefovir dipivoxil
             or drugs that may cause kidney problems, including aminoglycoside antibiotics,
             cidofovir, foscarnet, intravenous (IV) amphotericin B, IV pentamidine, IV vancomycin,
             and chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin).

          -  Have any medical conditions or have had any medications that the study investigator
             believes will make him/her unsuitable for the study.
