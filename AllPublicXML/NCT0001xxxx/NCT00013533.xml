      Background:

        -  Allogeneic blood and marrow stem cell transplantation (BMT) plays an important role in
           the curative treatment of a number of pediatric malignancies. Unfortunately, the success
           of conventional allogeneic BMT is limited in part by the multiple toxicities associated
           with myeloablative preparative regimens.

        -  Non-myeloablative pre-transplant regimens are associated with less toxic side effects
           than standard BMT. Recently, a novel immunosuppressive, non-myeloablative pre-transplant
           chemotherapy regimen has been shown to facilitate complete donor engraftment in an adult
           trial at the NCI.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective of this protocol is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this
      treatment approach in pediatric patients with hematopoietic malignancies

      Eligibility:

      Inclusion Criteria

      Age: Patient must be greater than or equal to 5 years and less than 22 years of age.

      Diagnosis:

        -  Hodgkin s and Non-Hodgkin s Lymphoma: Refractory disease or relapse after salvage
           regimen.

        -  Acute Myelogenous Leukemia: History of bone marrow relapse in remission (CR) #2 or
           greater.

        -  Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia: History of bone marrow relapse in CR #2 or greater (CR#1
           with Philadelphia chromosome positive or prior induction failure).

        -  Acute Hybrid Leukemia including mixed lineage, biphenotypic and undifferentiated:
           History of bone marrow relapse in CR #2 or greater (CR#1 with Philadelphia chromosome
           positive or prior induction failure).

        -  Myelodysplastic Syndrome: RAEB or RAEB-t with less than 10% blasts in marrow and blood.

        -  Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia: Chronic phase or accelerated phase with less than 10%
           blasts in marrow and blood.

        -  Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia: less than 10% blasts in marrow and blood.

      Prior Therapy: Chemotherapy to achieve above criteria allowed. Prior BMT allowed as long as
      at least day 100+ post-prior BMT, no evidence of GVHD, and no detectable residual donor
      chimerism.

      Donor: First degree related donors, who are HLA matched (single HLA-A or B locus mismatch
      allowed), weight greater than or equal to 15 kilograms, and who meet standard donation
      criteria will be considered. The same donor from a prior BMT is allowed.

      ECOG Performance Status: 0, 1, or 2. and life expectancy: greater than 3 months.

      Liver Function: Serum direct bilirubin less than 2.0 mg/dL and serum ALT and AST values less
      than or equal to 2.5x upper limit of normal. (Values above these levels may be accepted if
      due to malignancy.)

      Renal Function: Age adjusted normal serum creatinine or Cr clearance greater than or equal to
      60 mL/min/1.73 m(2).

      Pulmonary Function: DLCO greater than or equal to 50%.

      Cardiac Function: LVEF greater than or equal to 45% by MUGA or LVSF greater than or equal to
      28% by ECHO

      Exclusion Criteria

        -  Active CNS malignancy: Tumor mass on CT or leptomeningeal disease. (Patients with a
           history of CNS involvement and no current evidence of CNS disease are allowed.)

        -  HIV infection, active hepatitis B or C infection: HbSAg or HCV seropositive and elevated
           liver transaminases.

        -  Fanconi Anemia.

        -  Lactating or pregnant females.

      Design:

      Pilot Study

        -  Initial evaluation: Patient and donor will be screened for eligibility. G-CSF primed
           bone marrow derived stem cells will be collected from the donor.

        -  Induction/Consolidation chemotherapy: 1 to 3 cycles will be given every 22 days
           depending on disease response, CD4 count, and toxicities.

        -  Lymphoma: fludarabine, etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophohamide, prednisone,
           and filgrastim (EPOCH-fludarabine).

        -  Leukemia and MDS: Fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim (FLAG).

        -  Transplantation: Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide will be administered over 4 days
           followed by bone marrow transplant. Patients will remain hospitalized until bone marrow
           recovery. Patients will be monitored closely at the NIH for at least 100 days post-BMT.

        -  Post-transplant CNS prophylaxis for ALL: Standard post-transplant CNS prophylaxis will
           be employed with intrathecal methotrexate to decrease the risk of CNS relapse for all
           patients with ALL.

        -  Total number of recipient and donors to be accrued is 56.

        controlled by medication, or heart disease. Individuals with symptomatic angina or a
        history of coronary artery bypass grafting or angioplasty will not be eligible. History of
        congenital hematologic, immunologic, or metabolic disorder which in the estimation of the
        PI poses prohibitive risk to the recipient.

        Anemia (Hb less than gm/dl) or thrombocytopenia (less than 100,000/ul).

        Lactating or pregnant females.

        HIV positive.
