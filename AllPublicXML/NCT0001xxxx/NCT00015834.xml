    <textblock>
      Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining STI571 and chemotherapy in treating
      patients who have chronic myelogenous leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways
      to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. STI571 may stop the growth of
      leukemia cells. Combining chemotherapy and STI571 may kill more cancer cells

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of high-dose cytarabine when combined with imatinib
      mesylate in patients with blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      II. Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the frequency of
      hematologic and cytogenetic responses, duration of response, and survival of patients treated
      with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of cytarabine.

      Phase I: Patients who have not previously received imatinib mesylate receive oral imatinib
      mesylate daily on days 1-35. Patients who have previously received imatinib mesylate for at
      least 28 days receive oral imatinib mesylate on days 22-35. All patients receive cytarabine
      IV over 2 hours every 12 hours on days 29-32. Patients with more than 5% residual blasts in
      bone marrow on day 28 receive a second course in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of cytarabine until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Phase II: Additional patients are treated at the dose level preceding the MTD. Patients are
      followed monthly.
