      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CP4071 in treating patients who have
      locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy, in terms of response rate, of CP4071 in patients with previously
           treated, locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.

        -  Determine the clinical toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral CP4071 daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
