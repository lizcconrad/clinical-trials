  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells
      and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vinorelbine plus trastuzumab in treating
      patients who have refractory or metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of vinorelbine in combination with trastuzumab
           (Herceptin) in patients with HER-2/neu overexpressing unresectable or metastatic
           non-small cell lung cancer (closed to accrual as of 4/16/01) or refractory locally
           advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of this regimen in this
           patient population.

        -  Determine the objective response rate of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vinorelbine.

      Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1 and 8, and trastuzumab
      (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 8 and 15 of course 1 and days 1, 8, and 15 of all
      subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients receive escalating doses of vinorelbine until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-35 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Trastuzumab (INN; trade name Herceptin) is a monoclonal antibody that interferes with the HER2/neu receptor. Its main use is to treat certain breast cancers.
The HER receptors are proteins that are embedded in the cell membrane and communicate molecular signals from outside the cell to inside the cell, and turn genes on and off. The HER proteins regulate cell growth, survival, adhesion, migration, and differentiationâ€”functions that are amplified or weakened in cancer cells. In some cancers, notably some breast cancers, HER2 is over-expressed, and causes breast cells to reproduce uncontrollably.</description>
