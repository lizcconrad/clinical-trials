      The decision regarding the use of post-menopausal estrogen hormone replacement therapy (HT)
      is complex because patients must balance the short and long-term risks and benefits.
      Information from new and important clinical trials must also be considered. The purpose of
      this research is to develop and evaluate the efficacy of a HT CD-ROM decision-aid in
      improving the decision making process for women considering the use of estrogen HT.

      Background:

      The decision regarding the use of post-menopausal estrogen hormone replacement therapy (HT)
      is complex because patients must balance the short and long-term risks and benefits.
      Information from new and important clinical trials must also be considered. The purpose of
      this research is to develop and evaluate the efficacy of a HT CD-ROM decision-aid in
      improving the decision making process for women considering the use of estrogen HT.

      Objectives:

      The objectives of the study are to: 1) develop a model of the decision-making process for
      postmenopausal women considering hormone (HT), based on Multi-Attribute Utility Theory
      (MAUT); 2) produce an interactive CD-ROM decision-aid for HT; 3) evaluate the effect of the
      interactive CD-ROM decision-aid on patient satisfaction with decision (SWD) and knowledge
      about menopause and HT; and 4) test the effect of the interactive CD-ROM decision-aid on
      womenï¿½s decisions regarding use of HT.

      Methods:

      Phase I (completed) used structured interviews and surveys in the development of a decision
      model for HT. In phase II, an interactive CD-ROM decision-aid was developed and a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) of its effect on decision processes was conducted. Postmenopausal
      women, aged 45-74 were recruited from the primary care clinics of the four participating
      Veterans Affairs hospitals: Milwaukee, Madison, Chicago-Hines, and Chicago-Westside. The
      primary hypothesis was that women who use the CD-ROM decision-aid would demonstrate increased
      satisfaction with their decision regarding hormone replacement therapy use compared to women
      receiving the control intervention.

      Status:

      Enrollment and follow-up assessments have been completed. The study is in the analysis phase.
      The study was presented to the VA HSR&amp;D Combined Monitoring Board on February 5, 2003 and the
      committee voted unanimously to recommend continuation of the trial. The study has had one
      publication and several scientific abstract presentations.
