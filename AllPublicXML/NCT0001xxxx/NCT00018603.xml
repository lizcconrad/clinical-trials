    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study lasting 8 weeks. Purpose of the
      study is two-fold: first, to use a pharmacological agent to treat symptoms of PTSD, and
      second, to explore neurobiological mechanisms of action of guanfacine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subject population is comprised of 100 persons with PTSD. 50 patients will receive guanfacine
      and 50 patients will receive a placebo. Guanfacine is prescribed at 1 mg/day and may be
      increased to 2 mg/day. Samples of plasma MHPG will be collected weekly. Clinical ratings of
      PTSD anxiety and depression, as well as vital signs, will be assessed weekly. Repeated
      measures analysis of variance will assess significance of main effect of drug, time, and drug
      by time.
