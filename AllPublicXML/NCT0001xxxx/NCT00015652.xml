  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of a new treatment for hepatitis C (HCV) in
      patients who also have HIV.

      The usual treatment for HCV in people who are not HIV-infected is interferon-alfa (IFN) with
      ribavirin (RBV), an approved treatment by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This study
      will use a new, longer acting form of IFN called PEG-IFN alfa-2b. PEG-IFN alfa-2b is approved
      by the FDA for use in treating HCV but has not yet been approved for use with RBV. This study
      also will use IL-2, which is a substance that the body naturally produces. People with HIV
      infection usually do not make enough IL-2. IL-2 is being tested in this study to see if it
      will &quot;boost&quot; the immune system's response to HCV. The FDA has approved IL-2 for the treatment
      of some cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HCV infection is an increasingly important clinical problem in patients infected with HIV. In
      HIV-uninfected patients with acute HCV infection, the presence of vigorous T-cell
      proliferative responses to HCV proteins is associated with normalization of serum
      transaminase levels and viral clearance. Furthermore, early results suggest IL-2 may improve
      transaminase levels in HCV/HIV patients. These observations provide the rationale for an
      immune-based therapeutic approach to HCV/HIV coinfection. This study explores the use of
      initial immunostimulatory therapy with IL-2 followed by the addition of antiviral therapy
      with PEG-IFN alfa-2b and RBV, as a possible synergistic approach to treatment.

      Patients receive IL-2 for 12 weeks followed by the addition of PEG-IFN alfa-2b and RBV at the
      Week 12 visit. Patients remain on IL-2, PEG-IFN alfa-2b, and RBV for an additional 48 weeks.
      At Week 60, all study treatment is permanently discontinued and patients continue to be
      evaluated through Week 84. Toxicity or intolerance is evaluated. Data is collected on
      biochemical and virologic responses.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Are infected with HIV.

          -  Have been on the same anti-HIV drugs and doses, if on any, for 8 weeks or longer and
             intend to stay on these drugs the first 24 weeks of the study. If patients have not
             been on anti-HIV drugs, they should not start them during the first 24 weeks of the
             study.

          -  Have a CD4 count of 300 cells/mm3 or more within 30 days before study entry.

          -  Have an HIV viral load of less than 5,000 copies/ml within 30 days before study entry.

          -  Have a detectable HCV viral load within 30 days before study entry.

          -  Have a chronic HCV infection at least 6 months before study entry.

          -  Can document chronic hepatitis within 24 months before study entry.

          -  Agree not to become pregnant (females) or make someone pregnant (males), or donate
             sperm, or participate in any other fertilization procedures while on the study drugs
             and for 6 months afterwards. Agree to use reliable forms of birth control during the
             same time period.
