      This study will examine the safety of a new genetically engineered antibody called hLL2
      (epratuzumab) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It will also evaluate
      whether hLL2 can lessen overall disease activity in SLE or kidney damage in patients with
      lupus nephritis.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with mild to moderately active SLE may be eligible for
      this study. Candidates will be screened with blood and urine tests, a chest X-ray,
      electrocardiogram (EKG), tuberculin skin test, and screening tests for certain cancers.

      All participants will receive weekly infusions of hLL2 for 4 weeks. The drug is given through
      a catheter (small plastic tube) placed through a needle in an arm vein. Each infusion takes
      about 2 hours, after which the patient is observed in the clinic for 1 to 2 hours before
      being discharged from the clinic.

      The first 3 patients in the study will receive the lowest of three different doses used in
      the study. If this dose is well tolerated, the next 5 patients will receive a higher dose. If
      the second dose is tolerated, the last 5 patients will be given the highest dose. If any
      serious problems are encountered at a dose, patients in the next group will receive either
      the same or lower dose before being advanced to the next level. Patients in the first group
      will continue taking prednisone at their regular dose. All other patients will have their
      prednisone tapered gradually, if their condition permits. Patients who have a disease flare
      may have their prednisone increased for up to 2 weeks, followed by a gradual taper. If the
      flare is severe or does not respond to the increased prednisone, the patient will be taken
      off the study and treated to control the disease.

      Patients will be evaluated at various intervals for up to 8 weeks after the last dose.
      Several of the screening tests will be repeated throughout the study. No more than 500 ml of
      blood-the equivalent of a single blood donation-will be collected during a 2-month period.
      Participants may also be asked to undergo the following optional procedures before starting
      treatment, 1 week after the last dose and 8 weeks after the last treatment dose:

        -  Bone marrow aspiration - to collect cells from the bone marrow. The hip area is
           anesthetized and a special needle is used to draw bone marrow from the hipbone.

        -  Tonsil biopsy - The area to be biopsied is numbed with a local anesthetic and small
           pieces of tissue will be removed with a special type of forceps. (The procedure may be
           done under general anesthetic.)

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen - The patient lies on a table within a
           metal cylinder (the MRI scanner) for about 30 to 40 minutes while images are obtained
           with the use of a strong magnetic field and radio waves.

      This is a pilot study to evaluate the safety and tolerance of hLL2 (epratuzumab), a humanized
      anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody, in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

      B-lymphocytes play a major role in initiating and maintaining the underlying
      immunopathological mechanisms of SLE. In addition to producing autoantibodies, they also
      serve as antigen presenting cells and are able to disrupt peripheral T lymphocyte tolerance.
      Furthermore, B lymphocyte depletion ameliorates disease activity in animal models of SLE.
      Therefore, targeted depletion of B-lymphocytes may be of therapeutic benefit in human SLE.

      hLL2 (epratuzumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to CD22, a surface antigen
      expressed exclusively on B-lymphocytes. Clinical studies in patients with B cell lymphomas
      have shown that epratuzumab is safe and well tolerated across a wide range of doses. Although
      the exact mechanism is unknown, indirect evidence suggests that the antibody is depleting
      target B lymphocytes. Epratuzumab is made available by Immunomedics, Inc., and will be used
      under an investigator (NIH)-initiated IND.

      In this open-label, Phase I study, up to 20 patients with moderately active SLE may be
      enrolled. Patients will be treated with weekly infusions of hLL2 in one of three different
      dosing groups [(240 mg/m(2), 360 mg/m(2), 480 mg/m(2)] for 4 weeks, and followed for 8 weeks
      after the last dose.

      The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of hLL2 in patients with
      SLE. In addition to safety data, clinical and laboratory data will also be collected for
      preliminary evaluation of the effectiveness of hLL2 in SLE and to assess the effect of hLL2
      on B and T lymphocytes in the lymphoid organs and the peripheral blood. If the treatment is
      safe and there is preliminary evidence of efficacy, this regimen could be used in controlled
      trials in the future.
