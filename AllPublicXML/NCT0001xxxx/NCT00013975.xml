      This study will measure and compare the levels of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in the
      blood of people with and without risk factors for atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)
      to see if there is a relationship between these cells and cardiovascular risk factors such as
      smoking, high cholesterol level and high blood pressure.

      Healthy male volunteers between the ages of 21 and 55 years with and without heart disease
      risk factors may be eligible for this study. Candidates must have no evidence of coronary or
      peripheral vascular disease, proliferative retinopathy, or other chronic disease and no
      history of cancer, migraine-type headache, cluster headache, raised intraocular pressure,
      raised intracranial pressure, hyperthyroidism.

      Participants will undergo the following procedures at the NIH Clinical Center:

        -  Medical history and physical examination

        -  Blood tests to measure EPC level and various risk and growth factors

        -  Brachial reactivity study - This ultrasound study tests how well the subject's arteries
           widen. The subject rests on a bed for 30 minutes. An ultrasound measuring device is
           placed over the artery just above the elbow. The size of the artery and blood flow
           through it are measured before and after inflating a pressure cuff around the forearm.
           The pressure cuff stops the flow of blood to the arm for a few minutes. After a
           15-minute rest, the drug nitroglycerin is sprayed under the subject's tongue. Before the
           nitroglycerin spray and 3 minutes after it, the size of the artery and blood flow
           through it are measured again.

      Evidence suggests that risk factors for atherosclerosis contribute to atherogenesis by
      causing endothelial injury. However, little is known about determinants of endothelial cell
      repair and regeneration. We propose that mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)
      constitutes one mechanism for ongoing endothelial repair. EPCs are a bone marrow derived cell
      population that can be isolated from peripheral blood. Among human peripheral mononuclear
      cells, EPCs are relatively abundant with an estimated frequency of 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000
      cells. Evidence suggests that EPCs can participate in angiogenesis under pathophysiological
      circumstances. Under normal conditions, however, adult organisms undergo little if any active
      angiogenesis. One explanation for this set of observations is that high circulating levels of
      EPCs may exist to allow these cells to participate in functions beyond angiogenesis. We
      hypothesize that one such function is in the repair of ongoing endothelial injury. To test
      this hypothesis, we will measure peripheral blood EPC activity by ascertaining the number of
      EPC colony forming units from peripheral blood sampling. We intend to correlate this
      biological determinant with the degree of endothelial dysfunction assessed by flow-mediated
      brachial artery reactivity, and an atherosclerotic risk stratification method developed by
      the Framingham study. We hypothesize that a correlation will exist between the
      atherosclerotic risk profile, endothelial function and EPC activity and that the EPC activity
      will therefore become a novel surrogate biological marker for cumulative cardiovascular risk.
