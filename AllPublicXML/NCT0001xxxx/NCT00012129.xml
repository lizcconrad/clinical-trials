      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of annamycin liposomal in treating
      patients who have locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to
      previous chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the observed anti-tumor activity of annamycin liposomal in patients
      with anthracycline-resistant locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. II. Determine the
      qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of this regimen in these
      patients. III. Determine the clinical pharmacology of this regimen in these patients. IV.
      Determine the rationale for the dose and chosen schedule of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive annamycin liposomal IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      continues every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-30
      months.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer High
        likelihood of anthracycline resistance due to prior anthracycline exposure in the adjuvant
        or metastatic setting Prior anthraquinone (e.g., mitoxantrone) insufficient Prior
        cumulative anthracycline dose limited to doxorubicin-equivalent 350 mg/m2 by IV bolus or
        450 mg/m2 by prolonged (at least 48 hours) infusion Measurable or evaluable disease Brain
        metastases treated by prior surgery and/or radiotherapy allowed if neurologic status stable
        2 weeks after discontinuation of dexamethasone Hormone receptor status: Not specified

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: 18 and over Sex: Male or female Menopausal status: Not
        specified Performance status: Zubrod 0-2 Life expectancy: At least 12 weeks Hematopoietic:
        Absolute granulocyte count greater than 1,500/mm3 Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm3
        Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 mg/dL Renal: Creatinine no greater than 1.5 mg/dL
        Cardiovascular: No history of heart failure Ejection fraction at least 55% by 2-dimensional
        echocardiogram Other: Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must
        use effective contraception Other prior malignancy allowed if curatively treated and there
        is clear diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer requiring treatment

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: No concurrent prophylactic filgrastim (G-CSF)
        Chemotherapy: See Disease Characteristics At least 3 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6
        weeks for mitomycin or nitrosourea) and recovered Endocrine therapy: See Disease
        Characteristics Radiotherapy: See Disease Characteristics At least 3 weeks since prior
        radiotherapy and recovered Surgery: See Disease Characteristics
