      The project objective is to validate the types of eye trackers that may most effectively be
      employed in the rehabilitation evaluation and training of people with central scotomas. The
      eye trackers will include the three basic types of eye trackers, namely, 1)electrophysical,
      2) front surface trackers, and 3) retinal trackers.

      The project objective is to validate the types of eye trackers that may most effectively be
      employed in the rehabilitation evaluation and training of people with central scotomas. The
      eye trackers will include equipment representing the three basic types of eye trackers,
      namely, 1) electrophysical (e.g., electrooculogram or EOG), 2) front surface trackers (e.g.
      pupil), and 3) retinal trackers (e.g. SLO). The most appropriate eye tracking system for
      evaluation and training will depend on the type of eye movements (i.e., fixations, saccades,
      and pursuits) that comprise the complex eye movements used for visual skills (e.g., spotting,
      localization, scanning, tracing, tracking) which are being evaluated/trained for visually
      guided activities of daily living (e.g., reading, face recognition and television watching).

      The following methods will be employed. First, a Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (SLO) will be
      employed to confirm that people with central scotomas are recruited from the Atlanta VA Eye
      Clinic and the VA Rehab R&amp;D Subject Registry. SLO data taken for each eye will determine
      scotoma density, size and position. Visual functions of acuity, contrast sensitivity, and
      visual fields will be measured. Basic eye movements (e.g., fixation, tracking, saccades) and
      complex eye movements during visual tasks will be investigated to determine the effect of
      different biocular scotoma/PRL characteristics including: 1) central scotoma in one eye and
      functioning fovea in fellow eye, 2) central scotoma in both eyes and PRLs in retinal
      correspondence, and 3) central scotomas in both eyes with PRLs in anomalous retinal
      correspondence. Based on these biocular eye movement results, specifications can be developed
      for determining which eye can be used to monitor eye movements during binocular visual tasks
      (e.g., reading, face recognition, and TV event watching) as well as the need for biocular eye
      tracking equipment in evaluating complex eye movements. Each person will be tested using each
      representative eye tracker. The results of each eye tracker (position, velocity, and
      acceleration) in measuring PRL movements during fixation, saccade, and pursuit will be
      related to SLO measures. The results of these tests will also be compared to the types of
      measurements needed for evaluating complex eye movements in visual tasks. Specific
      measurements will be used to evaluate a patient's ability to perform the basic visual skills
      employed in performing everyday vision-related activities. The cost effectiveness of
      employing each type of eye tracker will be determined by a number of factors, including
      equipment cost, maintenance costs, ease of calibration and ease of use with low vision
      patients (e.g., feasibility for use with low vision patients who use head turns or optical
      low vision devices to view stimuli), and long-term reliability. Feasibility studies employing
      an eye tracker for eye movement monitoring during evaluations or biofeedback during training
      will be done in a few clinical studies (perimetry, PRL ability, visual scanning for reading
      training, and visual scanning for faces training) to indicate the potential clinical
      practicality of employing eye trackers for rehabilitative evaluation and training.
