      The primary objective of this multi-center sub-study of USPHS Study 23: &quot;Intensive
      Pharmacokinetic Study of Intermittent Rifabutin and Isoniazid with Daily Efavirenz in
      Combination with Two Nucleoside Analogs for Treatment of HIV and Tuberculosis Co-infections,&quot;
      is to compare the pharmacokinetics of rifabutin at 600 mg twice a week in combination with
      efavirenz 600 mg daily to the pharmacokinetics of rifabutin 300 mg twice a week without
      efavirenz. Secondary objectives are: (1) To describe pharmacokinetics of both rifabutin and
      efavirenz in combination regimen, (2) To evaluate the safety of concomitant efavirenz and
      rifabutin, (3) To assess the effect on absolute neutrophil count by changing rifabutin dose
      and adding efavirenz to the regimen, (4) To develop models of optimal sampling times for
      rifabutin dosed twice a week, (5) To describe the pharmacokinetics of isoniazid in
      combination with efavirenz daily with two NRTIs, (6) To compare the pharmacokinetics of
      isoniazid with and without efavirenz.

      BACKGROUND: There are two concerns regarding rifabutin and INH pharmacokinetics in this
      population: 1) Malabsorption of anti-TB medications is frequent in this population and 2)
      Many antiretrovirals and other drugs frequently used in the management of HIV-infected
      individuals are inhibitors of the cytochrome p450 3A4 isoform and result in increased levels
      of rifabutin. Correlation of the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes in the setting of
      these interactions is essential.

      METHODS: The study will be done on the General Clinical Research Center at Duke University
      Medical Center, on an inpatient basis (depending on where the patient lives). No one who is
      suspected of being infectious or is infectious from TB will be enrolled on the GCRC. After
      informed consent is obtained, each subject will be admitted to the GCRC twice; the first
      admission will occur after at least four twice weekly doses of intermittent rifabutin and
      prior to beginning antiretroviral therapy and the second admission will occur two to six
      weeks following the institution of an antiretroviral regimen including efavirenz. During
      Admission #1, blood will be drawn at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 21 hours post dosing with INH and
      rifabutin. During Admission #2, blood will be drawn at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours.
      Efavirenz will be given at time points 0 and 24 hours post sampling. TB drugs will be given
      at 3 hours (so that sampling times subsequent to INH/rifabutin dosing will correspond to
      those of Admission #1). Patients will be interviewed regarding concomitant medications,
      gastrointestinal symptoms and meals relative to study drug dosing. Sixty days following the
      last dose of PK study medicines, a follow-up visit or phone call (including review of medical
      record) will identify any adverse events.

      DATA ANALYSIS: Frequency distributions will include plots of the data, distribution curves to
      test for normality, parametric and non-parametric measures of central tendency and
      dispersion, as well as the Shapiro-Wilk W test for normality. Means will be reported + the
      standard deviation (SD). The percent coefficient of variation (CV) will be calculated as
      (SD/mean) multiplied by 100%. Correlation analysis (JMP) will be performed across the subject
      and outcome variables using non-parametric techniques (Spearman Rho, continuous data only).
      The dependence of outcome variables (the pharmacokinetic parameters) upon subject
      characteristics (demographic data such as age, weight, CD4 count, etc.) will be determined by
      using Y by X analyses, one parameter at a time (continuous or nominal data). Subsequently,
      models with multiple X variables will be constructed using forward addition and backward
      deletion. Correlations between parameters and covariates will be considered statistically
      significant at p 3/4 0.05.

        Inclusion criteria: Eligible subjects enrolled in Study 23 or HIV-infected patients with
        culture confirmed or suspected tuberculosis. Subjects must be currently receiving
        tuberculosis therapy including twice weekly isoniazid and rifabutin and currently not
        receiving antiretroviral therapy. Subjects must be willing to begin an antiretrovial
        regimen containing efavirenz and two NRTIs (combinations defined by protocol) at the
        requisite dosing. Exclusion criteria include hematocrit of less than 25%, pregnant or
        lactating women, prior use of an NNRTI, or use of a protease inhibitor or select
        medications defined in the protocol. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to
        practice an adequate (barrier) method of birth control and submit to serum pregnancy
        testing with 14 days of enrollment.
