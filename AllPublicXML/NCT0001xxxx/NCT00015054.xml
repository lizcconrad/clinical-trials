  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of methylphenidate (MPD) as
      effective and safe in the outpatient treatment of cocaine-dependent patients with a comorbid
      DSM-IV diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), to demonstrate the
      ability of each site to participate in a subsequent anticipated controlled trial of MPD
      (recruitment and execution), and to gather preliminary data on the ability of sweat patches
      to detect episodes of cocaine use.

      Forty-one participants were enrolled into this multi-site, outpatient, open-label, ten-week
      trial. Participants were scheduled to attend three visits per week to allow safety and
      efficacy measures to be taken. In addition, participants were given two hours of individual
      substance abuse therapy during the first four weeks, and one hour per week during the last
      six weeks, of the trial. All participants were started on a total daily dose of 20 mg MPD.
      The total daily dose was then increased to a maximum daily dose of 60 mg (20 mg TID) or to
      the maximum dose tolerated by the participant.

             screening examination.

          6. Subject must be negative for cocaine metabolites immediately prior to receiving a
             study treatment number and initial dose of MPD, as determined first by urine testing
             kit with result later confirmed by laboratory urine toxicology (BE &lt; 300 ng/ml).

          7. Subject must be willing and able to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has symptoms of AIDS.

          4. Subject meets DSM-IV criteria for dependence for any substance except cocaine,
             alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, caffeine, and has been actively using during the past
             two weeks.

          5. Subject is in need of detoxification from alcohol or benzodiazepines

             conduction

         11. Subject has organic brain syndrome (OBS) as evidenced in the psychiatric evaluation.

         12. Subject has an acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition which in the judgment
             of the evaluating physician would make study participation difficult or unsafe.
