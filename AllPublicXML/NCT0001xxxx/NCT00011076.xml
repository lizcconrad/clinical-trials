  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of the drug pirfenidone (Deskar) in improving heart
      function in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Stiffening of the heart muscle
      in patients with HCM impairs the heart's ability to relax and thus fill and empty properly.
      This can lead to heart failure, breathlessness and excessive fatigue. The heart's inability
      to relax may be due to scarring, or fibrosis, in the muscle wall. This study will test
      whether pirfenidone can reduce fibrosis, improve heart relaxation and reduce abnormal heart
      rhythms.

      Men and women 20 to 75 years old with HCM may be eligible for this study. Participants will
      undergo a physical examination, blood tests, and other tests and procedures, described below,
      to assess heart function. When the tests are completed, patients will be randomly assigned to
      one of two treatment groups. One group will take a pirfenidone capsule and the other will
      take a placebo (a look-alike pill with no active ingredient) twice a day with meals for 6
      months. For the pirfenidone group, the dose of drug will be increased gradually from 400 to
      800 milligrams. At the end of 6 months, all patients will repeat the physical examination and
      heart tests that were done before starting medication. These include:

        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) - electrodes are attached to the heart to record the heart's
           electrical activity, providing information on the heartbeat.

        -  Echocardiogram - a probe held against the chest wall uses sound waves to produce images
           of the heart, providing information on the function of the heart chambers.

        -  24-hour Holter monitor - a 24-hour recording of the electrical activity of the heart
           monitors for abnormal heartbeats or conduction abnormalities.

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - Radiowaves and a strong magnetic field are used to
           produce images of the heart, providing information on the thickness and movement of the
           heart muscle.

        -  Radionuclide angiogram - a radioactive tracer is injected into a vein and a special
           camera is used to scan the heart, providing information on the beating motion of the
           heart. Scans are obtained at rest and after exercise.

        -  Cardiac (heart) catheterization - a catheter (thin plastic tube) is inserted into a
           blood vessel in the groin and advanced to the heart to record pressures and take
           pictures inside the heart.

        -  Electrophysiology study - a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and
           advanced to the heart to record electrical activity, providing information on abnormal
           heart rhythms. This procedure is done at the time of the heart catheterization.

        -  Cardiac biopsy - a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and advanced to
           the heart to remove a small sample of heart muscle for microscopic examination. This
           procedure is done at the end of the heart catheterization.

      Left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias are important causes of morbidity
      and mortality in HCM. These abnormalities are believed to be in part due to myocardial
      fibrosis which frequently complicates HCM. Several studies indicate that pirfenidine can
      safely inhibit progression or cause regression of fibrotic lesions. We therefore propose to
      perform a six-month study that examines the ability of pirfenidone to improve LV diastolic
      dysfunction, exercise performance, and electrophysiologic abnormalities in symptomatic
      patients with severe HCM.
