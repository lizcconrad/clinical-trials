      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of R115777 in treating patients who have
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the rate of objective response and disease stabilization in patients
      with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma treated with R115777. II. Determine whether the
      degree of inhibition of FTase activity and farnesylation of lamin-B, H-, K-, and N-RAS in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor tissue correlates with tumor response in
      patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine whether the presence of activating RAS
      mutations in myeloma cells predicts treatment response in patients treated with this regimen.
      IV. Correlate R115777 plasma levels and RAS mutation status with tumor response in patients
      treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral R115777 twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      for at least 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-42 patients will be accrued for this study within 25
      months.

    <description>The primary end point of the study is to determine the rate of objective response and disease stabilization. Responses were to be defined according to modified Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria. Disease progression was defined as a 25% increase in the serum M-component confirmed by a second measurement obtained within 1 to 4 weeks of the first measurement, or an increase in the 24-hour urine M-component by more than 50%, confirmed by a second measurement. Other criteria for disease progression included the need to administer radiotherapy, new lytic bone lesions, enlargement of existing bone lesions, or new soft tissue plasmacytomas.</description>

    <description>Patients will be administered oral FTI (R115777) at a dose of 300-mg by mouth (PO) twice a day (BID). Drug will be taken without regard to meals.
The study regimen will consist of 3 weeks of treatment followed by one week off for a total cycle duration of 4 weeks.</description>
