  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if emtricitabine is safe in children infected with HIV
      and to determine the best dose.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children are placed into 1 of 4 treatment groups based on age: Group 1, 3 months to 24
      months; Group 2, 25 months to 6 years; Group 3, 7 years to 12 years; Group 4, 13 years to 17
      years. They receive baseline evaluations. Antiretroviral-naive patients receive emtricitabine
      plus stavudine plus lopinavir/ritonavir. Antiretroviral-experienced patients replace
      lamivudine with emtricitabine. Patients return to the clinic for follow-up visits at Weeks 2
      and 4 and then every 4 weeks until Week 48. Safety is evaluated using adverse events, which
      are reviewed at every clinic visit. Clinical laboratory data and full-profile
      pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine are evaluated at some visits. After the Week 48 study
      evaluations are completed, individual patients may continue to receive study medication (as
      provided by the sponsor) until commercially available, if certain criteria are met.

             between 5,000 and 500,000 copies/ml at screening. Those that have must have been
             taking anti-HIV drugs, including lamivudine, for at least 3 months and have a viral
             load of no more than 400 copies/ml at screening.

          -  Have a CD4 count of more than 200 cells/mm3.

          -  Have written consent from parent or guardian.

          -  Are willing to use effective birth control during the study and for 1 month after the

          -  Cannot follow the visit or dosing schedule or are not available for 1 year.

          -  Have taken experimental drugs or vaccines (except for emivirine and experimental forms
