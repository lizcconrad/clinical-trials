  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective cohort study examines the role of prenatal and early postnatal lead exposure
      on the neuropsychological status and social adjustment of adolescents enrolled in the
      Cincinnati Lead Study. We are examining the relationship between moderate exposure to lead
      and neuropsychological deficits, difficulties in peer relationships, personality disturbances
      and juvenile delinquency. This birth cohort of approximately 300 subjects has been followed
      since 1980 with regularly scheduled assessments of blood lead concentrations, health history,
      social and hereditary factors, and neurobehavioral development.

        Subjects for the Cincinnati Lead Study were recruited prenatally if their mothers resided
        in areas within Cincinnati, Ohio where there has historically been a high incidence of lead
        poisoning. Infants were eligible for follow-up if they were greater than 1500 grams at
        birth and had no disqualifying medical conditions such as defined genetic syndromes or
        other serious complications that may adversely affect neurobehavioral development.
