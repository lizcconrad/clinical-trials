      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity of cyclophosphamide and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin
      in patients with diffuse systemic sclerosis.

      II. Determine the efficacy of this regimen in terms of controlling disease in these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on day 1 and rabbit
      anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 6-8 hours on days 2-5.

      Patients are followed on days 60-85 and then every 3 months for 1 year.
