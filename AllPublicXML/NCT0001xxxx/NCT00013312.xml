  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare individuals with acute SCI to control patients in order to: 1.
      Determine if there are changes in colonic tone and sensation after SCI by comparing the
      fasting responses to the postprandial responses; 2. Determine if there are changes in colonic
      phasic motility after SCI by comparing the fasting responses to the postprandial responses;
      3. Determine if colonic motor and sensory function after SCI change over time by repeating
      these studies six month later in SCI and control patients.
