  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether fluoxetine (Prozac), used together with traditional
      psychotherapy, can reduce aggression in people who are physically violent towards their
      spouses or significant others. Treatment for domestic violence has centered on behavioral
      therapies, such as anger management and self-control exercises. Recent studies have shown
      that fluoxetine-a drug commonly used to treat depression and panic disorder-can decrease acts
      of aggression.

      Men and women between the ages of 18 and 65 who have a history of inflicting physical
      aggression on a spouses or significant others in the past year (with at least one episode
      occurring not under the influence of alcohol) may be eligible for this study. Participants
      spouses or significant others will also be asked to participate. All potential participants
      will be screened with a medical and psychiatric evaluation and history, breath alcohol
      analysis, blood tests, urine drug screen and electrocardiogram.

      Those enrolled will undergo the following procedures:

      Perpetrator

        -  Interview and questionnaires - Participants will be interviewed by a social worker about
           past and current mental health and use of alcohol and illicit drugs and will complete
           questionnaires assessing emotional state and personality, depression, anxiety,
           aggression and alcohol consumption. Some of the questionnaires will be repeated at
           monthly intervals.

        -  Physical performance testing - Performance and speed will be measured in three separate
           training sessions that involve repeatedly pressing a button on a button box console,
           earning points worth money.

        -  Dyadic interaction paradigm - Participants will interact with their spouse/significant
           other in a small room, first discussing a neutral topic, such as the day's events, and
           then a subject that has been a source of conflict.

        -  Fluoxetine administration - Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 10
           mg. of fluoxetine or placebo (identical capsules with no active ingredients) once a day
           for 3 days, then twice a day, increasing up to four capsules a day if there are no
           serious side effects. Blood will be drawn once a month to measure drug levels. At the
           end of 3 months, participants taking placebo may remain in the study and receive
           fluoxetine.

        -  Clinic visits - Participants are followed in the clinic weekly for the first month, then
           twice a month for the next 2 months for adjustment of number of pills, evaluation of
           aggressive behavior and alcohol consumption, and therapy for issues of self-esteem,
           anger management and communication skills. Couples therapy aimed at conflict resolution
           and improving communication skills will be offered.

        -  Genetic tests (optional) - Blood will be drawn to determine if there is a relationship
           between genes involved in a chemical process (serotonin reuptake) that is influenced by
           fluoxetine and the participant's response to the drug.

      Spouse/Significant other:

      Spouses/significant others will complete several questionnaires once a month (total 4 times)
      to rate their partners' behavior while in the study. They will also participate in the dyadic
      interaction paradigm described above at the beginning and end of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no controlled studies assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions
      to decrease aggression in perpetrators of domestic violence. Since serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRI) have been shown to decrease aggression in other patient populations, we
      will examine the effectiveness of SSRIs in reducing aggression in perpetrators of domestic
      violence. In this protocol, perpetrators of domestic violence will be randomized according to
      a double-blind design to receive either the SSRI, fluoxetine, or placebo. All participants
      will receive psychotherapy. All participants will also be carefully monitored in the
      outpatient clinic on a regular basis for three months. Drug efficacy will be established
      using validated rating scales and provocative aggression inducing paradigms.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Men and women over the age of 18 will be eligible for the study if they have:

        A history of at least two episodes of physical aggression (i.e., hitting, pushing,
        punching, choking etc.) toward their spouse or significant other in the past year;

        A history of at least one episode of physical aggression toward their spouse or significant
        other which occurred when the perpetrator had not used alcohol/drugs for at least a day;

        A score of at least 3 on the Straus Conflict Tactics physical violence subscale;

        A signed informed consent for participation in the protocol; and

        Agreed to provide investigators with phone numbers of family and/or friends who will be

        perpetrator does not come to appointments.

        neurological pacemaker; cochlear or eye implant).
