      RATIONALE: Immunosuppressive therapy may improve bone marrow abnormalities and may be
      effective treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome. It is not yet known whether
      immunosuppressive therapy is more effective than supportive care in treating myelodysplastic
      syndrome.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of antithymocyte globulin
      with that of supportive care in treating patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the clinical response rate of patients with early myelodysplastic syndrome
           treated with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin vs standard supportive care.

        -  Evaluate the safety of anti-thymocyte globulin in these patients.

        -  Compare the time to and duration of clinical response, rates of partial response and
           therapy failure, and rate of disease progression in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the ECOG performance score, number of transfusions and/or growth factor use, and
           maximum time between transfusions in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the infection risk, use of medical resources, and quality of clinical response
           in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtype (refractory anemia (RA) vs RA with excess
      blasts or hypocellular MDS). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) IV over at least 8-12 hours
           on days 1-4.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard supportive therapy for 6 months. At the end of 6
           months, patients may receive ATG as in arm I.

      Patients are followed for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients (48 in arm I and 24 in arm II) will be accrued
      within a minimum of 6 months.
