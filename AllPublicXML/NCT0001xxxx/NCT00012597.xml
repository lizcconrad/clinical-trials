    <textblock>
      A Web-based telemedicine system for monitoring the status of patients with pressure ulcers
      has been developed. It consists of three major data collection components: (1) digital
      photograph of ulcer; (2) quantitative measurements of wound status (i.e., ulcer area and
      volume, skin elasticity); and (3) other wound and patient data collected by a nurse. Data are
      collected via laptop computer and transmitted to a central database, where a computer program
      transforms the data into the necessary reporting format. The output is posted onto a World
      Wide Web page for access by the consulting physician. The system incorporates all data
      requirements for assessment recommended by AHCPR's Clinical Practice Guideline, Treatment of
      Pressure Ulcers.

      Background:

      A Web-based telemedicine system for monitoring the status of patients with pressure ulcers
      has been developed. It consists of three major data collection components: (1) digital
      photograph of ulcer; (2) quantitative measurements of wound status (i.e., ulcer area and
      volume, skin elasticity); and (3) other wound and patient data collected by a nurse. Data are
      collected via laptop computer and transmitted to a central database, where a computer program
      transforms the data into the necessary reporting format. The output is posted onto a World
      Wide Web page for access by the consulting physician. The system incorporates all data
      requirements for assessment recommended by AHCPR's Clinical Practice Guideline, Treatment of
      Pressure Ulcers.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the clinical accuracy of a
      telemedicine system for assessing the status of pressure ulcers, both chronic and those which
      have been surgically repaired. The principal hypotheses were: (1) use of the telemedicine
      system results in the same diagnoses as does in-person patient assessment; and (2) patients
      are satisfied with the telemedicine system.

      Methods:

      Two VA medical centers and two specialties participated in the study: Ann Arbor (plastic
      surgery) and Augusta (plastic surgery, physical medicine and rehabilitation). They
      contributed inpatients and outpatients with a pressure ulcer of stage II, III, or IV over a
      one-year enrollment period. All study patients were assessed both in-person (the &quot;gold
      standard&quot;) and with the telemedicine system. The in-person and telemedicine physicians
      provided yes/no responses to four diagnostic questions concerning wound healing and
      infection, based on AHCPR guidelines, and they were blinded to each otherï¿½s assessments.
      Patient satisfaction data were collected using a specially designed, self-administered
      questionnaire to measure perceptions regarding the burden of the telemedicine system,
      confidence in the evaluation, and absence of direct contact with a physician.
