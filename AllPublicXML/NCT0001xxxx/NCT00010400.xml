      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the induction of durable remission in patients with life-threatening systemic
      lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome treated with cyclophosphamide.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days 1-4 and filgrastim (G-CSF) beginning on day 10
      and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.
