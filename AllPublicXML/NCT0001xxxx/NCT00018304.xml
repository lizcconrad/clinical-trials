  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this proposal is to examine the contribution of changes in total
      body fat, enhancement in insulin-mediated vasodilatation and enhancement in
      endothelium-derived nitric oxide production to the improvements in metabolic insulin action.
      In addition, the study will track whether these improvements are related to changes in blood
      pressure.
