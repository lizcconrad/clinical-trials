  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research program is to implement a series of psychoeducational training
      classes designed to teach individuals with schizophrenia the importance of medication
      treatment, how to identify and manage medication side effects, and how to make appointments
      and emergency plans. The skills taught to the research subjects will lead to demonstrable
      increases (compared to the control group) in adherence to both the prescribed medication
      regimen and scheduled outpatient appointments and thereby cause a decrease (again compared to
      the control group) in rehospitalization rates and bed-days during subsequent twelve months
      following the intervention. A secondary objective of this work is that if the CREP program is
      successful and/or illness education is effective, the data will be able to disseminated
      throughout the VISN 22 via the recently awarded Mental Illness Research Education and
      Clinical Center (MIRECC) program.
