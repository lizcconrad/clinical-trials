  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a fatal
      neurodegenerative disease that poses a significant burden for affected individuals and their
      family members. The principal objective of this epidemiologic study is to identify
      environmental and genetic risk factors for ALS. Of primary interest is whether environmental
      chemicals such as heavy metals, pesticides and organic solvents contribute to the cause of
      ALS. We also aim to identify genetic factors that contribute to the risk of ALS because
      individuals with certain genetic traits may be unable to protect against the toxic effects of
      chemical exposure. Other factors that may protect against the development of ALS, such as
      dietary antioxidants, are also under investigation. If modifiable factors affecting the risk
      for ALS could be identified, interventions to delay or even prevent the development of ALS
      could be developed.

      The principal objective of this study is to identify environmental and/or genetic risk
      factors for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We are addressing this objective by
      conducting a case-control study of ALS in the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical
      Care Program (KPMCP). Over a four-year period, approximately 175 persons newly diagnosed with
      ALS will be identified and recruited through physician referrals and computerized mechanisms
      available within the Kaiser system. The patients with ALS will be compared to a sample of 350
      age- and gender-matched persons without ALS from the same membership. Specific study aims are
      as follows: (1) to investigate the association of ALS with exposure to neurotoxicants
      including lead, other heavy metals, solvents and pesticides; (2) to determine whether
      inadequate oxidative defenses for protecting against free-radicals enhance the toxicity of
      exogenous exposures; (3) to examine the evidence for familial aggregation of
      neurodegenerative diseases among first-degree relatives of patients with ALS; and (4) to
      estimate the incidence of ALS in diverse racial and ethnic groups.

        Individuals with ALS within the Kaiser Permanente population of Northern California, ages
        18 years and older, with first diagnosis of ALS in the years 1996-2000.

        Controls are individuals who are age- and sex-matched to the patients with ALS, also from
