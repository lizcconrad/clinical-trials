      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Giving drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan
      works in treating patients with primary unresectable liver cancer or liver metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine response rate, duration of response, and patterns of recurrence in patients
           with primary or metastatic, unresectable cancers of the liver after treatment with
           isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan.

        -  Determine the disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients who are otherwise eligible undergo an exploratory laparotomy of the
      peritoneal cavity. Patients with peritoneal seeding, unresectable extrahepatic metastases, or
      unresectable pathologically-involved lymph nodes outside area of portahepatis do not receive
      treatment. Remaining patients receive isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan. Liver
      perfusion proceeds for 1 hour.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 4 months until
      disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 67 patients will be accrued for this study.
