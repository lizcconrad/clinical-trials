      RATIONALE: Adenosine triphosphate may decrease weight loss and improve muscle strength in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of adenosine triphosphate in controlling
      loss of weight and loss of muscle mass in patients who have advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the individualized maximum tolerated dose of adenosine triphosphate in
           patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on quality of life of these patients.

        -  Determine the influence of this regimen on cancer cachexia in terms of weight change,
           percentage of body fat, voluntary muscle strength, and plasma markers in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on tumor burden in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive adenosine triphosphate (ATP) IV over 8 hours on day 0. Treatment repeats
      weekly for a total of 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Each patient receives escalating doses of ATP until the individual maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which the patient
      experiences at least grade 3 (at least grade 2 cardiac ischemia or arrhythmia) toxicity.

      Weight is measured at baseline and at weeks 1-8, 10, and 13. Percentage of body fat and
      skeletal muscle strength is measured at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8, 10, and 13.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8, 10, and 13.

      Patients are followed at weeks 10 and 13.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 13-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
