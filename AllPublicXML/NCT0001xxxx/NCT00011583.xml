  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our long term objectives are to understand the mechanisms of motor impairment following
      neurologic injury and to develop interventions to improve motor recovery. A series of
      complementary, overlapping clinical trials and development activities will validate and
      optimize the use of robot-assisted upper limb therapy for neuro rehabilitation.

      We have developed a robotic system that assists or resists elbow and shoulder movements in
      three dimensional space. In addition to unilateral exercise modes, a novel bimanual mode
      enables hemiparetic subjects to practice mirror image upper limb exercises.

      Randomized controlled clinical trial of the Mirror Image Movement Enabler (MIME) robotic
      device for shoulder and elbow neurorehabilitation in subacute stroke patients. MIME
      incorporates a PUMA 560 robot that applies forces to the paretic limb during unilateral and
      bilateral movements in three dimensions. Robot-assisted treatment (bilateral, unilateral, and
      combined bilateral and unilateral) was compared with conventional therapy.
