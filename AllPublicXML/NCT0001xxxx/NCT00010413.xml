      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate and 1-year event-free survival of patients with refractory
      pemphigus treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days 1-4 and filgrastim (G-CSF)
      beginning on day 10 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for 6 months, every 4 months for a
      year, and then annually thereafter.

        PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA:

        --Disease Characteristics--

        Definitive diagnosis of pemphigus, including all of the following: Typical clinical lesions
        Histologically proven by skin or mucous membrane biopsy Pemphigus IgG autoantibodies in
        skin or mucous membrane by direct immunofluorescence (IF) Circulating pemphigus IgG
        autoantibodies in serum by indirect IF

        Dependence on high-dose corticosteroids

        Persistent disease activity despite treatment with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine,
        or inability to tolerate these drugs (for paraneoplastic pemphigus, persistent disease
        activity despite treatment with cyclosporine)

        --Prior/Concurrent Therapy--

        No concurrent cytotoxic therapy

        Cardiovascular: LVEF at least 40%

        Pulmonary: FVC, FEV1, or DLCO at least 50% predicted

        Other: Not pregnant Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 9
        months after study Not preterminal or moribund
