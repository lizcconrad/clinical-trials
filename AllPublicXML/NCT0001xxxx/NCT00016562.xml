  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the origin and development of certain neurological diseases involving
      abnormal metabolism. A significant number of patients with progressive neurological disorders
      have not been diagnosed despite extensive workups. Lack of a specific diagnosis may amplify
      the distress of both the patient and family and decrease the chance of obtaining effective
      therapy. This study will try to advance the diagnosis and management of such patients.

      Patients with a metabolic neurological disease of unknown cause or one which presents an
      unusual or difficult management problem may be eligible for this study. This study does not
      include patients with known or suspected leukodystrophy.

      Participants will undergo various procedures, including physical and neurologic examinations,
      blood and urine tests, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the extent and
      severity of disease. MRI scanning uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to show
      structural and chemical changes in the brain. During the procedure, the patient lies on a
      table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. He or she can speak with a staff
      member via an intercom system at all times during the procedure. Patients will also have a
      lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which bathes the brain
      and spinal cord. To obtain the fluid, a local anesthetic is administered and a needle is
      inserted in the space between the bones in the lower back where the CSF circulates below the
      spinal cord. A small amount of fluid is collected through the needle. Although spinal fluid
      will not be examined regularly, this test may be requested during some clinic visits.

      X-rays, nuclear medicine scans and consultations may be obtained as needed. Other tests may
      include electroencephalograms (brain wave recordings), psychological tests, and speech and
      language and rehabilitation evaluations. A skin biopsy may be done to grow cells in culture
      for metabolic and genetic testing and to analyze the skin under a microscope. For the biopsy,
      an area of skin is numbed with an anesthetic and a small circular area is removed, using a
      sharp cookie cutter-type instrument.

      First degree relatives (parents, children or siblings) of patients with a metabolic disorder
      of unknown cause will be asked to provide a blood sample for DNA studies to try to identify
      genetic basis of the disorder.

      The study is expected to continue for 3 years, with yearly monitoring of patients for changes
      in neurological, ophthalmological and general medical status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On this protocol we will see patients of all ages with a neurodegenerative disorder of
      unknown etiology, as well patients with known diseases that are atypical or present difficult
      management problems. Patients with a known or a suspected leukodystrophy will be excluded
      from this study. Lack of specific diagnosis amplifies the distress felt by patients and
      families and decreases the chance of effective therapy. Clinical and laboratory evaluation
      will include blood, urine, spinal fluid, peripheral tissue pathology and radiological
      studies.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Patients are those referred by their physician for a second opinion because of inability to
        arrive at a diagnosis despite a reasonably complete evaluation.

        Written informed consent given by the patient or his/her guardian.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Patients with a known or suspected leukodystrophy will be excluded from this study.

        Patients who are unable to come to the NIH.

        When no informed consent was given.

        If on the opinion of the investigator, participation in this protocol will be to the
        detriment of the patient.
