  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine whether sequence variation in the lipoprotein lipase
      (LPQ) gene affects the amount of weight loss and metabolic responses during a hypocaloric
      diet treatment for overweight and obese (BMI=25-35 kg/m2), older (50-65 yrs), sedentary
      veterans.

      Veterans who are 50-65 yrs, non-smoking, sedentary and weight stable with a BMI between 25-35
      kg/m2 (120-150% desirable body weight) are recruited and screened via telephone, medical
      history, and physical exam. Exclusion criteria are: diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia (&gt;400
      mg/dl), history of cancer or myocardial infarction, clinical depression, renal, liver or
      hematologic disease, and medications that affect glucose or lipid metabolism (thiazides,
      estrogen replacement, beta-blockers). Changes in total and visceral body fat are measured by
      dual x-ray absorptiometry and computerized tomography, resting energy expenditure and fat
      oxidation rate by indirect calorimetry, and lipoprotein lipids by enzymatic assay. Glucose
      tolerance is assessed during a three-hour oral glucose tolerance test with measurement of
      glucose- and insulin levels every 30 minutes. LPL activity is measured in 3050mg pieces of
      subcutaneous abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue.
