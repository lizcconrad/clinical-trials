      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients who have metastatic Ewing's sarcoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the activity of cisplatin and etoposide in terms of response of patients with
           metastatic Ewing's sarcoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor.

        -  Assess the bone marrow and kidney toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 3 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, and 43 and oral
      etoposide daily on days 1-15 and 29-43 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
