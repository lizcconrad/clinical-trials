  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether the metabolic and cellular mechanisms contributing to
      improved insulin action after aerobic or resistive exercise are different in older, obese,
      insulin resistant veterans. The hypothesis is that regular exercise, whether aerobic or
      resistive, will improve whole body insulin action, but the nature and magnitude of changes in
      skeletal muscle will differ between the two types of exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Veterans will be of comparable body composition and age, and randomly assigned to either
      aerobic or resistive exercise. They will be instructed in a weight maintenance diet prior to
      beginning the exercise program, and maintain this diet throughout the study. Metabolic
      testing will be performed at baseline and after 6 months of exercise training. Testing will
      include measurement of body composition (anthropometry, dual-energy Xray absorptiometry,
      computed tomograph scan), maximal oxygen consumption, and muscle strength, glucose tolerance
      (oral glucose tolerance test), insulin sensitivity (euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp), and
      muscle biopsies to examine skeletal muscle metabolic characteristics (fiber type
      distribution, capillary density, oxidative and glycolytic enzyme activities, and levels of
      key proteins important in insulin signaling and glucose transport). Data will be analyzed
      using analysis of variance to determine differences between the two exercise groups, and
      multiple regression analysis to determine the primary adaptations that are associated with
      the improvements in whole body insulin action.
