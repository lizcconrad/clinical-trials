      Sleep-activity rhythm disturbance is a prevalent, disabling symptom in cognitively-impaired
      (CI) elders. Their nocturnal sleep is light and inefficient with frequent awakenings.
      Multiple short daytime napping episodes interfere with daytime activity and functioning.
      Daytime disruptive behaviors, such as pacing, hitting, and cursing are related significantly
      to sleep-activity rhythm disturbance. Medical treatment for sleep and behavior disturbances
      with benzodiazepines or antipsychotic medications has proven minimally effective and has
      serious side effects such as impairments in cognition, memory, coordination, and balance,
      tolerance and severe rebound insomnia, and tardive dyskinesia.

      Background:

      Sleep-activity rhythm disturbance is a prevalent, disabling symptom in cognitively-impaired
      (CI) elders. Their nocturnal sleep is light and inefficient with frequent awakenings.
      Multiple short daytime napping episodes interfere with daytime activity and functioning.
      Daytime disruptive behaviors, such as pacing, hitting, and cursing are related significantly
      to sleep-activity rhythm disturbance. Medical treatment for sleep and behavior disturbances
      with benzodiazepines or antipsychotic medications has proven minimally effective and has
      serious side effects such as impairments in cognition, memory, coordination, and balance,
      tolerance and severe rebound insomnia, and tardive dyskinesia.

      Objectives:

      The degree of daytime sleepiness in elders may reflect a reduction in the purposive physical,
      cognitive, and affective activities that previously sustained daytime alertness and promoted
      psychological well-being. For some institutionalized elders, living in a physically,
      cognitively, and emotionally understimulating setting may induce excessive napping during the
      day with a subsequent adverse impact on circadian sleep-wake patterns. Concrete,
      reality-based activities may counter napping by keeping residents with dementia involved in
      the world around them and helping them meet psychological, physical, and social needs. Our
      pilot study with five nursing home residents demonstrated that activities timed to occur
      during usual naptime and tailored to residentsï¿½ interests and their remaining abilities
      improved nocturnal sleep. Our other research has shown that engaging residents in meaningful
      activity improved their psychological well-being and decreased certain types of disruptive
      behaviors.

      Methods:

      We tested the effect of an Individualized Activity Intervention timed to occur when the
      resident usually napped in the daytime on nocturnal sleep as measured by actigraphy in CI
      nursing home residents. Examples of individualized activities include objects for tactile and
      visual stimulation, arts and crafts, and games. We also tested the effect of the intervention
      on psychological well-being and disruptive behavior, and measured its cost. After the
      collection of baseline sleep, disruptive behavior, and psychological well-being data for five
      days, residents were randomly assigned to the Individualized Activity Intervention or to a
      usual care control condition for 21 days. On days 17-21, the research assistant repeated the
      outcome measures.

      Status:

      Secondary data analysis on psychological well-being, disruptive behavior, and cost of the
      intervention is in progress.
