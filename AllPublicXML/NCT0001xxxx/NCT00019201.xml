      RATIONALE: Fluorescent bronchoscopy, when used in combination with conventional white light
      bronchoscopy, may improve the ability to detect early lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: A pilot study to evaluate fluorescent light bronchoscopy plus conventional
      bronchoscopy as a tool for screening and detecting lung cancer in persons with completely
      resected head and neck cancer or successfully treated early-stage lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of autofluorescence bronchoscopy using the Lung Imaging
           Fluorescence Endoscopic System with conventional white-light bronchoscopy for the early
           detection of lung cancer in selected patients with known or suspected bronchogenic
           carcinoma, completely resected head and neck cancer, and successfully treated
           early-stage lung cancer.

        -  Determine the number of areas of moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in
           situ in patients treated with surgery for lung cancer compared with patients treated
           with combined modality therapy.

        -  Determine the ability of immunohistochemistry to predict whether lesions of moderate to
           severe dysplasia will progress to cancer.

      OUTLINE: If possible, patients produce a 3-day pooled sputum sample prior to bronchoscopy.
      Patients then undergo tracheobronchial white-light bronchoscopy followed by autofluorescence
      bronchoscopy using the Lung Imaging Fluorescence Endoscopic (LIFE) Device attached to a
      computerized video camera. Visualized tissue is classified as either normal, abnormal, or
      suspicious. Abnormal or suspicious tissue is biopsied, as is tissue from 1 or 2 randomly
      chosen normal sites. Immunohistochemical analysis of the biopsy material is conducted without
      knowledge of the bronchoscopic results. Patients unable to produce a sputum sample prior to
      bronchoscopy are required to do so after bronchoscopy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be entered.
