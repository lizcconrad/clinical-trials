      This randomized phase III trial studies aldesleukin with vaccine therapy to see how well it
      works compared to aldesleukin alone in treating patients with melanoma that has spread from
      where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or to other places in the body. Aldesleukin
      may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill melanoma cells. Vaccines may make the body
      build an immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether combining
      aldesleukin with vaccine therapy is more effective than aldesleukin alone in treating
      melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify whether the addition of the peptide vaccine to high dose interleukin (IL)-2
      (aldesleukin) can result in a clinical response rate which may be superior to that found in
      similar patients treated with high dose IL-2 alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity profile of patients treated on this trial, according to the
      regimen received.

      II. To compare the disease free/progression free survival of patients treated on both arms of
      the study.

      III. To determine the immunologic response experienced by patients who have received the
      peptide vaccination, as measured by changes in T-cell precursors from before to after
      treatment.

      IV. To evaluate the quality of life of patients before and after high-dose IL-2.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive aldesleukin intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes every 8 hours for 12
      doses.

      ARM II: Patients receive gp100 antigen emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SC) on
      day 1. Patients also receive aldesleukin as in Arm I beginning on day 2.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease 3 weeks
      after completing 2 courses may receive a maximum of 12 additional courses. Patients with
      complete response may receive a maximum of 2 additional courses.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every 4
      months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

    <measure>Best Response Rate (Partial Response [PR] + Complete Response [CR])</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 years</time_frame>
    <description>A complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all clinical evidence of disease for at least 4 weeks. A partial response (PR) was defined as a 50% or greater decrease in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions for at least one month. No new lesions could appear, and none could increase 25% or more.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization until documentation of progression or last follow up, assessed up to 12 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival was compared between groups by means of Kaplan-Meier curves using the log-rank test to evaluate the significance of the difference between the arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in T-cell Precursors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 12 years</time_frame>
    <description>To measure change in T-cell precursors, PBMC were tested for reactivity by measuring gamma-interferon release after overnight coculture with peptide pulsed T2 cells. PBMC obtained after 4 cycles of study treatment were compared to pre treatment PBMC. A positive assay was defined as greater than 100pg/ml gamma-interferon release and at least twice the release (including all control peptides) by post treatment PBMC compared to pre treatment PBMC.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life (QOL) Score Assessed by the FACT-G (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General), FACT-F (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Fatigue), SF-36 (Short Form 36) and SDS (Symptom Distress Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>QOL was measured before and after 2 cycles of treatment using 4 measures: FACT-G is a 27 item measure of QOL. A total score is calculated by summing across responses on a 5 point scale and ranges from 0-135, with higher scores indicating better QOL. FACT-F is 13 item measure of fatigue. A total score is calculated by summing across responses on a 5 point scale. Total score ranges from 0-52, with higher scores indicating less fatigue. SF-36 is a 36 item measure of self-reported health status. SF-36 is comprised of 8 subscales: physical function, role physical, bodily pain vitality, role emotional function, mental health, social function and general health. Summated scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating a better health state. SDS is a 13 item measure of symptom distress. A total score is calculated by summing across responses on a 5 point scale. Total score ranges from 13 to 65, with higher scores indicating more symptom distress.</description>

        <title>Change in T-cell Precursors</title>
        <description>To measure change in T-cell precursors, PBMC were tested for reactivity by measuring gamma-interferon release after overnight coculture with peptide pulsed T2 cells. PBMC obtained after 4 cycles of study treatment were compared to pre treatment PBMC. A positive assay was defined as greater than 100pg/ml gamma-interferon release and at least twice the release (including all control peptides) by post treatment PBMC compared to pre treatment PBMC.</description>

        <description>QOL was measured before and after 2 cycles of treatment using 4 measures: FACT-G is a 27 item measure of QOL. A total score is calculated by summing across responses on a 5 point scale and ranges from 0-135, with higher scores indicating better QOL. FACT-F is 13 item measure of fatigue. A total score is calculated by summing across responses on a 5 point scale. Total score ranges from 0-52, with higher scores indicating less fatigue. SF-36 is a 36 item measure of self-reported health status. SF-36 is comprised of 8 subscales: physical function, role physical, bodily pain vitality, role emotional function, mental health, social function and general health. Summated scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating a better health state. SDS is a 13 item measure of symptom distress. A total score is calculated by summing across responses on a 5 point scale. Total score ranges from 13 to 65, with higher scores indicating more symptom distress.</description>
