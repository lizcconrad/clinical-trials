      This study is designed to determine if combining parathyroid (PTH 1-34) with fluoride (MFPSR)
      therapy in a cyclic treatment regimen will: (1) produce a greater increase in bone density of
      the spine than would be produced by either treatment alone; (2) prevent the resistance (i.e.,
      decreased bone formation and no further increase in bone density) that is observed within
      18-24 months of PTH therapy; (3) eliminate the calcium deficiency and osteomalacia that can
      occur with fluoride; (4) prevent excessive bone fluoride content; and (5) result in an
      increase in bone density which is maintained after treatment is discontinued.

      This is a 3-yr, single center, open label, active controlled, randomized study of
      approximately 99 postmenopausal females with osteoporosis of spine or femoral neck. Patients
      will be assigned to 1 of 3 groups: 1) PTH 1-34; 2) Fluoride; 3) PTH and fluoride. The
      treatment period is 3 years with 3-month cycles of therapy. PTH will be administered
      subcutaneously by injection 600 units daily for 28 days the first month of each 3-month
      cycle. Fluoride will be administered orally one 76mg tablet twice daily (providing 20 mg
      fluoride/day), during the last 2 months of each cycle. Calcium will be provided 800mg/day
      during month 1 and 1500-2000mg for months 2 and 3 of each cycle.
