  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will determine whether the Chinese herbal medicine (NPI-028) can make a
      significant contribution to the management of withdrawal and to follow-up treatment aimed at
      preventing or managing relapse in both women and men alcoholics. The herbal preparation has
      been used historically in the treatment of alcohol intoxication and is still prescribed in
      China and Southeast Asia. Efficacy has been documented but awaits the application of current
      research methods to establish efficacy, safety, and probable mechanisms of action.
      Preclinical studies have been carried out in alcohol-preferring rats and vervet monkeys to
      test efficacy in reducing voluntary alcohol intake, measure tolerance effects, and
      toxicological affects. The proposed human trial will develop a placebo, establish quality
      control, test methods of administration, and examine compliance issues. Following these
      preliminary steps, a placebo controlled trial will be conducted using 160 subjects (80
      subjects per treatment condition with 40 of each gender). Alcohol use, craving, health
      status, psychological status, and at rates will be assessed using established measures that
      are current in addiction research.
