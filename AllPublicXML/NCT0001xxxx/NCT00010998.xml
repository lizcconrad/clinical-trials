  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Changes in visual attention are common among elders and people with multiple sclerosis. The
      visual attention changes contribute to difficulty with day to day functioning including
      falls, driving and even finding one's keys on the kitchen counter as well as contributing to
      deficits in other cognitive domains. Yoga emphasizes the ability to focus attention and there
      is some evidence that the practice of yoga may improve one's cognitive abilities.
      Additionally, yoga practice may improve cognitive function through other non-specific means
      such as improved mood, decreased stress or declines in oxidative injury. We propose a
      randomized, controlled 6 month phase II trial of yoga in two separate cohorts: healthy elders
      and subjects with mild multiple sclerosis. We will determine if yoga intervention produces
      improvements on a broad attentional battery that especially emphasizes attentional control.
      To further understand the reported beneficial effect of yoga on its practitioners, we will
      also determine if there is a positive impact on measures directly related to yoga practice
      (flexibility and balance) as well as mood, quality of life and oxidative injury markers. The
      yoga intervention consists of a Hatha yoga class meeting twice per week. The class is taught
      by experienced yoga teachers who are supervised by a nationally known yoga instructor. There
      are two control groups. An exercise group will have a structured walking program prescribed
      by a certified Health and Fitness Instructor and Personal Trainer. The program will attempt
      to match the Hatha yoga class for metabolic demand. The second control group will be assigned
      to a 6 month waiting list. The outcome measures are assessed at baseline and after the 6
      month period. The primary outcome measures are alertness (quantitative EEG and self-rated
      scale), ability to focus attention (Stroop) and ability to shift attention (extradimensional
      set shifting task). Secondary attention outcome measures include the ability to sustain
      attention (decrement in reaction time) and ability to divide attention (Useful Field of
      View). Other secondary outcome measures include flexibility, balance, mood, quality of life,
      fatigue (in MS cohort) and decreased markers of lipid, protein, and DNA oxidative injury.
