  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol evaluates the efficacy of combining pharmacologic treatments for smoking
      cessation, entailing the use of the nicotine skin patch with the nicotinic antagonist
      mecamylamine, with a specific behavioral therapy designed to inhibit the smoking urge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have found that nicotine/mecamylamine treatment more than doubles the
      long-term abstinence rates relative to nicotine replacement alone. Recent evidence supports
      the hypothesis that nicotine/mecamylamine treatment prior to smoking cessation partially
      blocks the rewarding effects of cigarette smoking and hence promotes extinction of the
      smoking habit, facilitating subsequent abstinence. The behavioral approach employed is also
      an extinction strategy and involves having smokers switch to de-nicotinized tobacco
      cigarettes for two weeks prior to quitting smoking. It is hypothesized that the use of
      de-nicotinized cigarettes might provide more complete extinction than provided by the partial
      pharmacologic blockade using nicotine/mecamylamine alone. The pharmacologic treatment was
      expected to increase compliance with the de-nicotinized cigarette smoking regimen, because
      subjects' usual brands of cigarettes will be less appealing than in the absence of
      nicotine/mecamylamine treatment. Together the brand-switching and nicotine/mecamylamine
      therapies were expected to reduce cravings and other withdrawal symptoms as well as increase
      long-term abstinence from smoking.
