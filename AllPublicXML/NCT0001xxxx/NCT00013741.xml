  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine ways in which a clinical information system can help
      patients better recognize the signs and symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction (heart
      attack) and to take actions to decrease morbidity and mortality that may be related to delay
      in seeking treatment. The software-based intervention will use the best scientific evidence
      to create tailored strategies using a patient's specific health data. This approach is based
      on well-established cognitive and behavioral educational models.
