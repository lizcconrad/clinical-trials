      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining bryostatin 1 with cytarabine
      in treating patients who have relapsed primary acute myelogenous leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with primary acute myelogenous leukemia in first
           relapse treated with bryostatin 1 and high-dose cytarabine.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the relapse-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction: Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours on days 1 and 11. Patients
           also receive high-dose cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours for 4 infusions on days
           2-3 and days 9-10.

      Patients who achieve a major response receive a second course of induction therapy.

        -  Consolidation: Patients who achieve complete remission receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24
           hours on days 1 and 10 and high-dose cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours for 2
           infusions on days 2 and 9. Treatment continues for up to 6 courses in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who achieve a response and subsequently relapse may receive additional induction and
      consolidation therapy at the discretion of the investigator.

      Patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-46 patients will be accrued for this study.
