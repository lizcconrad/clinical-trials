  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research on Functional Incidental Training ( FIT) primarily involves women residing in
      community nursing homes. It is an individualized rehabilitative protocol intended to improve
      mobility, endurance, strength and continence in frail, older, functionally impaired and
      disabled veterans.

      Objectives of the project are as follows:

      1) Test the effects of FIT on transfer ability, continence, ambulation/mobility, balance and
      fall risk, strength, and endurance; 2) Determine the characteristics of NHCU residents who
      respond to FIT; 3)Identify the most sensitive outcome measures related to FIT; and 4)
      Determine the labor costs of FIT relative to usual care.

      This research on Functional Incidental Training ( FIT) primarily involves women in community
      nursing homes.

      Objectives:

      1. test the effects of FIT on functions such as transfer ability, continence,
      ambulation/mobility,balance and fall risk, strength, and endurance; 2. determine the
      characteristics of NHCU residents who respond to FIT; 3. identify the most sensitive outcome
      measures related to FIT; and 4. determine the labor costs of FIT relative to usual care.

      . The intervention is an individualized rehabilitative protocol intended to improve mobility,
      endurance, strength and continence in frail, older, functionally impaired and disabled
      veterans in VA nursing home care units(NHCUs).The design is a multi-site cross-over design,
      to be carried out in five NHCUs (Atlanta, Durham, Salisbury, Augusta, Tuscaloosa) over about
      eight months in each site. About 24 residents will be recruited in each NHCU: 12 each will be
      randomized to initial intervention and control for 8 wks and evaluated; the controls will
      then receive the intervention and vice versa for another 8 wks with another evaluation.
      Patients are seen 4x a day for FIT activities, including walking/using wheel chair, prompted
      toileting, strengthening exercises. Outcome measures will be made in a blinded manner by
      Project Manager.
