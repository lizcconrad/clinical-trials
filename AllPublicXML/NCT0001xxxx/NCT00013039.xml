      Physician compliance with practice guidelines is imperfect. Computer-generated reminders from
      electronic medical record systems have been shown to increase compliance with guidelines, but
      they often require symptom and history data, which limits computer facilitation. Heart
      failure is a serious condition for which compliance with established guidelines is
      suboptimal. Physicians� compliance with heart failure guidelines may improve if such
      reminders use symptom and history data.

      Background:

      Physician compliance with practice guidelines is imperfect. Computer-generated reminders from
      electronic medical record systems have been shown to increase compliance with guidelines, but
      they often require symptom and history data, which limits computer facilitation. Heart
      failure is a serious condition for which compliance with established guidelines is
      suboptimal. Physicians� compliance with heart failure guidelines may improve if such
      reminders use symptom and history data.

      Objectives:

      1) Program standard computer-based guidelines for heart failure using data from the
      electronic medical record systems at the Indianapolis and Seattle VAMCs. 2) Establish a
      system for capturing data on symptoms and history from heart failure patients before
      scheduled primary care visits. 3) Incorporate these data into enhanced computer reminders. 4)
      Conduct a randomized, controlled trial comparing these two types of reminders� effects on
      physician prescribing, patient objective and subjective outcomes, and health care
      utilization.

      Methods:

      This controlled trial targets patients with objective evidence of left ventricular
      dysfunction on cardiac imaging studies and a current outpatient diagnosis of heart failure.
      Primary care physicians in the Indianapolis and Seattle VAMCs have been randomized to receive
      either standard heart failure treatment reminders or reminders enhanced by history/symptom
      data. Study data come from the VAMCs electronic medical record systems (i.e., clinical data,
      utilization, and costs) and patient interviews (heart failure symptoms and medication
      compliance, heart failure-specific quality of life, and patients� satisfaction with their
      primary care). Data analysis will be performed at the patient level using general estimating
      equations to account for patient and physician characteristics and clustering of patients
      within physicians.

      Status:

      Data Collection: Enrollment has been completed, with 503 patients enrolled from the Roudebush
      VAMC in Indianapolis and 250 from the VA Puget Sound Health Care System in Seattle. The trial
      continues without irregularities in both places. More than 80 percent of eligible patients
      were enrolled from both sites. Subjective data are being collected prior to scheduled visits
      on more than 95 percent of enrolled subjects.
