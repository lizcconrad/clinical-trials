      RATIONALE: The LMB-9 immunotoxin may be able to locate tumor cells and kill them without
      harming normal cells. This may be an effective treatment for advanced solid tumors.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of LMB-9 immunotoxin in treating patients
      who have advanced solid tumors that have not responded to standard therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxic effects and the pharmacokinetics of LMB-9 immunotoxin in
      patients with advanced solid tumors that express Lewis Y antigen. II. Evaluate the anti-tumor
      activity and the immunogenicity of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive LMB-9 immunotoxin IV over 30
      minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Patients with negative neutralizing antibody to LMB-9
      immunotoxin with stable or responding disease receive additional courses every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of LMB-9 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional cohort of 6 patients may be treated at
      the MTD. Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued within 12-24 months.
