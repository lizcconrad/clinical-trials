      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of MS-275 in treating patients who have
      hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxic effects and pharmacokinetics of MS-275 in patients with poor-risk
           hematologic malignancy.

        -  Determine whether this drug induces changes in hematologic differentiation, in terms of
           changes in morphology, cell surface marker expression, and acetylation status, in these
           patients.

        -  Determine whether this drug induces clinical response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral MS-275 on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MS-275 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
