  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A decrease in mental function often occurs in patients with HIV. Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs
      are used to treat this but are not entirely effective. Some other therapy could play a role.
      The drug selegiline in its pill form is used to treat Parkinson's disease, a serious brain
      disorder. It is believed this drug might protect the brain and repair some damage. This study
      will use this drug in a &quot;patch&quot; form, which has not been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA), to see if it helps with decreased mental function in patients with HIV.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of selegiline transdermal system (STS) in
      the treatment of decreased mental function in patients with HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is a common adverse effect of HIV infection that can progress to
      dementia. ARVs are the only current therapy, but treatment response is frequently
      unsatisfactory, short lived, or the agents are poorly tolerated in doses adequate for central
      nervous system (CNS) penetration. An adjunctive therapy that interferes with the cascade of
      events triggered by the virus is likely to play an important role. Oral selegiline is an
      approved and marketed drug for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. Studies
      suggest that selegiline has a neuroprotective effect and that it may exert a &quot;rescue effect&quot;
      on dying and injured neurons. This study proposes to use transdermal selegiline, which may
      deliver a greater dose level than oral administration, in the treatment of HIV-associated
      cognitive impairment.

      This is a two-step study, with each step lasting 24 weeks. Step 1 is double-blind and Step 2
      is open label. At entry, patients are randomly assigned to receive either the STS or placebo.
      One STS patch will be applied daily at the same time for 24 weeks. Patients are evaluated at
      the clinic at entry and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24. Cognitive status will be evaluated
      by performance on a series of neuropsychological assessments. Patients who complete Step 1
      may participate in Step 2. Patients on placebo in Step 1 will receive active STS treatment in
      Step 2. The STS patch is applied once daily for an additional 24 weeks and patients are
      evaluated at the clinic at Weeks 28, 36, and 48.

        Note: This trial closed to accrual on 12/15/04. Use of the lower-dose STS was discontinued
        on 05/31/05. Any patients joining the study after 05/31/05 assigned to the interventional
        arm or who are currently enrolled in Step 2 will receive the higher-dose STS.
