      RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation is a procedure that heats tumors to several degrees above
      body temperature and may kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation in treating
      patients who have unresectable primary or metastatic liver cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the nature and duration of response of patients with primary or metastatic
           liver neoplasms, who are not candidates for surgical resection, treated with
           radiofrequency interstitial tissue ablation.

        -  Evaluate the ability of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the effects
           of this therapy on tumor blood flow and tumor vascular density in these patients.

        -  Determine the ability of positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18
           (FDG-PET) to monitor response after treatment with this therapy in these patients.

        -  Compare FDG-PET results with computed tomography (CT) scan, biopsy, and serum marker
           results in patients treated with this therapy.

        -  Compare the performance of FDG-PET with CT scan and MRI, in terms of their ability to
           assess the efficacy of this therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Lesions are targeted by ultrasound and then radiofrequency ablation needles are
      inserted into the lesions and heated to a target temperature greater than 60 degrees C for 15
      minutes, though exposure time may vary depending on temperatures achieved. To achieve a 1 cm
      margin of ablated tissue around each lesion, multiple ablation courses may be performed,
      depending on the size of the lesions and the time required to complete the treatment.

      Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging with gadopentetate dimeglumine contrast, CT scan,
      ultrasound, and positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18 at baseline, 6 weeks,
      every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2
      years or until evidence of recurrence.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 58 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 years.

    <measure>Response</measure>
    <description>Standard response criteria will be used to assess the CT (computed tomography) scan images on a lesion per lesion basis. Complete response is complete disappearance of the index lesion on followup scan when compared to the pretreatment images. Partial response is a decrease of 50% or greater in the product of the perpendicular diameters of the measured lesion following treatment compared to the pretreatment images. Minor response is a decrease between 25% and 49% in the product of the perpendicular diameters of the measured lesion following treatment compared to the pretreatment images. Stable disease is no change in the size of the treated lesion. Progressive disease is an increase of greater than 25% in the product of the perpendicular diameters of the measured lesion following treatment compared to the pretreatment images.</description>

        <description>Standard response criteria will be used to assess the CT (computed tomography) scan images on a lesion per lesion basis. Complete response is complete disappearance of the index lesion on followup scan when compared to the pretreatment images. Partial response is a decrease of 50% or greater in the product of the perpendicular diameters of the measured lesion following treatment compared to the pretreatment images. Minor response is a decrease between 25% and 49% in the product of the perpendicular diameters of the measured lesion following treatment compared to the pretreatment images. Stable disease is no change in the size of the treated lesion. Progressive disease is an increase of greater than 25% in the product of the perpendicular diameters of the measured lesion following treatment compared to the pretreatment images.</description>

        <description>Response was to be evaluated by the standard response criteria. Complete response is the complete disappearance of the index lesion on follow-up scan when compared to the pretreatment images. Partial response is a decrease of 50% or greater in the product of the perpendicular diameters of the measured lesion following treatment compared to the pretreatment images. Minor response is a decrease between 25% and 49% in the product of the perpendicular diameters of the measured lesion following treatment compared to the pretreatment images. Stable disease is no change in the size of the treated lesion. Progressive disease is an increase of greater than 25% in the product of the perpendicular diameters of the measured lesion following treatment compared to the pretreatment images.</description>
