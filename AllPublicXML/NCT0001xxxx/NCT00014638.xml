      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of cancer cells. Letrozole may fight breast
      cancer by reducing the production of estrogen.

      PURPOSE: Phase IV trial to study the effectiveness of letrozole in treating postmenopausal
      women who have metastatic breast cancer that has been previously treated with tamoxifen.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the time to progression of postmenopausal women with metastatic
      breast cancer treated with letrozole (Femara) as first-line therapy. II. Determine the
      objective response rate, time to treatment failure, survival rate, and changes in symptom
      distress in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to time to diagnosis
      of metastatic disease. Patients receive oral letrozole (Femara) daily. Treatment continues in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 590 patients will be accrued for this study.
