      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      treatment (no prior treatment vs prior surgical treatment) and geographic area.

      Patients who meet all study criteria are put in the &quot;Immediate Treatment Group.&quot; Patients
      receive an intralesional injection of picibanil (OK432) with the aid of ultrasonography or
      transillumination for localization of cysts. Treatment repeats every 6-8 weeks for a total of
      up to 4 injections.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years.

      Completion date provided represents the completion date of the grant per OOPD records
