      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the proportion of patients with cystinosis who experience a serious
      adverse effect when treated with a new formulation of cysteamine hydrochloride for corneal
      cystine accumulation.

      II. Determine the proportion of patients with a reduction in corneal crystal density of 1.00
      unit when treated with this regimen.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study Patients are randomized to receive
      the current formulation of cysteamine hydrochloride as drops in one eye and the new
      formulation of cysteamine hydrochloride as drops in the other eye.

      Patients receive the two formulations of cysteamine hydrochloride in their assigned eyes
      every hour during waking hours daily for 6 months (safety study) or for 1 year (efficacy
      study).

             protocol #86-El-0062 Any crystal density score, including zero, on photographs, that
             has been stable or improved over the past year

          -  Efficacy study: Crystal density score at least 1.00 on photographs Concurrently on
             cysteamine for at least the past 6 months
