      RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop
      cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells
      from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining biological therapy with chemotherapy may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy combined with
      temozolomide in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety of interleukin-12-primed activated T cells (12ATC) and temozolomide
           in patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 12ATC in this patient population.

        -  Determine the clinical response of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of interleukin-12-primed activated T cells (12ATC).

      Patients undergo leukopheresis on days 1-3 until adequate peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMC) are obtained. The PBMC are treated in vitro over 2 weeks with monoclonal antibody
      anti-CD3, interleukin-2, and interleukin-12 to form 12ATC.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 15-19 and 43-47 and 12ATC IV over 15-30 minutes on
      days 22, 25, 29, 32, 36, 39, 50, 53, 57, 60, 64, and 67 in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 12ATC until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed weekly for 2 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months
      for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-18 patients will be accrued for this study.
