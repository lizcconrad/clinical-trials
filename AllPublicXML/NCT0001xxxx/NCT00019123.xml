      RATIONALE: Thalidomide may kill cancer cells by stopping the growth of new blood vessels to
      the tumor.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating patients with
      HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the antitumor activity of thalidomide in terms of regression or
      stabilization of disease in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. II. Determine the
      toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this
      regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral thalidomide on day 1. Treatment continues daily for 6 months
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete or
      partial response or stable disease after 6 months of treatment may continue treatment for an
      additional 6 months. Patients are followed at 1, 6, and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 evaluable patients will be accrued for this study within
      3.75-6.25 months.
