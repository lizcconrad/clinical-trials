      Plasma histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) binds to platelets in the presence of zinc (1). This
      binding is totally blocked by a monoclonal antibody directed against platelet membrane CD36.
      Therefore, CD36 is assumed to carry the platelet binding site for HRG (2). Because CD36 also
      has a variety of other ligands, including polyanionic lipids, it is also possible that it
      contains the binding site for heparin (also polyanionic) and might be involve in the
      pathogenesis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Demonstrating absent HRG or heparin binding
      to platelets lacking CD36 would confirm that the binding sites for either or both of these
      ligands are located on this membrane protein. Because 3% to 11% of healthy Japanese are
      reported to lack CD36 on their platelets, this population is a practical source of cells for
      examining the physiologic role(s) for CD36. Therefore, we will recruit blood donors from the
      Japanese community on the NIH campus. Their platelets will tested for the presence of CD36.
      Recruitment will be closed after two individuals have been identified whose platelets lack
      CD36 and who are willing to donate 30 cc of blood on 4 or 5 subsequent occasions for binding
      studies with radiolabeled HRG and heparin.

      Americans and 4% of Taiwanese lack this protein on their platelets. Therefore, we will
      recruit blood donors from the Japanese, African American, and Taiwanese community on the NIH
      campus. Their platelets will be tested for the presence of CD36. Recruitment will be closed
