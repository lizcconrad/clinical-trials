      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-247550 in treating patients who
      have metastatic stomach cancer previously treated with chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the clinical activity of BMS-247550, in terms of response rate, in patients
           with previously treated metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Assess the response duration, time to progression, and survival of patients treated with
           this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2-18
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a
      complete response (CR) receive 4 additional courses after confirmation of CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-58 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
