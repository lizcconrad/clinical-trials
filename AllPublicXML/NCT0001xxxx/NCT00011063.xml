  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how the herbal remedy ginkgo biloba may affect the body's elimination
      of other medicines. Many people take ginkgo biloba to improve memory, mental alertness and
      overall feeling of well being. Since this product is considered a food supplement and not a
      drug, it is not subject to the rigorous pre-market testing required for prescription and
      over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. As a result, information has not been collected on possible
      interactions between ginkgo biloba and other medications. This study will look at how ginkgo
      biloba affects the elimination of phenytoin-a medication used to treat patients with
      seizures.

      Normal healthy volunteers 21 years of age or older may be eligible for this 40-day study.
      Candidates will provide a medical history and undergo a physical examination and routine
      blood tests. Women of childbearing age must use a reliable form of birth control other than
      oral contraceptives (&quot;the pill&quot;).

      For at least 2 weeks before the study and throughout its duration, study participants may not
      have any of the following: 1) medications that can affect platelet function (e.g., aspirin,
      Motrin, Advil, Nuprin, ibuprofen, etc.); 2) alcoholic beverages; 3) grapefruit and grapefruit
      juice; and 4) all medications except those given by study personnel.

      On day 1 of the study, subjects take one 500-mg dose of phenytoin at 8:00 A.M.. On an empty
      stomach. (Subjects fast the night before taking the phenytoin and are allowed to eat
      breakfast 2 hours after the dose). Blood samples are drawn just before dosing and again at
      0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 32, 48, 72 and 96 hours after the dose. Blood drawn on
      this first study day is collected through a catheter (small plastic tube) placed in a vein to
      avoid multiple needlesticks. After the 12-hour sample is collected, the subject goes home and
      then returns to the clinic for the remaining blood draws, which are taken by direct
      needlestick.

      When the blood sampling is completed, subjects begin ginkgo therapy. The NIH Clinical Center
      provides participants a supply of 60-mg capsules of ginkgo to take twice a day (at 8 A.M. and
      8 P.M..) for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4 weeks, subjects are given a second dose of
      phenytoin as described above and repeat the blood sampling procedure. Subjects continue
      taking ginkgo during this second phenytoin study.

    <textblock>
      Gingko biloba is a complementary or alternative medication used for purported cognitive
      enhancing effects. Despite its widespread use there is limited data regarding potential for
      drug interactions. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of administration of
      ginkgo for 4 weeks on single dose phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Eight healthy volunteers will
      take a single 500mg dose of phenytoin capsules orally with serial blood samples collected
      over 96 hours for determination of phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Following the pharmacokinetic
      study subjects will begin taking 2, 60mg capsules (120mg total) of ginkgo twice daily for 28
      days. Following 28 days of ginkgo subjects will then again undergo phenytoin pharmacokinetic
      evaluations with blood samples obtained over 96 hours for determination of phenytoin
      pharmacokinetics. The ratio of geometric means for phenytoin pharmacokinetic parameter values
      and 90% confidence intervals about the ratio of log transformed parameter values will be
      calculated. Confidence intervals falling within the 80-125% range will characterize the
      pharmacokinetic parameter values before and after ginkgo to be equivalent.

        Male or female.

        Healthy by medical history and physical exam.

        Age greater than 21 years old.

        No concurrent medications.

        Non-smoker (for at least 6 months if prior history of smoking).

        Laboratory values wihin the following guidelines: AST/SGOT less than or equal to 1.5 times
        the upper limit of normal; bilirubin less than or equal to the upper limit of normal; serum
        creatinine less than or equal to the upper limit of normal; hemoglobin greater than or
        equal to 10 g/dl; albumin NML.

        Females of childbearing potential must be using a reliable form of birth control other than
        hormonal contraceptives.

        No concomitant therapy with other inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P-450 mediated drug
        metabolism within 30 days of study.

        Must have the ability to remain free of chronic medications and alcohol for at least 2
        weeks prior to and during the study.

        of oral contraceptive lead to potential oral contraceptive failure).

        Must have the ability and willingness to avoid analgesics with antiplatelet activity for at
        least 2 weeks prior to and during the study.

        No presence of renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, hematologic, neurologic, psychiatric, or
        respiratory disease or any other condition that may interfere with the interpretation of
        the study results or not be in the best interests of the subject in the opinion of the
        principal investigator.

        No positive serum pregnancy test.

        No presence of persistent diarrhea or malabsorption that would interfere with the patient's
        ability to adequately absorb drugs.
