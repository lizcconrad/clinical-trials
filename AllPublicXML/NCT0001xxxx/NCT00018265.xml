  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of aerobic fitness on the ability of able
      and disabled older adults to perform daily functional activities. Subjects are tested in
      their oxygen use patterns as they perform a series of functional tasks (such as walking on
      stairs) and following a 24-week training program focused on improving the ability to perform
      daily tasks likely requiring aerobic fitness (such as walking on stairs).
