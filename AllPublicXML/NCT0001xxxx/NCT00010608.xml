  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of meditation in preventing of
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) in postmenopausal, older African American women.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older African American women suffer from disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular
      (CVD) morbidity and mortality compared to white Americans. Numerous controlled studies
      suggest that this disparity is associated with chronic psychosocial and environmental stress.
      Research indicates that Transcendental Meditation (TM) may result in significant improvements
      in CVD risk factors in this high risk population.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to either active stress reduction with
      TM or health education control, both in addition to usual medical care, for 12 months. The
      primary outcome will be carotid artery atherosclerosis (IMT) measured non-invasively by
      quantitative B-mode ultrasonography. Secondary measures will include traditional CVD risk
      factors (blood pressure, serum glucose and insulin levels, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle),
      stress-related neurohormones (catecholamine metabolite and cortisol), psychosocial stress,
      and quality of life. The results of this trial will yield valuable new knowledge for the
      prevention of CVD through a CAM intervention in high risk older African American women.
