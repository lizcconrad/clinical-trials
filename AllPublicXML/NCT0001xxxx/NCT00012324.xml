      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective
      for liver cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two different
      chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who have recurrent or unresectable liver cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the overall survival in patients with unresectable or recurrent hepatocellular
           carcinoma treated with nolatrexed dihydrochloride vs doxorubicin.

        -  Compare time to progression, time to treatment failure, and response rates in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the probability of survival at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Compare the safety and clinical benefit of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the response rates and survival of patients who have received prior therapy or
           no prior therapy after treatment with these two regimens.

        -  Compare the rates of conversion from unresectable to resectable lesions in patients
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to CLIP score (0-1 vs 2-3) and Karnofsky performance status (60-70% vs 80-100%).
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive nolatrexed dihydrochloride IV continuously on days 1-5.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin IV on day 1. Treatment continues in both arms every
           3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 446 patients (223 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 12 months.
