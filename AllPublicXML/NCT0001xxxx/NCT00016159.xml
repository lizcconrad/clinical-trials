      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining
      monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and monoclonal
      antibody in treating patients who have acute promyelocytic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the disease-free and overall survival of patients with acute promyelocytic
           leukemia in clinical complete remission following tretinoin-based induction therapy
           treated with monoclonal antibody HuG1-M195, arsenic trioxide, idarubicin, and tretinoin.

        -  Determine the rate of molecular complete remission in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

        -  Determine the number and length of hospitalizations of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive monoclonal antibody HuG1-M195 (MOAB HuM195) IV over 40-60 minutes
      twice weekly for 3 weeks. Approximately 2-4 weeks after completion of MOAB HuM195, patients
      receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours daily for a total of 25 days with no more than 5
      days between doses.

      Beginning approximately 4-6 weeks after completion of arsenic trioxide, patients receive
      idarubicin IV daily on days 1-3 or 1-4 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning
      on day 5 or 6 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for
      patients who remain RT-PCR positive or are newly converted to RT-PCR negative (molecular
      complete remission) following a prior course of idarubicin for a maximum of 3 courses.
      Patients who remain RT-PCR positive following course 3 of idarubicin receive no further
      treatment on study.

      Beginning 3 months after completion of idarubicin, patients in molecular complete remission
      receive oral tretinoin daily for 14 days. Treatment repeats every 3 months for a total of 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years.
