      Social, medical and economic burdens of diabetes care result from microvascular,
      macrovascular and neurological complications. Sustained reduction in hyperglycemia can reduce
      the incidence of these complications by as much as 50 percent. Studies have demonstrated
      improved glycemic control with nurse case-management or educational care models. However,
      none have controlled for their independent contributions, intervened with advanced practice
      nurses (APN), or targeted highest risk individuals.

      Background:

      Social, medical and economic burdens of diabetes care result from microvascular,
      macrovascular and neurological complications. Sustained reduction in hyperglycemia can reduce
      the incidence of these complications by as much as 50 percent. Studies have demonstrated
      improved glycemic control with nurse case-management or educational care models. However,
      none have controlled for their independent contributions, intervened with advanced practice
      nurses (APN), or targeted highest risk individuals.

      Objectives:

      The objective of this project is to examine whether interventions of diabetes self-management
      education programs with or without APN case managers improve outcomes and are cost effective.

      Methods:

      Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) Disease-management and diabetes
      education; 2) Disease-management alone; 3) Diabetes education alone; and 4) Routine Care.
      Veterans receiving primary care in VISN-5 and meeting high-risk criteria (HbA1c ï¿½ 9.0%) were
      screened for inclusion. Patient outcome measures were collected at baseline, three months and
      twelve months. These included: Quality of Life (QOL), HgbAlc levels, and incidence of
      diabetes-related hospitalizations/ER visits. In addition, patient-level intervention costs,
      health care use and costs were examined. ANOVA comparisons were used to test hypotheses.

      Status:

      Recruitment is over and final analyses are underway.
