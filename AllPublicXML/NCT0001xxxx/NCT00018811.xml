  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with chronic migraine or tension headaches will receive 12 sessions of biofeedback
      or relaxation training after fulfilling screening, intake interviews, &amp; psychological testing
      requirements. They will chart headache pain, anger level, &amp; medication usage throughout
      baseline, treatment, and 3 month follow-up periods.

      Migraine sufferers will receive a combination of progressive muscle relaxation training and
      thermal biofeedback (learning to warm hands). Subjects are randomly assigned to receive
      treatment either in the office with the therapist or from another room (where communication
      will be over a computer). The research is designed to compare the effectiveness of treatment
      based on location.

      Tension headache sufferers will receive training in how to reduce their muscle tension
      levels. They will be randomly assigned to have equipment monitor muscle tension levels either
      in the forehead or shoulder regions. The research is designed to compare the effectiveness of
      feedback to the forehead versus the shoulder muscles.
