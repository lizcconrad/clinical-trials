      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. It
      is not yet known which regimen of interleukin-2 is most effective for kidney cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of different regimens of
      interleukin-2 in treating patients who have metastatic kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and overall survival of patients with metastatic
      renal cell carcinoma treated with either low-dose or high-dose intravenous interleukin-2
      (IL-2) or subcutaneous IL-2. II. Compare the toxic effects of these 3 regimens in this
      patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to presence of renal
      tumor (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms. Arm I: Patients
      receive low dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV every 8 hours for up to 15 doses. Treatment repeats
      in 7-10 days for one complete course. Arm II: Patients receive high dose IL-2 IV every 8
      hours for up to 15 doses. Treatment repeats in 7-10 days for one complete course. Arm III:
      Patients receive IL-2 subcutaneously daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Treatment continues in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or
      responding disease receive an additional complete course of therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients will be accrued for this study.
