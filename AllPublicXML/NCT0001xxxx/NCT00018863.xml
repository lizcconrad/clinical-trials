  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research focuses on the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in
      very young children. The medication being used is methylphenidate (Ritalin); it is being
      studied to determine its safety and how well it works to treat ADHD in preschool-age children
      (3-5.5 year olds).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Young children age 3-5.5 years will be studied. The study includes treatment with different
      doses of methylphenidate and placebo; all children will receive active medication during the
      study. Prior to treatment, each child will receive a thorough psychiatric evaluation and each
      guardian will complete a 10-week workshop (2 hours/week). Throughout the study, parents and
      teachers will complete forms that report on the child's behavior and possible side effects.
      Participants will be monitored by regular visits with a study physician. Most participants
      will be involved in the study for up to 16 months to ensure optimal evaluation, dosing, and
      monitoring
