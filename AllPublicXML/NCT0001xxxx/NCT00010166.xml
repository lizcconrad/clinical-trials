      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Gemcitabine may
      make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining chemotherapy with radiation
      therapy after surgery may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemcitabine with radiation
      therapy in treating patients who have undergone surgery to remove cancer of the pancreas.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the time to disease progression, local control, and survival of patients with
           previously resected pancreatic cancer treated with adjuvant gemcitabine and
           radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25, 29,
      and 32 and undergo radiotherapy on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-38 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Beginning at least 4 weeks after chemoradiotherapy, patients without disease progression and
      with less than 10% weight loss during study receive additional gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total of 2 courses.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks for 6 months and then every 3 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.2 or 3.4
      years.
