  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community based studies have shown increased cardiovascular mortality associated with acute
      exposures to particulate air pollution. Electrocardiographic changes have also been reported
      in animals exposed to particles in controlled conditions. We have hypothesized that
      cardiovascular patients may experience life-threatening arrhythmias associated with
      particulate air pollution episodes. Implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) devices
      continuously monitor the heart rhythm, and on detecting arrhythmias can initiate
      interventions. These devices provide a passive, continuous monitor of cardiac arrhythmias. We
      are assessing the association between community exposures to air pollution measured by
      ambient monitors and these cardiac arrhythmias detected by implanted cardioverter
      defibrillator devices.

      Records of cardiac arrhythmias detected in patients with implanted cardioverter
      defibrillators will be linked with measurements of the concentration and constituents of
      ambient particulate air pollution. Time series methods will be used to assess temporal
      associations, adjusting for seasonal, weekly, and diurnal patterns, meteorology, and
      co-pollutants. Characteristics of subjects showing the strongest air pollution associations
      will be assessed, as well as effect modification by medication and co-morbidities.

      ICD patients are followed up clinically every three to six months. The ICD device is
      interrogated and data are retrieved by non-invasive radio frequency retrieval from the
      implanted device. Device performance is checked. Detected arrhythmias and therapeutic
      interventions are listed. For each detected episode, date and time is recorded, along with a
      short electrogram of the heartbeats immediately before and during the event.

      Daily ambient particle mass (PM10 and PM2.5) and particle constituents have been measured in
      Boston since January 1995. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection has
      measured concentrations of gaseous pollutants including carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide,
      ozone, and sulfur dioxide. Meteorological factors including temperature, humidity, and
      barometric pressure have been measured at the National Weather Service station at Logan
      airport. Meteorologic factors and gaseous co-pollutants will be considered as independent
      predictors of arrhythmic events, and as confounders of the particulate air pollution
      associations.

        The sample population consists of cardiac patients with implanted cardioverter
        defibrillator devices attending device clinics at the New England Medical Center (NEMC)
        Cardiac Electrophysiology and Pacemaker Laboratory. All patients with implanted ICD devices
        with event time and date recording living in the greater Boston area will be included.
