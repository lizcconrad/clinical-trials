      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and long term complications of total body irradiation in
      combination with cyclophosphamide, anti-thymocyte globulin, and autologous CD34-selected
      peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation in children with refractory autoimmune
      disorders.

      II. Determine the efficacy of this treatment regimen in these patients. III. Determine the
      reconstitution of immunity after autologous CD34-selected PBSC transplantation in these
      patients.

      IV. Determine engraftment of autologous CD34-selected PBSC in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously daily until peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection is completed. CD34+
      cells are separated from the rest of the PBSCs.

      Patients undergo total body irradiation twice daily on days -5 and -4. Patients receive
      anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, and 5 and cyclophosphamide IV on days -3
      and -2. CD34-selected PBSCs are reinfused on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF IV daily beginning
      on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed annually for 5 years and then every 5 years thereafter.
