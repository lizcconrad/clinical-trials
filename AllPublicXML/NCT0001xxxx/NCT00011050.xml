  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether laboratory storage of samples affects the
      amount of lactate over 3 years.

      Lactate is a natural substance normally present in the body. Lactate levels can go up for
      many different reasons, including treatment with nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor
      drugs. This study will help researchers know if stored blood samples can be used to test
      lactate levels.

      Lactic acidosis syndrome is a complication of therapy with nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor (NRTI) drugs. Measurement of lactate levels is important in clinical trials of
      antiretroviral treatments. The preferred collection method for determining plasma lactate is
      with NaF/KOx tubes, while a number of ACTG studies have stored blood in
      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes. This study will analyze lactate in samples
      collected and stored in NaF/KOx and EDTA tubes to investigate the reliability of lactate
      concentrations over time.

      Pre- and post-exercise blood samples are drawn from participants into NaF/KOx and EDTA tubes
      and a portion is tested for lactate levels immediately. The remaining portions are frozen and
      tested at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months.
