      This study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to learn how the brain functions
      in adolescents receiving fluoxetine (Prozac) cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or
      interpersonal therapy (IPT) for anxiety or depression in children/adolescents.

      All participants will receive interviews to assess how they are doing in general, including
      general mood, degree of nervousness and behavior. Each participant and one of his or her
      parents will be interviewed separately and together. Those electing the medication study will
      also receive a physical examination. Participants are asked to complete tasks involving
      problem-solving and memory that involve looking at pictures, remembering things, testing
      reaction times, and making simple choices.

      Participants with anxiety or depression will first meet with a psychiatrist or psychologist
      for two weekly sessions of talk therapy.

      Those who remain anxious or depressed after these 2 weeks will have the 3 options based on
      their choice: 1) treatment with fluoxetine daily for 8 weeks 2) cognitive-behavioral therapy
      or interpersonal therapy (two kinds of talk therapy) once a week for 8 weeks 3) a random
      assignment (50% chance) to either placebo or fluoxetine for 8 weeks. In addition, subjects
      also will be randomly and blindly assigned to receive either an active computer-based
      training task or an inactive computer-based training task, administered as part of the
      other,along with their medication or talk -therapy treatment. The active training is thought
      to help anxiety whereas the inactive training is thought to have no effect. The purpose of
      this part of the study is to understand the best way to help children and adolescents who are
      having problems with anxiety. However, more research is needed to find the best way to help
      such children and adolescents. During and after the 8 weeks of treatment, each participant
      will complete verbal and written symptom ratings. Blood samples will be drawn for laboratory
      tests before drug treatment and after it ends.

      Those who have not improved by the end of the study will be offered other treatment for 1 to
      3 months, and the clinicians will help with finding subsequent aftercare. Those who improve
      with treatment will continue therapy at NIH until an outside physician is able to assume
      responsibility for monitoring medication.

      Objective: This protocol uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine
      neuro-cognitive correlates of pediatric and adult mood and anxiety disorders. The primary
      goal of the project is to document, in pediatric anxiety disorders and

      major depression, perturbations in brain systems mediating attention biases, fear
      conditioning, emotional memory, and response to various forms of motivational stimuli. As one
      secondary goal, the project measures the relationship between these factors and treatment
      response to either fluoxetine, a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT), or interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Another secondary goal
      examines similar associations in adults.

      Study Population: A total of 2530 children, adolescents, and adults will be recruited. Most
      subjects will not be able to complete all procedures. We seek to comprehensively study 150
      juveniles with only a current anxiety disorder, 60 juveniles with current major depression,
      150 juveniles with no psychiatric disorder, 100 adults with major depression, 60 adults with
      an anxiety disorder, and 150 adults with no psychiatric disorder. To achieve this, we are
      recruiting 2530 individuals.

      Design: Subjects will be tested using fMRI paradigms designed to examine brain regions
      engaged when processing motivationally salient stimuli, as assessed during attention, memory,
      social interaction, reward, and fear-conditioning paradigms. After these initial fMRI tests,
      subjects with depression or an anxiety disorder receive treatment. Treatment will comprise
      open treatment with either fluoxetine or CBT, augmented with computer-based attention
      retraining, delivered in a randomized-controlled design, with random assignment to either
      active or placebo attentiontraining regimens. Adolescent subjects then will be re-tested
      after eight-weeks using only the attention, memory, and conditioning paradigms.

      Outcome Measures: Prior imaging studies note that tasks requiring attention modulation,
      emotional memory, social interchange, and fear conditioning engage brain regions previously
      implicated in adult mood and anxiety disorders. These regions include most consistently the
      amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex. Moreover, imaging studies of reward function
      implicate the striatum and prefrontal cortex in adult mood disorders. As a result, we
      hypothesize that attention, memory, social interaction, reward, and conditioning paradigms
      will engage the amygdala, ventral prefrontal cortex and striatum in both psychiatrically
      healthy and impaired

      subjects. Moreover, we hypothesize that these healthy and psychiatrically impaired groups
      will differ in the degree of engagement.

      Juvenile subjects also will be treated for eight-weeks, and a subset will be re-tested with
      fMRI. We predict that pre-treatment abnormalities in neural circuitry will predict response
      to treatment, such that increased amygdala and prefrontal activation will occur in
      individuals who show the strongest response to treatment. Moreover, we hypothesize that
      effective treatment will normalize abnormalities in attention and emotional memory, as
      manifest in fMRI.
