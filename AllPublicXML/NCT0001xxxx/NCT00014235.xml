      This clinical trial studies fludarabine phosphate and total-body radiation followed by donor
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant and immunosuppression in treating patients with
      hematologic malignancies. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop
      the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem
      cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make
      stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted
      cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving
      total-body irradiation together with fludarabine phosphate, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate
      mofetil before transplant may stop this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the rate of grade III/IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients treated
      with low-dose total body irradiation (TBI), fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate), PBSC
      infusion and immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil and a disease risk-based
      cyclosporine taper.

      II. To estimate the risk of graft rejection, GVHD, disease response, non-relapse mortality
      and the incidence and severity of infectious complications using this treatment strategy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      ARM I (indolent disease):

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4 to
      -2 and undergo TBI on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) on
      day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or IV every
      8-12 hours on days -3 to 56 with a taper to day 180 and mycophenolate mofetil PO BID or IV
      every 8-12 hours on days 0 to 27.

      ARM II (aggressive disease):

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate and undergo TBI as in Arm I.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo donor PBSCT on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine PO BID or IV every 8-12 hours on days -3 to
      56 with a taper to day 70 and mycophenolate mofetil as in Arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.

          -  Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or
             multiple myeloma who are not eligible for a curative autologous transplantation or who
             have received a prior autologous transplantation; patients with NHL or CLL must have
             failed prior therapy with an alkylating agent and/or fludarabine, or be at high risk
             of relapse; patients with multiple myeloma must have stage II or III disease and
             received prior chemotherapy

          -  Patients &lt; 50 years of age with NHL, Hodgkin's disease (HD), CLL or multiple myeloma
             at high risk of regimen related toxicity through prior autologous transplant or
             through pre-existing medical conditions

          -  Patients &lt; 75 years of age with other malignant diseases treatable by allogeneic bone
             marrow transplant (BMT) whom through pre-existing chronic disease affecting kidneys,
             liver, lungs, and heart are considered to be at high risk for regimen related toxicity
             using standard high dose regimens; the following diseases are the likely candidates

               -  Myelodysplastic syndromes

               -  Myeloproliferative syndromes

             approve patients with other malignancies or patients declining standard allografts for
             transplant following presentation and approval; centers outside the FHCRC that have a
             PCC or equivalent should obtain their Institutional approval; if there is not a
             comparable group at the Institution, please contact the FHCRC Principal Investigator
             for FHCRC approval through PCC

          -  Patients with renal failure are eligible, however patients with renal compromise
             (serum creatinine greater than 2.0) will likely have further compromise in renal
             function and may require hemodialysis (which may be permanent) due to the need to
             maintain adequate serum cyclosporine levels

          -  The addition of cytotoxic agents for &quot;cytoreduction&quot; with the exception of hydroxyurea
