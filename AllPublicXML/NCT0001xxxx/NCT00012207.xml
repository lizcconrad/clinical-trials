      RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop
      cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells
      from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining biological therapy with chemotherapy may
      kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy after chemotherapy in
      treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of cellular immunotherapy with autologous CD8+
           cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clones after chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide,
           vincristine, and prednisone in patients with relapsed or refractory CD20+ indolent
           lymphomas or mantle cell lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred CD20-specific
           CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clones in the absence and presence of subcutaneous
           interleukin-2 in these patients.

        -  Assess the trafficking of CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clones to lymph nodes in these
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine immune response and tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

        -  Leukapheresis: Patients undergo leukapheresis. Selected CD20-specific CD8+ cells are
           cultured to expand the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), which are then cloned.

        -  Chemotherapy:

      Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide and oral prednisone on days 1-5 and vincristine IV on
      day 1. Courses repeat every 3-4 weeks for a total of 6 courses.

        -  Immune cell infusion:

      Beginning 4 weeks after the last course of chemotherapy (and lymph nodes ≤ 5 cm diameter or ≤
      5,000 circulating CD20+ lymphocytes/mm^3), patients receive autologous CD8+ CTL clones IV
      over 30 minutes. Courses repeat every 2-5 days for a total of 3 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The last 6 patients receive interleukin-2
      subcutaneously every 12 hours for 14 days, beginning 2 hours after the last infusion of CD8+
      CTL clones.

      After course 2 or 3 of immune cells, all patients undergo surgical lymph node biopsy to
      determine if immune cells are moving to the lymph nodes.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year and then annually for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
