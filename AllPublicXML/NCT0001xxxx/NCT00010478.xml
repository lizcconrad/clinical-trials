  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although traditional Chinese medicine advocates the use of acupuncture not only to induce
      analgesia but also to treat essential hypertension, acupuncture's postulated antihypertensive
      efficacy in humans has not been subjected to rigorous Western scientific testing. Before
      advocating acupuncture as an effective complementary/alternative medicine strategy for
      essential hypertension, it is necessary to demonstrate that the beneficial effects of
      acupuncture are scientifically robust, long-lasting, and explicable in terms of modern
      scientific mechanisms. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, acupuncture-like electrical
      stimulation of thinly myelinated (Group III) somatic afferents activates central endorphin
      (naloxone-sensitive) pathways that elicit long-lasting decreases in sympathetic nerve
      activity (SNA) and blood pressure. The ability to record SNA with microelectrodes in
      conscious humans provides a new opportunity to test this novel mechanistic hypothesis in
      patients undergoing electroacupuncture, a modification of the ancient technique that provides
      a quantifiable and reproducible stimulus to human skeletal muscle afferents. Using a
      randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled design, we will test the following major
      hypotheses: Electroacupuncture produces a long-lasting reduction in SNA, thereby providing a
      safe and effective complementary treatment of human hypertension. Given the enormous interest
      in acupuncture by our lay public, but the paucity of Western scientific data about its
      efficacy in cardiovascular disorders, our studies in normotensive and hypertensive humans
      should provide a conceptual framework for deciding whether to accept or reject the large body
      of Chinese (and Russian) literature advocating acupuncture as a safe and effective treatment
      of essential hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders (such as heart failure, and
      myocardial ischemia).
