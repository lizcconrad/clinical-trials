      RATIONALE: Gene therapy may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the safety of NV1020 in patients who have colon cancer that
      has spread to the liver and has not responded to previous chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of a single intrahepatic NV1020
           injection in patients with hepatic metastases from colon cancer that has failed
           first-line chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine preliminarily the anti-tumor activity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Assess the immunogenicity of NV1020 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive a single intrahepatic arterial injection of NV1020 over 10 minutes with the
      aid of hepatic arteriography.

      Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of NV1020 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1, 2, and 3 months post injection. Patients may participate in a
      separate long term (up to 1 year) follow-up study for continued assessment and monitoring.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.
