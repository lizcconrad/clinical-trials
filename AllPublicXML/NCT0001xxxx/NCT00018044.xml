  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the symptoms, course of disease and treatment of non-tuberculous
      mycobacterial (NTM) infections, as well as the genetics involved in these infections.
      Patients with NTM have recurrent lung infections and sometimes infections of the skin and
      other organs as well. They may also have curvature of the spine, barrel chest, and heart
      valve weakness. The study will compare the features of NTM with those of Job syndrome and
      cystic fibrosis, other diseases involving recurrent infections of the lungs and possibly
      other organs.

      Patients with diagnosed or suspected non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection, cystic fibrosis
      or Job syndrome may be eligible for this study. All participants will have a medical and
      family history, blood and urine tests, imaging studies that may include X-rays, computed
      tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and DNA and other genetic studies.
      In addition, all patients with Job syndrome and cystic fibrosis, and patients with NTM who
      have lung disease undergo the following procedures:

        -  Scoliosis survey X-rays of the spine to look for curvature or other abnormalities of the
           spinal column

        -  Echocardiography imaging test that uses sound waves to examine the heart chambers and
           valves

        -  Electrocardiogram measurement of the electrical activity of the heart

        -  Pulmonary function tests breathing tests to measure how much air the patient can move
           into and out of the lungs

        -  Body measurements measurements of height, weight, arm span, finger length, etc.

        -  Joint function assessment of joint mobility using different maneuvers to test
           flexibility of joints and ligaments

        -  Examination of physical features that might be associated with NTM, such as high arched
           palate of the mouth, flat feet, or certain skin features

        -  Dermatology (skin) examination for reactive skin conditions or other skin problems and
           possibly a skin biopsy (surgical removal of a small skin tissue sample for microscopic
           examination)

        -  Interview with genetics specialist

      These tests may require several days to complete. Patients with NTM will also be examined by
      a cystic fibrosis specialist and may have a sweat test. In addition, NTM patients will be
      asked to return to NIH every year for 5 years for follow-up tests, if medically indicated,
      including CT of the chest, scoliosis survey and examination by other specialists.

    <textblock>
      The nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous environmental organisms foundin soil and
      water that rarely cause disease in humans. Since exposure to these organisms is universal and
      disease is rare, it can be concluded that normal host defenses are almost always sufficient
      to prevent infection. It follows that otherwise healthy individuals who develop disease must
      have abnormal susceptibility or immune defects that permit infection with nontubercuolous
      mycobacteria. The organisms that are most commonly encountered in clinical practice include
      Mycobacterium avium, and M. intracellulare [collectively known as the M. avium complex
      (MAC)], M. kansasii, M. fortuitum, M. abscessus, and M. chelonae. These organisms share
      significant structural and biochemical similarities with their more pathogenic relative, M.
      tuberculosis (MTB). Recognition of host factors that predispose or lead to NTM infection may
      have important implications for pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention, and may be
      applicable to the more virulent MTB. Identification of genetic or acquired susceptibility
      factors may lead to recognition of endogenous pathways that can be exploited therapeutically
      and to possible gene identification.

      Over the last two decades, three important observations have been made regarding the
      pathogenesis of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. 1) In patients infected with HIV,
      nontuberculous mycobacterial infections often occur when the CD4+ T-lymphocyte number falls
      below 50/mm3. This suggested that specific T cell products or activities were required for
      mycobacterial resistance. 2) An association was noted between pulmonary nontuberculous
      mycobacterial infections and a particular body habitus, predominantly in post-menopausal
      women (pectus excavatum, scoliosis, mitral valve prolapse). 3) Multiple defects have been
      found involving the interferon gamma synthesis and use pathways in patients with disseminated
      nontuberculous mycobacterial infection without HIV, suggesting this is a critical pathway for
      host defense against these organisms.

      We seek to better characterize the predisposition to mycobacterial infection. This study will
      specifically address several aspects of immune function and investigate the proposed link to
      body morphotype in the relevant population. By collecting this information, we hope to
      provide insight into disease associations, infection susceptibility, and genetic
      predisposition to mycobacterial infection.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS:

        This protocol will study patients with mycobacterial infections, including those without
        previously identified predisposing disease processes as well as individuals with underlying
        malignancies.

        Patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial infections will be of particular interest, as we
        are interested in isolating and characterizing the primary immune defect(s) responsible for
        this infection susceptibility.

        Select patients with acquired immunodeficiencies or tuberculosis may also be studied if
        relevant host defects are suspected.

        Patients must be referred to NIH with a diagnosis or suspicion of having mycobacterial
        infection.

        Male and female patients will be accepted without limitations due to age.

        Only patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial infections without HIV infection will be
        considered for long-term disease management.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RELATIVES:

        As part of this protocol, we may obtain medical records, blood work, urine, saliva or
        buccal swab from some blood relatives of patients on the study, with the hope of isolating
        and characterizing the primary immune defect(s) responsible for mycobacterial infection
        susceptibilityand if there are any genetic links seen within families. We hope to identify
        families with an apparent genetic susceptibility to respiratory diseases predominantly
        associated with P-NTM and perform whole genome sequencing within this group to identify
        genetic mutations accounting for this increased susceptibility. Male and female patients
        will be accepted without limitation due to age. These relatives will not receive treatment
        or have any other protocol procedures done unless they become a patient on the study.
