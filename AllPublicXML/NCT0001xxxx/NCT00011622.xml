      This proposal is a pilot study to describe the variations of blood sugar in pregnant women
      with various degrees of glucose intolerance, and how they relate to standardized meals. Blood
      sugar control during pregnancy is important to prevent complications for the newborn. The
      variation and timing of the blood sugar measurements in gestational diabetics and how this
      relates to the baby's outcome is controversial. We will use an FDA approved device called
      Minimed Glucose Continuous Monitor, which is used in clinical practice for certain diabetics.
      It is very small, similar to a beeper, and is connected to the patient through a small
      plastic catheter subcutaneously. This measures blood sugar every five minutes for a total of
      288 readings a day with minimum discomfort. The hypothesis of this study is that use of the
      Minimed glucose monitor will provide information about variations of blood sugar in
      gestational diabetics that is missed by capillary glucose monitors.

      Our conclusions will allow us to compare blood glucose trends among the groups. After the
      data is analyzed in this pilot study, we plan to design a bigger study involving more
      subjects to study the impact of the blood sugar variations in the outcome of the newborn, and
      to obtain generalizable results for the population in general.

      We will coordinate the study through the CRC. The women will have to come in only twice, to
      have the monitor placed and then taken off three days later. A blood sample will be collected
      at each visit. Meals and snacks will be provided for each day of the study, specially
      packaged, to supply an equivalent amount of calories for each subject. These will meet the
      nutritional requirements for both the mother and the fetus. Women will do separate
      fingerstick blood sugar measurements using a capillary glucometer four times a day, to ensure
      the accuracy of the sensor's readings.

        1. Inclusion Criteria

          -  Pregnant women, between 28 and 36 weeks of gestation. Gestational age will be
             determined by a combination of the date of the last menstrual period and ultrasound,
             done during the first or second trimester of pregnancy.

          -  Previous glucose challenge test and if abnormal, an oral glucose tolerance test.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 30 Kg/m2.

          -  Gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy, if glucose between pregnancies was
             normal.
