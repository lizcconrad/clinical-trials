      RATIONALE: NBI-3001 may be able to locate cancer cells and stop them from growing. This may
      be an effective treatment for glioblastoma multiforme.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare different regimens of NBI-3001 followed by
      surgery to remove the tumor in treating patients who have glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, tolerability, and optimal clinical dose of
      interleukin-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL cytotoxin (NBI-3001) followed by surgical resection in patients
      with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive
      interleukin-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL cytotoxin (NBI-3001) intratumorally as a continuous infusion
      over 4-5 days beginning within 12-36 hours after ventricular catheter placement. Patients
      then undergo surgical tumor resection approximately 3 weeks after drug infusion. Cohorts of 6
      patients receive escalating doses of NBI-3001 until the maximum tolerated dose is determined.
      Patients are followed within 1 week and then at 8, 16, and 26 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-36 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed recurrent or progressive glioblastoma
        multiforme Previously treated with cytoreductive surgery Unilateral, unifocal tumor with a

        radiotherapy No multifocal, brain stem, or infratentorial tumor or tumor invading midline
        No tumor with a clinically significant mass effect (greater than 5 mm midline shift) while
        on stable dose of corticosteroid No clinical symptoms attributed to uncontrolled increased
        intracranial pressure and/or edema of the brain

        other prior or concurrent malignancy except carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell
        or squamous cell skin cancer No medical instability due to non-malignant systemic disease
        No other prior or concurrent condition that would preclude study compliance Not pregnant
