      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known which chlorambucil regimen is more effective
      in treating advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of different regimens of
      chlorambucil in treating patients who have advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare overall and disease-related survival of patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic
           leukemia treated with high-dose chlorambucil induction therapy with or without low-dose
           chlorambucil maintenance therapy.

        -  Compare the time to salvage treatment in these patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the treatment-related mortality of these patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, time to complete response (before 12 weeks vs after 12 weeks vs partial
      response), and cytopenia at diagnosis (Binet stage A+B vs C).

      All patients receive induction therapy comprising high-dose oral chlorambucil daily.
      Treatment continues until achievement of complete response or a maximum of 24 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who respond to induction therapy are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms for
      maintenance therapy.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive low-dose oral chlorambucil twice a week. Therapy continues for
           up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If disease
           progression occurs, then patients may proceed to salvage therapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive no maintenance therapy. If disease progresses, patients receive
           induction therapy again. If disease does not respond to re-induction therapy, then
           patients may proceed to salvage therapy.

        -  Salvage therapy: Patients with progressive disease during maintenance therapy receive
           fludarabine IV daily and cyclophosphamide IV daily on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every
           4 weeks for 3-6 courses.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 2 months for 6 months, and then every 3
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 470 patients will be accrued for this study within 4.7
      years.
