      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the drug bevacizumab, in combination with
      doxorubicin and docetaxel, in improving survival of patients with inflammatory breast cancer
      or locally advanced breast cancer. Inflammatory breast cancer is an aggressive form of
      locally advanced breast cancer that often causes a red, swollen, tender breast and is
      associated with a poor prognosis. Bevacizumab blocks the growth of new blood vessels that
      supply oxygen and nutrients to tumors, and therefore, may kill cancer cells or stop their
      growth. Doxorubicin and docetaxel are approved drugs for treating breast cancer.

      Patients 18 years of age or older with stage inflammatory breast cancer who have not been
      treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates are
      screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, chest x-ray,
      electrocardiogram, and MUGA scan or echocardiography (see below). A mammogram of both
      breasts, dynamic MRI imaging of the affected breast, computed tomography (CT) of the head,
      chest, abdomen and pelvis, and a bone scan are done to determine the extent of disease.

      Participants undergo the following procedures at various intervals before, during and/or
      after completing chemotherapy:

      Tumor and skin biopsies to study the effects of bevacizumab on tumor blood vessels, tumor
      growth, and the biology of inflammatory breast cancer. A small piece of tumor tissue and a
      small piece of skin from the affected breast are removed under local anesthesia for
      microscopic study.

      Dynamic MRI to examine changes in the blood vessels and breast cancer following bevacizumab
      treatment. This test involves injecting a contrast liquid into a vein before scanning. A
      standard MRI scan is done before the dynamic MRI.

      Blood tests are done to 1) study clot formation and breakdown, 2) measure levels of VEGF (a
      substance produced by breast cancer cells) and VCAM-1 (a substance produced by cells lining
      blood vessel walls), and 3) check blood counts and liver and kidney function.

      MUGA (a nuclear medicine scan that checks the heart's pumping ability) or echocardiogram
      (ultrasound scan of the heart to evaluate heart function.

      Blood pressure monitoring

      Urine tests

      CT scans and x-rays to evaluate disease before and after treatment.

      Patients will have a central venous line (plastic tube) placed into a major vein in the chest
      before beginning treatment. The line stays in the body during the entire treatment period and
      is used to give chemotherapy and other medications, if needed, and to draw blood samples. All
      treatment is given on a single day every 3 weeks. This constitutes one treatment cycle. Cycle
      1 consists of bevacizumab alone; cycles 2 through 7 consist of bevacizumab with doxorubicin
      and docetaxel. During each cycle, patients also receive injections under the skin of G-CSF, a
      drug that raises the number of infection-fighting white blood cells, which are often
      decreased as a side effect of chemotherapy. After cycle 7, patients may require surgery and
      radiation or radiation alone. After radiation treatment, bevacizumab is re-started, given
      alone every 3 weeks for an additional eight cycles. Patients whose tumors are positive for
      estrogen or progesterone receptors will be advised to take the drug tamoxifen or anastrozole
      for 5 years to decrease the chances of disease recurrence. This would begin with cycle 8.

      This is a pilot study in patients with previously untreated inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)
      or locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) to evaluate angiogenesis parameters after treatment
      with rhuMAb VEGF - recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody vascular endothelial growth
      factor (bevacizumab). The challenge for new molecular-targeted anti-angiogenesis therapy is
      to devise appropriate and reliable markers to monitor efficacy. This may be achieved directly
      by evaluating changes in angiogenesis parameters in tumor samples. The use of less invasive
      surrogate markers to assess the efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy is preferable. This may
      include functional changes in tumor vasculature assessed using non-invasive methods such as
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or determination of changes in circulating soluble markers
      of angiogenesis.

      Most breast cancers over express VEGF thus making it an ideal disease for treatment with
      anti-angiogenesis therapy. This study will evaluate the effects of bevacizumab on
      angiogenesis parameters both molecular and functional. The first cycle will consist of
      bevacizumab alone followed by six cycles of bevacizumab in combination with doxorubicin and
      docetaxel (AT). Loco-regional therapy will follow and bevacizumab will be recommenced for
      eight cycles.

      Changes in pre-designated angiogenesis parameters will be assessed at baseline, three weeks
      after bevacizumab and after three cycles of AT/bevacizumab. The first three molecular
      parameters: endothelial cell proliferation, endothelial cell apoptosis and tissue VEGF
      require multiple tumor core biopsies obtained using a mammotome. The fourth parameter k(ep),
      the redistribution constant is obtained using dynamic MRI. To determine the variability of
      the values of the three molecular primary angiogenesis parameters, multiple biopsies will be
      sampled at the same time points. An attempt will be made to correlate each of the four
      primary angiogenesis parameters with time to progression/recurrence. The effects of
      bevacizumab alone and AT/bevacizumab directly on tumor vasculature using dynamic MRI imaging
      and on the circulating angiogenesis marker, serum vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)
      at the same three time points and prior to surgery and will be undertaken in an exploratory
      manner. An attempt will be made to correlate changes in these parameters with clinical
      findings and changes in tissue angiogenesis parameters. Additionally, other angiogenesis
      biomarkers will also be studied in an exploratory manner.

      Thrombosis factors will be monitored given the increased incidence of venous and arterial
      thrombosis seen in previous clinical trials using bevacizumab. An increase in the incidence
      of hypertension has also been seen. A subset of patients in this study will undergo frequent
      blood pressure monitoring to obtain a profile of the effect of bevacizumab on blood pressure.

        as histologically proven invasive adenocarcinoma of one breast with clinical inflammatory
        signs including onset of erythema and brawny induration or edema of the skin with an
        erysipeloid edge with or without an underlying tumor mass. Dermal lymphatic involvement by
        tumor cells is not a requirement for diagnosis. We will define locally advanced breast
        cancer as stage IIB, IIIA, or IIIC breast cancer according to the 2002 AJCC staging
        guidelines. Patients must have tissue accessible for serial biopsies.
