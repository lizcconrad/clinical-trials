      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill ovarian cancer
      cells. Interleukin-2 combined with white blood cells that are gene-modified to recognize and
      kill ovarian cancer cells may be an effective treatment for recurrent or residual ovarian
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 plus gene-modified white
      blood cells in treating patients who have advanced ovarian epithelial cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the clinical response in patients with advanced ovarian epithelial cancer
           treated with intravenously administered allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear
           cell-stimulated, gene-modified lymphocytes (MOv-PBL).

        -  Evaluate the ability of intravenously administered MOv-PBL to traffic to sites of
           ovarian cancer.

        -  Determine the duration of survival of transduced lymphocytes in the systemic circulation
           and at the tumor site in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified by eligibility to receive
      interleukin-2 (IL-2) (yes vs no).

      Patients undergo leukapheresis. The collected peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) are
      stimulated with allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) followed by retroviral
      transduction with antiovarian cancer MOv-gamma chimeric receptor gene (MOv-PBL). MOv-PBL are
      then reinfused IV over 30-60 minutes followed by IL-2 IV over 15-30 minutes every 12 hours
      for up to 8 doses (if eligible). This course may be repeated at least once, beginning 2-3
      weeks later. Patients receiving allogeneic PBMC-stimulated PBLs receive donor PBMCs
      subcutaneously at 1 and 8 days after each MOv-PBL infusion instead of IL-2.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each stratum receive escalating doses of MOv-PBL until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 10 patients receive MOv-PBL,
      without IL-2, followed by immunization with donor PBMCs as above.

      Patients are followed at 4 and 8 weeks and then periodically for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 13-50 patients will be accrued for this study.
