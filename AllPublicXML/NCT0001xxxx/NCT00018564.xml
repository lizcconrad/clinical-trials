  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical research program is designed to evaluate medications as new treatments for
      essential tremor. Essential tremor is a common condition with few available therapies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each medication will be evaluated for effectiveness against tremor in a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, cross-over, double blind clinical research trial. Tremor will be assessed
      with accepted rating scales and accelerometry
