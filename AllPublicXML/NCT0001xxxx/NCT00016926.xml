      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of capecitabine in treating patients who
      have advanced, persistent, or recurrent cervical cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the activity of capecitabine in patients with advanced, persistent, or
           recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-62 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-20
      months.
