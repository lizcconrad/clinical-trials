  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two diseases in particular that may have serious consequences for driving and
      mobility due to their potentially severe impact on visual function: glaucoma and diabetic
      neuropathy. In this project we will develop predictive models of driving for these patients
      and will train them to use low-vision aids to improve driving mobility. We will determine how
      best to train patients with hemianopic field loss due to cerebral vascular accidents and
      identify predictors of long-term success in the use of low-vision aids.

      There are two diseases in particular that may have serious consequences for driving and
      mobility due to their potentially severe impact on visual function: glaucoma and diabetic
      neuropathy. Both these diseases can potentially result in significant peripheral visual field
      loss, sometimes coupled with decreased visual acuity. We have previously demonstrated that
      each of these visual losses alone can have significant impact on driving and mobility
      performance. In this project we will develop predictive models of driving for these patients
      and apply our extensive expertise in training patients to use low-vision aids to improve
      driving mobility. A second question that will be addressed is how to best train scanning
      patients with hemianopic field loss due to cerebral vascular accidents. We propose to
      configure the prisms in a bioptic form similar to previously used for amorphic lenses in RP
      and for bioptic telescopes for patients in macular disease. The third problem that will be
      addressed is the identification of predictors of long-term success in the use of low-vision
      aids.
