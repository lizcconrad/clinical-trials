  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine tongue strength and endurance, how the tongue applies pressure during
      swallowing, and how the chin muscles react during swallowing in healthy volunteers and in
      patients with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). The information from this study may be
      helpful in developing better treatments for people with swallowing problems.

      Healthy volunteers who have no history of speech, swallowing or breathing problems and
      patients who have difficulty swallowing because of a neurologic disorder, musculoskeletal
      disease or head and neck cancer that caused tongue weakness and dysphagia may be eligible for
      this study. Such medical conditions may include stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple
      sclerosis corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, Gaucher's disease,
      leukodystrophy, cerebral palsy, myositis, or mouth, throat or neck cancer. Volunteers who
      have not participated in a NIH protocol for 1 year will be screened with a brief medical
      history and physical examination. Dysphagic patients not currently enrolled in a NIH protocol
      will also have a brief medical history and physical examination. In addition, they will have
      a modified barium swallow to determine the nature and degree of their swallowing difficulty.

      Participants will have a 15-minute examination of movements of their tongue, lips and jaw and
      will fill out a questionnaire about their swallowing ability. They will then begin the tongue
      pressure test. To monitor and record tongue pressure, a thin rubber strip with air-filled
      pressure bulbs will be attached to the roof of the mouth with dental adhesive. The pressure
      bulbs are connected to an external pressure-reading device. In addition, a small plastic pad
      with adhesive backing will be placed under the chin. Electrodes (wires) attached to the pad
      record chin muscle activities.

      With the pressure bulbs and chin electrodes in place, the patient will perform tongue
      pressure tasks to test tongue strength, how long the patient can maintain a certain tongue
      pressure, and how fast tongue pressure drops. The tasks include saliva swallows, water
      swallows and cup-drinking.

      The tongue enacts complex mechanical events during swallowing, the most important of which is
      the propulsion of a bolus from the oral cavity to the pharynx. Successful bolus transport
      requires the tongue to interact with other oral structures, especially the hard palate, to
      generate sufficient impulsive force or pressure gradients that drive the bolus toward the
      oropharynx. Our knowledge of deglutitive lingual pressure dynamics is at best incomplete. The
      available data on oral tongue pressure phenomena are based exclusively on commanded single
      swallows. Oral pressure changes during other important everyday eating activities (e.g., cup
      drinking) have not been studied to date. Past investigations revealed that rapid sequential
      swallowing during continuous drinking, in contrast to commanded discrete swallows, had unique
      tongue-palate contact patterns, surface electromyographic response characteristics, and hyoid
      displacement profiles. Given the different biomechanical properties and motor strategies, we
      hypothesize that oral lingual pressure profiles for sequential swallowing are also different,
      that sequential swallows require less impulsive force, and that selected dysphagic patients,
      especially those whose swallowing deficits are associated with reduced tongue strength, will
      perform sequential swallows more efficiently than they do discrete swallows. This protocol,
      therefore, proposes to test these hypotheses in healthy individuals of different ages, and in
      patients with reduced tongue strength and oral-oropharyngeal dysphagia associated with
      neurologic disorders, musculoskeletal diseases, or head and neck cancer. Our goals are to:
      (a) acquire a better and more complete understanding of normal tongue pressure phenomena as a
      function of swallowing tasks, (b) characterize the interrelationship between task-induced
      lingual pressure differences and result of clinical diagnostic tests of swallowing function
      in patient populations, and (c) differentially identify the profiles of dysphagic patients
      who can and those who cannot benefit from sequential swallowing as a
      compensatory/rehabilitative strategy.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Eligible healthy volunteers must:

          1. be at least 21 years of age;

          2. have no speech, swallowing, or respiratory problems;

          3. be in good general health;

          4. not be on medications that would adversely affect swallowing ability.

        Eligible dysphagic patients must:

          1. be at least 21 years of age;

          2. have a neurologic disorder (e.g., CVA, PD, PSD, CBD, MS, Gaucher, leukodystrophy,
             cerebral palsy), musculoskeletal disease (e.g., polymyositis), or head and neck cancer
             that has caused impairments in tongue function and swallowing;

          3. present with oral or oropharyngeal dysphagia without aspiration based on results of
             the standard modified barium swallow study.

          4. have sufficient auditory comprehension and cognitive skills to follow test
             instructions and understand the nature of the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        For healthy volunteers:

          1. History of swallowing problems or other conditions that adversely affect swallowing
             function, tongue motility and control, hearing, language, and cognition.

          2. On medication (e.g., anticholinergics, antidepressants) that adversely affects
             swallowing function, tongue movement, comprehension, or cognition.

          3. Oral dryness that interferes with swallowing.

          4. Unsatisfactory performance status, as judged by the examining speech-language
             pathologist, that indicates poor compliance for the planned tasks (e.g., undiagnosed
             oral motor deficits).

          1. Aspiration, as identified via the modified barium swallow study.

          2. Pregnancy, as determined via a urine pregnancy test prior to the MBS test.
