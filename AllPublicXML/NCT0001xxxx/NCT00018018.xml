  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a new method for delivering gene transfer therapy to patients with
      severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) due to a defective adenosine deaminase (ADA)
      gene. This gene codes for the adenosine deaminase enzyme, which is essential for the proper
      growth and function of infection-fighting white blood cells called T and B lymphocytes.
      Patients who lack this enzyme are vulnerable to frequent and severe infections.

      Some patients with this disease receive enzyme replacement therapy with weekly injections of
      the drug PEG-ADA (ADAGEN). This drug may increase the number of immune cells and reduce
      infections, but it is not a cure. Gene transfer therapy, in which a normal ADA gene is
      inserted into the patient s cells, attempts to correct the underlying cause of disease. This
      therapy has been tried in a small number of patients with varying degrees of success. In this
      study, the gene will be inserted into the patient s stem cells (cells produced by the bone
      marrow that mature into the different blood components white cells, red cells and platelets).

      Patients with ADA deficiency and SCID who are taking PEG-ADA and are not candidates for
      HLA-identical sibling donor bone marrow transplantation may be eligible for this study.

      Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 2 to 3 days. Stem cells will be
      collected either from cord blood (in newborn patients) or from the bone marrow. The bone
      marrow procedure is done under light sedation or general anesthesia. It involves drawing a
      small amount of marrow through a needle inserted into the hip bone. The stem cells in the
      marrow will be grown in the laboratory and a normal human ADA gene will be transferred into
      them through a special type of disabled mouse virus. A few days later, the patient will
      receive the ADA-corrected cells through an infusion in the vein that will last from 10
      minutes to 2 hours.

      Patients will be evaluated periodically for immune function with blood tests, skin tests, and
      reactions to tetanus, diphtheria, H. influenza B and S. pneumoniae vaccinations. The survival
      of ADA-corrected cells will be monitored through blood tests. The number and amount of blood
      tests will depend on the patient s age, weight and health, but is expected that blood will
      not be drawn more than twice a month. Patients will also undergo bone marrow biopsy aspirate
      (as described above) twice a year. Patients will be followed once a year indefinitely to
      evaluate the long-term effects of therapy.

      This is a clinical gene transfer study that aims to verify the safety and efficacy of the use
      of retroviral vectors to introduce the human adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene into the
      hematopoietic progenitors of patients affected with severe combined immunodeficiency due to
      ADA deficiency. In addition, this protocol will examine the effects of the ADA gene transfer
      on the immune system of treated patients. Patients with ADA deficiency and ineligible for
      matched sibling allogeneic bone marrow transplantation are eligible to participate to the
      study. To increase engraftment and selective advantage of gene-corrected cells, busulfan will
      be used as cytoreduction agent and enzyme replacement (PEG-ADA) therapy will be discontinued.
      CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors will be isolated from the patient bone marrow or cord blood,
      exposed to retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer and reinfused into the patient through a
      peripheral vein. Clinical, immunological and molecular follow-up studies will assess safety,
      toxicity, and efficacy of the procedure.

             peripheral blood or (for neonates) umbilical cord erythrocytes and/or leukocytes, or
             in cultured fetal cells derived from either chorionic villus biopsy or amniocentesis,
             prior to institution of enzyme replacement therapy.

             AND

          2. Evidence of severe combined immunodeficiency based on either:

             Family history of first order relative with ADA deficiency and clinical and laboratory
             evidence of severe immunologic deficiency

             OR

             Evidence of severe immunologic deficiency in subject based on lymphopenia (absolute
             lymphocyte count less than 200) or severely decreased T lymphocyte blastogenic
             responses to phytohemagglutinin (cpm less than 5,000) prior to institution of immune
             restorative therapy

             PEG-ADA enzyme therapy after being invited to discuss alternative treatment options
             with a physician not connected with the protocol.
