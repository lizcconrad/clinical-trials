    <textblock>
      This study compares air pollution exposures of residents in a South Baltimore community next
      to major industry with those in a comparison community with much less industry nearby.
      Parents and children as well as adults alone will be included. Air levels of 3 chemicals that
      have been found in increased amounts in the community as well as two urinary breakdown
      products of benzene will be measured. Participants will limit the amount of sorbate preserved
      foods they eat as this preservative interferes with one of the benzene breakdown products.
      Benzene air and urine exposure measurements will be compared in each community as well as
      between communities. By including children and parents we will gather exposure information on
      children who may be more sensitive that adults to these types of pollution. Lastly, by
      restricting the amount of food preserved with sorbates, we can decide if this improves the
      use of ttMA for people exposed to benzene from air pollution.

      The current study focuses on an environmental exposure assessment of a South Baltimore
      community residing near a heavily industrialized area. Exposure differences between this
      community and a reference community that is demographically similar to South Baltimore but
      has limited industrial impact will be assessed. Participants will include both parent child
      study pairs and adults. Outdoor, indoor and personal 72 hour badge monitoring for benzene,
      1,3-butadiene and carbon tetrachloride will be performed. Two urinary biomarkers for benzene
      exposure, trans,trans-muconic acid (ttMA) and s-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) will be
      measured at 3 daily time points over the 3 day period. Past work indicates that ingestion of
      sorbate preserved foods causes substantial interference with the benzene biomarker, ttMA.
      Therefore, participants will restrict their intake of sorbate preserved foods during the
      study. On the day of greatest dietary restriction, a 24 hour benzene personal air measurement
      will be obtained. Data analysis will include correlations of benzene badge exposure
      measurements and urinary biomarkers. Air and biomarker benzene exposure data will be compared
      between communities. Linear regression modeling will be used to determine important
      explanatory factors of the biomarkers. The inclusion of parent child study pairs will also
      allow correlation of benzene air levels and urinary biomarkers between parents and children.
      This will provide exposure information on a potentially susceptible subpopulation, e.g.
      children, and allow assessment of potential for age-related differences in benzene
      metabolism. Finally, we will be able to determine if dietary restriction is practical and
      results in greater specificity of ttMA as a benzene biomarker.
