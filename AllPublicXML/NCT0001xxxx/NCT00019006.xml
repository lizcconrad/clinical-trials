      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from mutated ras peptides may make the body build an immune response
      to and kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of a vaccine containing mutated ras
      peptides and an immune adjuvant in treating patients who have colon, pancreatic, or lung
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether endogenous cellular or humoral immunity to a tumor-specific
      mutated ras protein is present in patients with colorectal, pancreatic, or lung cancer.

      II. Determine whether vaccination with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the tumor's ras
      mutation combined with Detox-B adjuvant can induce or boost cellular immunity to that
      particular mutation in this patient population.

      III. Determine the type and characteristics of any cellular immunity generated in these
      patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. Determine the tolerance and toxicity spectra of such peptides given with Detox-B adjuvant
      in these patients.

      V. Determine the immune response associated with each peptide dose in these patients.

      VI. Assess any tumor response that may occur with treatment in these patients treated with
      this regimen.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive tumor-specific mutated
      ras peptide combined with Detox-B adjuvant subcutaneously monthly for 3 months. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      stable or responding disease or with a specific immunologic response may receive 3 additional
      monthly vaccinations.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tumor-specific mutated ras peptide
      combined with Detox-B adjuvant until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD
      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      A total of 33 patients (12 in the adjuvant setting) will be accrued for this study within 12
      months.

        1. Histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis according to
             the criteria defined by the Histiocyte Society

               -  Demonstration of CD1a antigenic determinants on the surface of lesional cells (by
                  immunocytology or immunohistology) or Birbeck granules in lesional cells by
                  electron microscopy

          2. Considered at risk or low risk according to the following criteria:

               1. Multi-system at risk disease, defined as involvement of one or more risk organs
                  (i.e., hematopoietic system, liver, spleen, or lungs)

                    -  No single-system lung involvement

               2. Multi-system low-risk disease

                    -  Multiple organs involved but without involvement of risk organs

               3. Single-system disease

                    -  Multifocal bone disease (i.e., lesions in 2 or more different bones)

                    -  Localized special site involvement, such as CNS-risk lesions with
                       intracranial soft tissue extension or vertebral lesions with intraspinal
                       soft tissue extension
