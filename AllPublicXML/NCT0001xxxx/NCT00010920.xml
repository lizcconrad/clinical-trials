      Preventing dementia is an important goal for our aging population. This proposal is an
      initial 42 months study of the effect of standardized ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) on
      preventing or delaying cognitive decline in people age 85 years or older (the oldest old).
      The study focuses on the oldest old who present a distinct advantage for primary prevention
      studies because of their particularly high risk for developing mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI), a precursor to dementia. Because this is a population that has previously been out of
      the mainstream for use of alternative medicine, the safety of GBE in this age group will also
      be tested in this study. The study is randomized, placebo controlled and double blind.
      Approximately 200 elderly cognitively healthy subjects will be enrolled and followed for
      detection of conversion to MCI. This pilot study is viewed as a necessary first step in order
      to demonstrate that GBE, an alternative or complementary therapy, has a disease modifying
      effect on the brain, distinct from a symptomatic effect. The study will test the feasibility
      of the randomized start design, a trial design proposed as a method for discerning brain- or
      disease- modifying from symptomatic effects. The magnitude of biological effect of the
      treatments will also be assessed with volumetric quantitative MRI, a complementary means of
      confirming whether there is a brain modifying effect (measured as a decrease in brain volume
      loss with treatment). Peripheral markers of oxidation status will measure possible
      anti-oxidant effects of GBE.
