  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to attempt to identify possible dangerous interactions between
      cocaine and methylphenidate (MPD). Additional objectives are to determine: a) if MPD reduces
      the craving and high for cocaine; b) if there are pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      interactions between cocaine and MPD; and c) the relationship between cocaine and
      benzoylecgonine (BE) levels in plasma and BE levels in urine.

      This study was conducted to evaluate the cardiovascular risk of prescribing up to 90 mg of
      methylphenidate (MPD) daily for treating cocaine dependence. This within-subject study was
      completed in an inpatient setting. It was non-blinded for MPD dose and single-blinded for
      cocaine dose. Each patient was given intravenous cocaine at 0, 20 and 40 mg while at three
      different steady state levels of MPD (0, 60 and 90 mg). Seven non-treatment seeking cocaine
      addicts, who were recruited from the community, completed the study. There were no cardiac
      rhythm abnormalities noted except for sinus tachycardia and sinus bradycardia. There were no
      incidences of seizures or myocardial ischemia. In a repeated measures ANOVA, MPD was shown to
      have an independent positive effect on heart rate (p=0.0001) but not on SBP or DBP. There was
      no cocaine by MPD interaction for any vital sign. Peak systolic blood pressure (SBP) and
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for any patient up to 60 minutes after infusion was 169 mm and
      108 mm, respectively. The first occurred when 60 mg of MPD and placebo cocaine were given and
      the second when no MPD and placebo cocaine were given. Peak heart rate for any patient up to
      60 min after infusion was 143/min at 60 mg of MPD and 40mg of cocaine. The number of adverse
      events reported when cocaine and MPD were given together was less than the number reported
      when either drug was given alone. The adverse events reported when cocaine and MPD were given
      together included headache, nervousness, and lightheadedness. Subjective ratings of drug
      effect revealed that MPD did not enhance patients' response to, or desire for, cocaine. MPD
      appears to be a safe drug to use in cocaine addicts who continue to use cocaine at the
      dosages tested.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. male or female of any race, between 21 and 45 years of age.

          2. cocaine dependent according to DSM-IV criteria.

          3. currently use cocaine by smoked or intravenous route of administration and confirmed
             by positive urine screen for benzoylecgonine within 2 weeks prior to signing the
             informed consent form. The subjects who currently use cocaine by smoked route must
             have a history of intravenous exposure to drugs of abuse.

          4. in stable physical and mental health as judged by interview and physical examinations.

          5. for female subjects, test non-pregnant and use adequate birth control. All female
             subjects will have a serum pregnancy test performed prior to the first dose of study
             medication.

          6. be capable of providing written informed consent to participate in this study.

          7. able to comply with protocol requirements and be likely to complete all study
             treatments.

          8. within 20% of ideal body weight.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. require detoxification from alcohol, opiates, or sedative-hypnotics.

          2. have a history of significant hepatic, renal, endocrine, cardiac (i.e., arrhythmia
             requiring medication, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction), stroke, seizure,
             neurological, non-drug-related psychiatric, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, hematological
             or metabolic disorders.

          3. have a history of adverse reaction to cocaine including loss of consciousness, chest
             pain, psychosis, or seizure.

          4. have a history of adverse reaction/hypersensitivity to methylphenidate.

          5. test positive upon urine toxicology screen for opiates, benzodiazepines, barbiturates
             or related CNS depressants, amphetamines or related stimulants.

          6. have clinically significant abnormal laboratory measurements in liver function tests
             (AST and ALT levels greater than 3 times of the upper limit of normal), hematology
             (CBC, differential, platelet count), serum chemistries (SMA-24) and EKG.

          7. have any significant active medical, or psychiatric illness which might inhibit their
             ability to complete the study or might be complicated by administration of the test
             drug.
