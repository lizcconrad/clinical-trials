      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab can locate cancer cells and either kill
      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining
      monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may be an effective treatment for hematologic
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bevacizumab combined with cytarabine
      and mitoxantrone in treating patients who have hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the clinical effectiveness of bevacizumab, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone in
           patients with poor-risk hematologic malignancies.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine whether this regimen can induce cell apoptosis in these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of bevacizumab on coagulation profiles in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cytarabine IV continuously over 72 hours on days 1-3, mitoxantrone IV over
      30-60 minutes on day 4, and bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on day 8 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving partial or complete remission may
      receive a second course of therapy beginning approximately 30 days after the completion of
      the first course.

      Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-3 years.
