  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common, life-threatening autosomal recessive
      genetic disorder of the white population, there are often delays in diagnosis and hence start
      of treatment. Advances of the past two decades have made CF screening feasible using
      routinely collected neonatal blood specimens and measuring an enzyme level followed by CF
      mutation DNA analysis. Our overall goal of the study is to see if early diagnosis of CF
      through neonatal screening will be medically beneficial without major risks. ''Medically
      beneficial'' refers to better nutrition and/or pulmonary status, whereas '' risks'' include
      laboratory errors, miscommunication or misunderstanding, and adverse psychosocial
      consequences. Specific aims include assessment of the benefits, risks, costs, quality of
      life, and cognitive function associated with CF neonatal screening and a better understanding
      of the epidemiology of CF.

      A comprehensive, randomized clinical trial emphasizing early diagnosis as the key variable
      has been underway since 1985. Nutritional status has been assessed using height and weight
      measurements and biochemical methods. The results have demonstrated significant benefits in
      the screened (early diagnosis) group. We are now focusing on the effect of early diagnosis of
      CF on pulmonary outcome. Pulmonary status is measured using chest radiographs, chest scans
      using high resolution computerized tomography, and pulmonary function tests. Other factors
      that we are looking at include risk factors for the acquisition of respiratory pathogens such
      as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, quality of life and cognitive function of children with CF who
      underwent early versus delayed diagnosis, as well as the cost effectiveness of screening and
      the costs of diagnosis and treatment of CF throughout childhood.

      If the questions underlying this study are answered favorably, it is likely that neonatal
      screening using a combination of enzyme level (immunoreactive trypsinogen) and DNA test will
      become the routine method for identifying new cases of CF not only in the State of Wisconsin,
      but throughout the country.
