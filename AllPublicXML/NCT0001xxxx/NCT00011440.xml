  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate whether exposure to particulate air pollution increases
      the allergic response to allergens. Research studies suggest that symptoms in individuals
      with allergies may be aggravated by exposure to particulate air pollution. We sought to
      experimental determine this by exposing human volunteers to combustion particles, a component
      of air pollution, and then challenge them with an allergen such as ragweed or oak tree
      pollen. Using biological tests we can measure whether the allergen response is magnified by
      prior particulate exposure.

      To study whether particulates enhance the allergic response, we chose the upper airway as a
      model of allergic inflammation and nasal lavage as a non-invasive method for obtaining
      samples. The nasal cavity is both an excellent model of allergic inflammation and provides an
      easily accessible site for study. We measured inflammatory cells and cytokines in the nasal
      lavage fluid. Our specific hypothesis was that particulate exposure prior to allergen
      challenge would enhance inflammatory cell recruitment and expression of inflammatory
      cytokines.
