    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled trial to compare supported treadmill ambulation training
      (STAT) to conventional gait training for improving gait speed, gait endurance, gait
      efficiency and muscle function in SCI subjects injured more than six months prior to start of
      training. Each subject will receive twelve weeks of either CGT or STAT, given as 20 minutes
      of training within a one-hour period per day, five days per week. These subjects will be
      studied baseline, 4,8 and 12 weeks of training, and three months after the end of training
      with a battery of tests designed to evaluate the subjects' gait and muscle function.
