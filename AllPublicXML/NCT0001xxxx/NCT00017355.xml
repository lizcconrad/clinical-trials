      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a patient's white blood cells mixed with tumor antigens may
      make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who
      have metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of antigen-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine in
           patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  Determine the longevity of melanoma-specific immunity in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Perform serial analysis of T-cell and B-cell function in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily on days 1-6 or
      1-7. Patients undergo apheresis on days 6 and 7 or 6-8 to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMC). PBMC are processed for CD34+ cell isolation. These autologous CD34+
      hematopoietic progenitor cells are cultured to generate dendritic cells (DC). DC are then
      pulsed with endotoxin-free keyhole limpet hemocyanin and HLA-A2-01 restricted flu-matrix
      peptides derived from melanoma-associated tumor antigens (MART-1:27-35, gp100:209-217, and
      MAGE-3). Antigen-pulsed DC are incubated with interferon alfa to induce DC maturation.

      Patients receive priming injections of antigen-pulsed DC vaccine SC once every 2 weeks for 8
      weeks. Treatment repeats at 2, 3, 4, and 5 months after the last priming injection in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed at 2 and 4 weeks and then every 3 months for 1.5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.
