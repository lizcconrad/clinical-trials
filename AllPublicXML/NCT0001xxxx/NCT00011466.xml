  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specific nutrient deficiencies have been described in children with ADHD including zinc,
      magnesium, calcium, and essential fatty acids. In addition, children with ADHD have been
      noted to behave and concentrate better in some studies when the ratio of protein compared
      with carbohydrate in their diets was increased, however, this was anecdotal information noted
      from studies designed to study other factors, so its not clear if the increased protein is
      actually the cause of the improved behavior. In our clinical practice, we have noted a high
      incidence of what appears to be carbohydrate &quot;craving&quot; among children with ADHD, which can
      put children at risk for obesity, diabetes type II, and additional dysregulation of mood and
      concentration. Carbohydrate craving is a well-documented phenomenon in adults, particularly
      those with certain patterns of obesity, mood disorders, or those undergoing smoking cessation
      programs. It has not been studied in children, however. Thus, this initial study was designed
      to determine 1) whether or not children with ADHD have different patterns of nutrient intake
      compared with children in the same family and children in families without a child with ADHD,
      2) if the described nutrient deficiencies are due to decreased intake, and 3) whether there
      is an increased occurrence of carbohydrate craving, based on parents' perceptions, eating
      patterns, and actual intake, among children (or certain subgroups of children) with ADHD. The
      information gained from this study will be used to design additional studies to test
      causative hypotheses and intervention strategies.

      Three day prospective diet records will be completed on 25 children aged 5-13 with ADHD,
      their sibling controls, and 25 children from control families without ADHD in order to assess
      their protein, carbohydrate, fat, calorie, and multiple specific nutrient intakes. In
      addition, a questionnaire will be completed on each child describing several aspects of
      eating behavior, food choices, and gastrointestinal, allergic, and infectious concomitants.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Children with ADHD (combined or hyperactive-impulsive subtype) by Parent and Teacher Rating
        Scales, history, and interview who do not have a medical or neurologic problem that
        influences eating, who are not on medication for ADHD or another medication that may
        influence eating, aged 5-13 years with a sibling in the same age range meeting the same
        criteria but without ADHD. This sibling must have a normal Parent Rating Scale and not have
        been held back in school or been on medication or diagnosed with a learning, developmental,
        or neuropsychiatric disorder. Controls must meet the same criteria, and may not have a
        first-degree relative with ADHD. All participants must have a normal intellect, and may not
        have an autistic spectrum disorder or major depression.
