      This study aims to assess selected naturopathic medicines for adult periodontitis and to
      identify variables that influence successful outcomes when traditional and alternative
      approaches to preventing and treating periodontal diseases are combined. Collaboration
      between Kaiser Permanente, Oregon Health Science University and the National College of
      Naturopathic Medicine provides an unsurpassed environment for such investigations.
      Periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss and negatively impacts systemic health. The
      limitations of traditional periodontal treatment have compelled scientists and clinicians to
      investigate new remedies, and naturopathic medicine holds several promising interventions.

      Because they are used to improve elements of host resistance that are known to be important
      in periodontal health and disease, three naturopathic medicines are potential adjuncts in
      preventing and treating periodontitis. Connective tissue components are enzymatically
      degraded in periodontitis. In naturopathy, Connective Tissue Nutrient Formula (CTNF)
      (vitamins A, C and D, glucosamine sulfate, oligoproanthocyanindins, copper, zinc, manganese,
      boron, silicon, magnesium, and calcium) is prescribed specifically to enhance the integrity
      of key connective tissue elements and improve their resistance to degradation. Periodontitis
      begins when permeability of the oral sulcular epithelium permits pathogenic bacterial
      components to invade deeper periodontal connective tissues. In naturopathy, glutamine is
      prescribed to reduce oral-intestinal epithelial membrane permeability. Chronic activation of
      the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis during the stress response, is a risk factor
      for periodontitis. Adaptogenic herbs (AH) (Panax ginseng, Withania somnifera and
      Eleutherococcus senticosus) are prescribed by naturopathic physicians to reverse the impact
      of bacterial and psychosocial stressors. Because glutamine, CTNF and AH target
      pathophysiologic mechanisms known to underline periodontitis, they are compelling candidates
      in clinical and mechanistic investigations of complementary medicine approaches to the
      management of periodontitis.

      Kaiser Permanente adult periodontitis patients will serve as subjects and receive standard
      periodontal treatment. Three of the four randomly assigned groups will also receive
      supplements of glutamine, CTNF, or AH. We will determine the effects of these supplements on
      clinical outcomes (attachment loss, pocket depths, indicators of inflammation, plaque
      composition, need for periodontal surgery, acute periodontal problems, tooth loss). In
      addition to completing the battery of self-report measures (stress, coping, quality of life),
      study subjects will provide samples of blood, saliva, gingival cervicular fluid and bacterial
      dental plaque. These samples will be examined as part of the Laboratory Core to identify
      biologic and genetic characteristics that correlate with successful outcomes. Storage of
      portions of the samples will allow future examination of additional variables as part of the
      Developmental Projects carried out as the Craniofacial Complementary &amp; Alternative Center is
      established and Phase III trials are undertaken.
