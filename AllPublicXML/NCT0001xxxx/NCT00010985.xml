      This study compares two approaches to the management of acute low back pain: usual care
      (standard benefit) vs. the choice of: usual care, chiropractic, acupuncture or massage
      therapy (expanded benefit). 480 subjects with uncomplicated, acute low back pain will be
      recruited from a health maintenance organization, and randomized to either usual care (n=160)
      or choice of expanded benefits (n=320). Patients' preferences for individual therapies and
      expectations of improvement will be measured at baseline and throughout the study. Subjects
      randomized to the expanded benefits arm who choose chiropractic, acupuncture or massage will
      receive up to 10 treatments over a five-week period. Additional treatments will be available
      after the fifth week but will require a copayment. Treatments will be provided by licensed
      providers who have met strict credentialing criteria. Chiropractic, acupuncture or massage
      treatments will begin within 48 hours. Chiropractic, acupuncture and massage therapy scope of
      practice guidelines for the treatment of acute low back pain have been developed as have
      detailed data tracking procedures to be used at each patient visit. Symptom relief,
      functional status, restricted activity days, use of health care, and patient and provider
      satisfaction will be assessed at 2, 5,12, 26 and 52 weeks after initiation of treatment.
      Primary outcomes will include: 1) change in symptoms; 2) change in functional status; 3)
      patient satisfaction; and 4) total utilization of services associated with care for low back
      pain. Medical records and the HMO's cost management information system will identify use of
      services. It is hypothesized that patients offered their choice of expanded benefits will
      experience a more rapid improvement in symptoms, a faster return to baseline functional
      status, a decrease in utilization of conventional medical services, and will be more
      satisfied with their care. The study is a direct examination of the effectiveness of an
      insurance eligibility intervention, not a test of the efficacy of specific, non-allopathic
      treatment regimens. The results of this study will provide valuable information to
      clinicians, patients and third party payers on the relative benefits and costs of an
      &quot;expanded benefits&quot; treatment option which incorporates chiropractic, acupuncture and massage
      services for low back pain.
