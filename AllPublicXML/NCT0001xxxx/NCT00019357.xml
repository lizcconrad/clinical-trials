      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells.
      Combining white blood cells, which have been activated by a vaccine, with interleukin-2 may
      kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 plus activated white blood
      cells in treating patients with cancer that has not responded to chemotherapy or radiation
      therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility of expansion and the reinfusion of specific T-cell
      lines (peptide-specific activated lymphocytes), in combination with interleukin-2, in
      patients who were vaccinated with ras peptides. II. Assess immunologic status or antitumor
      response that may occur with this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Autologous peptide-specific activated lymphocytes (PAL), previously harvested from
      the patient following vaccination on a different protocol, are expanded and reinfused
      intravenously; this is followed by a 4 hour observation period. Patients then receive
      interleukin-2 (IL-2) administered subcutaneously 5 days a week for 2 weeks; the first dose of
      IL-2 is administered at least 4 hours after PAL infusion. Patients are followed once a month
      for 2 months after treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study.
