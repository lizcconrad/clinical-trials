  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test another way to control the amount of HIV in the blood
      (viral load).

      Studies show that stopping all anti-HIV drugs for a time before switching to new anti-HIV
      drugs may improve the response in some individuals who are failing treatment. Other studies
      suggest a benefit if drug-resistance tests are used in selecting a new anti-HIV drug
      treatment. This study tests the effect of stopping anti-HIV drugs for a time before switching
      to anti-HIV drugs selected using drug-resistance test results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Virologic failure occurs in a large proportion of individuals receiving treatment with
      combination antiretroviral therapy. Studies suggest that treatment interruption prior to
      initiation of a multiple-drug rescue regimen may improve virologic response in individuals
      who have failed several prior antiretroviral regimens. Other studies suggest there is a
      virologic benefit derived from using genotypic or phenotypic resistance testing in selecting
      salvage therapy regimens for patients failing antiretroviral therapy. This study tests the
      hypothesis that salvage regimens selected on the basis of HIV-1 resistance genotype,
      phenotype [AS PER AMENDMENT 02/19/02: virtual phenotype], and treatment history will be more
      effective if there is a period of treatment interruption before initiating that regimen.

      Patients continue their antiretroviral therapy until randomization. Based on the results of
      the pre-entry genotype and phenotype [AS PER AMENDMENT 02/19/02: virtual phenotype] tests and
      treatment history, an individualized salvage therapy regimen (not provided by the study) is
      selected by the site investigator(s). Additionally, patients start or continue maintenance
      therapy (not provided by the study) for opportunistic infections (OIs). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. In Arm A, patients have antiretroviral treatment
      interruption for a period of 16 weeks (Step 1), followed by initiation of the [AS PER
      AMENDMENT 02/19/02: best available] salvage therapy regimen (Step 2). [AS PER AMENDMENT
      02/19/02: Patients in Arm A will be placed immediately on their individualized salvage
      regimen before the end of the 16-week period of treatment interruption if their CD4 count
      falls below a defined threshold, or if they develop a new OI]. In Arm B, patients switch
      immediately to the salvage therapy regimen. [AS PER AMENDMENT 02/15/01: Patients who become
      pregnant during Step 1 of Arm A must be advised to begin their selected, individualized
      salvage therapy regimen or a modified salvage regimen. Patients who become pregnant during
      Step 2 of Arm A or Arm B have therapy evaluated and undergo any changes required by their
      pregnancy.] Patients in both arms are monitored for plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+ and CD8+
      cell counts, and HIV drug resistance genotypes and phenotypes for a duration of 64 weeks from
      randomization. Patients in Arm A are also monitored for immune reactivation by measurement of
      T-cell subsets and plasma cytokines during treatment interruption. Patients may participate
      in a virology substudy (A5100s) and an immunology substudy (A5104s). [AS PER AMENDMENT
      02/19/02: Patients who volunteer to participate in the substudies must be registered to the
      main study at the same time they are registered to a substudy.]

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Are HIV-infected.

          -  Are likely to have drug-resistant HIV from having taken all types of anti-HIV drugs
             (protease inhibitors [PIs], nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs], and
             nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTIs]), and having failed treatment
             prior to the current treatment for reasons other than toxicity.

          -  Are currently receiving anti-HIV treatment with at least 3 drugs. Low doses of
             ritonavir (100 to 200 mg twice daily) taken with 1 other PI is counted as a single PI.

          -  Are currently failing treatment due to a high viral load (amount of HIV in the blood).

          -  Have had a new anti-HIV drug combination selected.

          -  Are at least 18 years old.

          -  This study has been changed to remove CD4 counts as an inclusion criterion. In the
             previous version of the protocol, patients were required to have a CD4 count of 150
             cells/ml or more within 42 days prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients will not be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Have stopped treatment for more than 4 weeks in the past 6 months.

          -  Are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Have cancer that requires systemic treatment or radiation.

          -  Have received the following medications affecting the immune system within 14 days
             before entry: erythropoietin; Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF), including
             Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factors (GM-CSF); interleukins; or
             therapeutic HIV vaccines.
