  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study offers evaluation and treatment for patients with inherited (genetic) eye
      diseases. The protocol is not designed to test new treatments; rather, patients will receive
      current standard of care treatments. The purpose of the study is twofold: 1) to allow
      National Eye (NEI) Institute physicians to increase their knowledge of various genetic eye
      diseases, identify possible new avenues of research in this area, and maintain their clinical
      skills; and 2) to establish a pool of patients who may be eligible for new studies as they
      are developed. (Participants in this protocol will not be required to join a new study; the
      decision will be voluntary.)

      Children and adults with genetic eye diseases may be eligible for this study. Candidates will
      be screened with a medical and family history, thorough eye examination and blood test. The
      eye examination includes measurements of eye pressure and visual acuity (ability to see the
      vision chart) and dilation of the pupils with eye drops to examine the lens and retina (back
      part of the eye). Patients may also undergo additional diagnostic tests needed to determine
      eligibility for other NEI studies, including routine laboratory testing, imaging,
      questionnaires, a physical examination, and other standard and specialized tests and
      procedures as needed. In addition, patients will have special photographs taken of the eye to
      document the clarity or opacity of the eye lens. They will also undergo a procedure called
      electroretinography to assess the eye's response to bright lights. For this procedure, the
      eye is numbed with anesthetic drops and a contact lens is placed in the eye. The patient
      looks inside a large, hollow sphere and sees flashes of light, first in darkness and then in
      light. The contact lenses sense small electrical signals generated by the retina.

      Patients who need medical care will be given appropriate standard medical treatment. Those
      who are found eligible for a research study will be recommended for participation in that
      study and taken off this one.

      Participants will be followed at least 3 years. Follow-up visits are scheduled according to
      the standard of care for the individual patient's eye problem. Patients in this protocol will
      probably have 1 to 3 follow-up visits per year.

      This &quot;Evaluation and Treatment Protocol&quot; will allow the geneticists and ophthalmic genetic
      specialists at the NEI to identify, follow and provide &quot;standard of care&quot; treatment to
      patients with genetic eye disease. The primary purpose of the protocol is to accumulate a
      cohort of patients with genetic eye disease for possible participation in NEI studies. A
      secondary purpose is to provide long-term follow-up and treatment for a variety of genetic
      eye diseases so that the genetic specialists at NEI will be better able to identify research
      hypotheses about these diseases in addition to maintaining their clinical skills. The
      availability of cohorts of patients with a spectrum of genetic disorders will be valuable for
      the training of fellows in ophthalmic genetics, an important mission of the NEI. Finally, the
      ability to provide long-term follow-up and care will also facilitate referral efforts for new
      NEI protocols.

      The genetic specialists at the National Eye Institute will be free to choose those genetic
      conditions that interest them. However, the total number of patients that can be enrolled in
      the protocol will be restricted. This protocol is not designed to test any new treatments.
      Any evaluations or treatment under this protocol will be based on the current standard of
      care for each genetic condition.

      Participants in this patient evaluation and treatment protocol will be evaluated for
      potential eligibility in any new NEI clinical studies as they are developed. If eligible,
      patients may be asked to participate in the new protocol. However, they will not be required
      to enter any protocol and their decision to participate will be entirely voluntary. No more
      than 150 patients will be accepted in this &quot;Evaluation and Treatment Protocol.&quot;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients are initially screened for NEI protocols under the NEI screening protocol or from
        closeout of another protocol. Some of these patients will have a genetic eye disease that
        NEI staff wishes to follow and treat. Such patients can then be enrolled in this evaluation
        and treatment protocol. Each study participant must have the ability to understand and sign
        an informed consent form.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be excluded from this study if they are unable or unwilling to give informed
        consent or they are unwilling to be followed and treated at the NEI clinical center for at
        least the next 3 years.
