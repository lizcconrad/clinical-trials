  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is aimed at better understanding how children living in agricultural
      environments are exposed to pesticides, and how such exposures can be prevented or reduced.
      The project will develop and implement a community-wide intervention to reduce the transfer
      of pesticides from the workplace to the home (take home pathway).

      This project is aimed at better understanding how children living in agricultural
      environments are exposed to pesticides, and how such exposures can be prevented or reduced.
      Since 1991 our group has investigated pesticide expsoures among children of agricultural
      families in Washington state, focusing on exposure to organophosphate insecticides. We have
      demonstrated in these studies that the residential environments of agricultural families have
      higher pesticide residues than do other homes in this region. We have also found that
      children living in these residential environments have elevated levels of pesticide
      metabolites in their urine. We need to better understand how these children are being exposed
      in order to develop recomendations for exposure prevention or reduction. The current project
      will develop and implement a community-wide intervention to reduce the transfer of pesticides
      from the workplace to the home (take home pathway). A complementary project is also underway
      by the UW-Child Health Center to characterize pesticide exposure pathways for children of
      farmworkers.
