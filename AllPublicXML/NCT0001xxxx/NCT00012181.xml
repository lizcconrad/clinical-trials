      Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of flavopiridol in treating children
      who have relapsed or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol in children with relapsed or
      refractory solid tumors or lymphomas.

      II. Determine the toxic effects and pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      III. Determine the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients receive escalating doses of flavopiridol until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
