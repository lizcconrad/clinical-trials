      This study is testing the safety and effectiveness of acupuncture in controlling pain related
      to the removal of partially impacted mandibular third molars. Acupuncture is the Chinese art
      of healing by inserting needles into the skin.

      Participants ages 18 - 40 are given an initial x-ray to determine if one lower molar is
      partially bony impacted. Eligible participants will then undergo standard oral surgery to
      remove the impacted molar. A local anesthetic will be used prior to surgery. Directly after
      surgery the participant will be assigned to one of three groups. Participants will not be
      able to select which group they are assigned. Participants will receive either real or sham
      (fake) acupuncture as a treatment for post-extraction pain. After the initial acupuncture
      treatment, participants are required to remain for six hours at the dental site to be
      monitored. If a participants discomfort is measured as moderate or higher then a second
      acupuncture treatment will be administered. All participants will be administered
      questionnaires during the day of surgery. Participants will also be required to complete two
      diaries during the seven days following surgery. On the seventh day, participants return to
      have stitches removed and hand in completed diaries.
