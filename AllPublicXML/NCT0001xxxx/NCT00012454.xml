      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of a protein called E-selectin, given as a
      nasal spray, in preventing the formation of blood clots that can cause stroke. In animal
      studies, animals that received E-selectin in the nose on a regular schedule had almost no
      strokes compared with those that did not receive it.

      Patients over age 45 who have had a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 1 to 4
      months of this study may be eligible to participate. Candidates will be screened with a
      review of their past medical records and neurologic and medical evaluations that may include
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, ultrasound or magnetic resonance angiography
      (a type of MRI) of the carotid arteries (arteries in the neck that supply blood to the
      brain), echocardiography (ultrasound test of the heart), electrocardiography (EKG) and blood
      tests.

      Participants will have a blood and urine test and will be assigned to one of four treatment
      groups. Patients in each group will spray a small amount of fluid into their nose according
      to the following schedule: 5 doses once every other day for 10-days, followed in 3 weeks by
      another 5 doses every other day for 10-days, followed in 3 weeks by a final series of 5 doses
      every other day for 10 days. The spray for patients in each group contains the following:

        -  Group 1 - fluid with low dose of E-selectin

        -  Group 2 - fluid with medium dose of E-selectin

        -  Group 3 - fluid with high dose of E-selectin

        -  Group 4 - fluid with no E-selectin

      Patients will be seen for follow-up visits at 1 month and 3 months after starting E-selectin
      therapy. The visits will include a neurologic examination and blood and urine tests. Patients
      will be contacted by phone, fax or e-mail in between the 1- and 3-month visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of
      disability. Despite the success of recent clinical trials of antithrombotic drugs for the
      secondary prevention of stroke, annually about 10% of patients with recent cerebrovascular
      accidents have recurrent strokes. The development of new treatment strategies for the
      secondary prevention of stroke is an important issue for modern medicine. There is increasing
      evidence that inflammation at the sites of endothelial activation plays an important role in
      the pathogenesis of stroke. Control of molecular inflammation at the sites of endothelial
      activation can be achieved by induction of mucosal tolerance. The induction of mucosal
      tolerance with repeated, low-dose, intranasal administration of antigen causes a shift of
      immune response from proinflammatory T(H)1 type to anti-inflammatory T(H)2 type at the sites
      of inflammation. E-selectin is an adhesion molecule expressed only on activated endothelium
      in response to proinflammatory cytokines. The major goal of proposed study is to test whether
      repeated administration of low-dose, intranasal E-selectin can induce mucosal tolerance to
      this compound causing a shift of immune response from T(H)1 to T(H)2 type in patients with
      recent stroke or TIA, and secondly to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this strategy
      for the secondary prevention of stroke.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with recent (greater than 30 and less than 120 days) stroke or TIA over the age of
        45 years are eligible for the current study.

        Patients must be on at least one antithrombotic medication (coumadin, aspirin, ticlopidine,
