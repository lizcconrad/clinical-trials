      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients who have Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has not responded to
      previous treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin in patients with
           relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's disease or aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this regimen in these two patient
           populations.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease (Hodgkin's
      disease vs non-Hodgkin's lymphoma).

      Patients receive oral dexamethasone on days 1-4, cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, and
      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44-88 patients (22-44 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 4-10 months.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed Hodgkin's disease OR

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of
             B-cell origin (including immunoblastic, anaplastic large cell, mediastinal large
             B-cell, or T-cell rich B-cell NHL)

               -  No histologic evidence of transformation from indolent to aggressive histology

          -  Bidimensionally measurable disease that is clinically or radiologically documented

          -  No known CNS involvement NOTE: A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's
             lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot;
             lymphoma will replace the former terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade
             lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former terminology.
