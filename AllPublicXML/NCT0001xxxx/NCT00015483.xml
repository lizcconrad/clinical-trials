  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematotoxicity is caused by a number of agents such as a benzene by-product called
      hydroquinone and the antitumor agent doxorubicin. This is a basic research study, conducted
      using normal human donors, of mechanisms involved in hematotoxicity and of the protective
      response of human hematopoietic progenitor cells to hematotoxic agents. Tumor necrosis factor
      exposure protects these cells from a subsequent exposure to hematotoxic agents. The
      alteration of gene expression in these cells caused by tumor necrosis factor is being
      studied. Additionally, the tumor necrosis factor-induced biochemical pathways involved in
      protection of human hematopoietic progenitor cells will be studied.
