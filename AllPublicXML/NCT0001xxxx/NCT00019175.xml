      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from an antigen combined with a modified virus may make the body
      build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white
      blood cells to kill melanoma cells. Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to compare the effectiveness of vaccine therapy with or without
      interleukin-2 in treating patients who have recurrent metastatic melanoma that has not
      responded to previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the toxicity, immunologic reactivity, and possible therapeutic
      efficacy of immunization with recombinant fowlpox virus encoding the gp100 melanoma antigen
      administered alone or with interleukin-2 in patients with metastatic melanoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive recombinant fowlpox virus encoding
      the gp100 melanoma antigen (FPV-gp100) IV or intramuscularly to rotating sites or fowlpox
      virus encoding modified gp100 melanoma antigen IV every 2 weeks for 4 vaccinations. Treatment
      continues for a maximum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression. Cohorts of 3-9
      patients receive escalating doses of FPV-gp100 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients develop
      dose-limiting toxicity. Patients in 3 of 5 cohorts also receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) within
      12 hours of FPV-gp100. One cohort receives IL-2 subcutaneously daily on days 1-5 and days
      8-12. A second cohort receives low-dose IL-2 IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours on days 2-8. A
      third cohort receives high-dose IL-2 IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours on days 2-6. Patients
      in cohorts 4 and 5 receive FPV-gp100 alone and, if no response is observed after 2 courses,
      may receive 2 courses of IL-2 alone every 8 hours for 5 days, approximately 2 weeks apart. A
      separate cohort of 3-9 patients receives modified FPV-gp100. If no response is observed after
      2 courses, IL-2 may be administered as in cohorts 4 and 5. Patients are followed at 28 days
      after the second immunization with FPV-gp100.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 91 patients will be accrued for this study.
