  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep venous thrombosis is the presence of blood clots, usually in the legs that lead to
      either local problems or breathing problems if the clot moves to the lungs. This study is
      designed to assess both clinical conditions as well as common genetic factors that lead to
      more risk of deep venous thrombosis. Clinical conditions of venous thrombosis include:
      stroke, malignancy, and situations such as surgery, pregnancy, trauma, or travel.
