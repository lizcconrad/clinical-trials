      The purpose of this CREST (Clinical Rapid Evaluation Screening Trial) study is the use of
      tiagabine, sertraline, or donepezil for the treatment of cocaine dependence using a modified
      placebo-controlled experimental design.

    <textblock>
      Considerable progress in preclinical research has provided a basis for hypothesis driven
      clinical trials in cocaine dependence. A greater mechanistic understanding of both cocaine
      and many clinically approved medications has led to the identification of many promising
      medications for the treatment of cocaine dependence.

      For this reason NIDA has developed a CREST (Clinical Rapid Evaluation Screening Trial)
      protocol to provide a needed incremental medication screening step between preclinical
      research and full blown expensive Phase III pivotal trials. While patients receive manual
      based psychotherapy, three medications are screened compared to unmatched placebo in an
      eight-week, 80-subject, four cell design trial. Other important features of the CREST
      protocol include collecting baseline measurements over a two week period and analyzing
      primary outcome measures (quantitative urine toxicology and clinical global improvement
      scales) in terms of a composite score of overall individual patient improvement.

      The three medications being evaluated in this trial include tiagabine, sertraline, and
      donepzil. Tiagabine is hypothesized to interfere with glutamatergic cocaine mechanisms
      relevant to addiction. Sertraline is a potent and selective inhibitor of neuronal 5-HT
      reuptake, which may modulate the reinforcing and cueing effects of cocaine. Donepezil is
      hypothesized to interfere with cholinergic cocaine mechanisms relevant to addiction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females, 18 to 60 years of age.

          2. DSM-IV diagnosis of cocaine dependence as determined by a semi-structured psychiatric
             evaluation.

          3. Use of at least $100 worth of cocaine within the past 30 days.

          4. Substantiated current cocaine use demonstrated by six urine toxicology specimens, two
             of which are positive for BE, in a consecutive two week period during the 30 days
             prior to study entry. No more than 4 specimens within seven days will be collected.

          5. Additional baseline measures must be completed in conjunction with urine specimens
             described in #4, which include: once weekly craving measure (BSCS), Self and Observer
             Global ratings, semiquantitative urine specimen for toxicology of six substances
             (amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methadone, opiates); and three
             times weekly alcohol breathalyzer and Self Report of Drug Use (SUR).

          6. Ability to provide written informed consent and to comply with all study procedures.

          7. Women of child-bearing capacity must be using one of the following acceptable methods
             of birth-control: a. oral contraceptives, b. barrier (diaphragm or condom) with
             spermicide, c. intrauterine progesterone contraceptive system, d. levonorgestrel
             implant, e. medroxyprogesterone acetate contraceptive injection, f.complete abstinence

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Dependence on psychoactive substance other than cocaine, alcohol, or nicotine.
             Physiological dependence on alcohol requiring medical detox.

          2. Neurological or psychiatric disorders which require treatment or which would make
             medication compliance difficult.

          3. Serious medical illnesses that may compromise patient safety or study conduct.

          4. Receiving a drug with known potential for toxicity to a major organ system within the
             month prior to entering treatment or being on any experimental medication within the
             past 60 days.

          5. Women who are pregnant, lactating, have had three or more days of amenorrhea beyond
             the time of expected menses at the time of the first dose of study medication.

          6. Women of childbearing capacity who are not on a medically accepted method of birth
             control.

          7. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values.

          8. Any disease of the gastrointestinal system, liver, or kidneys which could result in
