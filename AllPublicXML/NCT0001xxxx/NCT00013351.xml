  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between Useful Field of Vision (UFOV) and falls taken by the elderly will be
      investigated. UFOV is a test which measures visual attention. The test has been used in
      correlating the visual attention in the elderly with their driving safety record. The test is
      administered using a computer and consists of three parts: a) subject views figures which
      appear in the center of the computer screen and identified them as quickly as possible; b)the
      subject has to identify figures in the center of the screen while at the same time point to
      another symbol which will appear in one of eight places on the outer portion of the screen;
      c) the third section is similar to the second except while the subject is identifying and
      pointing there is a background noise.
