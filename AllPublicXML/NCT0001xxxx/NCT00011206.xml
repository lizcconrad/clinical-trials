    <textblock>
      To extend mortality followup through 25 years for two cohorts of men in the Multiple Risk
      Factor intervention Trial (MRFIT): the 361,662 men screened and the 12,866 men randomized,
      and to pursue the general aim of elucidating unresolved research issues on the epidemiology,
      natural history, etiology, prevention, and control of major chronic diseases, particularly
      cardiovascular and neoplastic diseases and diabetes.

      BACKGROUND:

      MRFIT was initiated in 1972 as a randomized, multicenter primary prevention trial designed to
      determine whether a special intervention consisting of smoking cessation, cholesterol
      reduction and control of high blood pressure, would result in a significant reduction in
      coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality, compared to usual care. Follow-up and analysis has
      continued on the 361,662 men screened and the 12,866 men randomized.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The National Death Index (NDI) will be used for continued follow-up of the MRFIT cohorts. An
      additional assay to establish IGF-1 and IGF binding protein will be added to the data set as
      a potential prognostic factor. The effort will focus on three primary aims related to
      long-term mortality. Aim 1 will relate nutritional-dietary data to twenty-five year mortality
      from coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, cardiovascular disease (CVD), colon cancer,
      prostate cancer, and all causes for the 12,866 men randomized. Aim 2 will relate age,
      ethnicity, socioeconomic position, geographic location, major risk factors, low risk status,
      prior diabetes, and prior myocardial infarction to twenty-five year mortality for the 361,662
      men screened. Aim 3 will relate insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF binding protein,
      and fasting and one-hour glucose measurements from frozen baseline sera to mortality for the
      12,866 men randomized.
