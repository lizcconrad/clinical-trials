  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is the second most common rheumatic disorder, affecting approximately 8-10
      million persons in the U.S., and is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and soft
      tissue tenderness upon examination. This study focuses on the use of acupuncture as a mode of
      therapy for fibromyalgia. The issues under examination are: 1) the optimal duration of
      treatment, 2) the independent and synergistic effects of needle placement and needle
      stimulation, and 3) appropriate control strategies. The proposal utilizes a randomized,
      blinded, sham-controlled design to achieve these aims. Subjects are randomly assigned to one
      of four groups: 1)active site with stimulation, 2) active site, without stimulation, 3) sham
      site with stimulation, and 4) sham site, without stimulation. All subjects will receive
      acupuncture at escalating frequency, beginning at once per week and ending at 3 times per
      week. This &quot;forced titration&quot; design allows for the detection of inter-subject differences in
      responsiveness to acupuncture, as well as the factors which may predict responsiveness (or
      lack thereof). Secondary goals of the study are to collect data on the mechanism, safety, and
      cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in fibromyalgia, and to determine the optimal outcome
      measures, for a full scale research clinical trial.
