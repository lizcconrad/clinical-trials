      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bevacizumab in treating patients who have
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab may stop the growth of
      cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Bevacizumab may be an effective treatment for
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the 6-month progression-free survival rate in patients with relapsed
      aggressive NHL treated with single agent bevacizumab therapy.

      II. To evaluate response rate and toxicity in patients with relapsed aggressive NHL treated
      with this regimen.

      III. To measure tumor VEGF and VEGF receptor 1 and 2 expression (Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR) and to
      explore the correlation between expression level and histology and response.

      IV. To measure pre-therapy, week 8 and time to progression biologic measures of VEGF activity
      including plasma VEGF levels, urinary VEGF levels, and circulating number of endothelial
      cells and explore the correlation with response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for a maximum of 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have biopsy proven relapsed (first or second relapse) non-Hodgkin's
             lymphoma, aggressive histology of one of the following histologic subtypes;
             transformed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients are not eligible for this study:

               -  Diffuse large (formerly Working Formulation Groups F, G, H)

               -  High-grade, Burkitt's or Burkitt-like

               -  Primary mediastinal

               -  Anaplastic large cell

               -  Mantle cell

               -  Note: patients being registered to this study at first relapse must not be
                  suitable for transplant or aggressive treatment at first relapse

          -  Patients must have measurable disease; all techniques used to measure disease must be
             completed within 28 days prior to registration and must have been done after
             completion of prior therapy

          -  Patients must have had a chest x-ray or CT scan of the chest and a CT scan of the
             abdomen and pelvis within 28 days prior to registration and they must have been done
             after completion of prior chemotherapy

          -  Patients must have either a unilateral or bilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsy
             within 42 days prior to registration

          -  Patients must have had 1 or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens (pre-induction and
             autologous bone marrow transplantation will be considered as one prior therapy) for
             lymphoma; this includes investigational agents and/or other antibody therapies; all
             prior therapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to registration; due to
             possible interactions with the rituximab antibody; patients previously receiving
             rituximab must have completed rituximab therapy at least 12 weeks prior to
             registration; if rituximab is given as a single agent after a relapse, it is
             considered a separate regimen and will be counted as such; if the rituximab is given
             in combination for either the first or second relapse or as consolidation after
             chemotherapy regimen without an intervening relapse, it will be considered part of the
             combination regimen and counted as one prior therapy; patients must have recovered
             from any chemotherapy-related toxicities prior to registration

          -  Patient must not have undergone major surgery within 4 weeks prior to registration
             (this does not apply to placement of venous access device) or received any
             radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to registration

          -  Patients must not be receiving or planning to receive oral steroids for any condition
             at the time of registration; use of a steroid inhaler or nasal spray is allowed

          -  Patients must not require chronic use of oral or parenteral anticoagulants (other than
             that used to maintain patency of an indwelling IV catheter) or anti-platelet therapy &gt;
             325 mg per day of aspirin

          -  Patients must not have any acute healing bone fracture

          -  Patients must not have a history of uncontrolled seizures

          -  A pretreatment sample of plasma whole blood, bone marrow (if there is bone marrow
             involvement with lymphoma) urine and unstained diagnostic paraffin slides must be
             submitted for correlative studies)

          -  All patients must have a performance status of 0, 1 or 2 according to Zubrod criteria

          -  Patients must not have central nervous system involvement with lymphoma

          -  ANC &gt;= 500

          -  Platelets &gt;= 75,000

          -  Hematocrit &gt;= 28%

          -  Prothrombin time (PT) =&lt; 2 seconds of the institutional upper limit of normal (IULN)

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 mg/dl or measured creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min

          -  Patients must have a 24 hour proteinuria =&lt; 500mg/24hours

          -  Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl

          -  SGOT/SGPT =&lt; 5 x IULN for subjects with documented liver metastasis or &lt; 2.5 x IULN
             for subjects without evidence of liver metastasis

          -  Patients must not have uncompensated coronary artery disease on electrocardiogram or
             physical exam, or history of previous thromboembolic events, including transient
             ischemic attack (TIA), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), myocardial infarction (MI),
             unstable angina, or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation in the past 6 months

          -  Patients must not have uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Patients must not have clinical evidence of peripheral vascular disease, diabetic
             ulcers or venous stasis, ulcers, or a history of deep venous or arterial thrombosis

          -  No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous
             cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has
             been disease-free for 5 years

          -  If day 1, 28, or 42 falls on a weekend of holiday, the limit may be extended to the
             next working day; in calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or
             measurement is done is considered day 0; therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the
             Monday 2 weeks later would be considered day 14; this allows for efficient patient
             scheduling without exceeding the guidelines

          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and give
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines

          -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and ID number
             must be provided to the statistical center in order to ensure that the current (within
             365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study has been entered
             into the database
