      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the amount of hepatic glucose production derived from gluconeogenesis and
      glycogenolysis in the post-absorptive state in patients with cystic fibrosis.

      II. Determine de novo lipogenesis in relationship to resting energy expenditure in this
      patient population.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in which blood is drawn from an IV in
      the arm 6 times over 3 hours. After the first blood draw, patients receive a beverage
      containing sugar and write down everything they ate and drank during the 24 hours before
      study entry. Patients also undergo a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan over 15
      minutes.

      Within 2 weeks after the OGTT, patients keep a journal of everything they ate and drank over
      3 days. Patients are fed a selected meal the following evening and receive saline fluids IV
      overnight. During the night, patients receive 2 doses of oral doubly labeled water. The next
      morning, patients receive [1,2-13C]acetate IV. A liquid mixed meal (Ensure Plus) is ingested
      hourly throughout the day. Patients also undergo hood indirect calorimetry over 30 minutes
      twice to measure resting energy expenditure. All urine is collected.
