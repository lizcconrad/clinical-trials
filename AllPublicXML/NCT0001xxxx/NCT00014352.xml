      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.
      Anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin may reduce the risk of blood clots.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus warfarin
      in treating patients who have prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, efficacy, and durability of docetaxel and estramustine
      followed by doxorubicin and ketoconazole in patients with high-risk, androgen-independent
      prostate cancer. II. Determine whether anticoagulation with warfarin can reduce the frequency
      of thromboembolic complications associated with estramustine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Regimen A: Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5 and
      docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 3 weekly. Patients also receive oral warfarin daily.
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Regimen B: After completion of regimen A, patients
      receive doxorubicin IV over 30 minutes weekly and oral ketoconazole twice daily. Treatment
      repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed monthly until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed prostate cancer High risk as defined by
        any 2 of the following: Karnofsky performance status of 70-80% Lactate dehydrogenase
        greater than 200 U/mL Hemoglobin less than 13 g/dL Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at least
        4 ng/mL Progressive disease based on any 1 of the following: Rise in PSA level of at least
        25% above baseline At least 3 determinations taken at weekly intervals OR At least 2
        determinations taken at monthly intervals New or progressive soft tissue masses on MRI or
        CT scan Radionucleotide bone scan with new metastatic lesion(s) Serum testosterone no
        greater than 30 ng/mL If no prior surgical orchiectomy, castrate levels of serum
        testosterone must be maintained with continuation of gonadotropin releasing hormone analogs
        If receiving an anti-androgen, must show progression of disease after stopping
        anti-androgen therapy
