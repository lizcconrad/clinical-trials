      The purpose of this CREST (Clinical Rapid Evaluation Screening Trial) study is the treatment
      of cocaine dependence using reserpine, gabapentin, or lamotrigine vs. an unmatched placebo
      control.

    <textblock>
      Considerable progress in preclinical research has provided a basis for hypothesis driven
      clinical trials in cocaine dependence. A greater mechanistic understanding of both cocaine
      and many clinically approved medications has led to the identification of many promising
      medications for the treatment of cocaine dependence.

      For this reason NIDA has developed a CREST (Clinical Rapid Evaluation Screening Trial)
      protocol to provide a needed incremental medication screening step between preclinical
      research and full blown expensive Phase III pivotal trials. While patients receive manual
      based psychotherapy, three medications are screened compared to unmatched placebo in an
      eight-week, 60-subject, four cell design trial. Other important features of the CREST
      protocol include collecting baseline measurements over a two week period and analyzing
      primary outcome measures (quantitative urine toxicology and clinical global improvement
      scales) in terms of a composite score of overall individual patient improvement.

      The three medications being evaluated in this trial include reserpine, gabapentin and
      lamotrigine. Reserpine is being screened because of its well-known preclinical ability to
      functionally antagonize cocaine (by depleting neurochemicals elevated by cocaine). Gabapentin
      and lamotrigine are hypothesized to interfere with glutamatergic cocaine
      sensitization/kindling mechanisms relevant to addiction.

          1. Males and females, 18 to 59 years of age.

          2. DSM-IV diagnosis of cocaine dependence as determine by a semi-structured clinical
             interview.

          3. Subjects must have at least two cocaine-positive urines (BE level &gt;300 ng/ml) during
             the two week screening phase of the study.

          4. Subjects must have a self reported use of at least $100 worth of cocaine within the
             past 30 days.

          5. Ability to provide written informed consent and to comply with all study procedures.

          6. Women of child-bearing capacity must be using one of the following acceptable methods
             of birth-control: a. oral contraceptives, b. barrier (diaphragm or condom) with
             spermicide, c. intrauterine progesterone contraceptive system, d. levonorgestrel
             implant, e. medroxyprogesterone acetate contraceptive injection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current dependence on any psychoactive substance other than cocaine, alcohol, or
             nicotine, physiological dependence on alcohol requiring medical detoxification.

          2. Subjects requiring treatment for neurological or psychiatric disorders.

          3. Subjects with any potentially life threatening or progressive medical illness other
             than addiction.

          4. Subjects with a history of hypertension currently requiring treatment.

          5. Subjects who have received a drug with known potential for toxicity to a major organ
             system within the month prior to entering treatment or who have been on any
             experimental medication within the past 60 days.

          6. Females who are pregnant or lactating or having had three or more days of amenorrhea
             beyond the time of expected menses at the time of the first dose of study medication.

             the principal investigator.

          8. Subjects who have any disease of the gastrointestinal system, liver, or kidneys which
             could result in altered metabolism or excretion of the study medication.
