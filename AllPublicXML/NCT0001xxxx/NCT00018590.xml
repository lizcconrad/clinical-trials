  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a working registry of a longitudinal cohort of Hispanics, Native Americans, and
      non-Hispanic whites (as controls) for tracking of vascular disease endpoints. Blood samples
      collected for ongoing pilot projects as well as specimen banking. Pilot studies are
      observational and involve risk measures for stroke, atherosclerosis, and vascular
      inflammatory responses. Questionnaires on demographics, risk factors, and vascular disease
      history are performed. No interventions proposed as yet.
