      This study will determine the best ways to collect, process and store umbilical cord blood
      from babies with sickle cell disease, sickle cell trait and unaffected babies. Sickle cell
      disease is an abnormality of the hemoglobin in red blood cells that causes the cells to
      change shape and clump together, preventing their normal flow in the bloodstream. This
      impairs blood flow to various organs, and the resulting oxygen deprivation causes organ
      damage.

      Cord blood is rich in stem cells (cells produced in the bone marrow that mature to different
      types of blood cells), which may prove useful in new sickle cell therapies. However, cord
      blood from babies with sickle cell trait, sickle cell disease and normal babies may act
      differently under laboratory conditions, so it is important to learn how best to work with
      blood from all three groups of babies for future use in possible treatments.

      Pregnant women between 18 and 45 years of age who are at risk of having an infant with sickle
      cell disease and normal volunteers who are pregnant and not at risk for this disease may be
      eligible for this study. Potential participants will be counseled about donating her infant s
      blood in order to make an informed choice.

      All women who participate in the study will provide a medical history and have blood
      collected from the umbilical cord and placenta (afterbirth) after the baby s delivery. The
      blood will be tested for various infectious diseases, processed, frozen and stored for
      research purposes. In addition, blood from women with babies at risk for sickle cell disease
      will be tested for the presence of the sickle cell gene, tissue typed, and used for research
      as follows:

        -  Sickle cell disease If cord blood tests show the baby has sickle cell disease, the blood
           will be frozen for an indefinite period of time for possible use in future treatment of
           the child. This treatment could include stem cell transplantation or gene therapy,
           treatments are not currently considered routine for sickle cell disease.

        -  Sickle cell trait or normal hemoglobin If cord blood tests show the baby has sickle cell
           trait or is unaffected, the blood will be processed and stored for up to 3 years, during
           which time it may possibly be used to treat a currently living or future sibling with
           sickle cell disease. After 3 years, the participant may agree to either have the blood
           discarded, given to research or moved to another facility for continued storage at the
           participant s expense, if there is a storage fee. Alternatively, if there is no
           anticipated future need for the collected blood, or if it does not meet standards needed
           for future treatment, it will be used in NIH-approved research studies.

      Participants and their family doctor or the baby s pediatrician will be contacted twice a
      year for information about changes in the baby s health. Participants may also be asked
      permission to perform new tests developed by researchers.

      Umbilical cord blood is a source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for transplantation or
      gene therapy. Our goal is to procure umbilical cord blood (UCB) from newborns at risk for
      sickle cell disease, sickle cell trait, and related disorders as well as normal newborns, for
      our controls, in order to develop methods for processing and cryopreservation of umbilical
      cord blood HSCs for use in future clinical transplantation or gene therapy. In order to carry
      out our methods development research umbilical cord blood units will be collected from an
      indefinite number of subjects until 30 cord blood units from newborns with sickle cell
      disease have been cryopreserved. These units will be stored for future gene therapy. Maternal
      subjects will have been identified as being at risk to have an infant with sickle cell
      disease, will be between the ages of 18 and 45, and will meet specified medical history
      criteria. The cord blood units will be tested for transfusion transmissible viruses,
      infectious disease markers, Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing, Hemoglobin genotyping, and
      enumeration of progenitor cells. The umbilical cord blood units will be used for the
      developmental research on processing/cryopreservation methods but, once processed and stored,
      may also be identified for future clinical use or for basic or translational research by NIH
      investigators.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Pregnant women who are at risk of having an infant with sickle cell anemia (HbSS), as well
        as woman who are not at risk and wish to serve as control subjects, will be identified and
        referred by their health care providers or will be self-referred.

        Maternal subjects must be between 18 and 45 years old, may be in their first or subsequent
        pregnancy, and must be able to provide informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The maternal subject will not be eligible for study if she is known to be positive for one
        or more of the following diseases transmissible by blood: HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or
        HTLV; is unable to give informed consent; or is known to have a fetus with a significant
        congenital anomaly.

        Subjects may be excluded at the time of delivery if the attending physician or collection
        staff, due to unanticipated obstetrical complications, deems cord blood collection
        inadvisable.
