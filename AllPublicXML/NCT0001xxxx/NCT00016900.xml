      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of PNU-93914 in treating patients who have
      locally advanced or metastatic cancer of the esophagus.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the antitumor activity and duration of activity of PNU-93914 in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal carcinoma. II. Determine the
      objective tumor response rate and tumor response duration in patients treated with this drug.
      III. Determine the survival of patients treated with this drug. IV. Determine the safety
      profile of this drug in these patients. V. Determine the effect of this drug on the quality
      of life of these patients. VI. Determine the time to tumor response, time to tumor
      progression, and time to treatment failure in patients treated with this drug. VII. Evaluate
      the change in dysphagia score in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive PNU-93914 IV over 60 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, day 1 of each course, and
      then at the final study visit. Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-41 patients will be accrued for this study.
