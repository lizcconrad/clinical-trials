      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of three antioxidant regimens in
      treating the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune mediated disease of the central nervous system that
      affects over 350,000 Americans. T lymphocytes, macrophages and soluble mediators of
      inflammation cause demyelination and axonal injury in MS. Activated macrophages release
      nitric oxide and oxygen free radicals that cause demyelination and axonal injury in MS and
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Natural antioxidants may favorably influence
      the course of MS by decreasing oxidative injury. Chronic relapsing EAE in mouse models is
      clinically and pathologically useful for testing potential therapies for MS.

      This study will assess three natural antioxidant regimens for their potential as treatments
      for MS: Ginkgo biloba, alpha-lipoic acid/essential fatty acids, and vitamin E/selenium. The
      effects of each regimen will be compared to determine which regimen appears most effective at
      suppressing EAE and decreasing markers of oxidative injury in patients with MS. As part of
      this study, two smaller trials will be conducted. A Phase I/II trial in patients with MS will
      determine if the selected antioxidant regimen can decrease disease activity as detected with
      gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. The results of this study will serve as the
      basis for a Phase III trial to assess the long term effectiveness of natural antioxidant
      therapy in MS.
