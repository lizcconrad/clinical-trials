      Control of the blood sugar prevents complications and results in extra years of life in
      patients with diabetes. Practice Guidelines delineating specific ways physicians manage
      diabetes have been outlined. Missing are guidelines for health care providers to encourage
      patients to take responsibility for their diabetes. Traditional patient education models have
      been ineffective in managing diabetic persons because they have relied upon information given
      alone and are disease centered rather than patient centered. This study will explore the role
      of self-efficacy in helping veterans move toward healthy behaviors.

      Background:

      Control of the blood sugar prevents complications and results in extra years of life in
      patients with diabetes. Practice Guidelines delineating specific ways physicians manage
      diabetes have been outlined. Missing are guidelines for health care providers to encourage
      patients to take responsibility for their diabetes. Traditional patient education models have
      been ineffective in managing diabetic persons because they have relied upon information given
      alone and are disease centered rather than patient centered. This study will explore the role
      of self-efficacy in helping veterans move toward healthy behaviors.

      Objectives:

      The long-term objectives are to: 1) increase recognition of veteranï¿½s responsibility for
      health; 2) develop more effective skills in managing chronic conditions; and 3) explore the
      role of self-efficacy in facilitating improvements in health behaviors and health care
      utilization.

      Methods:

      This is a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial of 2,068 cognitively intact,
      diabetic veterans. The outcome measures (health behaviors, self-efficacy, health status and
      health care utilization) will be measured using self-rated scales developed and tested by
      Lorig and colleagues from Stanford University. Glucose levels and BMI changes will be
      evaluated using information documented in the medical record.

      Status:

      Enrollment (a total of 326 patients) is closed. All necessary data have been received and are
      being analyzed.
