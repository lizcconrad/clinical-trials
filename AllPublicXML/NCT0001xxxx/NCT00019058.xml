      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs such as
      pentoxifylline and hydroxyurea may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus pentoxifylline
      and hydroxyurea in treating patients who have high-grade astrocytoma or glioblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of pentoxifylline administered with
      hydroxyurea during a course of cranial radiotherapy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.
      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Measure PTX levels in
      plasma and CSF in order to assess whether therapeutic drug exposures (e.g., 0.4-2.0 mM/24
      hours) can be achieved with an acceptable level of toxicity. IV. Assess the local control of
      glioblastoma in patients treated with this regimen. V. Determine the response of surrounding
      normal brain in patients treated with this regimen. VI. Determine the survival of patients
      treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of pentoxifylline (PTX). Patients receive
      hydroxyurea (HU) and PTX IV continuously 5 days a week concurrently with cranial radiotherapy
      twice daily, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. The first cohort of 3 patients is treated with radiotherapy and HU alone.
      Subsequent cohorts of 3-6 patients receive HU and radiotherapy plus escalating doses of PTX
      until the maximum tolerated dose of PTX is determined or serum or CSF drug concentrations
      reach 0.4-2.0 mM in 6 consecutive patients with acceptable toxicity. The MTD is defined as
      the dose immediately preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 week, at 1 and 3 months, every 3 months for 2 years, and
      then every 4 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24-34 patients will be accrued for this study.
