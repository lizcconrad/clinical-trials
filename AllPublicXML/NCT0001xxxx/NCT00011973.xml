      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of fenretinide in treating patients who
      have advanced kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with
           fenretinide.

        -  Determine progression-free and overall survival of this patient population treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral fenretinide twice a day for 7 days. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-21
      months.
