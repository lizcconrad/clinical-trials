  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at investigating specific pharmacological interventions in the treatment
      of the disruptive, agitated behavior associated with Alzheimer's patients. In addition, it is
      hoped that specific clinical profiles will be found to predict which treatment is most
      effective for these particular patients.

      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, the fourth leading cause of
      death, and has enormous economic and emotional costs for caregivers of patients. Most of the
      patients with AD develop disruptive, agitated behaviors at some point during the ailment that
      are a common catalyst for placement in long-term care settings where they represent more than
      half of all the residents. Disruptive behaviors create stress for both staff and patients in
      long-term care settings, reduce patient quality of life because of excess use of physical
      restraints, and drain the financial resources of the facilities. This study proposes to
      design specific interventions designed to decrease disruptive, agitated behavior in patients
      with AD residing in long-term care facilities. This 12-week study will assess the efficacy of
      two pharmacological agents, an atypical neuroleptic (risperidone) and an anticonvulsant and
      mood stabilizer (gabapentin) while identifying moderators of differential treatment response
      to the two drugs. Specifically, this study aims to randomize 130 patients with AD who are
      manifesting agitated disruptive behavior, into two groups of 65 patients each, with one group
      receiving risperidone and the other gabapentin. There are two main hypotheses: 1) Patients in
      both of the treatment groups will manifest different overall group decreases in ratings of
      disruptive, agitated behavior; and 2) Measurable, clinical characteristics will identify
      subgroups of subjects with differential treatment response to the two medications. The two
      variables to be considered as moderators are as follows: a) Patients with higher psychosis
      ratings will manifest greater responsivity to risperidone compared to gabapentin, and b)
      Patients with high levels of affective lability will manifest greater responsivity to
      gabapentin compared to risperidone.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Diagnosis of probable AD according to DSM-IV, which show high agreement with
             NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al., 1984); kappa = 0.81 (Chui et al., in press).

          2. At least a two-week history of two or more agitated behaviors from the Agitation
             Screening Inventory (a shortened version of the 24-item Revised Memory and Behavior
             Problem Checklist) (RMBPC; Teri at al., 1992), occurring at least once weekly, and
             rated by the caregiver or nursing staff as at least moderately distressing.

          3. Not planning a change in living situation or placement during the investigational
             period.

          4. Stability (of dose and type) of medications for nonexcluded concurrent medical
             conditions (i.e. thyroid disease, anemia, cardiac disease) for four weeks prior to
             baseline.

          5. Ability to ingest oral medications and participate in all scheduled evaluations.

          6. A sixth grade education or a work history sufficient to exclude mental retardation.

          7. 50 years of age or older.

          8. Medically acceptable for experimental drugs as confirmed by physical evaluation and
             laboratory tests.

          9. Modified Hachinski Scale score of 4 or less.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Neurological diagnoses other than AD which affect cognitive function. These include
             Parkinson?s Disease, tumors, hydrocephalus, history of significant trauma, and seizure
             disorder).

          2. A diagnosis of delirium by the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM, Inouye et al., 1990).

          3. A diagnosis of dementia related to infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             or amnestic disorder, as defined by DSM-IV.

          4. Known hypersensitivity to risperidone or gabapentin.

          5. Alcohol or drug abuse within the past year.

          6. Serious, unstable medical illnesses (e.g., unstable angina, poorly controlled diabetes
             mellitus, labile hypertension)

          7. Any medical problem that would cause or exacerbate agitated behaviors (including
             unstable thyroid dysfunction, electrolyte disturbances, urinary tract infection, fecal
             impaction, respiratory disease complicated by hypoxia or hypercapnia, etc.)

          8. Any psychotropic medications or other medications which may cause or exacerbate
             agitated behavior. Patients taking these medications may participate in the study if
             the drugs can be successfully discontinued during the washout period and the remainder
             of the study, and if after discontinuation they still meet inclusion criteria for the
             investigation. Excluded medications include: antipsychotics; antidepressants;
             anxiolytics; CNS stimulants; anti convulsants; and sedative hypnotics.

          9. Significantly abnormal laboratory findings.

         10. Significantly abnormal EKG findings.

         11. Conditions such as blindness, deafness, or other disability that may prevent the
             patient from participating in the study.

         12. Current participation in any other investigational drug study or treatment.
