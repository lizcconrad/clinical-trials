  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Water method with water exchange has been shown to reduce medication requirement and pain
      experienced during colonoscopy. It increases the success rate of cecal intubation in sedated
      and unsedated patients undergoing screening colonoscopy. Exchange of water during scope
      insertion minimizes distension of the colonic lumen and decreases loop formation. Exclusion
      of air from the colon during insertion by omission of air insufflations and suction removal
      of residual air prevent elongation of the colon. These maneuvers facilitate colonoscopy
      insertion in average patients and may enhance the success of difficult colonoscopy.

      Female gender and low-body mass index (BMI) is independently associated with incomplete
      colonoscopy, respectively. The investigators postulate that low-BMI female patients may
      benefit from using the water method for colonoscopy. In this proposal the investigators test
      the hypothesis that compared with conventional air insufflations the water method with water
      exchange significantly enhances the success rate of cecal intubation in low-BMI female
      patients.

      The aim of the study is to compare the outcome of colonoscopy using the water method versus
      the conventional air method in low-BMI female patients. The primary outcome is cecal
      intubation success rate. The secondary outcomes include cecal intubation time, maximum pain
      score during colonoscopy, overall pain score after colonoscopy and adenoma detection rate.

    <description>Colonoscopy will be performed without medications and aided by water infusion in-lieu of air insufflation during insertion of the colonoscope. The water infusion involves putting warm sterile water into the colon to open up the colon for advancement of the colonoscope until the end of the colon (cecum) is reached. The water is delivered through scope irrigation channel by an infusion pump equipped with a foot switch which will be controlled by the endoscopist. Infused water used to cleanse residual fecal matter will be suctioned as needed to clear the colonic lumen.</description>
