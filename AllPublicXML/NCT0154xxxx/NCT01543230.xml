    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this investigation is to evaluate survivorship at ten years. For
      this post approval study (PAS), a maximum acceptable hazard of revision is assumed to be a
      constant 1% per year.

      This is a retrospective and prospective, non-randomized study of the Ceramic on Metal(CoM)
      device. This study will follow each subject through 10 years postoperatively. A total of 250
      subjects will be enrolled in the investigation comprised of approximately 150 new PAS
      subjects and approximately 100 subjects recruited from the investigational device exemption
      study to the PAS.

    <description>Subjects will be seen each year through year 5 postoperatively for radiographic and clinical follow-up, and then at 8 and 10 years postoperatively for radiographic and clinical follow-up. Survivorship means the removal of either or both of the components (ceramic head or metal liner).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. If the subject:

               1. Was previously enrolled in the CoM IDE study with the Ceramic-on- Metal device,
                  or

               2. Qualifies based on the approved labeling for the device; and

          -  2. Is willing and able to provide informed patient consent for participation in the
             PAS study; and

          -  3. Is willing and able to return for follow-up as specified by the PAS study protocol;
             and

          -  4. Is willing and able to complete the hip outcomes questionnaire as specified by the
             PAS study protocol. A patient will be considered a &quot;Valid Study Subject&quot; when he/she
