    <time_frame>One Cycle of 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be administered ME-344 IV infusions weekly for 3 weeks during the first 28 days cycle for dose limiting toxicity. Patients will be assessed by physical exam, vital signs, hematology and clinical chemistry, urinalysis, ECG, echocardiogram and pharmacokinetic sampling.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline and a minimum of every 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Radiologic assessments will be performed at baseline and a minimum of every 12 weeks. Patients may continue weekly dosing if there is clinical beneficial determined by the Investigator.</description>

    <description>experimental drug, dose escalation with 5 planned dose cohorts of 1.2 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg; Cycle 1 is 3 weekly IV infusions on Days 1, 8, and 15. After safety assessment, if there is clinical benefit, weekly dosing may continue until withdrawal.
Once the highest tolerated dose has been determined, patients will be enrolled to receive IV infusions 2 days each week. Cycle 1 at the highest dose level is 3 weekly IV infusions on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16. After safety assessment, if there is clinical benefit, weekly dosing may continue until withdrawal.</description>
