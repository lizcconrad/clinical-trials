  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propofol is a commonly used agent for sedation and anaesthesia in the intensive care unit and
      the operating room. The pharmacokinetics of propofol are difficult to predict in patients not
      conforming to the norms in which the original pharmacokinetic research was based. Such
      patients, including the critically ill, and morbidly obese, are increasingly being
      encountered. The investigators group have been involved in the development of a device which
      can measure blood propofol concentrations, and hope for this to be available to use in the
      operating room in a clinically useful timeframe in the future. Data will be collected on
      patients undergoing propofol based general anaesthesia. The Marsh target controlled algorithm
      in effect site mode (commonly used by anaesthetists) will be assessed for accuracy using the
      propofol monitor. A new proportional correction method will be developed using this data,
      designed to enable recalibration of the TCI algorithm in near real time in order to achieve a
      more accurate estimated propofol concentration in these identified patient groups. The
      research will investigate the effectiveness of a correction of estimated propofol levels
      based on a one off measurement early on in the anaesthetic, and will take subsequent samples
      to measure propofol levels without modifying the TCI algorithm. Additionally, data on
      anaesthetist choice of TCI model, and method of administration in this relatively unselected
      group of patients will be analysed.
