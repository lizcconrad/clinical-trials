      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of Cre8 (CID) Drug Eluting
      Stent, studied 3 months after implant, compared to Vision/Multilink8 Bare Metal Stent
      (Abbott) studied at 1 month, in terms of neointimal coverage, determined by Optical Coherence
      Tomography (OCT), as percentage of cross-sections with RUTTS (Ratio of Uncovered to Total
      Stent Struts Per Cross Section) score ≤ 0.3.
