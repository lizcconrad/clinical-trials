      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate improved vein graft patency rates at 12 months
      for endoscopically harvested saphenous vein grafts. The study will evaluate use modifications
      to existing techniques in vein graft handling during harvests. A secondary aim is to develop
      a standardized approach for harvesting, handling, and preparing vein grafts in the endoscopic
      approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Available data supports two facts: 1) Saphenous vein graft failure rates may be as high as
      47% per patient at one year post coronary artery bypass grafting, and 2) Endoscopic
      vein-graft harvesting is independently associated with vein-graft failure and adverse
      clinical outcomes.

      Multiple factors may contribute to the lower long term patency rates of endoscopically
      harvested grafts. Summarized, the two major contributing factors are theorized to be
      harvesting techniques and vein trauma during harvesting.

      With recognized disadvantages of open vessel harvesting including higher incidence of
      infection, longer incisions, greater potential for poor healing, and longer length of
      hospital stay, reducing the failure rate of vein grafts harvested endoscopically is of utmost
      importance.

      It is our hypothesis that modification of existing harvesting techniques can improve vein
      graft patency in endoscopic vein graft harvesting so that patency rates comparable to open
      vessel harvesting can be obtained.

      In this prospective, multi-center non-randomized, observational study, 100 patients will
      undergo routine coronary artery bypass grafting. Eligible candidates will undergo lone
      coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures with endoscopic vein graft harvesting using
      best harvesting practices. As a part of routine postoperative care, patients will be
      prescribed dual-antiplatelet therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel. Compliance with 3 months of
      dual-antiplatelet therapy will be monitored.

      Vein graft patency will be evaluated:

        1. Intra-operatively by transit time graft flow measurements.

        2. Post-operative Day 30 through Cardiac CT Angiography.

        3. Post-operative Month 12 through Cardiac CT Angiography.
