    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness (good
      and bad effects) of a combination of three different drugs, pomalidomide, pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin, and dexamethasone when used to treat relapsed (the disease came back) or
      refractory (the disease did not respond to past treatment) multiple myeloma. Different
      dosages (amount of study drug) of pomalidomide are first being tested to determine if there
      are any side effects or risks associated with combining this study drug with the other two
      listed. Once the optimal dose is decided on, the study will change its focus to determining
      the effectiveness of the study drug in this combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2, multicenter, open label and nonrandomized study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of pomalidomide at daily dosages of 2, 3 or 4 mg in combination with intravenous
      (IV) dexamethasone at 40 mg/dose and Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (PLD) at 5 mg/m2/dose
      for subjects with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The study consists of a
      screening period, followed by up to eight 28 day open label treatment cycles, a final
      assessment to occur 28 days after the end of the last treatment, and a follow-up period.

      Subjects eligible for this study will receive treatment with study drug for a maximum of
      eight 28 day treatment cycles. Subjects are to be treated to a maximum response plus 2
      additional cycles (no more than 8 cycles will be allowed) or complete 8 cycles of therapy
      without disease progression.

      Pomalidomide, dexamethasone and PLD will be administered on the appropriate cycle days as
      shown below.

      Cohort 1 Pomalidomide* - 2 mg, Dexamethasone** - 40 mg, PLD** - 5 mg/m2

      Cohort 2 Pomalidomide* - 3 mg, Dexamethasone** - 40 mg, PLD** - 5 mg/m2

      Cohort 3 Pomalidomide* - 4 mg, Dexamethasone** - 40 mg, PLD** - 5 mg/m2

      * PO Days 1-21

      ** IV Days 1, 4, 8 and 11

      In all cohorts, if an unacceptable dose limiting toxicities (DLT) is not seen in any of the 3
      subjects during the first cycle of any dose level, dose escalation will continue. All
      subjects in a cohort must complete a minimum of 28 days or a full cycle, whichever is longer,
      without a DLT before enrollment to the next cohort can begin. If a DLT is identified in 1
      subject at any dose level during the first treatment cycle, an additional 3 subjects will be
      recruited to this dose level. A maximum of 6 subjects may be enrolled in each cohort. If an
      unacceptable DLT is observed in 2 subjects at any dose level, no further subjects will be
      recruited to this dose level. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be declared as the
      highest dose level at which fewer than 33% of subjects experienced an unacceptable DLT. If
      pomalidomide at 4 mg is reached and fewer than 33% of subjects experience an unacceptable
      DLT, 4 mg will be accepted as the putative MTD. Once the MTD is established, further
      enrollment will continue to expand that dose cohort until the total sample size of 40
      subjects is reached for the entire study. During the phase 2 portion of this study, subjects
      enrolled will have relapsed/refractory MM resistant to lenalidomide as demonstrated by
      progressive disease while on lenalidomide or that has relapsed within 8 weeks of the last
      dose of lenalidomide.
