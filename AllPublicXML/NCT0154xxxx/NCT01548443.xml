    <textblock>
      The wound healing efficacy and safety of &quot;Medifoam H&quot; in patients with minor, acute trauma.

      The hypothesis of this study is that using &quot;Medifoam H&quot; dressing for a week is not inferior
      to using &quot;Duoderm THIN&quot; dressing in wound healing.

      This study is single-center, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, Phase IV to evaluate
      clinical efficacy of wound healing and safety of &quot;Medifoam H&quot; in patients with minor, acute
      trauma.

      33 patients of treatment group and 33 patients of control group, total 66 patients will be
      enrolled to this study. Every patient will be treated with &quot;Medifoam H&quot; or &quot;Duoderm THIN&quot; for
      a week. During their participation, patients will visit 2 days and a week after to see
      investigator. Investigator will observe the wound and evaluate amount of exudation, infection
      status, wound healing.
