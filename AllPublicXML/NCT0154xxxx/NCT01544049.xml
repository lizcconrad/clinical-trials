      The purpose of this study is to better understand why women choose to have their fallopian
      tubes removed as a method for ovarian cancer prevention. This will be done through a paper
      questionnaire and phone interviews. The investigators hope to gain information that will
      allow us to better counsel women about ovarian cancer prevention.

      Women will be found eligible for this study after an eligibility questionnaire given over the
      phone. If one is found eligible, she will be sent a consent and paper survey to fill out and
      send back to the research coordinator. Once that is completed, she will be given a phone
      interview in order answer additional questions of interest. Lastly, the study participant
      will be contacted once a year over the phone to obtain follow-up information.
