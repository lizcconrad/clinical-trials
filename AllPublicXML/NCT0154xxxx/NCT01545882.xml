  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being offered to patients who have hormone resistant prostate cancer (HRPC).
      This means that their prostate cancer is no longer responding to standard hormonal therapy.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Degarelix will be able to stop the PSA from
      rising in patients with hormone resistant prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of a GnRH antagonist drug, Degarelix, for use in hormone resistant
      prostate cancer patients who have had biochemical PSA progression despite the use of total
      androgen blockade therapy. Patients will receive at least six monthly injections of Degarelix
      unless the patient shows radiographic or symptomatic disease progression, intolerable
      toxicity or decides to withdraw from the study. Patients will be evaluated for measures of
      efficacy, toxicity and disease progression during treatment and afterwards until
      radiologically confirmed metastatic disease progression or until the patient is removed from
      the study.

      Overall objective:

      The efficacy of Degarelix as a treatment for HRPC will be evaluated

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior trial of total androgen blockade

          -  Confirmed biochemical PSA progression on agonist therapy, defined as ≥ 50% increase in
             PSA between 2 measurements, taken at least 1 week apart. In patients that are
             currently on total androgen blockade (LHRH agonist plus non-steroidal anti-androgen)
             there must be a trial withdrawal of androgen receptor antagonists to ensure that there
             is no PSA response (6 weeks for bicalutamide and 4 weeks for flutamide or nilutamide).

          -  Radiologically confirmed non-metastatic disease within 90 days of registration based
             on negative chest radiographs, CT Scan Abdomen/Pelvis and Bone scan

          -  ECOG ≤ 2

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Serum testosterone of ≤ 50 mg/dl

          -  PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/ml

          -  White blood cell count ≥ 3000/mm3

          -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3

          -  Able and willing to sign informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with chemotherapy, radiopharmaceuticals, estrogen, PC-SPES,
             ketoconazole or other second line hormonal therapy (other than non-steroidal
             anti-androgens or Androcur)

          -  Known allergy to GnRH agonists or antagonists

          -  Previous treatment with Degarelix

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of registration

          -  Grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy

          -  Severe, active co-morbidity such as unstable angina, congestive heart failure or
             myocardial infarction within the last 6 months or congenital long QT syndrome
