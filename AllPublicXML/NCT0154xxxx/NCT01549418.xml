  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of bleeding after polypectomy of large colorectal polyps in patients taking aspirin
      is uncertain. This is a randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to
      compare the risk of significant bleeding after endoscopic polypectomy of large (&gt;=10mm)
      colorectal polyps in patients continuing or discontinuing on daily acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)
      use. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a group taking 75mg daily
      ASA or placebo 7 days before and 14 days following polypectomy. The primary endpoint of the
      study is bleeding within 30 days from colorectal polypectomy. The secondary endpoints are
      composite cardiovascular events occurring between the date of randomization and 30 days after
      polypectomy.

    <textblock>
      Patients chronically taking aspirin (in prophylaxis doses 75-325 mg), with a diagnosis of
      colorectal polyps â‰¥ 10 mm in diameter will be enrolled on a routine polypectomy under
      hospitalization. Meeting the inclusion criteria, after informed consent and a cardiologist
      consent the patient will receive aspirin/placebo, and The Patient Diary to fill (Visit 1).
      The patient will be admitted to the Study Center in 6-7 days taking on the aspirin/placebo
      and prepared for the study (Visit 2). Patient will be under the care of a physician after
      polypectomy by a minimum of 6 hours. 14 days after polypectomy will be the first control
      visit, during which the physician will take back patient diary and pack treatment (Visit 3).
      30 days after polypectomy will be the second control visit by phone (Visit 4). Patients will
      be monitored by looking at the end points.
