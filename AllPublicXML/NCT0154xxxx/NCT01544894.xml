      ranelate in a group of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.

      OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of raloxifene and strontium rannelate in the management
      of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.

      DESIGN: Prospective, open label study. SETTING: University hospital menopause unit. PATIENTS:
      80 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis were assigned to either raloxifene (60 mg/d) or
      strontium ranelate (2g/d). Participants were followed for 1 year.

      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Compliance with each regime. Secondary objectives were parameters of
      efficacy, including changes in bone mineral density and bone biochemical markers.

    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Primary Outcome measure: compliance. Assessment of compliance assessed two variables, the number of participants maintaining treatment after one year and, among those that completed the one year treatment, the number of them that completed at least 80% of the prescribed dose.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical study of raloxifene and strontium ranelate in postmenopausal osteoporosis</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome measure: efficacy. Efficacy has been assessed by changes in axial bone mineral density (spine and hip) and by changes in biochemical bone markers (C-telopeptides and P1NP in serum).
Axial densitometry has been performed prior to treatment and after completion of the programmed one-year treatment.
Bone markers have been assessed prior to treatment and at the 3rd, 6th and 12th month of treatment.</description>
