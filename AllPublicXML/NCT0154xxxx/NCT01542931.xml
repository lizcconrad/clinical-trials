  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induction chemotherapy is regarded as an effective way to reduce or downgrade the locally
      advanced or aggressive cancers, and to improve the chance of eradication of the locoregional
      lesions by radical surgery and/or radiotherapy. However, there are still debates on the
      clinical value of induction chemotherapy for patients with advanced and resectable oral
      squamous cell carcinoma. The hypothesis of this study is that the induction chemotherapy of
      TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil) protocol could benefit the patients with
      locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma. The endpoints of this study are the survival
      rate, local control, and safety.

      The primary endpoint of this study is the survival rate (2, 3, 5 years) after induction
      chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy. The second endpoint of this study is
      locoregional control rates (1, 2 years), and the safety.

    <description>Docetaxel (at a dose of 75mg/m2 of body surface area) was administered as a 2-hour intravenous infusion, followed by intravenous cisplatin (75 mg/m2), administered during a period of 2 to 3 hours. After completion of the cisplatin infusion, 5-Fu (750 mg/m2/day) was administered during a period at least 8 hours for 5 days. Induction chemotherapy was given every 3 weeks for 2 cycles, unless there was disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or withdrawal of consent by the patient.</description>
