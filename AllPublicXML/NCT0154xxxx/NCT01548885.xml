    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of one investigational Bayer Blood
      Glucose meter (with investigational Bayer test strips) and four Blood Glucose Monitoring
      Systems from other companies. All meter BG results were compared with plasma results obtained
      with a reference laboratory glucose method (YSI Glucose Analyzer). Performance of the five
      systems was evaluated across the glucose range of the BGMSs using capillary blood. All
      testing and lancing were performed by study staff and some blood samples were glycolyzed to
      lower the glucose levels.

    <measure>MARD (Mean Absolute Relative Difference Between BGMS Results and Reference Method Results) Across the Overall Tested Glucose Range</measure>
    <time_frame>10 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Using the overall Blood Glucose(BG) range (24 to 386mg/dL), the Mean Absolute Relative Differences (MARD) between the BGM System readings and the YSI laboratory reference values were compared. MARD is calculated from the sum of all |(BG meter)-(BG reference)| / (BG Reference) assessments, divided by the number of assessments, then multiplied by 100(%). Each evaluable sample was tested on all five BGMS, thus the same number of BG test results was analyzed for each BGMS intervention. Lower MARD value indicates smaller difference between meter value and the reference value . Higher MARD value indicates larger difference between meter value and the reference value.</description>

    <description>Using fresh and glycolyzed samples with Blood Glucose(BG) below 70 mg/dL, the Mean Absolute Relative Differences (MARD) between the BGM System readings and the YSI laboratory reference values were compared. MARD is calculated from the sum of all |(BG meter)-(BG reference)| / (BG Reference) assessments, divided by the number of assessments, then multiplied by 100(%). Each evaluable sample was tested on all five BGMS, thus the same number of BG test results was analyzed for each BGMS intervention.

        <title>MARD (Mean Absolute Relative Difference Between BGMS Results and Reference Method Results) Across the Overall Tested Glucose Range</title>
        <description>Using the overall Blood Glucose(BG) range (24 to 386mg/dL), the Mean Absolute Relative Differences (MARD) between the BGM System readings and the YSI laboratory reference values were compared. MARD is calculated from the sum of all |(BG meter)-(BG reference)| / (BG Reference) assessments, divided by the number of assessments, then multiplied by 100(%). Each evaluable sample was tested on all five BGMS, thus the same number of BG test results was analyzed for each BGMS intervention. Lower MARD value indicates smaller difference between meter value and the reference value . Higher MARD value indicates larger difference between meter value and the reference value.</description>

        <title>MARD (Mean Absolute Relative Difference Between BGMS Results and Reference Method Results) Across the Low Glucose Range (&lt;70mg/dL)</title>
        <description>Using fresh and glycolyzed samples with Blood Glucose(BG) below 70 mg/dL, the Mean Absolute Relative Differences (MARD) between the BGM System readings and the YSI laboratory reference values were compared. MARD is calculated from the sum of all |(BG meter)-(BG reference)| / (BG Reference) assessments, divided by the number of assessments, then multiplied by 100(%). Each evaluable sample was tested on all five BGMS, thus the same number of BG test results was analyzed for each BGMS intervention. Lower MARD value indicates smaller difference between meter value and the reference value . Higher MARD value indicates larger difference between meter value and the reference value.</description>

        <population>Same number (190) of BG results was possible for each BGMS. Subjects provided 1,2,or 3 capillary samples, of which 190 samples were less than 70 mg/dL.</population>
