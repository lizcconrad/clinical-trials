  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A quality colonoscopy examination remains as the gold standard for colorectal cancer
      screening, but effective large bowel cleansing prior to colonoscopy is still not achieved in
      all cases that undergo the procedure. Currently, the most widely used cleansing methods
      employ balanced electrolyte-polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions. However, a very large volume
      of PEG solution is required for it to be effective, and many patients refuse to drink a
      sufficient amount due to non-palatability. In this study, the investigators compare a novel
      colon preparation method--bolus lukewarm saline with yoga exercise--with a PEG based solution
      (HalfLytely) for large bowel cleansing.

      Effective large bowel cleansing prior to colonoscopy is still not achieved in all cases that
      undergo the procedure. The use of balanced electrolyte-polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution
      have improved the cleansing results and shortened the time needed for preparing the bowel.
      The problem with using PEG solution alone is the relatively large volume of the solution that
      the patients need to drink. The recommendation is to drink the solution until diarrhea fluid
      is clear and often 4 L or more is needed. Many patients refuse to drink the sufficient volume
      needed to get a clean colon due to non-palatability. Good results of bowel cleansing have
      also been reported with sodium phosphate solution or tablets.

      The fluid volume needed to drink along with sodium phosphate is generally no problem but this
      regimen causes electrolyte disturbances and renal insufficiency that usually are subclinical
      and of no significance. Several combinations of PEG solution and laxatives have been tested
      before. Low-volume PEG plus Bisacodyl preparation was better tolerated but it was not as
      effective as standard large-volume PEG and associated with abdominal cramping.

      PEG solution 2L and Bisacodyl is used for large bowel cleansing in many centers in the United
      States and is the standard regimen used in our colonoscopy unit. In this study the
      investigators compare this standard regimen taken day before colonoscopy with Bolus lukewarm
      saline solution taken orally with yoga exercise on the day of colonoscopy.

      The result of large bowel cleansing is evaluated during the colonoscopy according to a
      validated scoring method. Time to the first bowel movement and total preparation time are
      compared. Solution palatability, patient acceptability, abdominal symptoms, discomfort and
      subjective grading of how hard/easy it was to complete the cleansing program are evaluated
      with questionnaires.

    <measure>Efficacy of Large Bowel Cleansing as Assessed by the Physician Performing the Colonoscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 48 hours of bowel preparation</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint was the &quot;success&quot; rate of the preparations. Preparation efficacy was evaluated by a single, blinded endoscopist (V.A.), who performed all of the colonoscopies. The evaluation involved the rating of six anatomical segments of the colon (rectum, sigmoid, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon and cecum) on the 5 point Arya Bowel Prep Scale (ABPS). Aggregating the segmental scores resulted in overall scores. Grade A was defined as a total overall score of 19-24, grade B as a score of 13-18, grade C as a score of 7-12, and grade D as a score of 0-6. Grade A or B preparation was considered &quot;successes&quot;, while grade C or D was considered &quot;failures.&quot; To assess the reliability of ABPS, we trained 4 gastroenterologists and 3 fellows.</description>

        <title>Efficacy of Large Bowel Cleansing as Assessed by the Physician Performing the Colonoscopy</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint was the “success” rate of the preparations. Preparation efficacy was evaluated by a single, blinded endoscopist (V.A.), who performed all of the colonoscopies. The evaluation involved the rating of six anatomical segments of the colon (rectum, sigmoid, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon and cecum) on the 5 point Arya Bowel Prep Scale (ABPS). Aggregating the segmental scores resulted in overall scores. Grade A was defined as a total overall score of 19–24, grade B as a score of 13–18, grade C as a score of 7–12, and grade D as a score of 0–6. Grade A or B preparation was considered “successes”, while grade C or D was considered “failures.” To assess the reliability of ABPS, we trained 4 gastroenterologists and 3 fellows.</description>
        <time_frame>Within 48 hours of bowel preparation</time_frame>
        <population>The non-inferiority margin was set at -15%. This means the intervention will be considered non-inferior if the difference in success rates is less than 15%. The study was designed to have 90% power to establish non-inferiority when the two treatment groups are equivalent using a one-tailed test at the 5% significance level.</population>

            <description>Yoga contained a 32-oz plastic pitcher and 9-gm salt sachets (Iodine-free table salt - USP grade sodium chloride) for preparation of 0.9% saline (1 sachet in 32-oz lukewarm water (37.2-38.8 degrees Centigrade or 99-102 degrees Fahrenheit)), an instructional leaflet, and a DVD providing instructions of the bowel preparation process. Patients were instructed to fill the pitcher with 16-oz of hot water and 16-oz of room temperature water to reach the lukewarm temperature. Patients could add a twist of lemon if the solution was unpalatable to them.</description>

            <description>Patients in the HCP group followed the preparation method according to the manufacturer's standard instructions. Patients were instructed to stay on clear liquids the entire day before the colonoscopy. Two tablets of bisacodyl delayed-release tablets with water were taken at around 1:00 pm. Patients were instructed to start drinking the solution after a bowel movement or around 7 pm if no bowel activity occurred. They were instructed to sip all of the solution at a rate of 8 oz. every 10 minutes.</description>
