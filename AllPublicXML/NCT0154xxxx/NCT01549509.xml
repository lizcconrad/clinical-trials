  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RV 156A clinical trial is evaluating an experimental HIV vaccine in people who are not
      infected with HIV. Participants in that study are randomly assigned to receive either the HIV
      vaccine or placebo. This study will enroll people who are participating in the RV 156 study.
      In this study, researchers will evaluate the safety of and immune response to a different
      experimental HIV vaccine in people who participated in the RV 156 study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RV 156A is a single site, phase 1 open label study with accrual restricted to participants in
      RV 156. Participants in the RV 156 study were randomly assigned to receive three injections
      of either placebo or the VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP vaccine. All participants in this study will
      receive one injection of a different experimental HIV vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP
      vaccine in people who participated in the RV 156 study. Researchers will examine the
      differences in the immune response to the VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP vaccine between people who
      received placebo in the RV 156 study and people who received the VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP vaccine
      in the RV 156 study.

      A projected number of up to 29 volunteers will be enrolled from the Makerere University site
      in Uganda. At study entry, all participants will undergo a physical examination, medical
      history review, vital sign measurements, and blood and urine collection. They will also
      receive counseling for HIV prevention and pregnancy prevention. Participants will then
      receive one injection of the VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP vaccine in their upper arm. They will remain
      in the clinic for 30 to 45 minutes for observation and monitoring. For 3 days after the
      vaccination, participants will record their temperature and any adverse symptoms in a diary.
      Additional study visits will occur at Days 3, 14, 28, 42, 84, 168, 252, and 336. At each
      visit, participants will undergo the same study procedures that they completed at the study
      entry visit.
