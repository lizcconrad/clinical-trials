    <description>To determine the effects of triplet therapy and enzalutamide alone on androgen receptor signaling in prostatectomy specimens. Androgen receptor (AR) was a type of nuclear receptor that was activated by binding either of the androgenic hormones, testosterone, or dihydrotestosterone in the cytoplasm and then translocating into the nucleus. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling represented the major therapeutic target for treating metastatic prostate cancer. Assessment of androgen receptor signaling was measured by intensity of androgen receptor IHC staining and were graded as 0 (absent), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) and 3 (strong).

        <description>To determine the percentage of participants with positive surgical margins at prostatectomy as assessed by the local and central pathologist. Surgical margin, also known as tumor free margin referred to the visible normal tissue or skin margin that was removed with the surgical excision of a tumor, growth, or malignancy. The margin was described as positive when the pathologist finds cancer cells at the edge of the tissue, suggesting that all of the cancer has not been removed.</description>

        <description>EPIC sexual domain was HRQoL instrument that measured the effects of prostate cancer treatment on a participant's sexual function and sexual satisfaction. Sexual domain summary score was measured on a scale ranged from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) with higher scores representing better sexual function and satisfaction. Best change from baseline category in EPIC sexual domain summary score ranged from worsened to improved where worsened indicated decrease of at least 1 minimally important difference, stable indicated changed by less than 1 minimally important difference and improved indicated increase of at least 1 minimally important difference. Minimally important difference was defined as one-half of the standard deviation of baseline score. Number of participants within each category are reported below.</description>

          <description>EPIC hormonal function subscale score was HRQoL instrument that measured the effects of prostate cancer treatment on a participant's hormonal function. EPIC hormonal function subscale was a component of hormonal domain that was evaluated on a distinct set of questions. It was measured on a scale ranged from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) scale with higher scores representing better hormonal function. Best change from baseline category in EPIC hormonal function subscale score ranged from worsened to improved where worsened indicated decrease of at least 1 minimally important difference, stable indicated changed by less than 1 minimally important difference and improved indicated increase of at least 1 minimally important difference. Minimally important difference was defined as one-half of the standard deviation baseline score. Number of participants within each category are reported below.</description>

The total score ranged from 1 to 10, where higher scores indicated worse mental status. Best change from baseline category in mental component summary ranged from worsened (decrease of at least 1 minimally important difference), stable (changed by less than 1 minimally important difference), or improved (increase of at least 1 minimally important difference). Minimally important difference was defined as one-half the standard deviation of the score of interest at baseline.</description>

The mental health domain score had 2 items scored on a scale of 1 to 5 where for 1 item 1=all of the time person felt calm and peaceful to 5=none of the time person felt calm and peaceful. The score ranged from 1 to 5, where higher scores meant worse mental status. For other item 1=all of the time person felt downhearted and blue to 5=none of the time person felt downhearted and blue. The score ranged from 1 to 5, where higher scores meant better mental status. Best change from baseline category in mental component summary ranged from worsened (decrease of at least 1 minimally important difference), stable (changed by less than 1 minimally important difference), or improved (increase of at least 1 minimally important difference).

        <title>Pharmacodynamic Effects: Assessment of Androgen Receptor Signaling as Measured by Intensity of Androgen Receptor Immunohistochemical (IHC) Staining</title>
        <description>To determine the effects of triplet therapy and enzalutamide alone on androgen receptor signaling in prostatectomy specimens. Androgen receptor (AR) was a type of nuclear receptor that was activated by binding either of the androgenic hormones, testosterone, or dihydrotestosterone in the cytoplasm and then translocating into the nucleus. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling represented the major therapeutic target for treating metastatic prostate cancer. Assessment of androgen receptor signaling was measured by intensity of androgen receptor IHC staining and were graded as 0 (absent), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) and 3 (strong). Percentage of participants within each grade are reported below.</description>

          <title>Pharmacodynamic Effects: Assessment of Androgen Receptor Signaling as Measured by Intensity of Androgen Receptor Immunohistochemical (IHC) Staining</title>
          <description>To determine the effects of triplet therapy and enzalutamide alone on androgen receptor signaling in prostatectomy specimens. Androgen receptor (AR) was a type of nuclear receptor that was activated by binding either of the androgenic hormones, testosterone, or dihydrotestosterone in the cytoplasm and then translocating into the nucleus. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling represented the major therapeutic target for treating metastatic prostate cancer. Assessment of androgen receptor signaling was measured by intensity of androgen receptor IHC staining and were graded as 0 (absent), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) and 3 (strong). Percentage of participants within each grade are reported below.</description>
