                  systemic corticosteroid administered for more than 5 days, or in a daily dose
                  greater than 1 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent during any of 28 days prior to
                  enrollment, or cancer chemotherapy)

               -  receipt of immunostimulants

               -  receipt of parenteral immunoglobulin preparation, blood products, and/or plasma
