  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to demonstrate that the absence of post-transplantation
      corticosteroids does not induce a larger increase of renal graft fibrosis (by numerical
      reading) on biopsy at one year post-transplantation than immunosuppressive treatment strategy
      that includes standard oral corticosteroids.The secondary objectives of the study consist to
      compare on various parameters (fibrosis progression, renal function, dialysis, ratio of
      proteinuria/creatinuria, acute rejection, donor-specific antibody, graft survival, clinical
      and biological tolerance) therapy with no corticosteroids post-transplantation in comparison
      to standard immunosuppressive treatment strategies including oral corticosteroids. Secondary
      objectives of the study consist also to compare the two techniques for assessing fibrosis by
      numerical reading and by centralized blinded reading of the treatment group (by 2 anatomical
      pathologists).
