  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind sham study of TKA patients who receive a
      standard peri-operative treatment program plus Kneehab XP versus a standard peri-operative
      treatment program plus a sham device.

      The study is a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial of approximately 118
      patients (males and females) who are at least 40 years of age, who are scheduled for Total
      Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) surgery will be randomized into 1) a treatment group who receive
      Kneehab XP and a standard rehabilitation program and 2) a control group who receive only a
      sham device and a standard rehabilitation program. Patients are tracked for measures of
      function, pain, quality of life, physical performance and acceptable states status at 6 weeks
      and 1 week before surgery and 3, 6, 12, and 52 weeks following surgery.

    <description>To determine the efficacy of Kneehab XP in promoting early quadriceps strength improvement (measured as the difference between the baseline time point and the 6 week post-operative time point) when compared to a control group in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Isometric strength was measured using a Biodex Isokinetic Dynamometer machine on patients seated and secured to a chair and who performed 3 maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) for which the maximal torque is measured and a mean taken of 3 consecutive MVC's.</description>

    <description>To determine whether Kneehab XP leads to earlier recovery (measured at the 6 week post-operative time point) when compared to a control group in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) is a yes/no answer to a specifically stated question about the patients satisfaction with their state. For clarity, Positive PASS implies that the answer that is given is Positive i.e. Yes</description>

Isometric strength was measured using a Biodex Isokinetic Dynamometer machine on patients seated and secured to a chair and who performed 3 maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) for which the maximal torque is measured and a mean taken of 3 consecutive MVC's.</description>
