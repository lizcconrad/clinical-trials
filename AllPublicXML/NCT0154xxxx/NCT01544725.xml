  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using Ketamine for procedural sedation in adults is often uncomfortable for emergency
      physicians because of the significant proportion of patients experimenting recovery
      agitation. The investigators believe that combining propofol to ketamine, the proportion of
      recovery agitation will be significantly lowered.

      The objectives of this double-blinded, randomized controlled trial are to compare the
      proportion of recovery agitation in adults receiving procedural sedation with
      ketamine-propofol versus ketamine alone, and to compare the proportion of other classical
      procedural sedation side-effects and parameters such as respiratory depression, hypotension,
      sedation duration, time of recovery, procedural failures, and levels of satisfaction.

At t0 + 4 min, if needed to obtain an optimal sedation (RSS of 4 or 5): 0.25 mg/kg of K (0.05 ml/kg of 5 mg/ml K) followed by 0.25 mg/kg of P (0.05 ml/kg of 5 mg/ml P).

At t0 + 12 min, if maximal doses have been reached (1 mg/kg of K + 1 mg/kg of P) but the optimal sedation has not been obtained, the procedural sedation will be recorded as a failure in the analysis, and the patient will receive another procedural sedation product (at the discretion of the caregiver).</description>
