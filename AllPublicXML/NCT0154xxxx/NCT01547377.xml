  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized double-blind study was to evaluate the effect of oral zinc and
      selenium supplementation on oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers as well as the
      status of zinc and selenium in patients with atherosclerosis and angina stable treated with
      rosuvastatin. The hypotheses tested in this study were: Treatment with rosuvastatin impairs
      zinc and selenium status in patients with atherosclerosis and stable angina? Zinc and
      selenium supplementation, concomitantly with rosuvastatin, influences the antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory as well as the status of minerals?

      The study included 47 men and 29 women, average age around 60 years, with coronary
      atherosclerosis diagnosed by angiography. Data from patients were obtained at beginning and
      after four months of treatment with 10 mg rosuvastatin, concomitantly with zinc (30mg/d) and
      selenium (150μg/d) supplementation or placebo. The anthropometric and dietary data, zinc and
      selenium concentrations in plasma and erythrocyte, lipid profile, electronegative LDL
      (LDL(-)), anti- electronegative LDL, Ac-LDL(-) immune complexes, GPx and SOD activities, IL-6
      and hs-CRP were evaluated in all patients.
