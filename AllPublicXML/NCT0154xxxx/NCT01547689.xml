      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of UC-MSC
      (Human Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell) .This study is also to investigate the
      efficacy of this treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, most AD patients who seek treatment already have neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary
      tangles, and neurodegeneration. At this stage of the disease, perhaps a multi-faceted
      approach to halt the toxicity of amyloid-β peptides and promote cell survival and/or replace
      lost cells would be most beneficial.Most of the treatments for Alzheimer disease are chemical
      drug which can improve the symptoms but is not able to inhibit the disease progression.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that are being clinically explored as a
      new therapeutic for treating a variety of immune-mediated diseases.Preclinical studies of the
      mechanism of action suggest that the therapeutic effects afforded by MSC transplantation are
      short-lived and related to dynamic, paracrine interactions between MSCs and host
      cells.Clinical trials of MSCs thus far have shown no adverse reactions to allogeneic versus
      autologous MSC transplants. Clinical studies showed that umbilical cord derived MSC is
      immunologically stable and not toxic.

      This study is to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of UC-MSC (Human Umbilical
      Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell).This study is also to investigate the efficacy of this
      treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
