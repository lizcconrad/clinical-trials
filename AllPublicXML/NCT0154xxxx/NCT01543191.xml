        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or non-pregnant, non-lactating healthy female.

          -  Subject has a BMI of 17 or greater.

          -  Subject has a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis documented by a compatible
             clinical or radiographic presentation, and definitive accepted lab and clinical
             criteria (e.g., sweat chloride &gt; 60 mEq/L or 2 disease causing CFTR mutations) OR is
             regularly attending a Consultant led clinic where the diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis is
             not in doubt.

          -  Subject has an FEV1 â‰¥ 45% of predicted at screening.

          -  Subject has an oxygen saturation &gt;92% on room air as determined by pulse oximetry at
             screening.

          -  Subject is a non-smoker or ex-smoker has not smoked for at least six months prior to
             screening.

          -  Subject is otherwise medically stable without clinically significant abnormal
             screening results that depart from their usual baseline level of health as a subject
             with CF.

          -  Must be willing and able to communicate in English and participate in the whole study.

          -  Must provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has unstable lung disease, as defined by a change in medical regimen during
             the preceding 2-weeks, or a significant new finding on chest radiograph (pneumothorax,
             lobar/segmental collapse), or in the opinion of the Investigator, has had a decline in
             pulmonary status within the last year not considered a part of the usual, chronic
             progression of CF lung disease and part of their baseline health condition as a
             subject with CF.

          -  Subject has had an exacerbation of respiratory symptoms within the past 30 days that
             required initiation of a new or altered respiratory therapy.

          -  Subject had either an upper or lower respiratory illness within the 30 days prior to
             dosing days, or has symptoms from such an illness that have not resolved.

          -  Subject has a history of lung transplantation.

          -  Females of child bearing potential who are pregnant, or lactating. Females who are
             sexually active and either not surgically sterile or not willing to use an acceptable
             form of contraception

          -  Clinically significant abnormal biochemistry, haematology or urinalysis not consistent
             with CF as judged by the Investigator

          -  Failure to satisfy the Investigator of fitness to participate for any other reason.
