  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No validated second-line chemotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced/metastatic
      pancreatic cancer is actually available,after the failure of a gemcitabine(+/- Cisplatin or
      Oxaliplatin)-based regimen.

      Irinotecan seems to be a moderately active drug in the treatment of this disease Recently was
      reported some interesting results using a potentially non -cross resistant regimen (FOLFIRI)
      which could be useful even as second-line chemotherapy.

      An exploratory study in this setting seem warranted.

    <description>Treatment will consist of 4 combination-chemotherapy cycles and in case of stable or responsive disease, other 4 cycles can be administered at investigator's discretion. Therefore will be administered for up to 6 months Each treatment cycle will consist of 2 weeks, unless the start of the subsequent cycle is delayed, in which case the cycle length will be longer than 4 weeks.</description>
