    <textblock>
      INC280 will be administered to Japanese patients with advanced soid tumors whose disease has
      progressed despite standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists. The trial will
      assess the safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) on INC280
