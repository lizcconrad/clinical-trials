    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of S-1 plus oxaliplatin
      combination chemotherapy based on the adverse events and survival period by performing a
      phase I/II study of this combination in patients with D2 resection of gastric cancer.

    <textblock>
      This stage I/II study is designed to evaluate the appropriate dose of S-1 plus fixed-dose of
      oxaliplatin (SOX regimen) for Patients with D2 resection of gastric cancer and survival of
      SOX regimen for stage II-III patients(AJCC 7th). To assess the efficacy, data on recurrence
      and survival will be collected from the time of enrollment until 3 years after surgery. To
      evaluate safety, data on adverse events will be collected from the time of enrollment until 1
      year after surgery.
