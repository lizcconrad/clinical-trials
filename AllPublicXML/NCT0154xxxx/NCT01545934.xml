  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the effects of a multicomponent lifestyle intervention
      that includes partial meal replacements as a means to prevent excessive gestational weight
      gain in obese women. The primary hypothesis is that the intervention will reduce the rate of
      gestational weight gain compared with standard care.

    <measure>Weight gain per week of observation</measure>
    <time_frame>13 weeks gestation, 35 weeks gestation</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of gestational weight gain will be computed as difference between weights measured at study entry and gestational week 35; this difference will be divided by the number of weeks of observation during pregnancy (i.e., weeks between study entry and final pregnancy assessment). If gestational week 35 is unavailable, most proximal clinic visit weight will be used.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of women exceeding IOM guidelines</measure>
    <time_frame>13 weeks, 40 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Women will be categorized as exceeding or not exceeding IOM guidelines for gestational weight gain. Self-reported pre-pregnancy weight will be subtracted from weight measured at last clinic visit prior to delivery. Women will be categorized as exceeding or not exceeding 2009 IOM guidelines.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of women at or below prepregnancy weight</measure>
    <time_frame>22-30 weeks post delivery, 48-56 weeks post delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Weight measured at 22-30 and 48-56 weeks postpartum and subtracted from self-reported prepregnancy weight and then categorized as at or below vs. above self-reported prepregnancy weight.</description>
