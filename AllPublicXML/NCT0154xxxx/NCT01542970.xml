  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of allergic disease has increased worldwide during the last decades. Initially,
      a lot of effort has been put in elucidating which of the known risk factors commonly
      associated to the development of allergic disease early in life was the cause of this
      increase. Studies showing a reduced incidence of allergic disease in the former socialist
      countries in comparison to countries with a &quot;Western lifestyle&quot; have shown that risk factors
      as allergen exposure, environmental pollution and tobacco exposure are also present in
      societies with a less affluent lifestyle. This suggests the disappearance of factor
      protecting against the development of allergic diseases in affluent environment.The
      development of allergic diseases begins during the first year of life with eczema, both
      non-IgE- and IgE-associated, and food allergy, progressing during childhood with the
      development of asthma bronchiale, also both non-IgE- and IgE-associated, and later
      development of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, i.e. the atopic march. The immune system of the
      neonate is influenced by maternal immunity, both via the placenta and breast milk. Thus, the
      immunological interaction between the mother and her offspring is close during pregnancy and
      lactation. The association of cord blood IgE levels with maternal but not paternal atopic
      heredity, may depend on a possibly stronger placental Th2 shift in atopic mothers. Thus,
      factors influencing/protecting against the development of allergic disease early in life,
      would be important already during pregnancy, birth and early postnatal life. Two major
      hypotheses have been assessed during the last decade: Proper microbial stimulation, including
      the establishment of the gut flora in infancy and the relationship between low omega
      3-polyunsaturated fatty acids in the western diet and the incidence of allergic disease.

      This is a double blind randomized study. Families with at least one parent/sibling with
      clinical symptoms/history of allergic disease will be invited to participate in this study.
      Pregnant mothers will be included in the study at the 20th week of gestation. They will be
      randomized to 4 study groups, one will receive placebo capsules, the second will receive
      omega-3 PUFA supplementation and placebo regarding L. reuteri, the third will receive L.
      reuteri and placebo regarding omega-3 PUFA and the fourth group will receive both omega-3
      PUFA and L. reuteri supplementation. Omega-3 supplementation will be given to mothers from
      pregnancy and lactation while L. reuteri will be given to the mothers during pregnancy and
      later to the children during the first year of life.The children will be clinically followed
      by an allergy nurse regularly. Questionnaires regarding data on environment, siblings, pets,
      breast feeding, smoking exposure, upper respiratory and other infections and clinical
      symptoms of allergic disease will be filled regularly. Skin prick tests (SPTs) will be
      performed in the children at 6 and 12 months with milk, egg, wheat, peanut and cat. At 24
      months, timothy and birch allergen extracts will be added. A pediatrician will assess the
      children at 24 months of life and whenever it is needed during the study period. Dietary
      habits will be assessed during pregnancy (25th gestational week) and 6 months after child
      birth. Blood samples in the children will be taken from cord blood and at 6, 12 and 24 months
      of life. Maternal blood samples will be taken at 20th weeks of gestation and at child birth.
      Milk samples will be collected 1-4 days after partus and monthly during the first 4 months of
      lactation. Maternal gastrointestinal function will be addressed by validated diary cards.
      Saliva from the children and fecal samples from mother and child will also be collected
      according to the following protocol.

    <description>A food reaction is defined as gastrointestinal symptoms, hives, aggravated eczema or wheezing following ingestion of a certain food with recovery after food elimination from the diet and reoccurrence of symptoms after ingestion of the particular food. Eczema is characterized as reoccurring, itching eczematous and lichenified or nummular dermatitis. Doctor diagnosed wheezing at least three times during the first two years is required for the diagnosis of asthma. If specific positive SPT or serum IgE antibodies is present, the food reaction, eczema in defined as IgE associated.</description>

    <measure>Maternal gastrointestinal function</measure>
    <time_frame>20th gestational week to 6 months post partum</time_frame>
    <description>Maternal gastrointestinal function will be addressed by validated diary cards. The mothers will record every single stool, stool consistency, and corresponding defecatory symptoms (urgency, straining, and feeling of incomplete evacuation) for seven days at gestational week 25 and 35. Stool consistency will be defined by the Bristol Stool Form Scale. The mothers will also record every meal, and episodes (start and ending time) of abdominal pain and bloating.</description>
