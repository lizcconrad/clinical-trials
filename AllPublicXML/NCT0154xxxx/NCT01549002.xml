  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children can develop abscesses (a collection of pus under their skin) that require a
      physician to cut it open to let the pus drain out. This is a painful procedure. Most medical
      professionals will use numbing cream and inject numbing medicine into the skin, just like at
      the dentist, to help reduce the pain. While this helps minimize the pain of cutting the skin,
      it doesn't help the pain associated with draining out the pus.

      There are many strategies and medications available to physicians to help decrease the pain
      of this procedure. Most of the medications available to treat the pain require the placement
      of an intravenous (IV) catheter through the patient's skin, which itself is a painful
      procedure. In the investigators emergency department, many patients with abscesses that need
      a procedure to drain the pus receive a medicine called morphine through an IV.

      Some pain medicines, however, can be sprayed into a patient's nose, and have been shown to be
      helpful at reducing the pain of a broken bone or a burn. These medicines do not require the
      placement of an IV.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether a medicine called fentanyl, when
      sprayed into the nose of patients aged 4 to 18 years undergoing abscess drainage, is not
      worse than IV morphine in decreasing the pain of the procedure.

      After the risks and benefits of the study are explained to patients and their parents,
      written informed consent will be obtained. Written informed assent will be obtained for
      patients older than 8 years of age. Like the flipping of a coin, a computer program will
      decide randomly which half of the patients will receive fentanyl nose spray and which half
      will receive morphine by IV.

      The patients assigned to receive fentanyl nose spray will not have an IV placed. The patients
      assigned to receive morphine will have an IV placed. Both groups of patients will have the
      abscess drainage procedure done the same way. All patients will be videotaped in order to
      score their pain by a trained observer. This score is the main outcome (measurement) in the
      study.

    <measure>Score on the Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress Revised (OSBD-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 minutes after the procedure completion</time_frame>
    <description>Our primary outcome is the Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress - Revised (OSBD-R) to assess observed intra-procedural pain. The total OSBD-R score is a summation of the OSBD-R score of each individual phase. The score in each phase can range from 0 to 23.5. There were four phases in our study, so the range of scores for the total OSBD-R was 0 to 94, with a higher score indicating a greater degree of pain and distress. The scores documented here are the total OSBD-R scores.</description>

    <measure>Score on the Faces Pain Scale Revised (FPS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 minutes after procedure completion</time_frame>
    <description>The Faces Pain Scale Revised (FPS-R) has been validated in patients 4 - 16 years of age undergoing painful procedures and will be used to assess patients' self reported pain. Patients will complete the FPS-R at four times during their medical encounter: (1) before analgesia administration, (2) ten minutes after analgesia administration but before beginning I&amp;D, (3) immediately post I&amp;D procedure (to ascertain the pain perceived during procedure), and (4) ten minutes after procedure completion.</description>

    <time_frame>10 minutes after procedure completion</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction will be measured on a Likert scale just prior to Emergency Department discharge. If the patient is 8 years of age and older, both the patient and the parent or guardian will complete a satisfaction survey. If the patients is younger than 8 years, their parent or guardian will complete the satisfaction survey.</description>

          <description>An observational scale of pain and distress during procedures. Scores can range from 0 to 23.5 units for each phase. A higher score indicates a greater degree of pain and distress. The total OSBD-R score is a summation of the OSBD-R score from each phase. For example, if there are six phases, the range of scores for OSBD-R is from 0 to 141. The measured baseline OSBD-R scores was ZERO for all patients.</description>

        <title>Score on the Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress Revised (OSBD-R)</title>
        <description>Our primary outcome is the Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress - Revised (OSBD-R) to assess observed intra-procedural pain. The total OSBD-R score is a summation of the OSBD-R score of each individual phase. The score in each phase can range from 0 to 23.5. There were four phases in our study, so the range of scores for the total OSBD-R was 0 to 94, with a higher score indicating a greater degree of pain and distress. The scores documented here are the total OSBD-R scores.</description>

            <description>Patients in this arm will receive intranasal Fentanyl (50 micrograms/mL) as their pre-I&amp;D analgesic. The one time total dose to be used is 2 micrograms / kilogram, to a maximum of 100 micrograms. The medication will be delivered intranasally via an atomizer in 4 equally divided aliquots (2 per nare).
The abscess I&amp;D will be followed according to protocol using topical and local anesthetic.

        <title>Score on the Faces Pain Scale Revised (FPS-R)</title>
        <description>The Faces Pain Scale Revised (FPS-R) has been validated in patients 4 - 16 years of age undergoing painful procedures and will be used to assess patients' self reported pain. Patients will complete the FPS-R at four times during their medical encounter: (1) before analgesia administration, (2) ten minutes after analgesia administration but before beginning I&amp;D, (3) immediately post I&amp;D procedure (to ascertain the pain perceived during procedure), and (4) ten minutes after procedure completion.</description>

        <description>Patient satisfaction will be measured on a Likert scale just prior to Emergency Department discharge. If the patient is 8 years of age and older, both the patient and the parent or guardian will complete a satisfaction survey. If the patients is younger than 8 years, their parent or guardian will complete the satisfaction survey.</description>
