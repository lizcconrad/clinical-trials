  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose finding, Phase Ib dose escalation study to estimate
      the MTD(s) and/or RP2D(s) for the dual combination of LGX818 and MEK162 and the triple
      combination of LGX818 and MEK162 and LEE011, followed each independently by a Phase II part
      to assess the clinical efficacy and to further assess the safety of the combinations in
      selected patient populations. Oral LGX818 and MEK162 will be administered on a continuous
      schedule. Oral LEE011 will be administered once daily on a three weeks on, one week off
      schedule. Patients will be treated until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity
      develops, or withdrawal of informed consent, whichever occurs first. A cycle is defined as 28
      days. The dose escalation parts of the trial will be conducted in adult patients with BRAF
      V600-dependent advanced solid tumors and is expected to enroll at least 18 patients for the
      dual combination and at least 12 patients for the triple combination. The dose escalation
      will be guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM). Following MTD/RP2D
      declaration, patients will be enrolled in three Phase II arms for the dual combination and
      one Phase II arm for the triple combination. All patients will be followed for 30 days for
      safety assessments after study drugs discontinuation. All patients enrolled in the Phase II
      part of the study will be followed for survival.
