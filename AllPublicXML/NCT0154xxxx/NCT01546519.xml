    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multiple-center, multiple-dose study designed to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics and safety of vismodegib in patients with advanced solid malignancies
      (including hepatocellular carcinoma and lymphoma) that are refractory to standard therapy or
      for whom no standard therapy exists.

    <measure>Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration and Concentration at Steady-state Following Multiple Doses of Vismodegib</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1,2,4 and 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours post dose on Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum observed plasma Concentration (Cmax) &amp; Concentration at steady-state (Css) following multiple doses of vismodegib (150 mg QD) were analyzed. At steady state the amount of drug administered (in a given time period) is equal to the amount of drug eliminated. Blood samples for assessing Cmax and Css for analysis were collected following multiple oral doses of vismodegib at pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours post-dose on Day 8. From the plasma concentration-time curve, the PK parameter Cmax and Css were determined by standard non-compartmental analysis using WinNonlin</description>

    <measure>Minimum Plasma Concentration (Cmin) of Vismodegib</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>Cmin is defined as the minimum observed plasma concentration of Vismodegib. This was a pre-specified PK parameter. However, due to minimal fluctuation of Vismodegib concentrations at steady state, this parameter could not be determined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Clearance (CL/F) of Vismodegib</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>CL/F is apparent clearance of the drug from the plasma, calculated as the drug dose divided AUC (0-inf), expressed in liter/hour (L/hr). This was a pre-specified PK parameter. However, due to minimal fluctuation of vismodegib concentrations at steady state, this parameter could not be determined.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>Apparent Non-Renal Clearance (CLNR) describes the removal of vismodegib by organs other than the kidneys. This was a pre-specified PK parameter. However, due to minimal fluctuation of vismodegib concentrations at steady state, this parameter could not be determined.</description>

At steady state the amount of drug administered (in a given time period) is equal to the amount of drug eliminated.
