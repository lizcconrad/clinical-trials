      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of breast
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving the drugs
      in different combinations may kill more breast cancer cells. Giving combination chemotherapy
      after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying different combination chemotherapy
      regimens and their side effects and comparing how well they work in treating women with
      non-metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if the docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) regimen is non-inferior to the
           anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens in terms of invasive disease-free survival
           (DFS) by combining B-49 data with the docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC)
           and TC arms of NSABP B-46-I/US Oncology Research, Inc.(USOR) 07132 and the data from
           USOR 06-090.

      Secondary

        -  To determine rates of DFS-ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) for the TC and
           anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens.

        -  To determine rates of overall survival (OS) for the TC and anthracycline-based
           chemotherapy regimens.

        -  To determine rates of recurrence-free interval (RFI) for the TC and anthracycline-based
           chemotherapy regimens.

        -  To evaluate the toxicity associated with each of the regimens.

        -  To determine the role of TOP2A in prognosis and prediction of degree of benefit from
           anthracycline-based chemotherapy over TC. (exploratory)

        -  To develop predictive markers for benefit from doxorubicin. (exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter randomized study. Patients are stratified according to number
      of positive nodes (0 vs 1-3 vs 4-9 vs 10+) and hormone-receptor status (estrogen receptor
      [ER] and/or progesterone receptor [PgR] positive vs ER and PgR negative). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
             of 0 or 1.

          -  The tumor must be unilateral invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic
             examination.

          -  The breast cancer must be Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-negative
             based on current American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/CAP Guideline
             Recommendations for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Testing in Breast Cancer.
             If the result of the in situ hybridization testing (FISH, chromagen in situ
             hybridization [CISH], or other) is equivocal, the patient is eligible if there is no
             plan to administer HER2-targeted therapy.

          -  All of the following staging criteria must be met according to American Joint
             Committee on Cancer (AJCC) criteria:

               -  By pathologic evaluation, primary tumor must be pT1-3;

               -  By pathologic evaluation, ipsilateral nodes must be pN0, pN1 (pN1mi, pN1a, pN1b,
                  pN1c), pN2a, pN3a, or pN3b.

               -  If pN0, at least one of the following criteria must be met:

               -  ER negative and PgR negative; or

               -  Pathologic tumor size greater than 2.0 cm; or

               -  T1c (pathologic tumor size greater than 1.0 cm but less than or equal to 2.0 cm)
                  and ER positive (PgR status may be positive or negative) and either grade 3
                  histology or Oncotype DX® Recurrence Score of greater than or equal to 25.

          -  Patients must have undergone either a total mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery
             (lumpectomy).

          -  For patients who undergo lumpectomy, the margins of the resected specimen must be
             histologically free of invasive tumor and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as
             determined by the local pathologist. If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at
             the line of resection, additional operative procedures must be performed to obtain
             clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s),
             the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins
             positive for lobular carcinoma in situ [LCIS] are eligible without additional
             resection.)

          -  For patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be histologically free of invasive
             tumor and DCIS.

          -  Patients must have completed one of the following procedures for evaluation of
             pathologic nodal status:

               -  Sentinel lymphadenectomy alone if pathologic nodal staging based on sentinel
                  lymphadenectomy is pN0, pN1mi, or pN1b;

               -  Sentinel lymphadenectomy alone if pathologic nodal staging based on sentinel
                  lymphadenectomy is pN1a limited to 1 or 2 positive nodes and primary tumor is T1
                  or T2 by pathologic evaluation;

               -  Sentinel lymphadenectomy followed by removal of additional non-sentinel lymph
                  nodes if the sentinel node (SN) is positive; or

               -  Axillary lymphadenectomy with or without SN isolation procedure.

          -  The interval between the last surgery for breast cancer (treatment or staging) and
             randomization must be no more than 84 days.

          -  Patients must have ER analysis performed on the primary tumor prior to randomization.
             Breast cancer must be assessed for ER status by current ASCO/CAP Guideline
             Recommendations for hormone receptor testing. If negative for ER, assessment of PgR
             must also be performed according to current ASCO/CAP Guideline Recommendations for
             hormone receptor testing. (Either a core biopsy or surgical resection specimen can be
             used for ER/PgR testing.)

          -  The most recent postoperative blood counts, performed within 6 weeks prior to
             randomization, must meet the following criteria:

               -  absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than or equal to 1200/mm3;

               -  platelet count must be greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3; and

               -  hemoglobin must be greater than or equal to 10 g/dL.

          -  The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met based on
             the results of the most recent postoperative tests performed within 6 weeks prior to
             randomization:

               -  total bilirubin must be less than or equal to upper limit of normal (ULN) for the
                  lab unless the patient has a bilirubin elevation greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN
                  due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of
                  bilirubin; and

               -  alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and

               -  aspartate transaminase (AST) must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.

               -  Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example,
                  if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than or equal to 2.5
                  x ULN, then the AST must be less than or equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater
                  than the ULN but less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase
                  must be less than or equal to ULN.

               -  Note: If alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is performed instead of AST (per
                  institution's standard practice), the ALT value must be less than or equal to 1.5
                  x ULN; if both were performed, the AST must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN.

          -  Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion
             in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, PET-CT, or PET scan performed within 90 days
             prior to randomization) does not demonstrate metastatic disease and the requirements
             for adequate hepatic function as described above are met.

          -  Patients with alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than or equal to
             2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan, PET-CT scan, or PET
             scan performed within 90 days prior to randomization does not demonstrate metastatic
             disease.

          -  The most recent postoperative serum creatinine performed within 6 weeks prior to
             randomization must be less than or equal to ULN for the lab.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment by 2-D echocardiogram or
             multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan must be performed within 90 days prior to
             randomization. The LVEF must be greater than or equal to 50% regardless of the
             facility's lower limit of normal (LLN). (If the facility performing the assessment has
             not reported the LVEF as a whole number, decimals reported as greater than or equal to
             5 should be rounded up and decimals reported as less than 5 should be rounded down.)

        Exclusion criteria:

        Patients with one or more of the following conditions are ineligible for this study.

          -  T4 tumors including inflammatory breast cancer.
