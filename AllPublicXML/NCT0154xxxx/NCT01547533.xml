  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study the transfer of benznidazole into breastmilk from the
      blood of lactating women who receive the drug for the treatment of Chagas disease. Breastmilk
      and blood samples will be obtained from these patients at given times after they take the
      clinically indicated medication, and the concentrations in both matrices will be compared to
      estimate degree of transfer, which in turn will be used to evaluate potential degree of
      exposure of infants breastfed by these women. This study will help clarify safety of
      continuing breastfeeding while receiving treatment with benznidazole for Chagas disease.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Benznidazole concentration in breastmilk and in plasma</measure>
    <time_frame>at randomly selected time points during the 30 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Randomly obtained breastmilk samples will be obtained to both evaluate the breastmilk / plasma concentration ratio of the drug, and to develop a population pharmacokinetics model of drug trasfer into breastmilk, if possible.
Breastmilk concentrations will be used to calculate potential infant exposure through breastmilk to the medication (benznidazole) taken by the mother</description>

    <measure>incidence of adverse drug reactions in women treated with benznidazole during lactation</measure>

    <description>Women receiving treatment with benznidazole while lactating, enrolled in the study will be followed according to current clinical guidelines, and monitored during the 60 days of the treatment (as per Chagas disease treatment guidelines), and monthly for 3 months after treatment completion.</description>
