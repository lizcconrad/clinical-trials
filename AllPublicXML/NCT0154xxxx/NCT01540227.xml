  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that causes genital sores and rash, but in some
      circumstances may result in more severe and unexpected symptoms. These severe symptoms could
      include eye infections, meningitis (infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal
      cord), and liver infection. If not properly treated, syphilis can also lead to heart problems
      and dementia (a decline in reasoning, memory and other mental abilities) years down the road.
      There has been an increase in the number of reported cases of syphilis in North America,
      Europe, and Australia over the past decade. The number of new syphilis infections in Canada
      has increased roughly 10-fold over the past 10 years.

      Since 1943, the antibiotic penicillin has been used to treat syphilis; however, very little
      information has been gathered to determine the proper dose of penicillin or appropriate
      duration of treatment. Added to this, several studies have shown that the recommended dose of
      penicillin fails to cure syphilis in 20-30% of patients. Since the number of people infected
      with syphilis is increasing, and since syphilis has the potential to cause serious disease,
      the investigators need better information on how to treat syphilis effectively.

      This study aims to determine whether the current dose of penicillin recommended to treat
      syphilis is sufficient to cure the infection. Specifically the investigators will try to
      determine whether the amount of penicillin in your blood 3 and 7 days after receiving
      treatment for syphilis is sufficient to cure the infection as demonstrated by a blood test 6
      or 12 months from now. This study is a multi-centered trial based in Ottawa but with centers
      recruiting both in Montreal and Toronto. A total of 120 participants with syphilis will be
      recruited into this study. The treatment you will receive for syphilis in this study does not
      differ from that you would receive normally; the investigators are only observing the levels
      of penicillin in your blood and relating them with the outcome of treatment.
