  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to 1) demonstrate the protective efficacy against acute otitis
      media (AOM), 2) assess safety of the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' pneumococcal vaccine
      GSK2189242A in Native American infants aged less than 24 months, living in the southwestern
      US, in and around the Navajo and White Mountain Apache reservations, and 3) evaluate the
      impact on acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) up to the second year of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will also evaluate the impact of the pneumococcal vaccine GSK2189242A on
      nasopharyngeal carriage in a subgroup of children called Carriage subgroup. Immunogenicity
      and reactogenicity of the pneumococcal vaccine GSK2189242A will be evaluated in another
      subgroup of children called Immuno/reacto subgroup.

      Protocol Posting has been updated following Protocol Amendment 3, April 2012, leading to the
      addition of a secondary outcome measure.

      Protocol Posting has been updated following Protocol Amendment 7, March 2017, to add
      serological testing for antibodies against the Hib polysaccharide PRP on samples collected 12
      months following booster dose (Month 22) in the Immuno/reacto sub-cohort, in order to
      evaluate the long term persistence of immune responses to co-administered PedvaxHIB vaccine.

      <recruitment_details>1806 subjects were enrolled in this study, Three sub-cohorts of subjects were foreseen: Immuno/reacto sub-cohort for assessment of immunogenicity, Carriage sub-cohort for assessment of impact on carriage of S. pneumoniae and “No additional procedures” sub-cohort comprising subjects not included in any of the above sub-cohorts.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Out of the 1806 subjects enrolled in this study, 1803 were vaccinated and therefore included in the Total Vaccinated Cohort. 3 subjects were excluded for the following reasons: one subject had an invalid Inform Consent form and 2 subjects received subject number but did not receive any vaccine dose.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Time to occurrence of any episode of AOM is expressed in terms of rate: Person-year rate = number of episodes (n)/sum of follow-up expressed in years (T[year)]).
Definition of clinical AOM diagnosed and verified against AAP criteria required meeting three criteria based on the guidelines from the AAP [AAP, 2004], as per the judgment of a treating physician or equivalent licensed medical professional:
A history of acute (recent, usually abrupt) onset of signs and symptoms of middle-ear inflammation and middle-ear effusion (MEE).AND The presence of MEE indicated by any of the following: a) Bulging of tympanic membrane; b) Limited or absent mobility of tympanic membrane; c) Air-fluid level behind tympanic membrane; d) Otorrhea AND Signs or symptoms of middle-ear inflammation as indicated by either: a) Distinct erythema of tympanic membrane or b) Distinct otalgia (discomfort clearly referable to the ear[s] that resulted in interference with or precluded normal activity or sleep).</description>
        <time_frame>Any time from 2 weeks after the administration of dose 3 up to Month 22</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was performed on the modified according to protocol cohort for efficacy which included all evaluable subjects for whom data concerning efficacy outcome measures were available (efficacy cohort) and for whom non-compliance with the vaccination intervals during primary vaccination was the only elimination criterion from the efficacy cohort.</population>

Definition of clinical AOM diagnosed and verified against AAP criteria required meeting three criteria based on the guidelines from the AAP [AAP, 2004], as per the judgment of a treating physician or equivalent licensed medical professional:
A history of acute (recent, usually abrupt) onset of signs and symptoms of middle-ear inflammation and middle-ear effusion (MEE).AND The presence of MEE indicated by any of the following: a) Bulging of tympanic membrane; b) Limited or absent mobility of tympanic membrane; c) Air-fluid level behind tympanic membrane; d) Otorrhea AND Signs or symptoms of middle-ear inflammation as indicated by either: a) Distinct erythema of tympanic membrane or b) Distinct otalgia (discomfort clearly referable to the ear[s] that resulted in interference with or precluded normal activity or sleep).</description>

Draining AOM was defined as AOM with otorrhea or with spontaneously perforated tympanic membrane. In this case, middle ear fluid (MEF) was to be swabbed with no tympanocentesis needed and tested for the presence of S. pneumoniae and other pathogens as part of the routine clinical practice. Draining pneumococcal AOM were defined as draining AOM cases with S. pneumoniae identified in MEF.</description>

        <description>Assessed solicited general symptoms were Drowsiness, Irritability/Fussiness (Irr./Fuss.), Loss of appetite (Loss Appet.) and Fever (axillary route - temperature equal or higher than [≥] 38.0 degrees Celsius [°C]),. Any = Occurrence of the specified solicited general symptom, regardless of intensity or relationship to vaccination. Grade 3 Drowsiness = Drowsiness that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 Irr./Fuss. = Crying that could not be comforted/prevented normal activity. Grade 3 Loss of appetite = Subject did not eat at all. Grade 3 Fever = (axillary) temperature higher than (&gt;) 40.0°C. Related = Occurrence of the specified symptom assessed by the investigator as causally related to vaccination.

        <title>Number of Subjects With Any Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs) After Primary Vaccination - Immuno/Reacto Sub-cohort</title>
        <description>An unsolicited AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For the marketed products administered in the study, this also included failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse of the product. Any = Occurrence of an unsolicited AE, regardless of intensity or relationship to vaccination. The Immuno/reacto sub-cohort was composed of 200 vaccinated subjects from each study group.</description>
        <time_frame>Within the 31-day (Days 0-30) period post primary vaccination, across doses</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was performed on Immuno/reacto sub-cohort which included around 200 subjects from the total vaccinated cohort, for whom at least one vaccination dose was documented.</population>

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For the marketed products administered in the study, this also included failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse of the product.
