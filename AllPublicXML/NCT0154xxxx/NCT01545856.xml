  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a common comorbidity of Parkinson's disease (PD). The
      background incidence rate of CV events in a levodopa-treated PD population was assessed to
      better understand these comorbidities in the PD population. One objective of the study is to
      identify a population of prevalent PD patients with incident levodopa use within the years
      2004-2010 on the Integrated Health Care Information Services (IHCIS) database. The second
      objective is to report the incidence of CV events overall and during intervals 0-6, 6-12 and
      12-18 months after first prescription of levodopa among all new levodopa users.

        The study cohorts of interest will be identified from the most recent datacut of the IHCIS
        database. Individuals with one or more prescriptions of levodopa between 1st July 2004 and
        30th June 2010 will be included. The date of the first prescription of levodopa in the
        study time period is defined as the INDEX DATE. All individuals must be on the database
        with medical and pharmacy benefit for at least 6 months prior to the INDEX DATE. All
        individuals must have one or more diagnosis codes for Parkinson's disease within the 6
        months prior or 6 months post INDEX DATE. Individuals will be excluded if age is &lt;20 years
        on the INDEX date. Individuals will also be excluded if they have a previous levodopa
        prescription prior to the INDEX date as only new users of levodopa are of interest.
