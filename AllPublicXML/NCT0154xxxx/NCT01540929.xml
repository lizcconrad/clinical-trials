    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective study of the Department of Defense (DoD) Smallpox Screening Form 600s
      (SF600s) generated during screening of service members for possible immunization with the
      ACAM2000® smallpox vaccine.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the accuracy of the DoD smallpox vaccination screening process in military
           personnel.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To describe the number of subjects who are excluded from vaccination, stratified by the
           pre-defined categories for exclusion (separately for the Screened and Evaluable
           Populations).

      Please note that we elected to post this study on the registry (clinicaltrials.gov) in the
      interests of transparency and because the study represented a post-licensure commitment to
      FDA for ACAM2000® smallpox vaccine. However, this study was not a clinical trial and did not
      involve the administration of any vaccine product nor the collection of any product
      performance or adverse event data. Rather, the purpose of the study was to determine the
      success rate for proper completion and use of Department of Defense (DoD) Screening Form 600s
      (SF600s). The SF600 is a form required to be completed prior to smallpox vaccination of DoD
      staff and is used to guide decision-making by DoD vaccination staff regarding offering,
      postponing, or denying vaccination. The study evaluated both the extent to which the SF600s
      were completed correctly and the extent to which they were correctly used to guide
      vaccination decision-making.
