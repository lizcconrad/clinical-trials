  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look for low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) in your cervix cancer
      using a special x-ray test called a positron emission tomography (PET)scan. Hypoxia may have
      an effect on how cervix cancer grows and responds to treatments like radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy. Doctors at Princess Margaret Hospital have measured hypoxia in over 300
      patients. The use of PET scans to measure hypoxia may be better and simpler than the methods
      used previously.

    <description>A PET scan is an imaging test that uses special radioactive dyes to measure different aspects of how your cancer acts. In this study, a dye called 18F-Fluoroazomycin Arabinoside (18F-FAZA) will be used to measure hypoxia levels in tumours. Health Canada has not approved FAZA for general use, but has approved it for use in this study.</description>
