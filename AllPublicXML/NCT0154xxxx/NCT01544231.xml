  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project consists of a prospective diagnostic study conducted on patients with
      clinical suspicion of rhabdomyolysis admitted to the emergency rooms of the University
      Hospitals of Nimes, Montpellier, Paris, Nice and Toulon Inter Army Hospital. The main
      objective of this study is to determine whether the plasma level of Neutrophil Gelatinase
      Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) may be retained as a predictor of acute renal failure (ARF)
      occurring within 48 hours after admission for rhabdomyolysis.

      The secondary objectives of this are:

        -  to study plasma NGAL levels on admission to the emergency ward as a marker of morbidity
           and mortality by considering the following factors: duration of hospitalization, need
           for extracorporeal blood purification, ICU admission, death.

        -  to study the delay between the onset of the proposed cause of rhabdomyolysis and
           treatment initiation

        -  to study the delay between treatment initiation and the occurrence of ARF.
