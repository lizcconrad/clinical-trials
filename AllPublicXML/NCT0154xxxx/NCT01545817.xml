      Study to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of first-line pazopanib followed by
      second-line everolimus in metastatic and advanced renal cell carcinoma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A non-randomised, open label, single-arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of 1st-line pazopanib followed by 2nd-line everolimus in patients with previously untreated
      advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Subjects will receive initial therapy with
      pazopanib, followed, on progression, by 2nd-line therapy with everolimus. Study treatment,
      sequential treatment with pazopanib followed by everolimus, will continue until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death.

    Due to changes in the RCC treatment landscape, info gained is no longer clinically relevant to
