  <brief_summary>

      Background:

      - Early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) is more likely to be caused by gene mutations than
      Parkinson's disease that develops in older people. Studying these mutations may help find
      therapies for EOPD. Researchers want to study mutations on a gene called PARK2. These
      mutations prevent fat uptake into cells and may interfere with normal brain function.
      Researchers want to study fat and cholesterol in the body to look at the effects of these
      mutations on the body and brain.

      Objectives:

      - To study connections between genetic mutations and EOPD.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals between 18 and 80 years of age with EOPD.

        -  Individuals between 18 and 80 years of age with no family history of Parkinson s
           disease.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will also be collected.

        -  Participants will have some or all of the following tests:

        -  Blood samples and tissue (skin and fat) biopsies

        -  Cell line development from these tissue samples to study the function of PARK2

        -  DEXA scan to measure body fat context using low dose x-rays

        -  Glucose and insulin tolerance testing to measure blood sugar levels.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this protocol.

      The majority of subjects with the degenerative Parkinson s Disease present at around the age
      of 70 years. Other subjects develop this brain disease before the age of 40 years. This early
      onset presentation is more likely to have a direct genetic cause than the degenerative form
      of the disease. Our understanding of the genetic causes of early onset Parkinson s Disease
      may help us find therapies for both the genetic and more degenerative illnesses. Our
      laboratory has found that one of the genetic mutations associated with early onset Parkinson
      s Disease, in a gene called PARK2 results in impaired uptake of fat into cells. This may have
      detrimental effects in the brain, as the brain requires fat to make cholesterol and to send
      brain signals. A finding in mice lacking PARK2, is that they are resistant to diet induced
      diabetes and obesity and to fatty liver. These data suggests that the systemic and brain
      effects of low fat uptake may be opposing, with low fat uptake having a beneficial effect
      against risk factors such as obesity and diabetes but increasing the risk for brain diseases.
      To begin to test whether this is the case in subjects with PARK2 mutations we propose to test
      their fat uptake and glucose and insulin sensitivity.
