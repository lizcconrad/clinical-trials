  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perineal massage at the end of labor stage 2 has been investigated in 2 randomized controlled
      trials using a water soluble lubricant. In one trial a significant reduction of labor stage 2
      has been found, both trials did not show a significant increase of perineum integrity.

      In the HCB Swiss Study both a significant reduction of labor stage 2 by 30 % as well as a
      significant increase of perineal integrity have been shown. No adverse events have been
      reported.

      (see also Obstetric gel shortens second stage of labor and prevents perineal trauma in
      nulliparous women: a randomized controlled trial on labor facilitation. Schaub AF, Litschgi
      M, Hoesli I, Holzgreve W, Bleul U, Geissbuhler V. J Perinat Med 2008; 36 (2): 129-135).

      Today's practice- Lubricants are widely used to enable manual vaginal examination during
      labor. In Israel midwifes are using Almond Oil for perineal massage at the end of labor stage
      2 to protect the perineum. It has been shown for the first time that the use of the Dianatal
      Obstetric Gel facilitates vaginal childbirth in humans. Dianatal has been introduced to the
      EU markets in 2008.

    <description>Dianatal (approx. 30 mL in total) will be intermittently administered to the birth canal after vaginal examination in labor using the Dianatal applicator or the syringe or the fingers. Dianatal Stage I is used during labor stage I, Dianatal Stage 2 is used during stage 2. After rupture of the membranes supplementary Dianatal is applied within 5 to 20 minutes.</description>
