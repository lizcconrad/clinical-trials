    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the benefits of investigational drug, NRX 194204 in slowing
      down/stopping/reversing progression of the castration resistant and taxane resistant prostate
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies in pre-clinical models and in human clinical trials have clearly established
      the potential for the use of rexinoids in the treatment and prevention of cancer. NRX 194204,
      a second generation rexinoid, is a highly potent and specific activator of RXRs. Because NRX
      194204 is significantly more selective for the RXRs relative to the RARs than a first
      generation approved drug, it is associated with fewer adverse events in clinical use. This
      study seeks to investigate NRX 194204 monotherapy in patients with castration- and taxane-
      resitant prostate cancer.
