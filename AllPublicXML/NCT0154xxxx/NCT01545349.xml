  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety of Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus GG (LGG) versus placebo in elderly subjects receiving the live attenuated influenza
      vaccine. Lactobacilli are part of the normal flora of the intestine. LGG is one of several
      strains of Lactobacilli that is used as a probiotic or microorganism administered to confer
      &quot;health benefits&quot;. Our research is focused on studying the possible therapeutic effects of
      LGG. The study hypotheses are:

        1. LGG or placebo administered twice daily will be safe and well tolerated in elderly
           subjects who have just received the live attenuated influenza vaccine,

        2. The immune response to the influenza vaccine at day 21, 28, and 56 will be higher in the
           LGG group than the placebo group,

        3. The diversity of the microbiota in nasopharyngeal and stool specimens at day 21, 28, and
           56 will be greater in the LGG group than the placebo group.

                  prevention of cardiovascular disease, some of whom may also have influenza, but
