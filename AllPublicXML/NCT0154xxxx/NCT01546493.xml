  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Femoro-acetabular impingement (FAI) is a known cause of hip pain and possibly a major cause
      of adult hip osteoarthritis. The relationship between cam-type FAI deformity characteristics
      and joint degradation to better identify 'at-risk' patients requiring corrective surgery will
      be scrutinized to gain a better understanding of the condition's natural history. The
      influence of certain morphologies (e.g. size and location of the deformity) will be analyzed
      to determine if this leads to aberrant loading of regions of the cartilage and subchondral
      bone, resulting in cartilage damage and joint degradation. Additionally, this research will
      determine if changes in the subchondral bone precede cartilage degeneration.

      The methodology for establishing the morphology/cartilage degeneration relationship includes
      Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) analysis, three-dimensional motion analysis and computer
      simulation/finite element analysis.

      The outcomes of this research may lead to a reduction in total hip replacement cases by as
      much as 70%, saving many Canadians from a painful and debilitating condition and reducing
      costs to the Canadian health care system by as much as $290 million annually.

      The research objectives are:

        1. To determine the factors of cam deformities, including morphological, functional and
           bone quality, that are associated with cartilage degeneration through shape analysis,
           kinematic analysis, MRI imaging and bone densitometry.

        2. To determine whether subchondral bone changes occur before detectable cartilage
           degeneration by examining magnetic resonance images of asymptomatic subjects who have an
           identifiable deformity.

        3. To use 3D motion and finite element analysis to examine differences in mechanical
           stimuli in the subchondral bone and cartilage that are associated with FAI, thus
           expanding our understanding of the pathomechanisms of associated degeneration.

      Three subject cohorts will be recruited: subjects with bilateral cam deformity and unilateral
      symptoms (Group I, 'active cartilage damage stage'), asymptomatic subjects with cam deformity
      (Group II, 'early stage') and asymptomatic control subjects with no deformity (Group III).

    <measure>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will undergo MRI modalities which are sensitive to biochemical markers (T1-rho) and bone porosity (ultra-short echo time [UTE]) to evaluate joint cartilage. The T1-rho imaging is used to detect early molecular and biochemical alterations to cartilage while the UTE imaging is used to assess bone porosity. MRI scans will be completely pre-operatively and at a minimum of 24 months post-operatively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Computed Tomography (qCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will undergo a CT scan of the hip (qCT) that is sensitive to the mineral content within bone tissue, and can assess bone mineral density, a strong predictor of bone strength and stiffness, which can influence the health of the cartilage. This scan will take approximately 15 minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Motion Analysis to assess hip joint function</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hip joint kinematics and contact forces will be analyzed in the same subjects undergoing imaging analysis to better understand the role of joint function in the degeneration process. Patients will have 16 pairs of surface electromyography (EMG) electrodes placed on certain area of the skin. The kinematic and kinetic data will be recorded for all 3 groups. Data will be recorded during normal level walking and during completion of simulated daily tasks (uphill, downhill walking, stairs, squatting, sitting, rising from a chair).</description>
