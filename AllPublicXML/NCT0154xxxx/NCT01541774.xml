    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the procedural safety and effectiveness of the
      Phoenix Atherectomy™ System for the treatment of de novo and restenotic atherosclerotic
      lesions located in the native peripheral arteries. The Phoenix Atherectomy™ System is
      intended for use in atherectomy of the peripheral vasculature. The intended peripheral
      vessels include the Superficial Femoral, Popliteal, and Infrapopliteal arteries. The system
      is not intended for use in the coronary, carotid, iliac or renal vasculature. The results of
      this study will be used to support a 510(k) submission to the Food and Drug Administration.
