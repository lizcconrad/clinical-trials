      This study was designed to validate the color appearance on the NORMA-SENSE gen 3. The
      NORMA-SENSE gen 3 changes color when worn by the user and comes into contact with vaginal
      secretions having an elevated pH level, without false positives due to urine remains or
      incontinence. The study will also asses the physical comfort in using NORMA-SENSE gen 3 and
      the result reading clarity which includes the ability to visualize and interpret the
      NORMA-SENSE gen 3 results.
