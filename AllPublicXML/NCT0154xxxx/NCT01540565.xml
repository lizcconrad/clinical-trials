    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well veliparib works in treating patients with epithelial
      ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back or does not respond
      to treatment. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or
      partial).

      II. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with treatment with
      veliparib (ABT-888) as assessed by the Active Version of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      II. To determine the proportion of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6
      months.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes (e.g., breast cancer [BRCA]1, Fanconi) and clinical
      characteristics, response, and patient outcome (PFS and OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

    <description>If the clinical trial goes to the second stage and there is sufficient variability in the SNPs, then patients can be categorized by the nature of their SNPs and assessed for prognostic value through survival analysis (e.g. log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards modeling). If the variability in SNPs is relatively low, assessment of prognostic value can be conducted with odds ratios of patients responding or surviving progression-free for at least 6 months. These techniques will use exact methods such as Fisher's exact test.</description>
