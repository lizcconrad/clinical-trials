  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial will examine if there are any differences between post-dates
      inductions (inductions after 40 weeks of pregnancy) begun in the morning compared to the
      evening for first-time mothers. Sleep and fatigue measures will be measured to see if they
      differ by time of induction. Other measures will include the rate of births within 24 hours
      of admission, length of labor, use of labor analgesics, and method of delivery.

      Randomized clinical trial of first-time pregnant women requiring post-dates induction
      (induction after 40 weeks gestation). Women will be randomized to a labor induction time in
      the morning or the evening. On hospital admission once women have signed the study consent,
      they will complete sleep questionnaires and a fatigue assessment. Fatigue and sleep time
      assessments will subsequently done by the study subject every 4 hours until women enter
      active labor. At the onset of active labor, assessments will stop. Labor outcomes and patient
      satisfaction will be obtained once women deliver.
