      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue and urine from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctor learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in samples from younger patients with Wilms
      tumor.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine a unique molecular &quot;finger print&quot; of primary Wilms tumor arising in
           ethnically diverse children who are at increased risk to develop this lethal malignancy
           and subsequently relapse.

        -  To determine a unique protein &quot;finger print&quot; from the urine of ethnically diverse
           children who develop Wilms tumor and subsequent relapse.

      OUTLINE: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded and snap-frozen primary tissue samples, and urine
      samples collected at the time of diagnosis and before treatment, are analyzed for molecular
      and protein profile by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy, western blotting, immunohistochemistry,
      and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays.
