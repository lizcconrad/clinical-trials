  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The US preventative services task force (USPSTF) recommends behavioral counseling in the
      primary care setting for prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, however, screening and
      counseling rarely occur. Text messaging (TM) is increasingly being used as a tool to affect
      behavior change in patients, but its effect on patients that report at-risk sexual behavior
      in the emergency department (ED) is unknown. The investigators seek to assess the feasibility
      of ED-based screening of young adult females for at-risk sexual behavior and enrolling them
      in a 3 month trial using TM to deliver information and skill building to improve health
      behavior.
