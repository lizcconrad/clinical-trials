      Retrospective study of the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine among patients with
      immune Thrombopenia (ITP).

    <textblock>
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is usually used in Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
      in order to treat mainly arthralgia or skin manifestations of this disease. A few studies
      have previously shown that HCQ could also be useful for treating autoimmune cytopenia and
      particularly autoimmune thrombopenia associated with SLE. In this retrospective study, the
      investigators have selected patients followed in our center and who have received HCQ either
      for an authentic SLE or because they had positive antinuclear antibodies (&gt; 1/160e on HEP2
      cells) without a definite SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology.

      The main goal of this study is to compare the efficacy of HCQ in these two subgroups of
      patients.

        40 patients with an immune thrombopenia with or without a definite SLE have been
        retrospectively studied. All the patients should have an ITP according to the ASH
        guidelines 2011 and have positive antinuclear antibodies (title &gt;1/160e on Hep2 cells).
