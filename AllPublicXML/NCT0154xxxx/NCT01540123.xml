  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Berry fruits are widely recognised as natural functional food products. They contain several
      different phytochemicals which have potential to modulate human health and wellbeing. There
      is however some debate regarding the mechanisms driving their health promoting properties.

      Despite the wide health promoting properties of fruit extracts reported in the literature,
      considerable interest over the past decade has primarily been focused on their roles in
      reducing risk factors associated with cancer and heart disease. Consequently, there remains a
      paucity of actual scientific information on their role in modulating brain functions, such as
      mood, learning and memory, any decrements of which have very negative impacts on the quality
      of life.

      Fruit phytochemicals from other sources have been shown to mediate both peripheral and
      cerebral blood flow. However, a modulation of cerebral blood flow has not been shown with
      berries as yet. Cerebral blood flow must be maintained to ensure a constant delivery of
      oxygen and glucose as well as the removal of waste products. The modulation of cerebral blood
      flow via supplementation of berry polyphenols could therefore be a potential way to
      positively modulate human cognitive behavior. The link between acute increases in cerebral
      blood flow and increased cognition is currently a little weak but it could give a good
      platform for long term behavioral and health benefits via increased cerebral/peripheral blood
      flow and decreased MAO-B activity.

      The aims of the study are therefore to investigate the impact of the berry extract on digital
      volume pulse, blood pressure and cerebral blood flow.
