        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Patients receiving oral anticoagulation with warfarin derived agents.

          2. Patients who have need for urgent surgery, an invasive procedure or identification of
             a patient with active bleeding where oral or parenteral vitamin K therapy is deemed
             too slow in its action for reversal of warfarin anticoagulant effects.

          3. Patients with an elevated international normalized ratio.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Patients who are clinically unstable.

          2. Patients who have congenital or acquired coagulopathies (other than warfarin therapy).

          3. Patients who have received medications that could interfere with the results of
             laboratory testing.

          4. Pregnant or nursing women.

          5. Patients participating in another clinical treatment study currently or during the
             past 1 month prior to study inclusion.

          6. Patients previously enrolled in this study.

          7. Active illicit drug use.
