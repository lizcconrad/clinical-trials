  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cabazitaxel has shown significant efficacy as second line chemotherapy after Docetaxel in men
      with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. This was demonstrated in the Tropic
      Study where Cabazitaxel showed survival superiority compared to mitoxantrone. Almost one in 4
      patients treated with Cabazitaxel in this study required dose reductions or dose delays or
      stopped treatment due to toxicity. ConCab examines another scheduling for cabazitaxel to see
      if we can improve tolerability so that patients will receive a higher percentage of the
      treatment as planned.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ConCab compares the standard treatment of cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 every three weeks with an
      experimental scheduling of 10 mg/m2 for 5 consecutive weeks of a 6 week cycle. In both study
      arms the planned cumulative dose of cabazitaxel at week 18 is 150 mg/m2. Our study aims to
      evaluate differences in the total received dose in relation to the planned dose as a measure
      of which of the 2 treatment schedules is superior.

    <description>The primary endpoint compares the cumulative dose of cabazitaxel that is received relative to the planned dose at 18 weeks of therapy. The cumulative dose of cabazitaxel in relation to the expected dose is a reflection of both tolerability and efficacy. Patients stopping treatment due to disease progression prior to week 18 will have lower relative cumulative doses as will patients with poor tolerability due to dose reductions and delays.</description>
