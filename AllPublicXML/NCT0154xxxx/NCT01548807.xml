    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 dose escalation study of an investigational agent, everolimus, given in
      combination with standard radiation therapy, in prostate cancers with a rising PSA following
      a prostatectomy. A maximum of 33 people will be enrolled on this study at the University of
      Pennsylvania. The primary objective of this study is to determine the acute and chronic
      toxicities and maximum tolerated dose of everolimus with concurrent radiation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  - Patient must have a history of prostatectomy (Open Radical or Robotic Assisted) with
             histopathologic documentation of adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Patient must have biochemical evidence of PSA including one of the following: a).
             biochemical recurrence (defined as nadir + 2 rises measured at least 2 weeks apart)
             and b). PSA doubling time of less than or equal to 6 months; OR c). persistently
             elevated PSA(PSA post prostatectomy of 0.2 ng/mL if standard assay or greater than
             0.05 if ultrasensitive PSA assay)

          -  Patient must be a candidate for salvage radiotherapy to the prostate bed

          -  Age greater or equal to 18 years

          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 1

          -  Adequate bone marrow function

          -  Adequate liver and renal function Adequate renal function: serum creatinine 1.5 x ULN

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Patient must have archival prostate tumor block available for analysis of correlatives

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - Indication for lymph node radiation (i.e. evidence of LB node metastases)

          -  Patients currently receiving anticancer therapies or who have received anticancer
             therapies within 4 weeks of the start of study drug (including chemotherapy, radiation
             therapy, antibody based therapy, etc.)

          -  Patients, who have had a major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks
             of start of study drug, patients who have not recovered from the side effects of any
             major surgery (defined as requiring general anesthesia) or patients that may require
             major surgery during the course of the study

          -  Prior treatment with any investigational drug within the preceding 4 weeks

          -  Patients receiving chronic, systemic treatment with corticosteroids or another
             immunosuppressive agent. Topical or inhaled corticosteroids are allowed.

          -  Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated liver vaccines within one
             week of study entry or during study period. Close contact with those who have received
             attenuated liver vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus. Examples
             of live vaccines include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio,
             BCG, yellow fever, varicella and TY21a typhoid vaccines.

          -  Other malignancies within the past 3 years except for adequately treated carcinoma of
             the cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.

          -  Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other
             conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as:

               1. . Symptomatic congestive heart failure of New York heart Association Class III or
                  IV

               2. . unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial
                  infarction within 6 months of start of study drug, serious uncontrolled cardiac
                  arrhythmia or any other clinically significant cardiac disease

               3. . severely impaired lung function as defined as spirometry and DLCO that is 50%
                  of the normal predicted value and/or 02 saturation that is 88% or less at rest on
                  room air

               4. . uncontrolled diabetes

               5. . active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infections

               6. . liver disease such as cirrhosis or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class
                  C).

        Note: A detailed assessment of Hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors must be done
        at screening for all patients. HBV DNA and HCV RNA PCR testing are required at screening
        for all patients with a positive medical history based on risk factors and/or confirmation
        of prior HBV/HCV infection.

          -  A known history of HIV seropositivity as everolimus has immunosuppressant properties

          -  Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of everolimus (e.g., ulcerative disease,
             uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel
             resection)

          -  Patients with an active, bleeding diathesis

          -  Patients who have received prior treatment with an mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus,
             temsirolimus, everolimus).

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to everolimus (RAD001) or other rapamycins
             (sirolimus, temsirolimus) or to its excipients

          -  History of noncompliance to medical regimens

          -  Patients unwilling to or unable to comply with the protocol

          -  Male patient whose sexual partner(s) are WOCBP who are not willing to use adequate
