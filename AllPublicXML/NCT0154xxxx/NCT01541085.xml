      The purpose of this study is to study the kinetics (study of the rate of change) of immune
      recovery quality and function in stored plasma blood samples of treatment-naive (not
      previously treated with antiretroviral drugs) patients with advanced human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV) infection starting a Darunavir/Ritonavir- or Efavirenz-based highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen.

      This is an ex-vivo study (study which takes place outside the organism and records immune
      parameters from stored blood and cells of a defined population without any intervention by
      the researcher) to evaluate the kinetics (study of the rate of change) of immune recovery
      quality and function in stored plasma blood samples of treatment-naive (not previously
      treated with antiretroviral drugs) patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      infection starting a Darunavir/Ritonavir (DRV/r)- or Efavirenz (EFV)-based highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen. In previously stored plasma blood samples, the role
      of DRV/r compared with EFV in reducing T-lymphocyte activation, DRV/r compared with EFV in
      recovering T-lymphocyte immune phenotype in peripheral blood and thymic production, and DRV/r
      compared with EFV in recovering T-lymphocyte function (functional immunity) will be studied.
      Blood samples will be analyzed before (baseline) and up to 48 weeks after initiating HAART.

      Each patient will receive orally administered (given by mouth) regimens of either
      Darunavir/Ritonavir (DRV/r) + Tenofovir/Emtricitabina or Efavirenz (EFV) +
      Tenofovir/Emtricitabina.
