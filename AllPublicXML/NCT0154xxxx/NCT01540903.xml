      The proposed trial will evaluate whether relatively non immune populations in endemic
      countries can be effectively infected with aseptic, purified, cryopreserved sporozoites
      (PfSPZ Challenge) given intradermally.

    <textblock>
      Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) is a critical component of malaria vaccine and drug
      development and is an important element of any strategy for accelerating the development of
      new tools for malaria control, elimination and eradication. Until now, CHMI has been
      performed in malaria naïve subjects from countries not endemic for malaria using both
      infectious mosquitoes and recently, aseptic, purified, cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum
      sporozoites (PfSPZ). Results from these studies report significant infection success in all
      study subjects and an excellent safety profile.

      The conduct of CHMI studies in malaria endemic populations will allow early understanding of
      responses to new vaccines and drugs in endemic country populations and for direct comparisons
      between previously exposed and non-exposed individuals. Performing CHMI studies in malaria
      endemic countries will reduce associated costs, speed-up the process of testing and
      substantially contribute to the acceleration of the malaria vaccine and drug research and
      development processes.

      This study to be conducted in Bagamoyo, Tanzania, aims to see whether people in endemic
      countries with minimal previous history of malaria are suitable for CHMI using PfSPZ
      Challenge. This study will also assess whether the success rate of the experiment is improved
      by lowering the volume of injection and increasing the number of inoculations. Hence, the
      study will contribute towards improvements in the CHMI studies using syringe and needle
      inoculation of sporozoites.

    <description>Thick smears will be performed according to a standard operating procedure. In short, 15 μL of whole blood will be distributed on standardized 3-well slides, providing an equal slide thickness for all smears. Slides are dried and stained with Giemsa. 200 fields per slide will be read at 1000X. Slides are considered positive if they contain 2 or more parasites per 200 fields.</description>

    <description>qRT-PCR will be performed according to standard procedure described in Hermsen et al. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 118: 247-251. In short, qRT-PCR will be performed on the multicopy 18S ribosomal RNA gene. Cultured P. falciparum ring stage parasites are taken as a positive control. All samples are spiked with murine white blood cells, and a murine albumin gene PCR is used to determine efficacy of DNA isolation.</description>

The following signs and symptoms will be solicited: fever, headache, malaise, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain (Verhage, Telgt, Bousema, Hermsen, van Gemert, van der Meer, &amp; Sauerwein 2005), chest pain, palpitations and shortness of breath.</description>
