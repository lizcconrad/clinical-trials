  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare the rate of successful establishment of a
      central venous catheter in the first two attempts of ultrasound-guided puncture between two
      techniques: (1) a subclavian technique versus (2) an axillary technique.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives of this study are to compare the following between the two
      techniques:

        -  the success rate of the establishment of a central venous catheter

        -  the success rate of establishment of a central venous catheter at the first attempt at
           venipuncture

        -  for non-failures (eg, a catheter is placed in the first four trys), time to cannulation

        -  the presence / absence of the following complications:

        -  arterial puncture (yes / no)

        -  pneumothorax (yes / no)

        -  hemothorax (yes / no)

        -  hematoma (yes / no)

        -  nerve injury (yes / no)

        -  aberrant course (yes / no)

      The reasons catheter placement failures will also be described.
