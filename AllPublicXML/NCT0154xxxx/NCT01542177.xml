  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a diagnostic study to look for low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) in pancreatic cancer
      using an imaging test called positron emission tomography (PET). Hypoxia can influence how
      pancreatic cancer grows and responds to treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The
      use of PET scans to measure hypoxia may be better and simpler than the approaches used
      previously. This study will assess whether or not PET scans using a tracer called 18F-FAZA
      (18F-Fluoroazomycin Arabinoside) can provide useful information about hypoxia in pancreatic
      cancer. Also as part of the study, a blood sample will be taken to study biomarkers
      (substances in the body that may be important indicators of hypoxia and/or pancreatic cancer)
      that may be useful in studying pancreatic cancer and hypoxia.

      This is a single centre, single arm hypoxia study of pancreatic cancer with PET FAZA imaging.

      PET-CT imaging of tumor hypoxia with FAZA will be done prior to the start of standard
      treatment for pancreatic cancer with chemotherapy. The FAZA PET-CT imaging session will last
      approximately 2.5 hours and include an initial dynamic scan to completely characterize the
      initial rapid phase of FAZA uptake, followed by a later static scan.
