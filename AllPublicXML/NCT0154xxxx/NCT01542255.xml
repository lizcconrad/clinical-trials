      SUMMARY: Metronomic Therapy in Patients with Metastatic Melanoma: A Phase II Study of Low
      Dose Vinblastine, Cyclophosphamide, and Dacarbazine.

      Patients with measurable metastatic melanoma are eligible. All patients will be treated as
      outlined below with combined vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, and dacarbazine. Patients will be
      treated continuously, until evidence of progression of disease, or for up to two cycles
      following disappearance of all disease. A cycle will be defined as three weeks of continuous
      therapy with a one week rest.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low dose continuous chemotherapy, called metronomic chemotherapy, is designed to target
      vascular cells and inhibit tumor growth and metastasises. A recent study in a melanoma mouse
      model has identified low dose vinblastine, cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine as a treatment
      which improves the animal's survival and is superior to full dose dacarbazine alone. This
      clinical trial seeks to translate this laboratory model directly into metastatic melanoma
      patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Metastatic melanoma with measurable disease

          -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks from their last immunotherapy, radiation, surgery or
             chemotherapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas) and recovered from all ill

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥60%

          -  Life expectancy ≥ twelve weeks

          -  Adequate end organ function

          -  Women should not be lactating and, if of childbearing age, have a negative pregnancy
             test within two weeks of entry to the study.

          -  Appropriate Contraception in both sexes

          -  The patient must be competent and signed informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA
