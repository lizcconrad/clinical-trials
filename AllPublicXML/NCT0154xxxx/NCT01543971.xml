  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I Study to be conducted in 18 healthy volunteers. Each will receive daily
      injections for 5 days of TXA127 alone, or Neupogen alone, or TXA127 plus Neupogen together.

      The aim of the study is to determine the safety of the TXA127 alone and in combination with
      Neupogen, and to determine whether the use of TXA127 alone or in combination with Neupogen
      enhances peripheral blood stem cell (CD34+)mobilization.

      In this double-blinded comparison study, healthy volunteers will be randomized to one of 3
      treatment groups: (Group A) TXA127 at 300 mcg/kg once a day for 5 days or (Group B) Neupogen
      10 mcg/kg once a day for 5 days or (Group C) both together once a day for 5 days, these
      treatments administered by subcutaneous injection, to increase peripheral blood stem cell
      (CD34+) concentrations in healthy volunteers.

      A minimum of 18 healthy male and female volunteer Subjects (6 in each treatment group) who
      meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled in this study.
      Subjects will be recruited from the study center's existing database of healthy volunteers
      and/or by advertising. A sufficient number of alternate volunteers will be screened and
      checked-in on Day 0 to ensure 6 eligible healthy volunteers are enrolled on Day 1 in each
      treatment group. Subjects will remain housed in teh Unit during the conduct of this study.

      Safety: Predose blood samples will be collected immediately prior to receiving the study
      medication(s), as well as at 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours and 16 hours post-dose.
