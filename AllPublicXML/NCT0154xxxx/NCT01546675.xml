    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study was to conduct a head-to-head comparison of two designs for
      transhumeral level upper limb prosthetic sockets: a traditional socket design and a socket
      design hypothesized to provide greater skeletal stabilization. The investigators comparisons
      included assessments of patient comfort and satisfaction with fit, as well as dynamic
      kinematic assessment using X-Ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM) a novel
      high-speed, high-resolution, bi-plane video radiography system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past decade, advances in upper limb socket design and technology have been proposed to
      increase comfort and decrease perceived weight of the prosthesis. There have been no
      scientific studies to date that have evaluated the benefits of these designs, and thus no
      evidence to support use of one type of prosthetic socket design over another. Thus, the
      overall purpose of this pilot study was to conduct a head-to-head comparison of two designs
      for transhumeral level upper limb prosthetic sockets: a traditional socket design and a
      socket design hypothesized to provide greater skeletal stabilization.

    <measure>Degrees of Shoulder Abduction Within the Prosthetic Socket</measure>
    <time_frame>After 4 weeks of home use (2 weeks for each socket style)</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder abduction was performed to the subject's maximum elevation. Skeletal and socket kinematics were calculated using the markerless auto-registration algorithm and X-Ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM)</description>

    <measure>Degrees of Shoulder Internal Rotation Within the Prosthetic Socket</measure>
    <time_frame>After 4 weeks of home use (2 weeks for each socket style)</time_frame>
    <description>Isometric internal rotation was performed with the prosthetic elbow flexed to 90 degrees and shoulder in neutral position. Skeletal and socket kinematics were calculated using the markerless auto-registration algorithm and X-Ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM)</description>

    <measure>Degrees of Shoulder Displacement Within the Prosthetic Socket</measure>
    <time_frame>After 4 weeks of home use (2 weeks for each socket style)</time_frame>
    <description>A shoulder shrug task was achieved by pulling up on a strap attached to the load cell, which was mounted on the vertical face of the concrete pedestal. Skeletal and socket kinematics were calculated using the markerless auto-registration algorithm and X-Ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trinity Amputations and Prosthetics Experience Satisfaction Scale (TAPES)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 4 weeks of home use (2 weeks for each socket style)</time_frame>
    <description>This 10 item scale includes items related to satisfaction with aspects of the prosthesis. It includes questions about extent of satisfaction regarding functional characteristics of the artificial limb: reliability, comfort, fit, and overall satisfaction, contentment with cosmetic characteristics of the device. Each item is rated on a 5 point scale from very dissatisfied to very satisfied. Scores are summed and the average of the 10 items are calculated. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction. Scores range from 1-5.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) - Utility Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>after 2 weeks of home use of each socket type</time_frame>
    <description>The 8-item utility subscale includes items related to prosthetic socket utility including: comfort, fit, ease of donning and doffing and feel on the residual limb. All items were scored using a 1 to 7 Likert scale average with lower scores indicated worse ratings and higher scores indicated better ratings. The scores for each item were added and the total score was the average of scores for all items, thus scores could range from 1 to 7.</description>

    <measure>Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) - Residual Limb Health Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>After 4 weeks of home use (2 weeks for each socket style)</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-item residual limb health scale includes items about the bothersome of sweating, smell, swelling, ingrown hairs, rashes and blisters. All items were scored using a 1 to 7 Likert scale average with lower scores indicated worse ratings and higher scores indicated better ratings. The scores for each item were added and the total score was the average of scores for all items, thus scores could range from 1 to 7.</description>

        <title>Trinity Amputations and Prosthetics Experience Satisfaction Scale (TAPES)</title>
        <description>This 10 item scale includes items related to satisfaction with aspects of the prosthesis. It includes questions about extent of satisfaction regarding functional characteristics of the artificial limb: reliability, comfort, fit, and overall satisfaction, contentment with cosmetic characteristics of the device. Each item is rated on a 5 point scale from very dissatisfied to very satisfied. Scores are summed and the average of the 10 items are calculated. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction. Scores range from 1-5.</description>

          <title>Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) - Residual Limb Health Subscale</title>
          <description>The 6-item residual limb health scale includes items about the bothersome of sweating, smell, swelling, ingrown hairs, rashes and blisters. All items were scored using a 1 to 7 Likert scale average with lower scores indicated worse ratings and higher scores indicated better ratings. The scores for each item were added and the total score was the average of scores for all items, thus scores could range from 1 to 7.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>These results cannot be generalized outside of this small sample and may have been different if the intervention socket had been optimized. Additional research is needed to expand our understanding of the impact of prosthetic socket designs.</limitations_and_caveats>
