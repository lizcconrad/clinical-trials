  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to assess safety and efficacy of allogeneic Mesenchymal stem Cell (MSC) in
      Crohn's disease refractory or intolerant to conventional therapies. Twenty patients with
      active refractory Crohn's disease defined by a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) &gt; 220
      despite conventional treatment will be included over 4 years in this phase I-II trial. This
      will be a pilot open label trial. Patients will be treated with 2 successive injections of
      allogeneic MSC at baseline and 4 weeks later. Patients will be followed up at weeks 2, 4, 8
      and 12.

      1. Collection and expansion of MSC Bone marrow collection and MSC expansion cultures will
           be carried out at the Laboratory of Cell and Gene Therapy (LTCG) at the University of
           Liège. Bone marrow (50 ml) will be collected from unrelated donors under local
           anesthesia, mononuclear cells will be isolated, and cultured for a total of about 4
           weeks. After a sufficient number of passages, the cells will be harvested, washed and
           frozen.

        2. MSC injections MSC will be thawed and diluted at the Laboratory of Cell and Gene Therapy
           (LTCG), transported to the hospital ward and injected intravenously within 1 hour of
           thawing through a central catheter (when available) or a good peripheral vein. A dose of
           1.5 - 2.0 x 106/kg recipient MSC should be ideally administered at each infusion. MSC
           will be infused even if the number of post-thaw cells is lower than that. Patients with
           Crohn's disease will receive two injections of allogenic MSC 4 weeks apart (week 0 and
           4).

        3. Patients Follow up

      3.1. Quality controls of MSC products Quality controls of MSC product will include
      microscopy, nucleated cell count and differential, cell viability testing, microbiology
      testing (including standard virology, bacterial culture and detection of mycoplasmal enzymes
      by bioluminescence, endotoxin testing, karyotype and FACS analysis (cells must be positive
      for :CD90 &gt; 70%,CD105 &gt; 70 %,CD73 &gt; 70 %; and negative for :CD14 &lt; 5%,CD34 &lt; 5%, CD45 &lt; 5%,
      CD3 &lt; 1%).

      3.2. Toxicities of cell infusions: Potential toxicities associated with MSC infusions will be
      carefully monitored per the institution's standards and documented on the infusion report
      and/or the SAE report form. No dosage modifications are scheduled. In case of severe reaction
      to the first MSC infusion, the second infusion will not be performed.

      3.3. Clinical data The following parameters will be followed at baseline as well as at week
      2, 4, 8 and 12 : CDAI level, CRP levels, fecal calprotectin levels. In addition, duration of
      hospitalization, infections, any other serious complication, and eath and survival will be
      recorded.

      3.4. Immunologic data: Immune function in the patient will be monitored at baseline and
      appropriate intervals: nucleated cell count and differential; FACS analysis with
      determination of the % cells (on total WBC) with the markers :CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+,
      CD45RA+, CD45RO+, CD56+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+; CD3+CD56+; CD4+CD45RA+, CD4+CD45RO+; CD3-CD56+;
      regulatory T-cell (Treg) levels; immunoglobulin levels, Vβ repertoire of T lymphocytes; TRECs
      quantification in T lymphocytes.
