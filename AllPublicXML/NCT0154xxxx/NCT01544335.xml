  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether measuring the fluid in your arms using
      Bioimpedance Spectroscopy is as effective at detecting and monitoring lymphedema as
      measurements with the Perometer. The investigators will also evaluate any symptoms you may
      experience in your arms during and after treatment for breast cancer with a questionnaire.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the study whenever you have an arm volume measurement using the Perometer, we will
      also measure the fluid in your arms using Bioimpedance Spectroscopy. These measurements are
      made by passing a harmless electrical signal of very low strength through your body to
      determine the difference in the amount of fluid in each arm. The test is simple and painless,
      and takes about 3 minutes. In addition, whenever you have an arm measurement, you will be
      asked to complete a questionnaire. While completing the questionnaire, you can skip any
      questions you do not wish to answer. The questionnaires will take about 10 minutes to
      complete. Arm measurements with the Perometer and Bioimpedance Spectroscopy and completion of
      the questionnaire will occur every 4-7 months when you are at MGH for regular medical visits.

    <measure>Correlation of impedance ratios obtained through bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS)with perometric relative arm volume change (RVC) and self-reported symptom data</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation of volumetric measurements obtained using Perometry with impedance ratios obtained through BIS at the baseline examination and during follow-up visits. Impedance ratios will also be correlated with symptoms indicated in the LEFT-BC questionnaires completed during each examination. Volumetric arm measurements from perometry will be quantified using the RVC formula, which will be compared with impedance ratios calculated using the BIS device software.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare relationship between lymphedema diagnostic criteria corresponding to BIS, perometry, and self-reported symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Relationship among diagnostic criteria pertaining to BIS, perometry, and self-reported symptoms. A change of &gt;3 Standard Deviations in impedance ratios compared to pre-surgical baseline is considered diagnostic for lymphedema when BIS is utilized. A relative volume change of &gt;5% - &gt;10% compared to baseline is considered lymphedema by perometry. Self-report of symptoms including feelings of swelling, heaviness, and tightness are often considered as criteria for lymphedema.</description>

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer who will be returning
        routinely for follow-up at Massachusetts General Hospital

    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive or in-situ carcinoma of the breast

          -  Participants must have undergone sentinel node mapping or axillary dissection

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 1 year.

          -  Willingness to comply with required follow up Perometer and BIS measurements and
             completion of LEFT-BC questionnaire

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have known metastatic disease or other locally advanced disease in the
             thoracic or cervical regions

          -  Any patient who will not be returning routinely for follow-up at MGH or DFHCC

          -  Participants with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of primary lymphedema

          -  History of prior surgery or radiation to the head, neck, upper limb, or trunk

          -  Participants who have evidence that axillary lymph node malignancy is causing
             lymphedema due to recurrence as per physician discretion

          -  Any patient who has bilateral lymph node mapping or dissection

          -  Any patient with a current case of cellulitis

          -  Patients with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin
