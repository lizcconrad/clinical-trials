  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate whether robot assisted laparoscopic radical
      prostatectomy give rise to the impairment of diaphragmatic function postoperatively, and
      whether combined general/epidural anesthesia could provide better postoperative diaphragmatic
      function.

    <textblock>
      Diaphragmatic dysfunction after abdominal surgery can result in extended hospital stay and
      increased medical costs, because it is related with atelectasis, lung collapse or pneumonia.
      The mechanism of diaphragm dysfunction is thought to be from not only direct injury to
      abdominal wall and viscera but inhibitory reflexes of phrenic activity. Thoracic or upper
      abdominal surgery is suggested as a risk factor of postoperative diaphragm dysfunction, and
      perioperative analgesic modality is also known to affect diaphragm movements. But there has
      been no trial to investigate the effect of laparoscopic pelvic surgery such as prostatectomy
      on diaphragm movement. Moreover, it is not clear if minimally invasive Robot-assisted
      laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) has any influence on respiratory and diaphragm
      functions.

    <description>The measurements of diaphragmatic motion were attained at the posterior surface of the diaphragm. From the tracings on M-mode, the distance between echogenic lines (DIA) in cm and diaphragm inspiratory/expiratory velocity in cm.s-1 during quiet, deep, and sniff breathing were measured on the frozen images. Three consecutive sonographic examinations were performed, and the highest value of three measurements was recorded</description>

    <description>Before the induction of anesthesia, epidural catheter was inserted in group GE at T8/9, T9/10, or T10/11 interspinous space with a 17-gauge Tuohy needle in lateral decubitus position and advanced 5 cm cephalad. .
Epidural analgesia was maintained using the patient-controlled analgesia technique containing 250 mL of 0.2% ropivacaine and 2 μg/mL fentanyl with setting of 5 mL/hr for continuous infusion and 0.5 mL of bolus dose. Lockout time was set to 15 min.
General anesthesia was induced with 2 mg/kg of propofol and 50 mg of rocuronium. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. All the patients were ventilated with controlled mode of 8 mL/kg of ideal body weight and respiratory rate was adjusted to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide between 35-40 mmHg.</description>
