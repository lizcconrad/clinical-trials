      The purpose of study is to test the efficacy of an adaptation of Motivational Interviewing to
      Address Suicidal Ideation (MI-SI) on the severity of suicidal ideation in psychiatrically
      hospitalized Veterans at high risk for suicide.

    <textblock>
      Veterans who receive health care from the VA are at elevated risk for suicide, and the number
      of Veterans at high risk may be growing. Although the months following discharge from
      psychiatric hospitalization are a period of acute risk for Veterans, there is a dearth of
      empirically supported treatments tailored to psychiatric inpatients and no studies examining
      treatments for psychiatrically hospitalized Veterans. This randomized controlled trial will
      test the efficacy of an adaptation of Motivational Interviewing to Address Suicidal Ideation
      (MI-SI) on the severity of suicidal ideation in psychiatrically hospitalized Veterans at high
      risk for suicide. Participants will be recruited from the Acute Psychiatric Inpatient Unit at
      the Syracuse VA Medical Center. To meet high-risk criteria, Veterans must score over two on
      the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), which is prospectively predictive of death by
      suicide. Participants will complete a screening assessment to confirm eligibility and a
      baseline assessment of risk factors for suicide. They will be randomized to receive
      Motivational Interviewing to Address Suicidal Ideation (MI-SI) plus treatment as usual (TAU),
      or TAU alone. The MI-SI group will receive two sessions of MI-SI during hospitalization and
      one telephone booster session after discharge. Participants in both conditions will be asked
      to complete telephone follow-up interviews at 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge. Change in
      the severity of suicidal ideation will be measured using the SSI.
