      The aim of this study is to reduce the number of subsequent hospital admissions and/or
      emergency department (ED) visits for hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) by utilizing a respiratory care practitioner-led disease management (RCP-DM)
      program compared to standard discharge instructions and planning.

      The investigators propose to carry out a prospective, randomized, trial at Barnes-Jewish
      Hospital (1250-bed urban academic hospital). Eligible patients will be identified by a senior
      study coordinator who will also obtain informed consent for study participation. Adults
      greater than 18 years of age and less than 65 years of age will be eligible for enrollment if
      the lead investigator and the treating physician agree that the patient meets the enrollment
      criteria which include the following: patients with spirometrically confirmed COPD at high
      risk for repeat hospitalization or ED visits as predicted by hospital admission or ED visit
      in the previous 12 months for a COPD exacerbation, chronic home use of oxygen, or a course of
      systemic corticosteroid therapy in the preceding 12 months. Exclusion criteria include
      patients not expected to survive their hospitalization, presence of metastatic cancer,
      bed-bound individuals, non-English speaking patients, and patients unable to provide informed
      consent.
