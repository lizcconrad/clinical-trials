  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Movement slowness (bradykinesia) is one of the main motor symptoms in Parkinson Disease (PD).
      Several studies have shown that patients with PD exhibit slowness because they are unable to
      modulate, in an optimal way, the velocity of voluntary motor acts not induced by external
      stimulation. Indeed, these patients have difficulties to integrate multi-sensorial
      information, mainly proprioception.

      The investigators investigated changes in shoulder velocity during pointing movements by
      patients with PD after stimulation of soft tissues (aponeurosis) of upper limb muscles. The
      stimulation consisted of manipulating, with a hook (the diacutaneous fibrolysis method), the
      aponeurotic tissues enrobing the heads of the upper limb muscles. This technique has
      previously been shown to decrease passive tension and the tendon reflex response of the
      manipulated muscle group. The investigators hypothesis is that aponeurotic manipulation of
      shoulder muscles therefore creates a modification in the proprioceptive information, which in
      return temporarily decreases the bradykinesia of shoulder movements.

    <description>Treatment consisted of manipulating, with a hook, the aponeurotic tissues enrobing the heads of the upper-limb muscles. The manipulation consisted of back and forth mobilization, applied perpendicularly to the axis of the muscular fibers. The mobilization is performed with both hands; the therapist's non-dominant hand performs a manual mobilization whereas the dominant hand follows the movement with the hook. The hook allows the therapist to be very precise about the location of the tissues that are stretched. This stretch is realized at the level of the aponeurotic fibers presenting the greatest resistance to perpendicular movement. The shape of the hook is chosen to avoid discomfort or pain during manipulation. To spread the pressure exerted by the spatula on a very local point, it is important to fill completely the curved part of the hook with the adjacent soft tissues. We manipulated muscle from the proximal insertion towards the distal, giving special attention to the tendons.</description>
