    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if walnut oral immunotherapy can be used in
      subjects allergic to tree nuts to reduce tree nut allergy and induce changes in the subject's
      immune system.

    <description>Determine in tree nut allergic subjects the effectiveness of walnut oral immunotherapy on clinical desensitization to a second tree nut (&quot;test tree nut&quot;) causing allergy when compared to placebo treatment, as measured by the change in cumulative dose from baseline oral food challenge (OFC) to the OFC to the test tree nut at approximately 38 weeks on therapy.</description>

    <description>Dosing begins with a one-day walnut oral desensitization protocol. Starting at 0.1 mg protein and increasing every thirty minutes until a maximum dose of 6 mg is reached or until allergic symptoms develop. After the initial escalation day, subjects will continue daily dosing with dosing build-every two weeks to a maximum dose of 1500mg walnut protein at 34 weeks. A daily maintenance dose (1500mg or the highest dose reached by 34 weeks) will be given for 4 weeks followed by 5 gram oral food challenges to walnut and the second tree nut (at 38 weeks), after which the study will be unblinded. Active treatment subjects will continue on maintenance dosing for up to a total of 298 weeks of therapy. Subjects reaching a qualifying specific IgE to walnut and the test tree nut at any early time point will receive a tolerance oral food challenge to the tree nuts on and 4 weeks off therapy. All subjects will have an oral food challenge on and off therapy at 142 weeks and at 298 weeks.</description>

    <description>Subjects in the placebo group will undergo the same one-day desensitization protocol as the active treatment group, consuming a maximum dose of 6 mg of oat powder (initial day escalation phase). After the initial escalation day achieving at least 1.5 mg and up to 6 mg of oat powder, the dosing build-up will occur every two weeks through dose 24 (1500mg oat flour) at ~34 weeks. A maintenance dose will be given for 4 weeks followed by a 5 gram protein double blind, placebo controlled OFC to walnut and a 5 gram protein OFC to a second tree nut (at ~38 weeks), after which the study will be unblinded. Placebo subjects that fail the OFC will be crossed over to active treatment beginning with initial escalation day.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 6 to 45 years, either sex, any race, any ethnicity with a convincing clinical
             history of walnut or another tree nut allergy and either a positive prick skin test (&gt;
             3mm) or serologic evidence of allergic sensitization (defined as specific IgE &gt; 0.35
             kU/L) to walnut and at least one other tree nut.

          -  A positive 2000 mg oral food challenge at enrollment to walnut and to one other tree
             nut.

          -  Written informed consent from participant and/or parent/guardian

          -  Written assent from all subjects as appropriate

             food challenge.

          -  Poor control or persistent activation of atopic dermatitis

          -  Active eosinophilic or other inflammatory (e.g., celiac) gastrointestinal disease in

          -  Participation in any interventional study for food allergy in the past 6 months

          -  Participant is on &quot;build-up phase&quot; of immunotherapy (i.e., has not reached maintenance
             dosing).

          -  Severe asthma (2007 NHLBI Criteria Steps 5 or 6, see Appendix 2) or poorly controlled
             mild or moderate asthma

          -  Inability to discontinue antihistamines for initial day escalation, skin testing or
             OFC

          -  Use of omalizumab or other non-traditional forms of allergen immunotherapy (e.g., oral
             or sublingual) or immunomodulator therapy (not including corticosteroids) or biologic
             therapy within the past year

          -  Use of beta-blockers (oral), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
             angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) or calcium channel blockers

          -  Pregnancy or lactation
