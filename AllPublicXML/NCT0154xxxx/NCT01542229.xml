  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As in the general population, there is no clear standard of care within Veterans Affairs
      Medical Centers for treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among individuals with
      severe mental illness (SMI). This is a considerable issue because trauma, posttraumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD), and severe psychiatric comorbidity are particularly common among
      Veterans and this symptom presentation clearly exacerbates the overall course and severity of
      mental illness. This study is significant in that it proposes to establish the efficacy of a
      frontline exposure based intervention for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Prolonged
      Exposure, for improving critical clinical, quality of life, and cost outcomes among Veterans
      with severe mental illness (SMI) enrolled in VA healthcare. Collectively, it is anticipated
      that these data will establish a much needed clinical course of action for what is considered
      a vulnerable yet highly underserved patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of this proposal is to compare the efficacy of Prolonged Exposure for
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) plus treatment as usual (PE+TAU) relative to treatment
      as usual (TAU) alone using a randomized, between groups, repeated measures design. One
      hundred fifty six (156) ethnically/racially diverse male and female Veterans with
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and severe mental illness (SMI) will be recruited from
      the Charleston VA and affiliated Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) during the study
      time frame. For the investigators' study purposes, severe mental illness (SMI) is defined as
      (1) the presence of a past year DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective
      disorder, bipolar disorder, or severe depression (2) resulting in persistent impairment in
      self-care, work, or social functioning. Veterans will be randomized 1:1 to one of two
      conditions: PE+TAU or TAU. The active intervention phase is 12 weeks. Veterans randomized to
      treatment as usual (TAU) will receive support services through the VA potentially inclusive
      of case management, psychotropic medication management, and/or supportive counseling and
      Veterans randomized to prolonged exposure (PE) plus treatment as usual (TAU) will receive 12
      weekly sessions of prolonged exposure (PE) in addition to treatment as usual (TAU). All
      participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, post-treatment, and at 3 and 6 months.
      Additionally, they will complete two self report forms during sessions 3, 6, and 9.
