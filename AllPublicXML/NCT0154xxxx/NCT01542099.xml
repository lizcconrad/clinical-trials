      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect site concentration of remifentanil
      blunting hemodynamic changes to tracheal intubation of single or double lumen tubes.

    <description>Heart rate and mean arterial pressure will be recorded at 2 minutes before intubation, 1 minute before intubation, during intubation, 1 minute after intubation. The mean value of heart rate and mean arterial pressure before intubation will be regarded as the baseline values. If maximum heart rate or mean arterial pressure after intubation increased by &gt;15% from baseline value, the response will be regarded as &quot;fail&quot; and increased concentration of remifentanil will be applied to next patient by up and down sequential method.</description>

    <description>According to previous patient's response, the investigators will allocate the effect site concentration of remifentanil of next patient during double lumen tube intubation. For this allocation of dose of remifentanil the investigators use up-and-down method.
For the first patient, the dose of remifentanil would be fixed at 6.0 ng/ml which we predict as EC50. And, step size of dose is 0.5ng/ml.</description>
