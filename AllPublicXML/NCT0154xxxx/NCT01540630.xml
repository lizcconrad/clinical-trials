  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized withdrawal study comparing CNV1014802 with placebo in
      patients with trigeminal neuralgia who have successfully responded to CNV1014802 in an
      initial open-label phase.

      Patients will participate in an initial open-label treatment period of 21 days of CNV1014802
      150mg three times a day (tid). Responders will be randomized to 28 days of CNV1014802 150mg
      tid or placebo.

      Following an interim analysis after 10 evaluable patients have completed the open-label
      phase, the dose regimen may be increased to 350mg twice a day (bid) for the remainder of the
      trial if the responder rate is less than 60%.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to be randomised and enter the double-blind placebo controlled phase of the study,
      patients must satisfy at least one of the following criteria:

        -  30% or more decrease in number of paroxysms (either spontaneous, evoked, or both)

        -  30% reduction in the severity of pain experienced during the paroxysm (either
           spontaneous, evoked or both)

        -  A Patient Global Improvement of Change rating of much improved/very much improved The
           response will be compared with the baseline recordings of pain made in the 7 day run-in
           period. If a patient meets one of these criteria they are termed a responder, and will
           be eligible to be randomized into the double-blind treatment phase.

      During the double-blind randomised phase, patients will be evaluated to determine if they
      meet the failure criteria at each clinic visit which will occur every 7 days in the
      double-blind treatment period. The number of failures on CNV1014802 versus number of failures
      on placebo during the double-blind treatment period will be the primary outcome of the study.

      Patients will be classified as a treatment failure if they meet one of the following
      criteria:

        -  50% increase in the frequency of paroxysms compared to the final 7 days of the
           open-label period

        -  50% increase in the severity of pain experienced in the paroxysms compared to the final
           7 days of the open-label period

        -  A Patient Global Improvement of Change rating of much worse/very much worse

        -  The patient discontinues the study due to 'Lack of Efficacy'

        -  The patient discontinues due to an adverse reaction or poor tolerability considered to
           be related to study medication
