    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to evaluate the performance of the Chembio Diagnostics Systems,
      Inc. DPP® Syphilis Screen and Confirm rapid test. The device is intended to qualitatively and
      simultaneously detect the presence of antibodies to Non-treponemal and Treponema pallidum
      antigens in whole blood (capillary and venous), serum or plasma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum.
      It is a chronic bacterial infection that remains a public health concern worldwide,
      especially in resource poor settings. Syphilis can be transmitted from infected women to
      their unborn children during pregnancy. Worldwide 12 million individuals are diagnosed with
      syphilis each year, 90% of them in developing countries. Diagnosed individuals are also at
      risk of becoming infected with and transmitting HIV [1].

      Early and appropriate diagnosis and treatment prevents the transmission and development of
      severe complications. A rapid serologic test for specific antibodies to non-Treponemal and T.
      pallidum antigens is important in the early diagnosis and treatment monitoring of syphilis
      patients. In turn, this monitoring allows for the formulation of a more successful public
      health strategy. Various serologic tests are currently available such as Venereal Disease
      Research Laboratory (VDRL), rapid plasma reagin (RPR), fluorescent Treponemal antibody
      absorption (FTA-ABS) test, T. pallidum hemagglutination (TPHA) test, immunoenzymatic assay
      (EIA), Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) test and Western blot (WB) test [2-
      5]. The Chembio DPP Syphilis Screen &amp; Confirm Assay is a unique non-Treponemal and Treponemal
      rapid point-of-care test, which is simple and easy to use. The DPP Syphilis Screen &amp; Confirm
      Assay is a qualitative immunoassay for the detection of antibodies to the non-Treponemal and
      T. pallidum antigens in serum, plasma and whole blood.
