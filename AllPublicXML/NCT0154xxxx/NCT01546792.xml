  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) is a common disorder characterised by
      interrupted breathing while sleeping. It is associated with cardiovascular problems such as
      high blood pressure, heart attack and stroke. Furthermore, most patients with OSAHS are
      overweight and have impaired quality of life. Lifestyle interventions incorporating exercise
      training, dietary advice and behaviour change have been shown to elicit favourable changes in
      quality of life, body mass/composition and cardiovascular risk in a range of patient groups.
      However, no study has investigated the impact of lifestyle modification on such health
      outcomes in patients with OSAHS. This study will address this issue by investigating the
      effects of a lifestyle intervention on quality of life, body mass/composition and
      cardiovascular risk in patients with OSAHS. A total of 60 volunteers will be recruited and
      randomly allocated to one of the two groups. Patients in the intervention group will be
      offered a 12-week individualised lifestyle programme consisting of supervised exercise
      training, dietary advice and behaviour change counselling. Patients in the control group will
      receive an educational booklet detailing healthy eating and exercise guidelines but no
      supervised or structured intervention. The results of this study will inform the design of a
      larger, multi-centre randomised controlled trial.
