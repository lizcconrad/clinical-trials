      The primary objective of the CUSTOM study is to respond to customer support issues (outside
      of the US) and to assess the impact of a particular treatment or perturbation relative to an
      initial control measurement. Sequential subject measurements will be analyzed to determine if
      a given action or condition induces a score shift, an inflation of measurement variance or
      elevated outlier rates.

      The SCOUT DS device is not yet approved by the FDA for sale in the United States, but
      currently is being marketed in Canada and other countries. Customers who are using the device
      have contacted the sponsor with questions about testing conditions which might affect the
      reproducibility of measurements.

      The objective is to obtain information to allow the Sponsor to address these issues. The
      concerns fall into three broad categories:

      â€¢ Factors affecting the interface between the skin and the test sensor

      These would include the effects of skin care products applied to the forearm, subject
      activity that changes perfusion to the skin and subject movement during the test procedure.

        -  General operating conditions Issues such as ambient temperature, lighting, and height of
           the table on which the SCOUT DS device rests have been questioned as possible factors
           influencing accuracy.

        -  Rare subject disorders

      Included here would be subject skin abnormalities or physiologic changes which occur so
      infrequently that they were not well represented in previous data sets. Examples of such rare
      conditions would include scleroderma, capillary angiomata, and Raynaud phenomenon.

    <description>The primary objective of the CUSTOM study is to respond to customer support issues and to assess the impact of a particular treatment or perturbation relative to an initial control measurement. Sequential subject measurements will be analyzed to determine if a given action or condition induces a score shift.
Subjects will undergo measurements and a diabetes risk score is generated from the SCOUT device. The scale of the score is 0-100. Subjects are not provided with this score as the device is still investigational in the US.</description>
