  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helical tomotherapy is a novel radiation treatment machine that combines two existing
      technologies: spiral radiotherapy treatments combined with simultaneous computed tomotherapy
      imaging of the body. This new machine can potentially allow radiation treatments to be
      focused more precisely, and delivered more accurately than with existing radiation machines.
      In this study, helical tomotherapy will be used to provide radiation treatments (whole brain
      radiotherapy, daily over 10 treatments) that are commonly used to treat cancer metastatic to
      the brain. In addition, the individual spots of cancer (metastases) in the brain will be
      treated to a higher dose (approximately 2 times higher) than the dose to the whole brain. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of whole brain radiation with lesion
      boosting with the helical tomotherapy machine.
