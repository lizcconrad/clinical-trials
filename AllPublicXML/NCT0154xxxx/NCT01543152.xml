    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effect on HIV viral
      load, of escalating doses of cyclophosphamide administered 1 day prior to SB-728-T infusion.

      The objectives of the study are to augment HIV-specific T-cells and to reverse or decrease
      the progressive destruction of CD4+ T-cells that leads to clinical AIDS. Levels of
      engraftment vary from negligible to about 10% of the CD4+ T-cells in the vascular
      compartment. Preliminary analyses of HAART TI suggest that an anti-HIV effect may correlate
      with the level of SB-728-T engraftment. Concurrently, non-myeloablative lymphodepletion with
      cyclophosphamide has been demonstrated to enhance engraftment of adoptively transferred
      T-cells through a variety of mechanisms. The study is being undertaken to increase SB-728-T
      engraftment through the administration of low non-myeloablative doses of cyclophosphamide.
