  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to collect data on the way gadobutrol is taken into, moves
      around, and is eliminated from, the body of children aged 0 to less than 2 years. The study
      will also evaluate safety and tolerability, and efficacy of gadobutrol.

      A maximum total amount of approximately 5 ml of blood will be needed for these analyses which
      will be drawn within 2-3 days.

      Gadobutrol is a contrast agent used for enhancement of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
      potentially allowing better visibility of tissues in the body. Children aged under 2 years
      scheduled for a routine contrast-enhanced MRI examination of any body region may take part in
      this study, in which case they will receive gadobutrol as contrast agent intravenously at the
      standard dose of 0.1 mmol/kg (0.1 ml/Kg) of body weight. Only subjects without renal
      insufficiency of any intensity (i.e. estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate &lt;80% of age
      adjusted normal value calculated based on the Schwartz formula) will be included in the
      trial.

      The duration of this study as a whole is around 1 year and the total number of children to be
      enrolled is 50. A child will be expected to take part in the study for around 7 days.

    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC) From Time 0 to Infinity of Gadobutrol: Individual</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples were collected at 3 timepoints between 15 minutes and 8 hours post administration of gadobutrol</time_frame>
    <description>AUC is a measure of systemic drug exposure, which is obtained by collecting a series of blood samples and measuring the concentrations of drug in each sample. AUC from time 0 (start of injection) to infinity was reported in micromole*hour per liter (micromole*h/L).</description>

    <measure>Body Weight-Normalized Total Body Clearance (CL) of Gadobutrol From Plasma: Individual</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples were collected at 3 timepoints between 15 minutes and 8 hours post administration of gadobutrol</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance is the volume of the fluid presented to the eliminating organ that is effectively completely cleared of drug per unit time and depends on the rate of elimination. CL of gadobutrol normalized for body weight, was reported in Liter per hour per kilogram (L/(h*kg).</description>

    <measure>Body Weight-Normalized Apparent Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss) of Gadobutrol in Plasma: Individual</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples were collected at 3 timepoints between 15 minutes and 8 hours post administration of gadobutrol</time_frame>
    <description>Vss is an estimate of drug distribution independent of the elimination process and is proportional to the amount of drug in the body versus the drug plasma concentration at steady-state.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Residence Time (MRT) of Gadobutrol in Plasma: Individual</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples were collected at 3 timepoints between 15 minutes and 8 hours post administration of gadobutrol</time_frame>
    <description>MRT is the average time that the molecules introduced into the body stay in the body. MRT of Gadobutrol is expressed in hours.</description>

    <measure>Terminal Elimination Half-Life (t1/2) of Gadobutrol From Plasma: Individual</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples were collected at 3 timepoints between 15 minutes and 8 hours post administration of gadobutrol</time_frame>
    <description>Half-life refers to the elimination of the drug, that is, the time it takes for the blood plasma concentration to reach half the concentration. Terminal elimination half-life of gadobutrol from plasma is expressed in hours and is derived from the terminal slope of the concentration versus time curve.</description>

    <measure>Simulation of Plasma Concentration of Gadobutrol at 20 Minutes Post-Injection (C20)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>Simulation is the use of the model to predict data other than observed data, in this case early Gadobutrol plasma concentration after intravenous injection. Plasma concentration serves as a surrogate for efficacy (signal and contrast enhancement) in MRI. C20 was simulated for virtual pediatric subjects with homogenous distribution over age. Simulated median (5th and 95th percentile in parenthesis) gadolinium plasma concentrations for a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight were presented.</description>

A Serious AE (SAE) was an AE resulting in death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening experience, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly, or deemed significant for any other reason. The drug-relatedness of AEs was determined by the Investigator based on his/her clinical decision based on all available information, and was based on the question whether there was a &quot;reasonable causal relationship&quot; to the study treatment.</description>

        <title>Simulation of Plasma Concentration of Gadobutrol at 20 Minutes Post-Injection (C20)</title>
        <description>Simulation is the use of the model to predict data other than observed data, in this case early Gadobutrol plasma concentration after intravenous injection. Plasma concentration serves as a surrogate for efficacy (signal and contrast enhancement) in MRI. C20 was simulated for virtual pediatric subjects with homogenous distribution over age. Simulated median (5th and 95th percentile in parenthesis) gadolinium plasma concentrations for a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight were presented.</description>

        <description>The degree of visualization of internal morphology and structure was recorded on a 3-point scale: 1 = Poor, the structure and internal morphology of the lesion or vessel is poorly visible; 2 = Moderate, the structure and internal morphology of the lesion or vessel is visible but sufficient information cannot be obtained; 3 = Good, the structure and internal morphology of the lesion or vessel is sufficiently visible for diagnostic purposes. Results per body regions were reported. Evaluation was done on pre-injection and combined (pre- and post-injection) images.</description>

        <title>Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) Prior to Gadobutrol Injection</title>
        <description>eGFR was calculated based on the Schwartz formula with blood sampling for serum creatinine (Scr) not exceeding 14 days prior to gadobutrol injection. Otherwise, the eGFR was obtained from the original Schwartz formula: eGFR = k * height / Scr where k = 0.45 in term newborn infants &lt; 1 year of age, and k = 0.55 in children up to 13 years of age. If Scr was measured by an enzymatic creatinine method that had been calibrated to be traceable to Isotope dilution mass spectroscopy (IDMS), the updated Schwartz formula was used: eGFR = 0.413*height/Scr.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who received study drug. A Serious AE (SAE) was an AE resulting in death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening experience, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly, or deemed significant for any other reason. The drug-relatedness of AEs was determined by the Investigator based on his/her clinical decision based on all available information, and was based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to the study treatment.</description>
