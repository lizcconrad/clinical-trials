    <textblock>
      The DAXOR Corporation manufactures and distributes a blood volume analyzer. The analysis is
      based on the tracer dilution principle utilizing radioiodine labeled human serum albumin. In
      addition to calculating human blood volume it is hypothesized that measurement of the
      dilution of the tracer can also yield an accurate measurement of total body albumin.

    <textblock>
      Twenty adult individuals underwent a standard blood volume measurement. The specimens for
      this determination are normally collected over a period of approximately 40 minutes. For the
      determination of total body albumin, additional specimens were collect over a three to four
      day period until the counts in the blood specimens were stable. Calculation of the degree of
      dilution over this time interval is thought to represent dilution of the tracer in albumin in
      both the intra and extravascular space. The ratio of albumin in the intravascular to the
      extravascular space is available in the medical literature. The total volume in which the
      tracer is distributed can be determined from the dilution determined. A calculation of total
      body albumin is therefore possible. Computation of the total body albumin for the test
      subjects (all normal individuals) was consistent with values for total body albumin in the
      literature. The purpose of the development of this method is to permit clinicians to
      determine albumin status in patients with disturbances in albumin such as burn patients,
      cirrhotic patients, nephrotic patients as well as patients with protein losing
      gastroenteropathies.
