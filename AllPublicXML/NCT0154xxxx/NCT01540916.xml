  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alterations of acid-base equilibrium are very common in critically ill patients. Thus,
      understanding their pathophysiology and the possible compensatory mechanisms acting in
      different organs may play an important role in better set the consequent clinical treatment.
      The lung and the kidney are the two principal actors of such regulations. Although the
      respiratory response to acid-base alterations is well understood, less information are
      available for what the renal system is concerned. Such lack of information is partially due
      to: 1) the historical consideration of the kidney as a &quot;slow&quot; organ, in response to
      variations in acid-base equilibrium; 2) the lack of a monitoring system to closely assess
      renal response.

      Our group has recently developed a monitoring system aimed at analyzing, in a
      quasi-continuous and non-invasive manner (every 10 min) the urinary profile in terms of
      urinary pH and electrolyte concentrations (sodium, potassium, chloride, ammonium).

      The investigators hypothesize that the renal system reacts to large as well as to minimal
      variations of the acid-base equilibrium (especially induced by a variation in the respiratory
      function) in a very fast way, modifying the urinary concentration (and therefore the urinary
      excretion) of ammonium and some electrolytes (especially chloride).

      Primary aim:

      To investigate the acute renal response to respiratory alterations of acid-base equilibrium
      in order to better understand the underlying physiological mechanisms and to evaluate the
      validity of a renal monitoring system to indirectly assess the effectiveness of the
      respiratory function.

      Secondary aim:

      To collect data on the chronic response of the renal system in patients affected by chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as on the acute response to acute variation of
      the chronic respiratory acidosis characterizing patients affected by COPD exacerbation.

      Study protol:

      Mechanically ventilated patients will undergo controlled variation of the ventilatory setting
      (hyperventilation vs. hypoventilation) in order to induce a controlled reduction or increase
      in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (and an increase or reduction of arterial pH),
      within normal range of pH (7.35 - 7.45) During the variations, urinary concentrations of
      electrolytes and pH will be monitored.
