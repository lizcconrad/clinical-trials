    <textblock>
      Data on smoking and POP are conflicting. In a study done by Alnaif et al, smoking was found
      to be associated with severe POP. The authors' proposed explanation was that smoking impairs
      tissue and wound healing. Our primary objective is to document whether smokers with pelvic
      organ prolapse (POP) are different from non-smokers with POP with respect to collagen
      biosynthesis and breakdown using systemic markers of collagen metabolism and Vitamin C.

      Tissue destructive disorders are more common in smokers than in non-smokers. Alterations in
      wound healing and connective tissue turnover are suggested mechanisms, but exact details
      remain to be discovered. The synthesis of subcutaneous collagen in smokers is specifically
      impeded, and that smokers have less collagen compared to non-smokers. Jorgensen et al study
      showed that smokers tend to have less procollagen I N-propeptide (PINP) levels in the blood,
      less vitamin C and higher levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9), these findings reversed
      after smoking cessation.

      Since smoking is one of the promoting and modifiable factors in the development of prolapse,
      understanding its effects on the support of pelvic organs may help modify the course of the
      POP condition in the future. Understanding the connective tissue effects of smoking using
      systemic markers of collagen metabolism in female smokers with prolapse may help future
      management and counseling of these patients. In addition, description of the markers of
      collagen metabolism in POP has not previously been documented.
