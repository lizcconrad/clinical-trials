      This is an open-labeled, randomized, multicenter, prospective, parallel group, interventional
      study to demonstrate the effectiveness of 24 weeks treatment with Vildagliptin 50mg bid as
      add on to metformin 500 mg bid compared to metformin up to 1000 mg bid in Chinese patients
      with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on sub maximal dosage metformin monotherapy.

    <description>The change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c(HbA1c) after 24 weeks treatment in vildagliptin 50 mg bid used in combination with metformin 500 mg bid is not inferior to that with metformin up to 1000 mg bid as monotherapy after 24 weeks</description>

    <description>Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Serious adverse events are any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgment of investigators represent significant hazards.</description>
