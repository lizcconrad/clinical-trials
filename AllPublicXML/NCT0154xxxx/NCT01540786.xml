  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify differences in bladder contractions during the storage phase (non
      voiding activities) between OAB subjects and healthy subjects, using high resolution
      urodynamics.

      The study is divided into two parts:

        -  PART 1: Consists of 5 females with overactive bladder

        -  PART 2: Consists of 25 females with overactive bladder and 15 healthy females

      Part 1 subjects will be enrolled followed by part 2 subjects. The data from part 1 subjects
      will be reviewed and analysed by a group of experts before starting the second part (part 2)
      of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will complete a total of 2 visits and a follow up telephone call (or visit at
      the investigator's discretion).

      Upon meeting eligibility criteria subjects will be screened and complete visit at hospital
      (Visit 1). They will then be asked to complete procedures such micturition diary,
      questionnaires and if applicable discontinued their ongoing OAB medication. Upon confirmation
      of eligibility criteria subjects will then be enrolled and complete visit 2 within 6 to 31
      days post V1. At Visit 2 subjects will complete high resolution urodynamic assessment
      followed by the conventional urodynamic assessment. The visit will take approximately half a
      day. Safety follow up phone call (or visit at investigator's discretion) will take place 4 to
      6 days post visit 2.

    <description>NVA is defined as changes of pressure in the bladder lumen. These changes are measured as detrusor pressure (Pdet) calculated from substraction of intra-abdominal pressure (Pabd) from intra-vesical pressure (Pves). All Pdet with an amplitude of at least 1cm of water, frequency below 0.2 Hz and pulse duration between 5 and 60 seconds qualify as NVA.</description>
