  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot, phase II, 24-week study will recruit a total of 10 patients and will evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of acitretin in patients with severe chronic hand dermatitis .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive acitretin once daily for a maximum of 24 weeks. Patients who reach a
      Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of clear or almost clear at week 12 will end the study.
      Patients who do not reach a PGA of clear or almost clear at week 12 will continue treatment
      up to week 24. The starting dose will be 10mg/day and, if well tolerated, will be increased
      in the first 4 weeks to a maximum of 30 mg/day.
