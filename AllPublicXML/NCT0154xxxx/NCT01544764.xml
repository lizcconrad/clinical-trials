  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The North Carolina Immunization Branch will evaluate the use of the CDC program to improve
      adolescent vaccination practices (called Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, and eXchanges, or
      AFIX). This evaluation is the first of its kind in the nation and may have a profound impact
      on prevention.

      AFIX has four major components: 1) Assessment of a provider's current immunization practices
      and vaccination levels, 2) Feedback of the assessment results and strategies to improve
      coverage levels, 3) Incentives to improve coverage levels, and 4) eXchange of information and
      resources necessary to facilitate improvement.

      This program will evaluate the effectiveness of AFIX visits on affecting provider practices
      to increase adolescent (age 11-18) immunization. Visits include discussion of that practice's
      immunization rates and strategies for improving rates. The investigators will compare the
      changes, from baseline to 5 months, in immunization for practices receiving virtual visits
      (webinars), in-person visits, and no visits (control group). Thirty practices will be
      randomly assigned to each intervention type. The main outcomes of this study are
      practice-wide uptake rates of several adolescent vaccines (Tdap, HPV, and MCV4) as well as
      pre- and post-AFIX visit surveys focusing on recall tactics utilized by each practice. Data
      will be collected on practices with at least 200 adolescent patients (note: there is no
      patient-level data collected in this study).
