      Study visit 1: about 16 hours - you will come to this visit fasting.

      You will have an oral glucose tolerance test which takes about 3 ½ hours. An IV line will be
      placed in your arm vein for blood draw purposes and will remain there throughout the testing.
      A blood sample will be drawn 15 minutes and just before you will drink a sugar solution
      consisting of 75 grams of glucose. Blood will be drawn at specific times after you consume
      the drink.

      You will have a second oral glucose tolerance test which takes about 3 ½ hours. An IV line
      will be placed in your arm vein for blood draw purposes and will remain there throughout the
      testing. A blood sample will be drawn 15 minutes and just before you will drink a sugar
      solution. Blood will be drawn at specific times after you consume the drink.

    <description>This study designed to determine whether a person's sensitivity to their own insulin varies from the morning to the evening. The test is useful in the diagnosis of diabetes, and pre diabetes. Oral Glucose Testing provides details about how quickly glucose is absorbed into the bloodstream for use by body cells as energy. The rate of glucose clearance depends on the amount of glucose consumed. Once the participant drink a glucose-rich beverage, Blood will be drawn at different points and tested to see how effective the body breaks down metabolizes blood glucose.</description>
