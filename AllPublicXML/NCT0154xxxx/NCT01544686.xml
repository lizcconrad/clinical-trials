  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In neutropenic cancer patients, catheter-related bloodstream infections may cause severe
      infections and even death. To assess the prophylactic effect of a chlorhexidine coated
      catheter securement dressing on the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections,
      this open, randomized trial is being carried out. CHG iv Tegaderm securement dressing will be
      randomized in a 1:1 fashion against Tegaderm Advanced iv securement dressing.

          -  Patients receiving a central venous catheter for high-dose chemotherapy with
             consecutive autologous stem cell transplantation or any other condition with an
             expected duration of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia of at least 5 days and an
             expected duration of central venous catheter use of at least 10 days

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years

             days

          -  Use of a central venous catheter with antimicrobial coating other than chlorhexidine
             and/or silver-sulfadiazine

          -  Limited venous status, impeding acquisition of peripheral blood cultures in case of
             febrile neutropenia
