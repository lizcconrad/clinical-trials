    <description>Recombinant VIIa-FP (rVIIa-FP) is a fusion protein linking coagulation factor VIIa with albumin and will be administered by intravenous infusion in escalating doses up to 1000 mcg/kg. Participants will receive pre-treatment with an oral anticoagulant starting 7 days prior to administration of study product and continuing for 7 days after study product has been administered.</description>
