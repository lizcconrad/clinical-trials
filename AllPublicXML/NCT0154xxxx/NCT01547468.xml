  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is compare the rates of post-operative delirium between a group of
      people receiving intravenous (IV) pain control after hip fracture surgery and a group of
      people receiving a femoral nerve catheter for pain control. Post-operative delirium is
      confusion that can happen after the deep sleep of anesthesia. AThe hypothesis is that the
      group receiving the femoral nerve catheter for pain may have a lower incidence of delirium
      than the group receiveing IV pain medication.

      Subjects will have their hearing and vision tested. They will have their ability to think and
      analyze information tested using 4 questionnaires/ surveys: The Confusion Assesment Method
      (CAM), the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Modified Blessed Dementia scale (MBDS), and
      Barthel's Activities of Daily Living (ADL). They will have pain medication prior to surgery
      based on the doctor's orders.

      On the day of surgery, subjects will be randomized (like a flip of a coin) into one of two
      groups. One group will receive IV medication to control for pain after surgery. The other
      group will receive a femoral nerve catheter to control for pain after surgery.

      A femoral nerve catheter is the small tubing that delivers numbing medicine to the nerves
      around the hips that control pain. This will be placed either before, during or soon after
      your surgery to help with pain after the surgery. This catheter is placed using an ultrasound
      machine. Subjects will still have pain medication through the IV before surgery if the
      catheter is put into their leg.

      After surgery, you will be given the pain medication either through the IV or through the
      catheter in your leg. The catheter will be left in after surgery for 2-3 days delivering
      numbing medicine to the nerves. If subjects have the catheter in their leg and need more pain
      medication, the medication will be given to them through the IV.

      Subjects will be visited by a member of the study staff on the second and third day after
      surgery. The study staff member will ask questions about the subject's ability to think and
      analyze information.
