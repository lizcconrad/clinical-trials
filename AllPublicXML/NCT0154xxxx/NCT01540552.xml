      RATIONALE: Comparing lung CT scans from participants with lung nodules at high-risk for lung
      cancer may help doctors learn more about the disease and find better methods of treatment.

      PURPOSE: This trial studies the natural history of lung nodules using CT scans from
      participants at high-risk for lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluation of lung nodules (target and non-target lesions) detected during annual
           low-dose (ld) computed tomography (CT) scans and measured for three years after study
           completion in subjects enrolled in a randomized, phase IIb, placebo-controlled trial
           with inhaled budesonide (both person-specific and lesion-specific analyses will be
           performed).

      Secondary

        -  Lung cancer detection rate in the two arms.

        -  Appearance of new nodules in the two arms.

      OUTLINE: Low-dose CT scans are analyzed retrospectively for the natural progression of
      undetermined lung nodules. Nodule dimension will be evaluated according to maximum diameter
      and volume, when feasible. Volume measurements are performed using an automatic and
      semi-automatic computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. Lesion-specific and person-specific
      analysis are performed by measure of average change in size of the target lesions or number
      of lesions.
