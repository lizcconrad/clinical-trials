  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients requiring the use of artificial ventilation (also called mechanical ventilation) for
      more than 21 days account for more than 37% of all ICU costs. As such, these patients are now
      transferred to centers that specialize in weaning patients from the respirator; these units
      are referred to as long-term acute care (LTAC) facilities. Despite the increase of LTAC
      facilities, research on the fastest method for disconnecting the patient from the respirator
      is lacking. In addition, little information is available regarding the long-term survival and
      quality of life after a prolonged course of artificial ventilation. The purpose of this study
      is to determine the fastest method for disconnecting the patient from the respirator at a
      LTAC facility and its effect on long-term survival and quality of life.

    <textblock>
      Patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (defined as more than 21 days) account
      for more than 37% of all ICU costs. As such, these patients are now transferred to centers
      that specialize in weaning from mechanical ventilation, so called long-term acute care (LTAC)
      facilities. Despite the proliferation of LTAC facilities, research on methods for expediting
      weaning is lacking. In addition, little information is available regarding long-term survival
      and patient's perception of quality of life after a prolonged course of mechanical
      ventilation.

      In patients receiving mechanical ventilation in an ICU, randomized trials have revealed that
      ventilator duration was significantly influenced by weaning methods. The two most common
      weaning methods are pressure support and spontaneous breathing trials. Unlike the ICU, the
      relative efficacy of these two techniques in weaning patients requiring prolonged ventilation
      at a LTAC facility is largely unknown. The aim of this proposal is to determine whether the
      length of time required for weaning from prolonged ventilation differs with pressure support
      versus spontaneous breathing trials. The second aim is to determine the long-term impact of
      prolonged ventilation on survival, functional status and quality of life.
