      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a low salicylate diet will improve the
      quality of life of patients with Aspirin Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is clinically diagnosed in patients who suffer
      from allergy to aspirin, asthma, nasal polyps, and chronic sinusitis. Patients with AERD are
      often resistant to medical management of nasal polyps, and require multiple endoscopic sinus
      surgeries to manage recurrences of nasal polyps. Control of AERD can be obtained through
      aspirin desensitization, which consists of taking aspirin every day. However, there are
      substantial risks and adverse side effects to taking moderate amounts of aspirin daily.
      Furthermore, patients experience progressively worsening nasal and respiratory disease even
      with complete avoidance of aspirin and other NSAIDs.

      The active and major component in aspirin/NSAIDs is salicylate, which is also found naturally
      in some foods. Diet modification is a cost-effective intervention that has the potential to
      provide long-term remission of AERD. Our study will evaluate whether a low salicylate diet,
      which is a more cost effective and benign intervention with minimal risks, will improve
      nasal, sinus or respiratory symptoms, such as congestion, sinusitis, smell, or asthma.

    <description>As this is a crossover study, all participants will complete the SNOT-22 questionnaire at the beginning of the study. After 6 weeks of their assigned diet (normal vs low salicylate), they will complete the SNOT-22 questionnaire to see if there are any differences in subjective nasal and sinus symptoms. After 6 weeks, the participants cross over to the other diet and they will complete the SNOT-22 questionnaire again in another 6 weeks when the study ends.</description>

    <description>As this is a crossover study, all participants will be evaluated for the Lund-Kennedy Endoscopic Score at the beginning of the study. After 6 weeks of their assigned diet (normal vs low salicylate), they will be re-evaluated in clinic to see if there are any differences in endoscopy findings. After 6 weeks, the participants cross over to the other diet and they will have a final endoscopic evaluation in another 6 weeks when the study ends.</description>
