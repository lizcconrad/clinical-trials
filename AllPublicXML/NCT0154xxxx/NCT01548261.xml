  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cultivated oral mucosal epithelial sheets on amniotic membrane have been reported to have
      good clinical results in treating patients with ocular surface disorders in both human and
      animal studies. However, such technique has not been well established in this hospital. The
      main purpose of this study is to obtain the discarded oral mucosal tissue from healthy donors
      who volunteer to donate their oral mucosa from buccal area. The obtained oral mucosal tissue
      will be cultured under different types (co-culture with or without 3T3 cells)ã€‚Inverted light
      microscopy, electron microscopy and immunostaining with K3/K12, K14, Ki67, P63, connexin 43,
      and involucrin will be preformed to test the effects of foreskin cell line co-culture system
      on cell condition. The investigators plan to start the study from Jan. 1st, 2011 to Dec.
      31th, 2015. Thirty patients will be enrolled.
