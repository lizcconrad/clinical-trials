      The purpose of this study is to measure the levels of serum proteins and other biomarkers in
      cervical cancer patients. We believe that some of these markers may be useful in selecting
      patients for specific types of cancer therapies. These markers may also help to predict
      response to therapy, relapse after therapy, and survival after therapy.

      SPECIFIC STUDY AIMS

      Specific Aim 1: To use gene expression analysis of primary cervical cancers to identify a
      gene expression signature that predicts for lymph node metastases in this disease.

      Specific Aim 2: To predict lymph node metastases by performing multiplex measurements of
      cancer-associated proteins and cytokines using proximity ligation assay (PLA) on plasma
      samples.

      Specific Aim 3: To measure circulating human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA in the plasma samples
      of cervical cancer patients using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and
      determine its ability to predict for nodal metastases.

      Specific Aim 4: To use deep sequencing to evaluate gene and sequence differences between
      cervical cancer patients with and without lymph node metastasis.

        Recruitment of patients for participation in this study will occur at Stanford Medical
        Center. All facilities are adequately equipped to meet all study requirements. Patients of
        this disease type are regularly treated at Stanford Cancer Center. Estimated accrual rates
        are based on normal patient flow.
