  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is common following beast surgery. Dexmedetomidine
      was reported to a reduced PONV due to opioid-sparing effect. It is not clear if
      dexmedetomidine itself is useful on reducing PONV. The hypothesis of present study:
      intraoperative application of single dose dexmedetomidine (0.5 mcg/kg) is is effective than
      placebo for reducing of PONV and improve postoperative quality of recovery score within 48
      postoperative hours.

      This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Severance Hospital, Yonsei
      University Health System. After written informed consent was obtained from all patients, aged
      20-75 years with ASA physical status class I-II who were scheduled breast cancer surgery
      under general anaesthesia were enrolled in this study All the patients were randomly assigned
      to receive dexmedetomidine or placebo during surgery. The primary outcome was quality of
      recovery determined by QOR-40 in the first 24h after surgery.The secondary outcome measure
      was PONV assessed by visual analogue scale every 6 hours within 48 postoperative hours.
