    <textblock>
      Main of the present study was to develop a model of concomitant C-fibre block and
      sensitization eliciting spontaneous pain as well applying topical capsaicin and local
      anesthetics (LA) to examine the sensory alterations after combined C-fiber block and
      sensitization in both different application orders (sensitization of blocked C-fibers and
      block of sensitized C-fibers), compared to each of both mechanisms alone. Thereby, we expect
      stronger sensory changes during the combined substance application than during the
      monoapplication. We expect also contralateral sensory alterations mirroring the changes on
      the intervention site after the combined capsaicin and LA application, being stronger than
      after sensitization alone absent after C-fiber block alone.
