  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a european randomised, phase III, multi-centric study comparing a diagnostic and
      therapeutic strategy based on molecular analysis followed by suspected primary cancer
      tailored specific therapy, to an empiric strategy in patients with carcinoma of unknown
      primary. The purpose of this trial is to determine whether or not a strategy based on
      molecular analysis is effective in improving the progression free survival rates of patients
      with carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP).

    <description>CancerTYPE ID is a real-time RT-PCR assay that measures and interprets the differential expression of 92 genes as a molecular correlate for tumor classification. The test classifies 28 main tumor types and 50 subtypes using an algorithm incorporating gene expression data from a reference database of 2,094 tumor specimens. CancerTYPE ID is used, in conjunction with other clinical and diagnostic procedures, to help identify tumor type and histological subtype. The performance characteristics and reproducibility of the test have been published previously (Erlander et al., 2011 ; Kerr et al., 2012).
CancerTYPE ID is conducted on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens at bioTheranostics' high complexity laboratory, which is certified by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA), accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP), and approved by the State of New York.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients presenting with carcinoma of unknown primary, confirmed by histopathological
             analysis (including an immunohistochemical analysis) and corresponding to one of the
             following histologic types : moderately or well-differentiated adenocarcinoma,
             poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, squamous-cell
             carcinoma

          2. Diagnostic work-up in keeping with Standard Options Recommandations des CAPI (Lesimple
             et al., 2003),

          3. Age &gt; 18 years,

          4. Performance Status 0, 1 or 2 according to ECOG

          5. Good or poor prognosis CUP classified according to the GEFCAPI classification

          6. CUP with at least one measurable lesion

          7. Tumour sample available for molecular analysis

          8. CUP not belonging to a subgroup requiring a specific treatment,

          9. Satisfactory haematological, renal and hepatic function

         10. Cardiac, respiratory and neurological function compatible with the administration of
             cisplatin chemotherapy,

         11. No previous chemotherapy for a CUP

         12. Previous radiotherapy is acceptable, but it should be completed at least 4 weeks
             before the start of systemic treatment. Randomization can be performed during this
             time frame.

         13. All patients with reproductive potential must practice an effective method of birth
             control throughout the study. Female patients with childbearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test within 7 days before study treatment

         14. Information delivered to patient and informed consent form signed by the patient or
             legal representative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients in whom the diagnosis has not been histologically confirmed (a cytological
             analysis alone does not permit patient entry onto the trial),

          2. Patients with known HIV infection

          3. Patients with symptomatic brain metastases,

          4. Associated disease likely to prevent the patient from receiving the treatment,

          5. Previous history of cancer (excepted skin basocellular epithelioma or epithelioma in
             situ of the uterine cervix) during the 5 years before study entry,

          6. Patients already included in another clinical trial with an experimental therapy,

          7. Pregnant woman or woman who are breastfeeding,

          8. Compliance with trial medical follow-up impossible due to geographic, social or
             psychological reasons.
