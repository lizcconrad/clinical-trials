             side-shifting) unilateral temporal or ocular pain.

             pain phase.

          -  Subject reports a minimum of 8 days per month and a maximum of 14 days per month with
             migraine attacks of at least moderate severity based on the subject/Investigator's
             knowledge for at least 3 months prior to inclusion and confirmed for at least 1 month
             during the Pre-Implant Baseline Period using the Pathway M-1 Daily Headache Diary.

          -  Subject reports at least 24 hours of pain-free periods between typical migraine
             attacks.

          -  Subject has a MIDAS grade of III or IV, or has a HIT-6 score &gt; 56.

          -  Subject has had stable type and dosage of preventive headache medications for at least
             1 month prior to study enrollment and agrees to maintain stable type and dosage of
             preventive headache medications through the completion of the Experimental Period.

          -  Subject is able to distinguish migraine attacks from other headaches (i.e., TTH).

          -  Subject agrees to not participate in supplemental or alternative therapy through the
             Open Label phase of the study. This includes: acupuncture, spinal manipulation, TENS,

             pterygopalatine fossa or zygomaticomaxillary buttress ipsilateral to the planned
             implant site that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may lead to the inability to
             properly implant or use the Neurostimulator.

          -  Subject has active oral or dental abscess.

          -  Subject has been treated with therapeutic radiation to the facial region.

             maintaining a stable headache medicine regimen or returning for required follow-up
             visits) in the Investigator's opinion.

          -  Subject is a woman of childbearing age who is pregnant, nursing, or not using

             months.

          -  Subject has undergone botulinium toxin injections of the head and/or neck in the last
             3 months.

          -  Subject has or requires a pacemaker/defibrillator or other implantable device having a
             sense amplifier that is programmed 'On.'

          -  Subject has a history of bleeding disorders or coagulopathy or is unable to
             discontinue anticoagulation, antiplatelet, or GP IIb IIIa inhibitor medication in
             preparation for the implantation procedure.

          -  Subject has a chronic neurological illness of the face (e.g., facial nerve paralysis,
             trigeminal neuralgia).

          -  Subject is not suitable for the study for any reason in the judgment of the
