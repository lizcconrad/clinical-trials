      The broad objective is to improve zinc status in older infants and young children who are at
      risk of zinc deficiency because of combination of inadequate dietary zinc intake and high
      rates of diarrhea. As a sub-study within larger RCT using zinc fortified Sprinkles, the
      proposed study will measure the amount of zinc absorbed from a test meal of typical
      unfortified complementary foods consumed by Pakistani infants, or the same complementary
      foods fortified by the addition of the Zn-containing Sprinkle.

      In the nested study we aim to measure from a subgroup of recruited children in the main
      study, the amount of zinc absorbed from typical unfortified complementary foods consumed by
      Pakistani infants, and compare it with the same complementary food fortified by the addition
      of the Zn-containing Sprinkles and multi vitamins. Since EZP Exchangeable Zinc Pool is
      considered to be the gold standard for estimation of the actual concentration of zinc in the
      plasma that is readily available for cellular function, we would also calculate the EZP in
      this subset of samples.

      The specific aim of the nested study will :

        1. Determine absorption of zinc (Zn) from a test meal consisting of typical local food with
           addition of a multiple-micronutrient Sprinkles product containing (10 mg of Zn) vs
           absorption from the same meal without zinc supplementation to those with no
           micronutrient fortification.

        2. Compare size of exchangeable Zn pool (EZP) for subjects who have been randomized to
           receive multi-micronutrient Sprinkle (MN) only with those who were randomized to (MN+Zn
           ) with control group.

        3. Children will be followed for growth monitoring for at least 2 years.

        4. Plasma zinc and phytates levels in the weaning diet will also be assessed.
