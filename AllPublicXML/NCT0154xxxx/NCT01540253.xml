    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of PI3K inhibitor BKM120 when given
      together with docetaxel in treating patients with advanced solid tumor that is locally
      advanced, cannot be removed by surgery, or metastatic. PI3K inhibitor BKM120 may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving PI3K inhibitor BKM120
      together with docetaxel may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicities and identify the recommended phase II dose of
      the combination of docetaxel and BKM 120 (P13K inhibitor BKM120) in patients with advanced
      solid tumors.

      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of this combination. III. To determine any
      pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between BKM12O and docetaxel.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess any preliminary evidence of efficacy with this combination in patients with
      advanced cancers.

      II. To evaluate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha
      (PIK3CA) mutations as predictive biomarkers of efficacy for the combination.

      III. To evaluate PIK3CA polymorphisms and polymorphisms in BKM120 transport and metabolism as
      predictors of toxicity and/or efficacy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PI3K inhibitor BKM120.

      Patients receive PI3K inhibitor BKM120 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and docetaxel
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

             women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any time
             in the preceding 12 consecutive months), must have a negative serum pregnancy test =&lt;
             48 hours prior to initiating treatment

             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile

             amenorrhea with serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels &gt; 40 mlU/mL (for US
             only: and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or
             without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago; in the case of oophorectomy alone, only
             when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
             level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during treatment for 4
             weeks (5 T1/2) after stopping treatment; the highly effective contraception is defined
             as either:

               -  True abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject; periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago; in case of oophorectomy
                  alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by
                  follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); for female subjects on the study, the
                  vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient

               -  Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):

                    -  a) Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                    -  b) Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository

               -  Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as
                  BKM120 potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives

               -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test =&lt; 48
                  hours prior to initiating treatment

               -  Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving
                  offspring must use condom during treatment, for 4 weeks (5 T1/2) after stopping
                  treatment and for additional 12 weeks (16 weeks in total after study drug
                  discontinuation) and should not father a child in this period

               -  Female partner of male study subject should use highly effective contraception
                  during dosing of any study agent and for 16 weeks after final dose of study
                  therapy

          -  Inability to swallow oral medications

          -  Significant gastrointestinal disorder, in the opinion of the investigator, could
             interfere with the absorption of BKMI20 (e.g. significant, uncontrolled inflammatory
             bowel disease, history of abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal [GI] perforation
             within 6 months, extensive small bowel resection and requirement for tube feeding or
             parenteral hydration/nutrition)

          -  Patients who are currently receiving treatment with medication with a known risk to
             prolong the QT interval or inducing Torsades de Pointes and the treatment cannot
             either be discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study
             drug

          -  Patients receiving chronic treatment with steroids or another immunosuppressive agent;
             Note: topical applications (e.g. rash), inhaled sprays (e.g. obstructive airways
             diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g. intra-articular) are allowed; patients
