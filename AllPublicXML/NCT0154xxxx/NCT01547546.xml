  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, Phase I, dose-escalating study will evaluate the safety and
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of GDC-0084 in patients with
      progressive or recurrent high-grade glioma. Stage 1 is the dose escalation part of the study.
      Stage 2, patients will receive GDC-0084 at a recommended dose for future studies.

             III-IV)

          -  Prior treatment with at least one regimen for gliomas (radiotherapy with or without
             chemotherapy for Grade III gliomas and radiotherapy with chemotherapy for Grade IV
             gliomas) and/or not considered to be a candidate for regimens known to provide
             clinical benefit

        Patients enrolled in Stage 2:

          -  Histologically documented recurrent or progressive glioblastoma (WHO Grade IV gliomas)

          -  Prior treatment with one or two regimens for glioblastoma (with the initial regimen
             consisting of radiotherapy with chemotherapy)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with anti-tumor therapy (approved or experimental) within 4 weeks prior to
             initiation of study drug
