    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of a 30 hour cognitive remediation
      program for young patients with early phase schizophrenia spectrum disorders on cognitive,
      clinical and functional outcome measures. The remediation program is integrated with whatever
      active rehabilitation the participant is currently attending (school, work, day program etc).

    <measure>MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in MCCB performance from baseline to 4 months and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Included in the MCCB are measures of the following cognitive domains: Speed of Processing, Attention, Working memory, Verbal learning, Visual Learning, Reasoning and problem solving and Social Cognition. In addition the following tests are included: HVLT-R and BVMT-R delayed recall to measure memory, TMTB (Halstead Reitan) and Color Word Inteference Test (D-KEFS) to measure executive functioning), Digit span (WAIS-III)to measure working memory, Grooved Pegboard (Halstead Reitan) to measure motor function.</description>
