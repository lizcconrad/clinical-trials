  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is a well known health problem in Western society that is significantly
      responsible for socio-economic problems like absenteeism and disability. The lifetime
      prevalence of LBP is 60-80% and approximately 85% of this LBP has a &quot;non-specific&quot; character
      whereby the underlying causes and risk factors cannot be demonstrated. While many people
      recover within a month, most individuals will have recurrence within a year with more severe
      symptoms. This might be due to insufficient knowledge of the underlying mechanisms. Impaired
      proprioception, the ability to discern body/limb positions and movements, may cause and
      maintain LBP shown by an altered postural control strategy. Specifically, patients with LBP
      rely more on proprioceptive signals from the ankles due to less reliable proprioceptive input
      of proximal segments. Moreover, they show a decreased variability in postural control and
      less postural robustness, while variability is a prerequisite for optimal functioning of
      biological systems. However, further clarification of the neural correlates is necessary.
      Deficits in proprioception, as found in a subgroup of patient with LBP, are associated with a
      decreased ability of the brain to process proprioceptive inputs.

      The aim of this project is to clarify the central changes in individuals with recurrent
      non-specific low back pain and healthy controls. To evaluate these central changes MRI
      techniques (3DTFE, DTI and RS-fMRI) will be used. In addition, the association between
      central changes and postural control tasks will be evaluated.
