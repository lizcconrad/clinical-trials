      Background: The significance of retinal ganglion cell protection in the glaucoma led the view
      that, glaucomatous optical neuropathy can also be considered as a pathology of central
      nervous system. It is known that α−tocopherol and Gingko Biloba have specific neuroprotective
      and vasoregulatory activities, in addition to antioxidant effects. In this study, the
      investigators compared early neuroprotective effects of α−tocopherol and GB with each other
      as well as control and a strong antioxidant formulation in patients with glaucoma.

      Methods: In this non-randomized control trial, 120 eyes of 60 patients with glaucoma were
      enrolled into the study and divided into 4 groups, each consisting of 30 eyes. Unlike the
      controls, patients in the 3 antioxidant groups received α−tocopherol, Gingko Biloba and a
      strong antioxidant formula for 3 months. Central vision field and MD, PSD and OCT as well as
      thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell counts and c/d ratios were recorded.
      The data were compared statistically.

      A significant difference was observed between MD, PSD, s-RNFL and m-RNFL levels of groups
      (p&lt;0.05) (Table 3), but when compared with Groups of Vit E and AOF, MD and s-RNFL levels of
      the Group GB were significantly low and PSD level was significantly high in the same group.
      m-RNFL level of the Vit E group was significantly higher than m-RNFL levels of GB, AOF and
      Control groups (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01). In the comparison of Vitamin E with GB, MD values were found
      significantly higher and PSD values were significantly low (p&lt;0.05). No statistically
      significant difference was present between I-RNFL levels of groups (p&gt;0.05). While the
      difference between c/d levels of groups were highly significant (p&lt;0.01) (Table 3), c/d
      levels of Vit E and GB groups were found significantly lower than c/d levels of AOF and
      Control groups (p&lt;0.01). c/d level of the Vit E group is significantly lower than c/d levels
      of AOF and Control groups (p&lt;0.01). No statistically significant difference was found between
      c/d levels of other groups (p&gt;0.05).

      No statistically significant difference was present between s-GCC and i-GCC levels of groups
      (p&gt;0.05). A high statistically significant difference was found between m-GCC levels of
      groups (p&lt;0.01). While highly 201 significant and significant difference were present between
      m-GCC level of the Vit E Group and m-GCC levels of AOF and Control Groups, respectively,
      (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.05), m-GCC level of the Group GB was significantly higher than that of Group AOF
      (p&lt;0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed between m-GCC levels of other
      groups (p&gt;0.05).
