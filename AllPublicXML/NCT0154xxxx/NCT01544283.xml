      Objective:

      This purpose of this pilot study is to explore the potential usefulness of Synera for the
      treatment of pain associated with shoulder impingement syndrome.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive either a subacromial injection at baseline or will be issued Synera
      patches to use daily for 2 weeks and then PRN for an additional 2 weeks.

    <description>Patch will be applied directly to the lateral tip of the affected shoulder, at the site of maximal tenderness. Subjects will apply a single patch at home approximately every 12 hours (e.g., morning and evening patch applications) for 14 days. Subjects will remove each patch after 4 hours. Subjects will have the option of applying the Synera patch as needed for an additional 2 week period (weeks 2-4) if they feel their shoulder impingement pain is severe enough to warrant treatment. Patches will be applied every 12 hours for up to 4 hours as needed during this period.</description>

    <intervention_name>Synera® (lidocaine 70 mg and tetracaine 70 mg) topical patch</intervention_name>
    <description>Synera consists of a thin, uniform layer of a local anesthetic formulation with an integrated, oxygen-activated heating component that is intended to enhance the delivery of the local anesthetics. The drug formulation is an emulsion in which the oil phase is a eutectic mixture of lidocaine 70 mg and tetracaine 70 mg. The surface area of the entire Synera patch is approximately 50 cm2, 10 cm2 of which is active. The 40 cm2 perimeter is a medical grade adhesive. The Synera patches used in this study are the commercially available form.</description>

    <intervention_name>Triamcinolone Acetonide</intervention_name>
    <description>Triamcinolone Acetonide is a synthetic glucocorticoid corticosteroid with marked anti-inflammatory action, in a sterile aqueous suspension suitable for intralesional and intra-articular injection. Each mL of the sterile aqueous suspension provides 40 mg of triamcinolone acetonide, with sodium chloride for isotonicity, 0.9% (w/v) benzyl alcohol as a preservative, 0.75% carboxymethylcellulose sodium, and a 0.04% polysorbate 80; sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid may have been added to adjust pH between 5.0 and 7.5. At the time of manufacture, the air in the container is replaced by nitrogen.</description>

             2-week duration).

          -  have tenderness at the attachment site of the rotator cuff tendons.

          -  have positive Hawkin's and Neer's signs.

          -  report an average pain intensity score of 4 (on an 11-point scale) over the past 24
             hours at the Screening/Baseline visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  have used any topically applied pain medication on the target treatment area within 14
             days preceding Study Day 1, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
             menthol, methyl salicylate, local anesthetics (including Lidoderm®), or steroids.

          -  have used any injected medication within 60 days preceding Study Day 1, such as local
             anesthetic (lidocaine) or steroids.

          -  have a clinically significant illness within 14 days of Screening/Day 1 that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would preclude the subject from participating in the
             study.

          -  are receiving class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs (ie, tocainide, mexiletine, etc.)

          -  have a history of and/or past diagnosis of severe hepatic disease.

          -  have participated in a clinical trial of an unapproved drug within 30 days prior to

          -  are pregnant, breastfeeding, or a female of childbearing potential and not practicing
             an acceptable method of birth control.

             procedures and cooperate fully with research staff.

          -  have filed a disability claim or are currently receiving disability payments for
             shoulder impingement syndrome.
