    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Gintuit compared to a
      free autogenous graft using donor tissue harvested from the subject's palate in the treatment
      of subjects who have an insufficient zone of attached gingiva associated with at least two
      non adjacent teeth. The trial is designed to demonstrate non-inferiority between treatment
      and control in the change in amount of attached gingiva over the 6 month observation period.

      Gintuit will be placed as a graft in one of the deficient zones, and a free autogenous graft
      will be placed in the other. The grafts will be evaluated clinically to determine the change
      in the amount of attached gingiva and on at least three subjects, a small biopsy will be
      taken to allow histologic evaluation and comparison of both grafts.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is 18 years of age or older at the time of enrollment, and not older than
             seventy years.

          2. Subject has at least two non-adjacent teeth with an insufficient zone of attached
             gingiva which requires soft tissue grafting. The two selected teeth must be located in
             contralateral quadrants. (In case of adjacent teeth requiring grafting, only one tooth
             at each site will act as test or control tooth, but both teeth will get the same
             treatment).

          3. Root coverage is not desired or indicated at the time of grafting.

          4. Females of childbearing potential must have a documented negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test.

          5. Subjects must have read, understood and signed an institutional review board (IRB)
             approved Informed Consent Form.

          6. Subjects must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Teeth that have an insufficient zone of attached gingiva that would be best treated
             using soft tissue grafts, which would attempt to cover the denuded root surface.

          2. Subjects with any systemic conditions (i.e., diabetes mellitus, cancer, HIV, bone
             metabolic diseases) which could compromise wound healing and preclude periodontal
             surgery.

          3. Subjects who are currently receiving or have received within one week prior to study
             entry, systemic corticosteroids (including inhaled), immunosuppressive agents,
             radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy which could compromise wound healing and
             preclude periodontal surgery.

          4. Subjects with the presence of acute infectious lesions in the areas intended for
             surgery.

          5. Subjects who smoke.

          6. Teeth requiring treatment are molars.

          7. Teeth with axial mobility.

          8. Known hypersensitivity to bovine collagen.

          9. Subjects enrolled in medical, dental, or any investigational device study for any
             disease within the past four weeks.

         10. Subjects who have received an investigational drug or biological treatment within the
             three months prior to study enrollment (medical or dental).

         11. Subjects previously treated with Gintuit, Dermagraft or any other skin graft at the
             target site(s).

         12. Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, for any reason other than those
             listed above, will not be able to complete the study per protocol.
