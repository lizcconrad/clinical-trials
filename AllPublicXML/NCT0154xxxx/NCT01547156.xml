    <textblock>
      Mobile Sipoo is a randomized controlled trial aiming to improve selfcare and outcomes of
      diabetes and hypertensive patients by introducing a remote patient monitoring system
      supported with automatic patient decision support. The feedback system is coupled with
      back-office health coaching.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self-monitored data from blood pressure meters (SMBP), glucometers (SMBG), scales and
      pedometers are transferred by mobile phone terminals to a tethered personal health record
      (PHR) integrated with the provider EHR. The PHR application includes tools to display of
      self-monitoring data.

    <description>Intervention patients were given a remote patient monitoring toolbox that included a mobile telephone, software application, and assessment devices for measuring and remote reporting of hypertension and diabetes -related health parameters at home. The monitored parameters were body weight, steps, blood pressure and blood glucose. Based on their self-monitored data, patients received feedback that was automatically generated, theory-based, health promotion rich information that aimed at strengthening their self-care practices.</description>
