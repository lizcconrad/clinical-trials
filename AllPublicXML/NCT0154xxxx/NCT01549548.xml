  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this protocol is to provide expanded access to the study drug
      (Ponatinib/AP24534) for people with imatinib-, dasatinib-, and nilotinib-
      resistant/intolerant Philadelphia Chromosome Positive (Ph+) Leukemias. The other purpose of
      this protocol is to monitor the safety of the study drug in people with Ph+ Leukemias that
      have not responded to prior treatment.
