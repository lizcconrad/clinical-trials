  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder (BD) is a serious and chronic mental illness that is associated with
      substantial impairment in quality of life and functional outcomes, high rates of suicide, and
      high financial costs. In spite of a proliferation of treatments for BD, nearly half of
      individuals with BD do not benefit from pharmacotherapy because of sub-optimal medication
      treatment adherence. Non-adherence with BD medication treatment dramatically worsens
      outcomes. Reasons for non-adherence among individuals with BD are multi-dimensional, and it
      has been suggested that adherence enhancement might work best if the intervention
      specifically addresses factors that are important and modifiable for a specific individual.
      In spite of the enormity of the problem, the literature on interventions to improve treatment
      adherence is surprisingly limited. There is an urgent need for interventions to enhance
      treatment adherence among BD patients that: 1) are at high risk for future treatment
      non-adherence; 2) may not have access to or interest in long-term, high-intensity, and
      specialized care; and 3) are flexible and patient-focused taking into account reasons for
      non-adherence for a specific individual.

      The proposed study is a first-ever RCT focused specifically on BD treatment adherence
      enhancement, and will test whether a customized adherence enhancement (CAE) psychosocial
      intervention improves adherence and mental health outcomes compared to broadly-directed,
      non-individualized education (EDU). The proposed project has the potential to greatly advance
      the care of BD patients who are at greatest risk for poor health outcomes, with findings
      expected to be generalizable across a variety of treatment settings.

      Hypothesis 1: CAE will be associated with greater improvement in treatment adherence compared
      to broadly-directed, non-individualized BD education (EDU).

      Hypothesis 2: CAE will be associated with improved BD symptoms compared to EDU.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A special pill cap will record the time/date of bottle opening. The cap will be used for the medication that the patient takes the most frequently (in the case of multiple BD medications taken at same frequency, the medication that was started most recently will be selected). A dose will be counted as &quot;taken&quot; if the bottle is opened within two hours of the prescribed time. A percent of doses taken (treatment adherence) will be calculated by dividing the number of times the bottle is opened by the number of times it should have been opened as per the prescription.</description>
