      The purpose of this study is to evaluate, by way of randomized controlled trial, the
      effectiveness of a web-based, time-flexible, and teacher-directed &quot;Teacher Help for ADHD&quot;
      program in reducing the impact of ADHD symptoms in elementary students.

      *Please note that the information below is taken verbatim from our project's research
      summary.*

      Treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most
      well-researched areas in childhood psychopathology. ADHD is a highly prevalent (5% of
      school-aged children) and chronic disorder (ADHD will persist into adulthood for ~70% of
      children diagnosed with this disorder). ADHD has a substantial impact on daily life including
      difficulties with behavioural, academic, social and emotional functioning (DuPaul &amp; Weyandt,
      2006).

      Although medication is the most commonly used treatment, there are a number of important
      limitations including poor long-term effects, lack of effectiveness in improving academic
      skills, and lack of acceptability by parents and children (DuPaul, 2007). Therefore, a number
      of psychosocial interventions have been developed and empirically validated (parent training,
      social skills training, school-based interventions). School-based interventions have been
      shown to be effective; however, these are significantly underutilized and when implemented in
      an uncontrolled way, are often ineffective. This intervention program is comprised of
      evidence-based treatment strategies that are presented in a manner that will provide teachers
      with knowledge of the disorder and intervention strategies. The novel delivery of this
      program, through distance treatment modalities (e-mail and internet) will allow us to
      overcome many of the known barriers to treatment so that teachers will receive the necessary
      information in a timely and efficient manner. The specific research questions that will be
      addressed are:

        1. Does the overall impairment of children with ADHD in the treatment group improve
           compared to those who are in the waitlist group?

        2. Is the school-based intervention effective in reducing ADHD symptoms, improving
           behavioral functioning, and enhancing academic performance in the active treatment group
           compared to the waitlist group?

        3. Do teachers in the treatment group develop more knowledge about ADHD and more positive
           and realistic attitudes about this disorder over the course of the intervention?

        4. Is the intervention viewed as accessible to teachers and is there evidence of fidelity
           to the program?

      The investigators expect that the program will reduce overall impairment, improve ADHD
      symptoms, behavioural, and academic functioning in the children and will enhance knowledge
      and reduce misconceptions of ADHD in teachers. If successful, this program will be
      disseminated to school boards in Nova Scotia and across Canada, and as such would have the
      potential to have a significant positive effect on the health and well-being of many
      children, teachers and parents.

    <time_frame>Functional impairment of ADHD symptoms will be measured in the Treatment group at 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, and 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SKAMP is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the functional impairment of ADHD symptoms in the school setting. Statements target children's classroom attention and deportment, and teachers are asked to respond on a 4-point Likert-type scale, response items ranging from &quot;Not at All&quot; to &quot;Very much.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Homework Problem Checklist (HPC; Anesko, Schoiock, Ramirez, &amp; Levine, 1987)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in homework problems at 6 weeks (length of program) and 12 weeks (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The HPC is a parent report instrument consisting of 20 items. It has been used in a number of studies as a screening tool and outcome measure to assess homework problems.</description>

    <measure>Parent and Teacher Satisfaction Ratings (adapted from Ervin, DuPaul, Kern, &amp; Friman, 1998)</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment group will complete satisfaction questionnaires at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Two versions of this questionnaire are used to assess parent and teacher satisfaction with interventions for children with ADHD. The parent version consists of 10 items and the teacher version consists of 15 items, rated on an 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Items focused on intervention effectiveness (e.g., ''problem behavior improved during the intervention''), feasibility (e.g., ''the intervention was easy to implement''), and social validity (e.g., ''the student seemed to appreciate the intervention'').</description>
