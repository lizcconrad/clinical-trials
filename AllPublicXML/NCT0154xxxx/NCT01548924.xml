      This is an open label,multicenter, Phase I dose escalation study with a phase dovitinib alone
      for the pharmacokinetic profile and a treatment phase to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of oral(po)dovitinib with paclitaxel administered intravenously (iv) (80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8,
      15 and 21 every 4 weeks) in patients with malignant tumors of any histologically confirmed,
      not susceptible of cure, which have been treated available reference.
