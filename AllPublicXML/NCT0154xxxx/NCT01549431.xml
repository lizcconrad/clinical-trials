    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the combination of
      panobinostat and carfilzomib have on the patient's cancer. It will determine the side effects
      of different dose levels of panobinostat and carfilzomib and determine the best dose and
      schedule of the two drugs to recommend for future studies. The study will assess the effects
      of the drug on multiple myeloma. In addition, tests to study the way the drugs work will also
      be done.

      The combination of the 2 drug classes have shown both pre-clinical (studies done in the lab)
      and clinical (studies done with people) effects against multiple myeloma. For this reason,
      these 2 drugs are being studied in combination to determine the side effects and anti-myeloma
      effects of the 2 drugs.

      This is a multi-center, open-label, phase I study of panobinostat, carfilzomib in patients
      with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Based on the preclinical data supporting the use
      of combined histone de-acetylase (HDAC) and proteasome inhibition, the incidence of
      single-agent panobinostat and carfilzomib anti-myeloma activity, and clinical data
      demonstrating safety and efficacy of panobinostat with a different proteasome inhibitor
      (bortezomib), this study will evaluate the combination of panobinostat and carfilzomib in
      patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in a phase I trial.
