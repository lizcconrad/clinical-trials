  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational prospective follow-up study to assess the utilization of boceprevir
      and the management of pre-specified health outcomes of interest (HOIs) under conditions of
      routine clinical care in participants with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1.

      As an observational prospective study, this study is not intended to change the
      participant/physician relationship, nor influence the physician's drug prescription or
      therapeutic management of the participant. No individual administration of any therapeutic or
      prophylactic agent is assigned in this protocol, and there are no procedures required as part
      of this protocol. Physician choice of the drug used to treat the participant is based on
      clinical judgment alone.

Child-Pugh scores assessed within 3 months before CHC treatment regimen initiation were recorded from the eCRF, and the number of participants who were Grade A, Grade B, Grade C, not assessed, or unknown whether assessed were reported.</description>

        <description>Anemia (hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL) was considered a Health Outcome of Interest (HOI) for this study. Clinical interventions used to manage episodes of anemia in participants could include erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA), blood transfusion, drug dose reduction, other treatment, and CHC treatment regimen modifications (drug dose reduction, drug discontinuation, and drug interruption). For this analysis, participants were categorized by CHC treatment group of exposure, and could successively be assigned to different treatment groups of exposure depending on their treatment regimen (treatment groups were not mutually exclusive). The percentage of anemia episodes that were managed by at least one intervention is reported for each CHC treatment exposure group with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

Clinical interventions used to manage episodes of grade 3/4 neutropenia in participants could include Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) use and CHC treatment regimen modifications (drug dose reduction, drug discontinuation, and drug interruption). For this analysis, participants were categorized by CHC treatment group of exposure, and could successively be assigned to different treatment groups of exposure depending on their treatment regimen (treatment groups were not mutually exclusive). The percentage of grade 3/4 neutropenia episodes that were managed by at least one intervention is reported for each CHC treatment exposure group with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

        <description>Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia (Grade 3: platelet count 25 - &lt;50 × 10^9/L, Grade 4: &lt;25 × 10^9/L) was considered a HOI for this study. Clinical interventions used to manage episodes of grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia in participants could include thrombopoietin, platelet transfusion, other treatment, and CHC treatment regimen modifications (drug dose reduction, drug discontinuation, and drug interruption). For this analysis, participants were categorized by CHC treatment group of exposure, and could successively be assigned to different treatment groups of exposure depending on their treatment regimen (treatment groups were not mutually exclusive). The percentage of grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia episodes that were managed by at least one intervention is reported for each CHC treatment exposure group with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

Clinical interventions used to manage episodes of serious rash in participants could include topical corticosteroid use, intravenous (IV) and/or oral corticosteroids, emollients/moisturizers, antihistamines, other treatment, and CHC treatment regimen modifications (drug dose reduction, drug discontinuation, and drug interruption). For this analysis, participants were categorized by CHC treatment group of exposure, and could successively be assigned to different treatment groups of exposure depending on their treatment regimen (treatment groups were not mutually exclusive). The percentage of serious rash episodes that were managed by at least one intervention is reported for each CHC treatment exposure group with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

          <description>Serious rash was considered a HOI for this study and included rash &gt; 50% of body surface area, rash associated with significant systemic symptoms, or rash resulting in hospitalization or urgent care visit. Clinical interventions used to manage episodes of serious rash in participants could include topical corticosteroid use, intravenous (IV) and/or oral corticosteroids, emollients/moisturizers, antihistamines, other treatment, and CHC treatment regimen modifications (drug dose reduction, drug discontinuation, and drug interruption). For this analysis, participants were categorized by CHC treatment group of exposure, and could successively be assigned to different treatment groups of exposure depending on their treatment regimen (treatment groups were not mutually exclusive). The percentage of serious rash episodes that were managed by at least one intervention is reported for each CHC treatment exposure group with 95% confidence intervals.</description>
