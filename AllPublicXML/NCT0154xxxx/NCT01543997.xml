    <textblock>
      This randomized study investigates whether two treatment conditions:Mind-Body Bridging (MBB)
      and Supportive Education (SED) are effective in improving sleep disturbance and self-reported
      indicators of other co-morbid symptoms in veterans with GWI. The two treatment conditions
      will each comprise 3 sessions of 2 hr. duration and conducted over 3 consecutive weeks (Week
      1-3).

    <description>The Mind-Body Bridging Program (MBBP) is an awareness training program (ATP)to help individuals improve their health condition and attain a state of well-being. Bridging is the primary technique that facilitates the healing process, by bringing one back to the present moment to experience thoughts, emotions and physical sensations. Bridging aims to reduce the impact of negative thought patterns that contribute to stress in the body.</description>
