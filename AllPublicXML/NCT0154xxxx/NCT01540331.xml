  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A group of subjects affected by Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) underwent 3 PNT treatments
      to evaluate one-year efficacy in term of IOP reduction and one-year safety in term of
      incidence of adverse events

    <intervention_name>&quot;model 1000 PNT vacuum controller&quot; (the vacuum device for ocular suction)</intervention_name>
    <description>A Pneumatic Trabeculoplasty treatment, composed of 3 single PNT applications at day 0, 7 and 90. Each treatment consist in a ocular pneumatic suction of 500inchHg administered for 60 seconds in perilimbal region through the device (model 1000 PNT vacuum controller). This suction is then repeated after a 5 minutes pause.</description>
