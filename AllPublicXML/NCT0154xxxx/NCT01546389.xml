      Study Phase and Design Phase I with experimental malaria challenge. The study will enroll 30
      healthy adult participants randomized to one of three cohorts comprised of six groups of 5
      individuals per group to simultaneously receive PfSPZ Challenge via the ID route. The goal
      will be to determine the optimal dose required to achieve 100% infectivity (ID100) of adult
      volunteers. The parameters of 1) dose (number of sporozoites) 2) number of injections and 3)
      aliquot volume will be studied; adding to previous data collected at the University of
      Nijmegen. The following single time point inoculation regimens (a-f) will be assessed: Cohort
      1: Medium dose, medium aliquot volume: a. 10,000 PfSPZ ID in 2 divided doses of 50 microliter
      aliquot volume b. 10,000 PfSPZ ID in 8 divided doses of 50 microliter aliquot volume Cohort
      2: Medium dose, low aliquot volume: c. 10,000 PfSPZ ID in 2 divided doses of 10 microliter
      aliquot volume d. 10,000 PfSPZ ID in 8 divided doses of 10 ml aliquot volume Cohort 3: High
      dose, low aliquot volume: e. 50,000 PfSPZ ID in 2 divided doses of 10 ml aliquot volume f.
      50,000 PfSPZ ID in 8 divided doses of 10 ml aliquot volume. Safety, tolerability and efficacy
      of the inoculation regimens will be evaluated. All 30 volunteers will be evaluated as part of
      an inpatient stay (Days 8-18 post-injection) to diagnose and treat Pf malaria infection with
      chloroquine. Following review, and with the assistance of an independent SMC, 2 regimens will
      be chosen for further testing in DMID 11-0042. The following criteria strategy will be
      employed in the order listed: 1. Regimen necessary to achieve ID100 of adult volunteers; 2.
      Regimen eliciting Pf patency and parasite density (as detected by qRT-PCR) that most closely
      approximates patency rates experienced after mosquito challenge; 3. Regimen requiring the
      least number of injections; 4. Regimen utilizing the fewest number of PfSPZ; 5. Volume of
      administration considered to be the easiest to administer by the clinicians. Chloroquine
      sub-study: Eighteen of thirty participants (3 volunteers from each of the six groups
      comprised of 5-subjects/group) will be assigned to participate in a CQ and possibly
      desethylchloroquine blood and urine study designed to assess the drug kinetics of CQ over the
      course of four weeks after standard CQ dose administration.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or nonpregnant female between the ages of 18 and 45 years, inclusive.

          2. Women who are not surgically sterile (no history of bilateral tubal ligation,
             bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or hysterectomy), post-menopausal (1 year without
             menses) or determined otherwise by medical evaluation to be sterile must agree to
             practice adequate contraception (such as double barrier methods (condoms plus foam or
             spermicide, diaphragm plus foam or spermicide), licensed intrauterine devices (IUDs),
             intravaginal or intra/transdermal or oral hormonal methods initiated at least 1 month
             prior to inoculation or challenge, documented surgical sterilization via tubal
             ligation the essure procedure or hysterectomy, abstinence or a vasectomized partner).
             The contraceptive method should remain unchanged throughout the entire study period
             (56 days). Serologic pregnancy tests will be conducted upon screening. Urine testing
             will be done on the day of malaria challenge, on the day of the first positive malaria
             smear and at the conclusion of active surveillance (Day 56).

          3. Is in good health, as determined by vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, oral
             temperature), medical history, screening 12-lead ECG and a physical examination.

          4. Has normal laboratory values (Urinalysis (assessing blood, and protein presence as
             greater than trace by dipstick), hemoglobin, WBC, platelet count, AST, ALT, bilirubin,
             glucose, and creatinine) prior to challenge study. Any abnormal screening value for
             any screening test listed in Table 8 will exclude the participant from the study with
             the exception of elevated fasting glucose and hematuria &gt;1+ detected during menses for
             females. Elevated fasting glucose may need to be repeated due to recent carbohydrate
             consumption and is therefore not a true fasting glucose. Subsequent repeat fasting
             glucose testing that is in the normal range will be acceptable for participation. For
             females who are menstruating, urinalysis frequently tests positive for blood and is
             not an indicator of poor health status or increased risk. This can be repeated if
             clinically warranted.

          5. Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures including an inpatient
             stay from Day 8-18 after malaria challenge.

          6. Provides informed consent prior to any study procedures, correctly answers &gt; 70% on
             the post consent quiz and is available for all study visits.

          7. Willing to avoid non-study related blood donation for 3 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

        While not a formal exclusion criterion, the deltoid area of both arms will be assessed for
        marks, burns and other skin damage. If, in the Investigator's opinion, assessment of local
        reactions could be impaired, the subject may be excluded under criterion 23.

          1. Has any known history of malaria infection, is a long-term resident (&gt; 5 years) of a
             malaria-endemic area, was born and resided in a malaria-endemic area, or has traveled
             to a malaria-endemic area within the previous 6 months.

          2. Has a positive urine pregnancy test prior to malaria challenge (if female of
             childbearing potential), is lactating, or has the intention to become pregnant within
             2 months after enrollment in this study.

          3. Use of any antibiotic (that has known or potential antimalarial properties) or
             antimalarial drug beginning 28 days prior to the screening and extending to Day 56 of
             study surveillance.

          4. Has evidence of increased cardiovascular disease risk (defined as &gt; 10%, 5 year risk)
             as determined by the method of Gaziano. Risk factors include sex, age (years),
             systolic blood pressure (mm Hg), smoking staus (current vs. past or never), BMI
             (kg/mm2), reported diabetes status (yes/no), current treatment for raised blood
             pressure (yes/no).

          5. Is immunosuppressed (e.g., poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, renal
             insufficiency, active malignancy, connective tissue disease, organ transplant) as a
             result of an underlying illness or treatment.

          6. An abnormal ECG, defined as one showing pathologic Q waves and significant ST-T wave
             changes; left ventricular hypertrophy; any non-sinus rhythm excluding isolated
             premature atrial contractions; right or left bundle branch block; or advanced
             (secondary or tertiary) A-V heart block.

          7. Has an active neoplastic disease (excluding nonmelanotic skin cancer) or neoplastic
             disease within the past 5 years or any history of hematologic malignancy.

          8. Is using or intends to continue using oral or parenteral steroids, high-dose inhaled
             steroids (&gt;800 micrograms/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) or other
             immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs (an exception includes asthma for which any oral
             or inhaled steroid intake will mean exclusion from study enrollment).

          9. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B surface antigen
             positivity, or Hepatitis C infection.

         10. Has a history of alcohol or drug abuse in the last 5 years.

             this study.

         12. Has a history of psoriasis or porphyria, which may be exacerbated after treatment with
             chloroquine.

         13. Has an acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would render malaria challenge unsafe or would interfere with the evaluation of
             responses (this includes, but is not limited to: known liver disease, renal disease,
             neurological disorders, visual field defects, cardiac disorders, pulmonary disorders,
             auditory damage, diabetes mellitus, and transplant recipients).

         21. Received an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or
             medication) within 1 month prior to enrollment in this study, or expects to receive an
             experimental agent during the 2-month post-challenge period.

         22. Has a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bi-polar disease or other major psychiatric
             condition that makes study compliance difficult (e.g. subjects with psychoses or
             history of suicide attempt or gesture in the 3 years before study entry, ongoing risk
             for suicide)

         23. Has any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator, place the
