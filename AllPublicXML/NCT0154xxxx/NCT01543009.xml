      The aim of this study is to determine if local application of heat increases the probability
      of insertion of peripheral venous catheter at the first attempt, reduces the time needed to
      obtain cannulation and maintains the analgesic effect of Emla in children undergoing
      peripheral venous cannulation and previously treated with local analgesia with Emla.
