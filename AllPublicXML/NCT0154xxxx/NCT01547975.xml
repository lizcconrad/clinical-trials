      Currently, no demographic and surgical results comparing different donor cornea sources were
      available in Taiwan. National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), as one of the largest
      tertiary medical centers in northern Taiwan, is now in charge of a big part of intense care
      for patients receiving corneal transplantation. With detailed medical record done of these
      patients during care in the ward and out-patient clinic, the investigators are competence for
      this meaningful program.

      An insufficient donor supply is a worldwide problem in organ transplantation. Even with
      corneal transplantations, the most widely performed transplantation, shortages and imbalances
      in donor supply is a global concern. In National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), the
      investigators performed over one hundred of corneal transplantations every year and the
      majority of donor corneas were from the eye bank in United States. Previous literature showed
      satisfactory results in corneal transplantation using foreign donor corneas compared with
      domestic corneas. However longer preservation time had associated with a statistically
      significant increased risk of persistence of the postoperative epithelial defect. On the
      other hand, longer storage times may allow better outcomes in high-risk grafts because of the
      depletion of donor T cells from the donor cornea into the storage media.

      Currently, no demographic and surgical results comparing different donor cornea sources were
      available in Taiwan. NTUH, as one of the largest tertiary medical centers in northern Taiwan,
      is now in charge of a big part of intense care for patients receiving corneal
      transplantation. With detailed medical record done of these patients during care in the ward
      and out-patient clinic, the investigators are competence for this meaningful program.
