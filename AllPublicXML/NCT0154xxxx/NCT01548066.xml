  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta-catenin, the transducer of Wnt signaling, is critical in development, growth, and
      regeneration of hair. In the absence of Wnt signals, cytoplasmic β-catenin is maintained at
      low level through regulation by GSK-3, multifunctional serine/threonin kinase. After
      phosphorylation by GSK-3, β-catenin is ubiquitinated and degraded in cytoplasm. Therefore,
      inhibition of GSK-3 is able to increase β-catenin in nucleus and would be able to induce
      growth of hair. Valproic acid (VPA) is an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug used for
      decades and is known to inhibit the GSK-3β. However, the effect of VPA on hairs has not been
      studied yet.
