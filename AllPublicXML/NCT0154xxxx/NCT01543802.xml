      The purpose of this study is to examine if a short-term treatment with pazopanib, an oral
      drug inhibiting the growth of blood vessel, can reduce the metabolism of soft-tissue sarcomas
      and thus facilitate their resection when given prior to surgery. Moreover, the study assesses
      the prognostic and predictive value of several new biomarkers (endothelial progenitor cells,
      soluble vascular epithelial growth factor),
