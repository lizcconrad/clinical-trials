    <measure>Maximum Change From Baseline in QTc Interval Based on the Fridericia Correction (QTcF) Method</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (28 day cycle), Day 1: pre-dose and at multiple timepoints (up to 6 hours) post-dose; Cycle 2 (28 day cycle), Day 1: pre-dose and at multiple timepoints (up to 6 hours) post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements (each recording separated by approximately 1 minute) were performed and average was calculated. The time corresponding to beginning of depolarization to repolarization of the ventricles (QT interval) was adjusted for RR interval using QT and RR from each ECG by Fridericia's formula (QTcF = QT divided by cube root of RR). Results of change in QTcF analyzed from 12-lead ECGs performed at each time point were averaged for analysis and a maximum across all post-dosing time points was used. Baseline is defined as the average of the triplicate 12-lead ECG measurements taken at the specified time prior to dosing.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Change From Baseline in QTc Based on the Bazett Correction (QTcB) Method, PR, QRS and Uncorrected QT Interval</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (28 day cycle), Day 1: pre-dose and at multiple timepoints (up to 6 hours) post-dose; Cycle 2 (28 day cycle), Day 1: pre-dose and at multiple timepoints (up to 6 hours) post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Triplicate 12-lead ECG measurements (each recording separated by approximately 1 minutes) were performed and average was calculated. The time corresponding to beginning of depolarization to repolarization of the ventricles (QT interval) was adjusted for RR interval using QT and RR from each ECG by Bazette's formula (QTcB = QT divided by square root of RR). Results of change in QTcB, PR, QRS and uncorrected QT analyzed from 12-lead ECGs performed at each time point were averaged for analysis and a maximum across all post-dosing time points was used. Baseline is defined as the average of the triplicate 12-lead ECG measurements taken at the specified time prior to dosing.</description>

    <measure>Changes From Baseline in Heart Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (28 day cycle), Day 1: pre-dose and at multiple timepoints (up to 6 hours) post-dose; Cycle 2 (28 day cycle), Day 1: pre-dose and at multiple timepoints (up to 6 hours) post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Triplicate 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements were performed and average was calculated. Supine heart rate was measured as beats per minute (bpm). Results of change in heart rate analyzed from 12-lead ECGs performed at each time point were averaged for analysis and a maximum across all post-dosing time points was used. Baseline is defined as the average of the triplicate 12-lead ECG measurements taken at the specified time prior to dosing.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting Change From Baseline in ECG Morphology</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (28 day cycle), Day 1: pre-dose and at multiple timepoints (up to 6 hours) post-dose; Cycle 2 (28 day cycle), Day 1: pre-dose and at multiple timepoints (up to 6 hours) post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with incidence of ECG morphology abnormalities were observed. Types of abnormalities included appearance of abnormal U waves, T waves inversion, elevation of ST segment, depression of ST segment, second or third degree heart block, right or left bundle branch block, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and myocardial infarction. New morphological changes were observed in abnormal U waves, depression of ST segment, and T waves inversion. Here, 'new' refers to change not present at baseline, ie, at any evaluation predose, and only seen postbaseline. Results of change in ECG morphology analyzed from 12-lead ECGs at each time point were averaged for analysis and a maximum across all post-dosing time points was used. Baseline is defined as the average of the triplicate 12-lead ECG measurements taken at the specified time prior to dosing.</description>

    <measure>Correlation Between the QTcF Change From Baseline and Plasma Concentrations of Orteronel</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (28 day cycle), Day 1: pre-dose and at multiple timepoints (up to 6 hours) post-dose; Cycle 2 (28 day cycle), Day 1: pre-dose and at multiple timepoints (up to 6 hours) post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Coefficient of correlation was measured using linear mixed effects model for the association between two variables; change from baseline versus the plasma concentration. Participant's effects on the intercept and plasma concentration slope were included in the model as random effects terms. Plasma concentrations were re scaled for model convergence. Average results at each time point were analyzed and a maximum across all post-dosing time points was used. Baseline is defined as the average of the triplicate 12-lead ECG measurements taken at the specified time prior to dosing.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting One or More Treatment-emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (Day 86)</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

        <description>Triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements (each recording separated by approximately 1 minute) were performed and average was calculated. The time corresponding to beginning of depolarization to repolarization of the ventricles (QT interval) was adjusted for RR interval using QT and RR from each ECG by Fridericia’s formula (QTcF = QT divided by cube root of RR). Results of change in QTcF analyzed from 12-lead ECGs performed at each time point were averaged for analysis and a maximum across all post-dosing time points was used. Baseline is defined as the average of the triplicate 12-lead ECG measurements taken at the specified time prior to dosing.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Reporting Change From Baseline in ECG Morphology</title>
        <description>Participants with incidence of ECG morphology abnormalities were observed. Types of abnormalities included appearance of abnormal U waves, T waves inversion, elevation of ST segment, depression of ST segment, second or third degree heart block, right or left bundle branch block, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and myocardial infarction. New morphological changes were observed in abnormal U waves, depression of ST segment, and T waves inversion. Here, 'new' refers to change not present at baseline, ie, at any evaluation predose, and only seen postbaseline. Results of change in ECG morphology analyzed from 12-lead ECGs at each time point were averaged for analysis and a maximum across all post-dosing time points was used. Baseline is defined as the average of the triplicate 12-lead ECG measurements taken at the specified time prior to dosing.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
