      Background:

      - Some people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) develop problems with thinking and
      concentration when the virus affects the brain. This is known as mild neurocognitive disorder
      (MND). Research has shown that some HIV medications do not get through the blood brain
      barrier very well. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a brain protein that is part of the blood brain
      barrier. Differences in the activity of P-gp may help explain why some people with HIV
      develop MND. It is also possible that MND is partly due to inflammation in the brain.
      Researchers want to study P-gp and its effect on MND and HIV infection.

      Objectives:

      - To study P-gp and brain inflammation related to HIV infection.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals between 18 and 60 years of age who have HIV and either do or do not have
           MND.

        -  Healthy volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected.

        -  Participants will have one outpatient visit and one 3-day inpatient stay.

        -  At the outpatient visit, participants will provide blood samples and have a lumbar
           puncture (spinal tap). The spinal tap will collect cerebrospinal fluid for study.

        -  At the inpatient visit, participants will have two positron emission tomography (PET)
           scans of the brain. These scans will study brain activity and possible inflammation. One
           scan will involve a study drug called tariquidar, which blocks the activity of P-gp. A
           second lumbar puncture will be done before the first PET scan. Blood and urine samples
           will be collected daily.

      Objective:

      To determine the relationship among neuroinflammation, Permeability-glycoprotein (P-gp)
      function and mild neurocognitive disorder (MND), a cognitive disorder associated with HIV
      infection.

      Study Population:

      HIV seropositive subjects with MND, HIV seropositive subjects with normal cognitive function,
      and HIV seronegative control subjects.

      Design:

      Subjects will undergo history and physical exam, screening laboratory tests, EKG, brain MRI
      and neuropsychological evaluation. HIV-seropositive subjects will be stratified based on
      results of neuropsychological evaluation into HIV-seropositive controls (i.e., cognitively
      normal) and HIV-seropositive with MND. All subjects will receive brain PET imaging with
      [11C]dLop after P-gp blockade to measure the function of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier.
      P-gp will be blocked prior to the PET scan with tariquidar. HIV-seropositive subjects will
      receive one lumbar puncture at baseline and one lumbar puncture after P-gp blockade with
      tariquidar to measure CSF concentrations of anti-retroviral medications and to measure
      biomarkers of blood-brain barrier integrity and inflammation in the CSF. HIV-seronegative
      subjects will receive one lumbar puncture at baseline to measure biomarkers of blood-brain
      barrier integrity and inflammation in the CSF.

      Outcome Measures:

      The main outcome measures of the study is brain uptake of [11C]dLop in response to P-gp
      blockade with tariquidar. We will correct for individual metabolism of tariquidar by
      measuring the plasma concentration of tariquidar during the P-gp blocked scan.

      As a secondary outcome measure, concentrations of anti-retroviral medications in CSF will be
      measured in HIV seropositive subjects with and without MND. CSF concentrations will be used
      as a surrogate marker for CNS delivery of anti-retroviral drugs.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Subjects must be between 18 and 60 years of age.

               2. Capable of providing informed consent.

               3. Ambulatory at initial visit.

               4. Speak English fluently

               5. For HIV seropositive subjects:

                    1. Confirmation of HIV antibody status by ELISA and Western Blot

                    2. Documented HIV-infection for at least one year

                    3. On a stable antiretroviral regimen that includes a protease inhibitor for at

        Specific inclusion criteria for mild neurocognitive disorder are as follows:

          1. Subject has an acquired mild-to-moderate impairment in cognitive function documented
             by a score of at least 1 SD below demographically corrected norms on testing of at
             least two different cognitive domains.

          2. The cognitive impairment interferes, at least mildly, with activities of daily living,
             as determined by neuropsychological interview.

          3. The impairment does not meet DSM-IV criteria for delirium or dementia.

          4. The impairment is not fully explained by co-morbid conditions.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Current Axis I psychiatric illness or severe systemic disease (other than HIV and MND)
             based on history and physical exam that would make study participation unsafe in the
             opinion of the investigators.

          2. Current alcohol use greater than 14 drinks per week for men and 7 drinks per week for
             women.

             ANC greater than or equal to 1500 cells/ul, platelet count greater than or equal to
             100,000 cells/ul, serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 times upper limit of

             normal cardiac function (e.g., normal stress test or echocardiogram results).

          5. Previous research radiation exposure (X-rays, PET scans etc.) that, with the study PET
             scans, would exceed annual research limits.

          6. Pregnancy or breast feeding.

          7. Evidence of brain disease such as stroke, tumor, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, or
             any neurodegenerative disease on history or on screening MRI.

          8. Inability to lay on his/her back for long periods, severe claustrophobia, pacemaker,
             or other contraindication for MRI.

          9. More than moderate hypertension, defined as blood pressure greater than or equal to
             160/95 at the time of screening.

         11. Subjects taking medications, other than anti-retroviral drugs, that are known
             substrates of P-gp that cannot be safely discontinued for this study. Anti-retroviral
             drugs, particularly protease inhibitors such as ritonavir, that are P-gp substrates
             are allowed.

        Note: The rationale for the exclusion criteria for alcohol use is to avoid alcohol-related
        cognitive impairment as a confounding factor.
