    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of participants that initiate
      allergen immunotherapy (AIT) upon the recommendation of their physician and the proportion of
      participants that persist with their AIT throughout the recommended course.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Advised to Start AIT Who Elected Subcutaneous Immunotherapy (SCIT) Shots or Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT) Drops</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who were advised by their physician to start AIT and elected to initiate AIT was calculated. AIT initiation was broken down by type of AIT initiated (SCIT or SLIT).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Initiated SCIT or SLIT and Completed 5 Years of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who initiated SCIT or SLIT and completed 5 years of treatment was calculated. Duration of SCIT or SLIT was based on dates when allergy extract prescriptions were refilled. If extract refills continued past the recommended time for therapy (e.g. 5 years from the start of therapy), the participant was deemed successful in completing the recommended course. If the extract refills stopped prior to the end of the recommended time for therapy, but the last refill occurred within 6 months of the recommended time for therapy, this participant was deemed successful in completing the recommended course.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Treatment With SCIT or SLIT</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The mean duration in years of SCIT or SLIT treatment for all participants with AR who initiated SCIT or SLIT was calculated. Duration of SCIT or SLIT was based on dates when allergy extract prescriptions were refilled.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reason for Discontinuation of SCIT or SLIT More Than 6 Months Before Completion of the Recommended Course</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The reason for discontinuation of SCIT or SLIT treatment more than 6 months before completion of the recommended course of therapy was recorded. The percentage of participants whose records were reveiwed and who discontinued SCIT or SLIT due to different reasons was calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Co-morbidity of Asthma Who Initiated SCIT or SLIT</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who had AR and asthma and initiated SCIT or SLIT was calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of SCIT or SLIT Treatment for Participants With AR and Asthma or AR Alone</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The mean duration in years of SCIT or SLIT treatment for all participants with AR and asthma and for all participants with AR only was calculated. Duration of SCIT or SLIT treatment was based on dates when allergy extract prescriptions were refilled.</description>
