    <textblock>
      A research study on the diagnosis of spread of disease for children who have been diagnosed
      with solid tumors using a new whole body imaging technique and a new MR contrast agent
      (ferumoxytol). Standard tests that are used to determine the extent and possible spread of a
      child's disease include magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, computed tomography (CT), Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET) as well as bone scanning, and metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)
      scanning. The purpose of this study is to determine if newer imaging tests referred to as
      whole body diffusion-weighted MR and whole body PET/MR can detect the extent and spread of
      the disease as accurately or even better as the standard tests (CT, MR and/or PET/CT). The
      advantage of the new imaging test is that it is associated with no or significantly reduced
      radiation exposure compared to standard CT and PET/CT imaging tests. The results of whole
      body MR and PET/MR will be compared with that of the conventional, standard imaging studies
      for tumor detecting.

    <textblock>
      New developments in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technology provide an alternative to
      radiographic staging techniques. Novel whole body (WB) diffusion weighted MR scans (WB-DW-MR)
      provide a very high tumor-to background contrast, similar to 18F-FDG PET scans. Therefore,
      this study was designed to compare the sensitivity of whole-body MR and 18F-FDG PET for
      detecting metastatic disease in children with malignant lymphomas and malignant sarcomas.
      Recently, integrated whole body PET/MRI technologies have been proposed as a compromise
      between radiation-free WB-DW MRI (which does not provide information about tumor metabolism)
      and PET/CT, which is associated with high radiation exposure.

      Pediatric patients with a newly diagnosed malignant lymphoma, malignant sarcoma or other
      solid tumor, who are scheduled to undergo clinical imaging for tumor staging, will also
      undergo WB-DW-MR and integrated 18F-FDG PET/MR as a staging procedure prior to, during and
      after treatment. Following intravenous injection of ferumoxytol (Feraheme) and/or
      18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG), WB-DW-MR scans and integrated 18F-FDG PET/MR scans will be
      obtained simultaneously on a 3T PET/MR system with an acquisition time of 60-90 minutes. Very
      young patients who would need an anesthesia or sedation for this study will be excluded in
      order to keep this initial research exam minimally invasive. Two experienced pediatric
      radiologists will determine the presence, location and size of primary tumors and metastases
      separately for the WB-DW-MR, 18F-FDG PET/MR studies and 18F-FDG PET or PET/CT scans. The
      presence or absence of tumor lesions will be confirmed by histopathology or clinical and
      imaging follow-up over at least one year as the standard of reference.
