  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our overarching aim is to set up a procedural, analytic and developmental framework to
      establish CT of the central and peripheral skeleton as a clinically useful biomarker for
      skeletal strength in the clinical research and ultimately in the clinical setting. To
      accomplish this, the investigators will develop and validate phantoms and scanning procedures
      to standardize strength and structure measurements between different vQCT scanners and
      develop standardized acquisition, analytical, and quality control techniques for HR-pQCT with
      an emphasis on optimization for multi-center studies.

      The investigators will develop new calibration phantoms to address inter and intra scanner
      variability in vQCT and HRpQCT. Phantom sets to evaluate inter-scanner disparity and
      determine corrections to apply to in vivo scan data in the multi-center settings. These
      methods will be validated in a multi-center phantom study and in a 120 patients

    <description>Correction of the in vivo images using the proposed inter-scanner calibration approaches will improve the quality of multi-site data by reducing the variability in CT structure and strength measures. To study the Multi-center standardization of vQCT and HR-pQCT imaging we will develop new calibration phantoms to address inter and intra-scanner variability in vQCT and HRpQCT bone strength and structure estimates.</description>

    <time_frame>Time frame will be 3 hours for a visit</time_frame>
    <description>To provide standardized analysis of future clinical studies and retrospective analysis of past trials, we will develop a set of image analysis metrics for vQCT (trabecular, cortical and integral BMD, cortical thickness, cross-sectional areas, axial and bending strength estimates). These metrics will be made available to the community in an open source format, allowing them to be incorporated into commercial software platforms at the discretion of the manufacturer, incorporation as a plug-in for NIH supported programs such as MIPAV.</description>
