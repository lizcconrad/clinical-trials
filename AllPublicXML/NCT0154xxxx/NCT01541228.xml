      Aim of the study: To evaluate clinical effectiveness of two different light doses when
      treating actinic keratoses with photodynamic therapy with 20% 5-aminolevulinic acid.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine and compare clinical and histological effectiveness of different (70 J/cm2 ir
      100 J/cm2) light doses when treating actinic keratoses with photodynamic therapy.

      To determine pain intensity during photodynamic therapy with visual analogue scale and
      factors influencing pain during the procedure.

    <description>Patients take part in intraindividual (left-right) comparison study when having at least 2 non-hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses (AK) on the left and right sides of the face/scalp.
Punch biopsies in 3.5 millimetres diameter performed to confirm the diagnosis of AK.
Patients randomized so that half of them would receive a light dose of 70J/cm2 as their first split face/scalp treatment on the left side. Photodynamic therapy with the light dose of 70 J/cm2 using a broad-band red light source (570-670 nm,Curelight®, PhotoCure, Oslo, Norway) and 20% 5-ALA. Treatment repeated twice with two weeks interval.</description>
