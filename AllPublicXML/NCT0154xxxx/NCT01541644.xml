    <textblock>
      Patients are asked to be in this study if they have multiple myeloma and are having tingling,
      numbness and pain from taking bortezomib (velcade®). Patients who have been diagnosed with
      multiple myeloma often take bortezomib (velcade®).

      This research is being done to find out if acupuncture can reduce the nerve pain, tingling,
      and/or numbness patients experience due to bortezomib (velcade®).

      Acupuncture is a medical technique of inserting very thin needles into the &quot;energy points&quot; on
      the body with the aim to restore health and well-being. It has been used widely to treat
      pain, such as lower back pain and nerve pain. In this study we will see if acupuncture can be
      used to ease nerve pain and tingling, numbness that is caused by bortezomib.

      Information gained from this clinical trial will provide insight into the efficacy and
      mechanism of acupuncture in reducing Bortezomib-induced Peripheral Neuropathy (BIPN) in
      multiple myeloma patients. It will examine the effect of acupuncture on serum proinflammatory
      cytokine and β-endorphin levels to further understand the mechanism of acupuncture on a
      molecular level. This study is the first clinical trial studying the effect of acupuncture on
      treating BIPN. It is also the first study to explore the mechanism of acupuncture through
      frequent small amount of blood draws at six time points to detect changes in proinflammatory
      cytokines and β-endorphins. It has the potential to identify a minimal risk
      non-pharmacological intervention to alleviate BIPN symptoms, and to significantly improve our
      understanding of the mechanism of acupuncture.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS) uses self-report visual analogue scales (VAS) to quantify on a scale of 0-10 (with total NPS score of 1-100), global pain intensity and unpleasantness and 8 other descriptive qualities of neuropathic pain. Response defined as average change of Clinical Total Neuropathy Score (TNSc) greater than or equal to 10% over 10 weeks compared to baseline. Effect defined as as average change of Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Neurotoxicity/ Gynecologic Oncology Group (FACT/GOG-Ntx)over 10 weeks as compared to baseline. Safety will be assessed by recording side effects from acupuncture treatment. Please note TNSc results deemed invalid as original validation of TNSc was performed by 2 neuromuscular trained physicians &amp; the TNSc in our trial was performed by a research nurse. The reliability &amp; validity of research nurse's TNSc not established pre-trial. For the scale range, the higher the score the worse the symptoms and function. No subscales were used.</description>
