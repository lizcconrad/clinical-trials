  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) practically requires moderate to deep
      sedation by a combination of benzodiazepine and opioid. Propofol as a sole agent may cause
      oversedation. A combination (cocktail) of infused propofol, meperidine, and midazolam can
      reduce the dosage of propofol and may result in a lower risk of oversedation. The
      investigators prospectively compare the efficacy, recovery time, patient satisfactory, and
      side effects between cocktail and conventional sedations in patients undergoing ERCP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ERCP patients were prospectively randomized into 2 groups; the cocktail group and the
      controls. For induction, a combination of 25 mg of meperidine and 2.5 mg of midazolam were
      injected in both groups. In the cocktail group, a bolus dose of propofol 1 mg/kg was
      administered and continuously infused. In the controls, 25 mg of meperidine or 2.5 mg/kg of
      midazolam were titrated to maintain the level of sedation.

    <description>(1) hypotension (systolic blood pressure drops to less than 90 mmHg or decreases more than 25% from the baseline), (2) bradycardia (heart rate &lt;40 beats/min), (3) desaturation (oxygen saturation &lt;90% for &gt;10 seconds), and (4) apnea (cessation of respiratory activity for over 10 seconds under visual observation). If the oxygen saturation dropped to &lt;85% for more than 30 seconds despite oxygen supplementation or apnea occurred, the procedure would be interrupted and reversal medications would be given to the patient.</description>

    <description>For induction, 25 mg of meperidine and 2.5 mg of midazolam were administered in both groups. In the cocktail group, one milligram per kilogram body weight of 1% propofol emulsion (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Irvine, CA) was slowly infused by an automated pump (Terufusion syringe pump TE-331, Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). To maintain conscious level of patient in the conventional group to be at moderate or deep level, 25 mg of meperidine and/or 2.5 mg of midazolam were administered as necessary, whereas patients in the cocktail group were continuously administered with 1% propofol at the rate of 1 mg/kg/hr. An additional 0.5 mg/kg bolus was administered as needed to achieve the designed conscious level.</description>
