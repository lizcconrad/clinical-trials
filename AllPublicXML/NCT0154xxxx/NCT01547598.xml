      This non-inferiority study will assess safety and efficacy of LUMIGAN® RC (bimatoprost
      ophthalmic solution 0.01%) versus DuoTrav® (travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% combination
      ophthalmic solution) in patients previously on Travatan® Z (travoprost ophthalmic solution
      0.004%) monotherapy.

The mean diurnal IOP was the average of the IOP values of the study eye (worse eye) at Week 12 measured at 8 AM, 12 Noon and 4 PM. For each study eye, IOP was either the average of 2 measurements, or, if a third measurement was required, the average of 3 measurements.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean IOP at Week 12</title>
        <description>IOP is a measurement of the fluid pressure inside the eye. IOP of the study eye (worse eye) was measured at 8 AM, 12 Noon and 4 PM at Week 12. For each eye, IOP was either the average of 2 measurements, or, if a third measurement was required, the average of 3 measurements. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>
