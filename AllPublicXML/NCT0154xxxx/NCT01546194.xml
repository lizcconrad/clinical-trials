  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In most current academic anesthesia groups, it appears that consent for research is acquired
      on the day of surgery. This practice raises concerns because the hospital may be regarded as
      a coercive environment and there may be the possibility that the immediate preoperative
      environment prohibits adequate time for understanding the research project and making an
      informed decision about participation. However, this is often the only opportunity for
      anesthesiologists to obtain research consent. The aim of the present investigation is to
      utilize a survey study to determine if patients at Evanston Hospital are comfortable
      consenting for research on the day of surgery
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients participating in approved, minimal risk clinical research projects will be
      approached by the study investigators. Consent for clinical research will be obtained on the
      day of surgery in the ambulatory surgery unit. In addition, some patients will be contacted
      by telephone on the day prior to surgery to be informed that they will be approached about
      participation in a research project. If patients agree to participate in the clinical trial,
      they will be provided with a self-addressed envelope containing the survey and a brief cover
      letter. The research team member will explain the purpose of the survey (to determine
      patients' attitudes towards research consent on the day of surgery). Subjects will be
      requested to complete the survey within a week of the surgical procedure. Two days after
      surgery, the research team will provide a follow-up call to determine if there are any
      questions about completing the survey. Although patient names will not be identified on the
      survey packet, all surveys will be coded with the subjects study number for subsequent
      analysis.

      Questions are designed to investigate six areas of potential concern relating to informed
      consent; comprehension, situation (privacy/time), obligation (pressure) motivation,
      compunction (regrets), and satisfaction. Subjects will reply using a 5-point scale from
      1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree.
