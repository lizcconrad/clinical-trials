  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A commonly administered conservative non-pharmacological treatment for OA is exercise, with
      beneficial effects in terms of reduced pain and disability.

      While the link between exercise and reduced disability is mediated by e.g. increased muscle
      strength and endurance, the analgesic mechanisms related to exercise are unexplored. knee OA
      patients have both peripheral and central sensitization of pain mechanisms resulting in
      hyperalgesia. Thus, targeted pain treatment in these patients may focus on both peripheral
      and central mechanisms but it unknown if exercise affects either of these mechanisms.

      It is hypothesized that in knee OA patients exercise reduces the pain sensitivity
