      Site of research: Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH), Department of Obstetrics and
      Gynaecology and University of Helsinki Department of Psychology, in collaboration with
      Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden

      In Finland and in Sweden, fear of childbirth is one of the most common reasons for
      consultation of obstetrician, and for an elective caesarean section. Approximately 5 to 6% of
      pregnant women suffer from severe fear of childbirth, which disturbs family-life and working
      and prevents the preparation to normal childbirth and parenthood. It represents as
      nightmares, panic attacks, anxiety, and as numerous physical complaints. After giving birth
      it can be difficult for these women to form an early mother-infant-relationship. Their risk
      for puerperal depression is also increased.

      Finland and Sweden have both a long tradition in research of this field. In Finland, the
      investigators research group started the first out-patient clinic for fearful pregnant women
      in HUCH in1996. Different strategies how to treat fear of childbirth have been applied to
      clinical practise. Studies on the treatment for fear of childbirth are, however, scanty. Some
      descriptive studies have showed that far more than one half of patients can, after the
      treatment, prepare to a normal vaginal delivery and caesarean without a medical indication
      can be avoided. The aim of the treatment should be both to avoid unnecessary caesareans,
      increase the number of uneventful vaginal deliveries and to help the pregnant couple to
      prepare to parenthood, as well as to prevent puerperal depression.

      In this study, psychotherapeutic group psychoeducation is studied as promising treatment for
      severe fear of childbirth. To screen fear of childbirth, all women coming to ultrasound
      screening at the 18 to 20 gestational week in HUCH are asked to fill in a specific
      questionnaire. Those nulliparous women whose score for fear exceeds 95th percentile are
      randomized to intervention and to control group.

      The intervention group is invited to start a psychotherapeutic group therapy based on
      cognitive and psychodynamic therapy combined with training in relaxation. Each group consists
      of six nulliparous women and meets six times during pregnancy 120 minutes at a time. Between
      the sessions the patients fill in a homework questionnaire. One session focuses on the
      partner's role and the partners are present then. Three months after delivery, the groups
      meet once more.

      The women in the control group stay in the care of community midwives and general physicians.
      If needed, they are referred to out-patient clinic in the maternity hospital where their fear
      is treated according the clinical practice of that hospital, mainly support from obstetrician
      or midwife.

      The women and their partners in both groups are asked, approximately one month after the
      screening and one month before the due date of delivery, to fill in the questionnaires
      examining depression, self-esteem, general anxiety, social support, marital satisfaction,
      personal projects and concerns, and efficacy concerning childbirth and maternity. After
      childbirth, data about the childbirth will be collected. Three months and two years after
      childbirth mothers and fathers in both groups receive again a psychosocial questionnaires.

      The aim of the study is to help the authorities to organize the treatment for fear of
      childbirth in their districts by examining the benefits of the treatment also in long-run.
      The investigators hope the results would lead to production of Current Care guidelines for
      fear of childbirth.
