  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed at verifying whether sessions of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation over a certain brain area (the supplementary motor area) could be useful in the
      relief of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Patients were randomly administered either real (n = 12) or sham (n = 10) rTMS, once a day, 5
      days a week, for 2 weeks. Randomization was performed according to a computer-generated
      schedule. Subjects and scale-rater physician were blind to treatment status of individuals.
      Only the rTMS administrator was aware of group allocations. Treatment response was assessed
      by self-and clinician-rated scales before treatment, immediately after treatment and 3 months
      thereafter, with the same examiner following a subject throughout the study. All patients
      included in the study had failed adequate pharmacological treatment for at least 2
      antiobsessional drugs. Their prescription drugs were continued without change in dosage
      regimens throughout the study.

    <description>rTMS was administered by means of a NEURO-MS (NEUROSOFT LTD®, Russia) with a focal 8-shaped 70 mm coil. Stimulation parameters were 1-Hz, 20-min trains (1200 pulses/day) at 100% of resting MT, once a day, 5 days a week, for 2 weeks.</description>

    <description>The sham treatment was performed using the Neurosoft ® sham coil. A metal plate placed inside this coil prevents the magnetic field from stimulating the cortex. This coil looks and sounds like an active coil.</description>
