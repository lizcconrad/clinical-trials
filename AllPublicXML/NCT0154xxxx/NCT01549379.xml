  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer, this study will use dynamic
      contrast-enhanced CT scans to try to determine which lymph nodes in the neck contain cancer
      and require surgical removal.

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This group will consist of 15 patients with locally advanced HNSCC of the oral cavity, larynx or hypopharynx presenting with adenopathy ≥ 1 cm where the recommended treatment is surgical resection of the primary malignancy with bilateral neck dissection. These patients will receive a DCE-CT scan of the head and neck prior to surgery.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Chemoradiation Patients</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This group will consist of 15 patients with locally advanced HNSCC with lymph nodes ≥3 cm in which chemoradiotherapy is the primary treatment as per standard of care. This group will be composed of patients with a primary malignancy originating in the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx or larynx. Pre-treatment DCE-CT of neck will be obtained. The standard therapy, radiation and chemotherapy, will be administered and the patients will have standard follow up. A post-treatment DCE-CT of neck will be obtained 8-10 weeks after treatment along with standard CT neck.</description>

    <description>The neck will be scanned using 120 kVp, 50 mAs, 8 x 5 mm slices at intervals of 2.8 - 3.0 s for 3 min. Contrast (e.g. Visipaque 320) at a dosage of 0.7 ml/kg is injected at 4 ml/s through an antecubital vein after a delay of 6 s from start of scanning.</description>
