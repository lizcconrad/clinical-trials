      The purpose of this study is to verify the presents of autoantibodies in serums of MDS serum
      patients who had an inadequate response or did not respond to Recombinant human
      erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment.

      MDS are a heterogeneous group of hematologic disorders broadly characterized by cytopenias
      associated with a dimorphic and usually cellular bone marrow, and by consequent ineffective
      blood cell production. 85% of patients have a severe anemia which is Associated with lowering
      quality of life and Often requires blood transfusions. Historically, only stem cell
      transplantation offers cure. however, multiple new drugs have been approved for treatment,
      such as to Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment for dealing with the anemia.
      rHuEPO treatment can improve hematocrit level in 25% of patient which leaves the rest with
      the need of other treatment solution. Studies have shown presents of anti- rHuEPO in blood
      serums which followed Treatment of other diseases. These findings can indicate the
      possibility of the presence of antibodies in MDS patients as well.

    <description>Response to Erythropoietine (EPO) was defined as a rise in untransfused hemoglobin concentration of at least 2 g/dl or a 50% decrease in transfusion requirements over the treatment period.
