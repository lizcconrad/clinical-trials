  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new device delivering a sound-based
      intervention (termed acoustic coordinated reset neuromodulation) has significant clinical
      benefit for people with intrusive tinnitus. It is hypothesised that the particular pattern of
      sound stimulation delivered by the device acts to break up patterns of synchronous nerve
      firing in the brain that may be responsible for the sensation of tinnitus. We will also
      measure brain activity in a subset of participants to determine if the intervention results
      in changes in brainwave activity.

    <textblock>
      Tinnitus affects a large number of people in the UK population but is a poorly understood
      disorder with no form of treatment that benefits everyone. One theory about tinnitus is that
      it is caused by altered patterns of synchronous nerve firing in the brains hearing centres.
      It is believed that conditions such as hearing loss lead to changes in how areas of the brain
      responsible for hearing are 'wired up' causing large areas of the brain to fire at the same
      time; this is believed to be a mechanism responsible for the sensation of tinnitus. Research
      suggests that this type of synchronous activity may be interrupted by presenting very
      specific sequences of sounds to the ears over several months. If sound stimulation can be
      used to break up patterns of synchronous activity in the hearing brain, then it is argued
      that it should also be effective in treating tinnitus. The German company ANM have patented a
      very specific algorithm of sound simulation that is delivered via headphones from a
      pocket-sized device. This treatment is currently being marketed by the private healthcare
      sector in Germany and very recently in the UK. The purpose of this study is to independently
      test the effects of this new therapy on tinnitus severity and related brain activity. We will
      gather information using questionnaires and listening tests, and make recording of electrical
      brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG).

    <description>The WHOQOL-BREF is a 26-item, multi-attribute questionnaire measure of health related quality of life. Outcome was measured as a change on Question 1: 'How would you rate your quality of life (over the past 4 weeks)?' There are 5 response options (Very poor=1; Poor=2; Neither poor nor good=3; Good=4; Very good=5). Change was computed as 'visit 2' - 'visit 6' and so a positive change score indicates a reduction in self-perceived quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Normalized Oscillatory Power in the Delta Brainwave Pattern as Measured by Electroencephalography (EEG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (visit 2) and 12 weeks (visit 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Non-invasive recording to measure rhythmic patterns of spontaneous brain activity at rest. An a priori hypothesis targeted normalized delta rhythm. Band powers were calculated as percent change in delta brainwave pattern relative to change in total (1-90 Hz) EEG band. Comparison made between 'visit 2' and 'visit 6'.
We used a Neuroscan system (SynAmps2 model 8050, Compumedics Neuroscan, Charlotte, NC, USA) and custom cap with 66 equidistant scalp electrodes (Easycap, GmbH, Germany). A central frontal electrode was used as ground and a nose-tip electrode as reference. Electrode impedances were maintained at 5 kΩ prior to recordings. Recording was done with an offline filter of 0.5 to 200 Hz pass-band and 1 kHz sampling rate. Recording was over a continuous 10-minute period. Participants were seated in a quiet, darkened soundproof booth and were instructed to relax, keep eyes open and fix gaze on a marker point.</description>

    <description>The active comparator uses the same ear level device and also delivers patterned sound but the stimulus will be determined according to an algorithm predicted not to break up tinnitus generating activity in the brain. It may have a masking effect. For the first 12 weeks participants will be asked to wear the device every day for 6 hours, and in blocks of time not less than 1 hour. After 12 weeks, the participants will be unblinded and the device algorithm will be reprogrammed in the same way as the experimental intervention. In weeks 13-24 participants will be asked to wear the device for 6 hours per day, in continuous blocks of at least 1 hour. In weeks 25-36 they will be asked to continue using the device every day for 4 hours, in continuous blocks of at least 1 hour.</description>

          <population>We have analyzed both complete case and multiple imputed data for the mean change in global TFI score from baseline (visit 2) to 12 weeks (visit 6). Here we report complete case data.</population>

        <description>The WHOQOL-BREF is a 26-item, multi-attribute questionnaire measure of health related quality of life. Outcome was measured as a change on Question 1: 'How would you rate your quality of life (over the past 4 weeks)?' There are 5 response options (Very poor=1; Poor=2; Neither poor nor good=3; Good=4; Very good=5). Change was computed as 'visit 2' - 'visit 6' and so a positive change score indicates a reduction in self-perceived quality of life.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Normalized Oscillatory Power in the Delta Brainwave Pattern as Measured by Electroencephalography (EEG)</title>
        <description>Non-invasive recording to measure rhythmic patterns of spontaneous brain activity at rest. An a priori hypothesis targeted normalized delta rhythm. Band powers were calculated as percent change in delta brainwave pattern relative to change in total (1-90 Hz) EEG band. Comparison made between 'visit 2' and 'visit 6'.
We used a Neuroscan system (SynAmps2 model 8050, Compumedics Neuroscan, Charlotte, NC, USA) and custom cap with 66 equidistant scalp electrodes (Easycap, GmbH, Germany). A central frontal electrode was used as ground and a nose-tip electrode as reference. Electrode impedances were maintained at 5 kΩ prior to recordings. Recording was done with an offline filter of 0.5 to 200 Hz pass-band and 1 kHz sampling rate. Recording was over a continuous 10-minute period. Participants were seated in a quiet, darkened soundproof booth and were instructed to relax, keep eyes open and fix gaze on a marker point.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (visit 2) and 12 weeks (visit 6)</time_frame>
        <population>The EEG assessment was offered only to the first 50 participants enrolled at the Nottingham site. We have analyzed only complete case data for the mean change in delta band power from baseline (visit 2) to 12 weeks (visit 6).</population>
