  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
      among African American women who have sex with women (AAWSW). In addition, the study is
      interested in better understanding the types of risk behaviors that place AAWSW at risk for
      STIs. The investigators hypothesis is that AAWSW experience high rates of STIs, similar to
      heterosexual African American women. Knowledge gained from this study will guide development
      of interventions to reduce women's risk for these types of infections and will improve how
      AAWSW are screened for STIs.

      The objectives of this study are (1) To determine the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis,
      trichomoniasis, Chlamydia, gonorrhea, Mycoplasma genitalium, HIV, genital herpes, and
      syphilis and associated risk behaviors in a cohort of African American women who have sex
      with women (AAWSW) in Birmingham, Alabama; (2) To compare exclusive AAWSW (during the past 12
      months) to African American women who have sex with women and men (AAWSWM) in terms of
      socio-demographic characteristics, sexual risk behavior characteristics, and STI prevalence;
      and(3) To perform an exploratory prospective study of an age-matched (± 2 years) sub-group of
      exclusive AAWSW and AAWSWM over a 12 month time period to obtain data on differences in STI
      risk behaviors and STI incidence rates.
