    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the longevity of immune response in adolescents for approximately 48
      months after receipt of a primary series of bivalent rLP2086 vaccination, which is then
      followed by a booster dose and an assessment of immune response for 12 or 26 months post
      booster vaccination.

    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the longevity of immune responses in adolescents (aged 10 to &lt;19
      years at the time of entry into a primary study) following receipt of a vaccination regimen
      of 2 or 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086 in a primary study. A booster dose of bivalent rLP2086 at
      approximately 48 months was given following the final dose of the 2- or 3-dose primary
      bivalent rLP2086 vaccination series. The study was therefore divided into Stage 1 (4-year
      persistence of immune responses following receipt of a primary vaccination series) and the
      booster stage (follow-up through 12 months for all boosted or 26 months for a subset of the
      boosted).

      Subjects participating only in Stage 1 will attend up to 6 study visits for collection of a
      20-mL blood sample at each visit. Subjects participating in both Stage 1 and booster stage
      will attend up to 9-10 study visits with 1 visit for booster dose vaccination and 8-9 visits
      for collection of a 20-mL blood sample at each visit.

          5. A known or suspected defect of the immune system that would prevent an immune response
             to the vaccine, such as subjects with congenital or acquired defects in B-cell
             function, those receiving chronic systemic (oral, intravenous, or intramuscular)
             corticosteroid therapy, or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Subjects in the
             United States with terminal complement deficiency are excluded from participation in

             seizure).

          7. Current chronic use of systemic antibiotics.

          8. Current participation in another investigational study. Participation in purely
             observational studies is acceptable.

          9. Received any investigational vaccines, drugs, or devices within 28 days before
             administration of the booster vaccination.

         10. Any neuroinflammatory or autoimmune condition, including, but not limited to,
             transverse myelitis, uveitis, optic neuritis, and multiple sclerosis.

         11. Pregnant female subjects, breastfeeding female subjects, male subjects with partners
             who are currently pregnant, or male and female subjects of childbearing potential who
             are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as outlined
             in this protocol through Visit 10 of the study.
