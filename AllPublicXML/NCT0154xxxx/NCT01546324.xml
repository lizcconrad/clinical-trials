      The purpose of this study is to collect blood samples from pregnant women who achieved
      pregnancy following in-vitro fertilization (IVF) with Natera's preimplantation aneuploidy
      screening (with or without single gene gene testing). These samples will be used for test
      development of non-invasive prenatal diagnostic testing.

      Eligible subjects will sign a consent form and have blood drawn at approximately 8-17 weeks
      gestation. Subjects will received $200 reimbursement for providing this blood sample. The
      collected samples will be used to help develop non-invasive prenatal diagnostic testing using
      Natera's Parental Support technology which is already commercialized for genetic diagnosis of
      in-vitro embryos. In this study, the technology will be tested for it's ability to analyze
      fetal-specific pieces of DNA isolated from the mother's blood. No results of the maternal
      blood testing will be reported to the subject or to their physicians.
