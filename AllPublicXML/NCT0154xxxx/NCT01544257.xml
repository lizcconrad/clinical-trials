  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) in preterm infants has been documented
      and results from previous studies suggest the association between OMT and length of stay
      (LOS) reduction, as well as significant improvement in several clinical outcomes. The aim of
      the present study is to show the effect of OMT on LOS in a sample of premature infants.
