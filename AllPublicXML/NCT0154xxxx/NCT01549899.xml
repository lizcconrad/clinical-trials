  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to directly compare 6 sessions of in-person and Internet
      administered Cognitive-Behavior Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) to a Minimal Contact control
      (MC), within an active duty military population to determine the comparative benefits of
      these interventions on improvement in sleep as well as domains strongly related to insomnia
      such as depression, substance abuse, and PTSD symptoms. A total of 189 military personnel
      with chronic insomnia, aged 18-65, will be recruited and randomized to receive 6-sessions
      (over 6 weeks) of CBTi (n=77), ICBTi (n=35), or a MC control (n=77) condition. The
      investigators will compare these three groups on subjective and objective measures of sleep.
      The CBTi and MC control groups will be compared on other variables of interest (e.g.,
      depression, substance abuse, and PTSD symptoms) and predictors of outcomes.

    <description>Provides daily self-reports of bedtime, time to fall asleep, middle of the night awakenings, and time out of bed. These data will be aggregated to determine self-reported sleep efficiency (i.e., total sleep time/time in bed X 100). Other variable to be extracted will include total sleep time and total wake time.</description>

    <description>A wrist worn accelerometer that measures activity level and then uses validated algorithms to determine objectively daily bedtime, time to fall asleep, middle of the night awakenings, and time out of bed.

Other variable to be extracted will include total sleep time and total wake time.</description>

    <description>CBTi consisted of 6 weekly 60-minute sessions and included identical informational material. The treatments contained the following efficacious and commonly used modules of cognitive behavioral treatments for insomnia: Stimulus Control, Sleep Restriction, Sleep Hygiene, Relaxation Training, Cognitive Restructuring.</description>

    <description>The I-CBTi protocol was developed by the National Center for Telehealth and Technology with the first author (DJT) serving as the subject matter expert, and administered on the afterdeployment.org website. The information and instructions for I-CBTi were identical to in-person CBTi; however, their mode of delivery in I-CBTi is considerably different due to the constraints of its automated, online format. The lessons were presented as audio recordings accompanied by visual graphics and animations and several lessons, had interactive components such as games, quizzes, and prompts for participants to schedule healthy sleep habits.</description>

    <description>Those assigned to the MC control group will be asked to not work with another therapist or seek additional treatment for insomnia-related difficulties during the 6-week MC period. They will be called every other week to monitor their status and to provide support as needed. The calls will be limited to 10-15 minutes. MC participants will also be given contact information to use in case of worsening of symptoms or increasing distress. At the end of six weeks, they will complete the baseline assessments again, which will serve as the post-treatment assessment for the MC period. They will then be randomly assigned to either the CBTi or ICBTi groups.</description>

    <description>In-person CBTi was be provided by a master's or doctoral level mental health counselor (e.g., social worker or psychologist). This treatment consisted of 6-sessions and included the same efficacious and commonly used modules of CBTi (i.e., sleep education &amp; hygiene, stimulus control, progressive muscle relaxation, sleep restriction, and cognitive therapy).</description>

    <description>The ICBTi treatment is an online protocol developed by the National Center for Telehealth and Technology, with the PI (DJT) as the subject matter expert. The treatment consists of the same components as the in-person CBTi, but their mode of delivery was considerably different due to the constraints of its automated, online format. Each of the six ICBTi sessions was divided into lessons covering different aspects of each of the components. The lessons were presented as audio recordings accompanied by visual graphics and animations. For several lessons, interactive components were included, such as games, quizzes, and prompts for participants to schedule healthy sleep habits.</description>
