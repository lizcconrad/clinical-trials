      Single-Center, Pilot, controlled adverse environment (CAE) Study.

      This is a single-center, one visit, pilot, CAE study. Dry Eye Subjects (N=30) who qualify
      will undergo tear film video recording, fluorescein staining, and break up time before CAE
      exposure and after CAE exposure.

      All subjects will undergo baseline dry eye assessments including fluorescein staining,
      breakup time, conjunctival redness and tear film video recording. Subjects who qualify will
      then undergo CAE exposure for 90 minutes. At the end of CAE exposure subjects will undergo
      dry eye assessments again.
