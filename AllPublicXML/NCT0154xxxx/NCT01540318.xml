  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major goal of this project is to conduct a randomized controlled trial studying an
      initial evaluation strategy with abdominal ultrasound versus a strategy without abdominal
      ultrasound for the evaluation of children with blunt abdominal trauma. The proposal's
      objectives are to compare the following variables in those that randomize to abdominal
      ultrasound versus those that do not:

        1. rate of abdominal CT scanning

        2. time to emergency department disposition

        3. the rate of missed/delayed diagnosis of intra-abdominal injury

        4. the costs.

               -  Crush injury to the torso

               -  Physical assault involving the abdomen

               -  Decreased level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale score &lt; 15 or below
                  age-appropriate behavior) in association with blunt torso trauma

          -  Blunt traumatic event with any of the following (regardless of the mechanism):

               -  Extremity paralysis

               -  Multiple long bone fractures (e.g., tibia and humerus fracture)

          -  History and physical examination suggestive of intra-abdominal injury following blunt
             torso trauma of any mechanism (including mechanisms of injury of less severity than
             mentioned above)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No concern for inter-abdominal injury or no planned evaluation for possible IAI

          -  Presence of an abdominal &quot;seat belt sign&quot; - continuous area of erythema/contusion
             completely across the lower abdomen secondary to a lap belt

          -  Penetrating trauma: stab or gunshot wounds

          -  Traumatic injury occurring &gt; 24 hours prior to the time of presentation to the ED

          -  Transfer of the patient to the UCDMC ED from an outside facility with abdominal CT
             scan, diagnostic peritoneal lavage, or laparotomy previously performed

          -  Patients with known disease processes resulting in intraperitoneal fluid including
             liver failure and the presence of ventriculoperitoneal shunts
