  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the present study the investigators wish to examine if reconceptualisation of pain, by
      educating chronic whiplash-associated disorders (CWAD) patients on the neurophysiology of
      pain, in combination with psychologic innoculation is able to influence maladaptive (pain)
      cognitions, pain (inhibition) and movement performance, and reduce symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Results from a previous pilot study conducted by the same investigators suggest that
      intensive pain neurophysiology education (PNE) is able to increase pain thresholds and
      improve pain behavior and pain-free movement performance in patients with CWAD. However these
      results have not been confirmed in a randomized controlled trial.

      In addition, it has been emphasized that PNE is not a standalone treatment and that future
      research should examine PNE in combination with other treatment modalities. Another treatment
      modality that challenges people's beliefs and barriers is psychological inoculation (PI).
      However, it has not yet been examined if PI could be a useful component in the rehabilitation
      of chronic pain patients.

    <description>The NDI was developed in 1991 as a modification of the Oswestry Back Pain Index and was the first instrument designed to assess self-rated disability in patients with neck pain. The NDI is scored from 0 (good function) to 50(poor function), and the percentage of disability can be obtained when the score is multiplied by two. The NDI is a valid and reliable instrument sensitive to measure changes within a population of patients with neck pain.</description>

    <description>The TSK is a 17-item questionnaire that measures the fear of (re)injury due to movement [48]. Items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale, and a total score is calculated(1-4 for each item) after inversion of the individual scores of items 4, 8, 12, and 16. The total scores for the TSK range from 17 to 68.</description>

    <time_frame>Measured prior to (baseline=day 1) and immediate following (=day 13) the treatment. Long term changes examined at 3 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>This selfreported questionnaire measures catastrophic thinking about pain and consists of 13 items describing different thoughts and feelings that individuals may experience when experiencing pain. Items are scored on a 5-point scale, and one general score can be obtained for the degree of catastrophic thoughts about pain by adding up all individual item scores. This general score can be subdivided into three subscales: Helplessness, Magnification, and Rumination. Higher scores correspond to more severe catastrophic thoughts about pain.</description>

    <description>This is a self-reported measure for assessing symptom severity in patients with WAD. The questionnaire is composed of the most reported WAD symptoms in the literature and some autonomic symptoms. Every symptom is presented by a visual analog scale (VAS) (100 mm), a method that is known for its validity and reliability.</description>

    <description>Brachial Plexus Provocation Test is a neurodynamic test during which the range of elbow extension corresponding with the moment of &quot;pain onset&quot; and &quot;submaximal pain&quot; can be measured reliably, both in laboratory and clinical conditions.

    <description>The Neck Extension Test is used to diagnose sensory disturbances in patients with whiplash and is able to discriminate between subjects with symptoms after a whiplash injury and subjects without head or neck complaints. During cervical extension the patient's willingness to perform the movement is registered and the degree of pain experienced during the test performance is measured using a VAS.</description>

    <time_frame>Measured prior to (baseline=day 1) and immediate following (=day 13) the treatment. Long term changes examined at 3 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a clinical test of the anatomical action of the deep cervical flexor muscles and evaluates neuromotor control. The features assessed are the activation and isometric endurance of the deep cervical flexors as well as their interaction with the superficial cervical flexors during the performance of five progressive stages of increasing craniocervical flexion range of motion. It is a low-load test performed in the supine position with the patient guided to each stage by feedback from a pressure sensor placed behind the neck.</description>
