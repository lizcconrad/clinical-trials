    <textblock>
      The proposed study will compare a well defined and integrated yoga practice (postures/breath
      control/meditation) to a conventional exercise program in reducing hypertension. The expected
      outcomes include data on the effects of yoga on ambulatory blood pressure, psychosocial
      stress, and the autonomic system in individuals with pre- and Stage I hypertension. The
      information gained in this study will have a positive impact by providing critical
      preliminary and feasibility data to support a larger multi-ethnic randomized clinical trial
      on the effects of yoga on individuals with hypertension.

    <description>The integrated yoga program was designed to: 1) include the three primary elements of yoga as most commonly practiced in western cultures (physical postures, breath control and meditation); and 2) be appropriate for those without any prior yoga experience and with pre- and Stage I hypertension. The yoga program was designed by Eddie Stern, Founder and Director of &quot;Ashtanga Yoga New York&quot; (AYNY) in consultation with Drs. Hagins and Rundle, and are in large part congruent with the yoga program we studied previously (see Preliminary Studies). The yoga class includes: instruction on yogic principles regarding moral precepts (yamas and niyamas); active postures requiring mild-moderate physical exertion; conscious control of the breath in synchrony with active postures; and meditation. We expect approximately 10-15 minutes of the integrated yoga program to consist of isolated practice of meditation (occurring independently of the moving postures, typically in seated or lying positions).</description>
