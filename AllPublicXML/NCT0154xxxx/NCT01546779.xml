  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients perform airway clearance incorporating various breathing
      strategies, to clear secretions from their lungs. Hand held devices may aid mucus
      expectoration, and also motivate the patient to manage by themselves. Our aims was to study
      if resistive expiration through &quot;volumetric incentive spirometer&quot; (VISex) can improve lung
      function in the short term in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients.

    <description>40 CF patients performed airway clearance using the VISex, by exhaling against chosen resistance being motivated by visual feedback of raising colored balls. The level of resistance was set to cause longest expiration/volume, until mucus was transported from the peripheral to the central airways, to be expectorated by the subsequent cough.</description>
