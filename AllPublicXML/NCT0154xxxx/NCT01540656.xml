  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During transcutaneous mechanical nerve stimulation in spinal cord injured men an increase in
      pressure was observed in the external urethral sphincter along with an increase in bladder
      capacity. In a subsequent study it was demonstrated that Transcutaneous Mechanical Nerve
      Stimulation (TMNS) in women could induce pressure increment of the external urethral
      sphincter. A pilot study have since shown that after 6 weeks of stimulation 24 out of 33
      women suffering from urinary stress incontinence were able to contract their pelvic floor
      muscles and had become free of symptoms. Another pilot study has shown promising effect on
      the overactive bladder syndrome. Furthermore pilot studies in men who are incontinent after a
      radical prostatectomy have shown promising results. A randomized investigation of TMNS
      applied in the immediate period after a radical prostatectomy to investigate effects on both
      continence and erectile function is on going.

      The present study aims to treat urinary incontinence in men who are still incontinent more
      than 1 year after a radical prostatectomy. A medical vibrator is used daily for a period of 6
      weeks and the results of the treatment is then evaluated. The participants will be randomized
      to 2 groups. Group 1 starts vibration treatment at base line and group 2 starts after 6 weeks
      when group 1 is done. The groups are compared at baseline, at 6 weeks and at 12 weeks.

      The stimulation will be performed at the frenulum of the glans penis every day for 6 weeks
      with an amplitude of 2 mm and a frequency of 100 Hz. Results will be evaluated on the basis
      of questionnaires, micturition diaries and diaper tests.

      If the investigators are able to demonstrate a significant reduction in the incontinence
      symptoms in the subjects the investigators asses that vibration can be a way of
      reestablishing normal continence in men after a radical prostatectomy.

    <time_frame>Assessment at baseline and again after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be provided diapers and they will wear them for 24 hours. The weight of all used diapers is then measured to assess how much urine is leaking.
The main outcome measure is the difference in leakage between groups 1 and 2 at 6 weeks (when group 1 has received treatment and group 2 has not).</description>

    <description>Participants will be provided diapers and they will wear them for 24 hours. The weight of all used diapers is then measured to asses how much urine is leaking.

    <description>The number of involuntary incontinence and normal micturition episodes are evaluated based on a patient diary. Here the difference in number of incontinence episodes between groups 1 and 2 are calculated at 6 weeks (when only group 1 has received treatment) and at 12 weeks (when both groups have received treatment).</description>

The scores are evaluated and differences between groups 1 and 2 are calculated at 6 weeks (when only group 1 has received treatment) and at 12 weeks (when both groups have received treatment).</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcutaneous mechanical nerve stimulation (TMNS) (FERTI CARE)</intervention_name>
    <description>A medical vibrator (FERTI CARE personal, Multicept A/S, Albertslund, Denmark) will be used. The stimulation works through a vibrating disc of hard plastic with a diameter of 3.5 cm. The stimulation point will be the frenulum of the glans penis. The stimulation will be performed with a vibration amplitude of 2 mm and a frequency of 100 Hz.
A daily stimulation sequence consisting of 10 seconds of stimulation followed by a 10 second pause repeated 10 times will be used through 6 weeks.</description>
