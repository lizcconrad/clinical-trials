    <textblock>
      Denutrition, lost of weight and anorexia are present in many oncologic patients at any time
      of the disease. Anorexia is the spontaneous loss of appetite and many changes in the
      metabolism are made in this case, leading to this syndrome called anorexia-cachexia, that
      includes changes in the tumoral response and inflammatory pathways. The guaraná (Paullinia
      cupana) is originally from Brazil and Venezuela and has been used culturally for headaches,
      muscle pains, depression and others. As it has shown a good response and tolerability for
      fatigue, the investigators decide to try guaraná for anorexia. Patients will receive guaraná
      as capsules of 50 mg twice daily, for 4 weeks, and will be weighted and respond questionaries
      about quality of life.

      Patients 18 years and older, diagnosed with any cancer, that is losing weight and have
      anorexia will be selected. They must have normal levels of creatinine, thyroid evaluation and
      hepatic function. If they are taking corticosteroid, they must keep losing weight and refer
      anorexia, as well as if they are on treatment with chemotherapy.

      Patients will receive 50mg of the guaraná twice daily for 4 weeks. Every week will be an
      evaluation of the weight, level of appetite and answer 2 questionaries of quality of life and
      level of symptoms (FACT-G and MDASI).

      This is a fase II study, open-label, no randomized, with two steps following ¨two stages of
      Simon¨ model. First step 18 patients will be included and if there are 3 good responses
      second step will follow, including 17 more patients. Response will be considered if there is
      at least 5% of gain in the weight.
