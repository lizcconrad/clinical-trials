  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today there is evidence for that neck specific exercises reduce neck pain problems in
      patients with mechanical neck pain. However, there is a lack of consensus on how to optimize
      neck exercises and dosages in neck rehabilitation. More knowledge is needed to determine
      which and how muscles are activated in exercises thought to be neck-specific. There is
      neither enough knowledge of differences in neck muscle activation between patients with long
      standing neck problems after a whiplash trauma and healthy controls nor if the neck muscle
      function improved with specific neck exercises. One approach would be a real time study of
      deformation and deformation rate in different layers of neck muscles in patients with
      residual long-term neck pain and disability after a whiplash trauma. The purpose of the
      present study was to investigate deformation and deformation rate in different layers of
      dorsal and ventral neck muscles (including upper and middle part of trapezius muscle) during
      rest and during different exercises; arm flexion until 120 degrees, repeated arm flexion
      until 90 degrees, low loaded neck extension, low loaded neck muscle endurance test, shoulder
      elevation. Forty patients with long standing (more than 6 months but less than 3
      years)patients and 40 controls matched for age and gender will be included for comparisons
      between patients and healthy in neck muscle activation. The investigators also include 60
      patients with whiplash trauma, of those 30 patients will be randomized to A. neck specific
      exercises in a 3 months period and B. will 30 be on a waiting list for 3 months. Measurements
      are performed at baseline and at 3 months follow-up. Those patients who fulfilled the 3
      months period of neck specific exercises will also be asked for a 6 months follow-up.
