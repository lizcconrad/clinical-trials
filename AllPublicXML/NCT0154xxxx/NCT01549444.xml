  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if mothers with high blood pressure (Hypertension)
      and/or diabetes have babies with high levels of different substances (that help to regulate
      blood pressure, called Renin and Aldosterone) in their blood. The investigators are also
      trying to determine if these babies have higher blood pressure than those babies born to
      mothers without high blood pressure or diabetes, during the first year of life.

      The investigators will measure your baby's blood pressure once a day for the first 4 days, at
      1 week of age, and then once per week until your baby is discharged. The investigators will
      also measure the blood pressure after discharge at 4 and 10 months of age, either on the day
      of your baby's follow-up appointment in the Neonatal Follow-up Clinic or at a visit to our
      Outpatient Nephrology Clinic, both at CHEO.

      We will compare two groups of babies born between 26+0 and 34+0 weeks gestation.Group 1 is
      the babies born to mothers with diabetes and/or high blood pressure, and babies that are
      small for dates. Group 2 are babies that are 26 to 34 weeks of age, that are born to mothers
      without these problems.

      In the study we will measure the baby's blood pressure once a day for the first 4 days, at 1
      week of age, and then once per week until the baby is discharged. We will also measure the
      blood pressure after discharge at 4 and 10 months of age, either on the day of your baby's
      follow-up appointment in the Neonatal Follow-up Clinic or at a visit to our Outpatient
      Nephrology Clinic, both at CHEO.

      As blood tests will be done. A small amount of extra blood, 0.75ml - 1.5 ml (about 1/6 -1/3
      of a teaspoon, or approximately 1 ml) will be collected for measurement of the blood
      substances we are studying will be collected when the baby has their regular non-study blood
      work.

      This will be done within six hours of birth and then again at 2-3 weeks of life.
