  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation (DC) of Study Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>SAEs were collected from signing of informed consent through Month 6 (or end of treatment) plus 14 days. AEs were collected from administration of VIMOVO through Month 6 (or end of treatment) plus 14 days.</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a preexisting medical condition, whether or not considered causally related to treatment. An SAE is defined as an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run-in, treatment, washout, follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: results in death; is immediately life-threatening; requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; is a congenital abnormality or birth defect; is an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. AEs were considered treatment-emergent if they occurred after the first dose of study drug. Events were categorized as mild, moderate, and severe; participants were represented only with the maximum reported intensity.</description>

    <description>Three VIMOVO strengths will be used in this study: 250 mg naproxen/20 mg esomeprazole magnesium (VIMOVO 250/20), 375 mg naproxen/20 mg esomeprazole magnesium (VIMOVO 375/20), and 500 mg naproxen/20 mg esomeprazole magnesium (VIMOVO 500/20). The VIMOVO strength allocated to each participant will be determined by the participant's weight at baseline and based on investigator's discretion.
The target dose of the naproxen component will be within the range of 10-20 mg/kg/day divided twice daily (BID) with a maximum daily dose of 1000 mg.</description>

          -  In systemic JIA patients, presence of systemic features (ie, fever, rheumatoid rash,
             serositis, lymphadenopathy, macrophage activation syndrome) within 6 months prior to
             start of study drug.

          -  Currently taking (ie, within 4 weeks prior to start of drug) naproxen &gt; 20 mg/kg/day
             or &gt; 1000 mg total daily dose.

          -  Hemoglobin ≤ 8.5 g/dL.

             medical conditions indicated by medical/surgical history, physical, or laboratory
             examination that might put the patient at greater risk during the study.

        <description>An AE is defined as the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a preexisting medical condition, whether or not considered causally related to treatment. An SAE is defined as an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run-in, treatment, washout, follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: results in death; is immediately life-threatening; requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; is a congenital abnormality or birth defect; is an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. AEs were considered treatment-emergent if they occurred after the first dose of study drug. Events were categorized as mild, moderate, and severe; participants were represented only with the maximum reported intensity.</description>
        <time_frame>SAEs were collected from signing of informed consent through Month 6 (or end of treatment) plus 14 days. AEs were collected from administration of VIMOVO through Month 6 (or end of treatment) plus 14 days.</time_frame>
