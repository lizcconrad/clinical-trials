      I: Conduct Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial of Dialectical Behavior Therapy for children
      (DBT-C) in residential as compared with Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) (60 children in DBT-C and 60
      children in the comparison condition).

      Specific Aim 1: Examine feasibility of DBT-C by evaluating response rate in treatment
      attendance, treatment satisfaction, and any differences in these rates by groups.

      Hypothesis 1: DBT-C will be equivalent to TAU in attendance rate and will have significantly
      greater treatment satisfaction rating by subjects, as well as by therapists and milieu staff.

      Specific Aim 2: Examine efficacy of DBT-C as compared to TAU in reducing internalizing and
      externalizing symptoms.

      Hypothesis 2: Children in DBT-C condition as compared to TAU will have significantly fewer
      internalizing and externalizing symptoms.

      Specific Aim 3: Examine efficacy of DBT-C in improving adaptive coping, emotion regulation,
      risk taking, and social skills, and reducing depression.

      Hypothesis 3: Children in DBT-C Training condition as compared to TAU will have significantly
      greater improvement in adaptive coping skills, emotion regulation, risk taking and
      impulsivity and social skills, and reducing depressive symptoms.

      Specific Aim 4: Examine efficacy of DBT-C in reducing the frequency of critical incidents.

      Hypothesis 4: Children in DBT-C condition as compared to TAU will have significantly fewer
      critical incidents, including psychiatric hospitalization, emergency room visits, total
      number of days inpatient, suicidal ideations and attempts, self-harm behaviors, sexual acting
      out, running away, stealing, police involvement, etc.

      II: Finalize therapist training manuals and educational materials to guide selection,
      training, and supervision of treatment providers.
