  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of paliperidone extended-release
      (ER; designed to slowly release a drug in the body over an extended period of time) tablets
      in participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional
      instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions [a false belief held in the face
      of strong differing evidence, especially as a symptom of psychiatric disorder] and
      hallucinations [imagining things], and withdrawal into the self) who were not satisfied with
      other prior antipsychotics (agents that control agitated psychotic behavior, alleviate acute
      psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a quieting effect; olanzapine,
      quetiapine and risperidone) they had been taking. The safety and tolerability of paliperidone
      ER tablets will also be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label (all people know the identity of the intervention), prospective (study
      following participants forward in time), non-randomized (the study drug is not assigned by
      chance, participants may choose which group they want to be in, or they may be assigned to
      the groups by the researchers), single-arm (getting one dose of medicine) and multi-center
      (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study
      designed to determine the efficacy, tolerability and safety of flexible dosage of
      paliperidone ER tablets in treatment of participants with schizophrenia not satisfied with
      other prior antipsychotics. The duration of the study will be 12 weeks. All participants will
      be given paliperidone ER 3 milligram (mg) or 6 mg or 9 mg or 12 mg oral (by mouth) tablets
      depending on Investigator's discretion once daily for 12 weeks; initial dose for paliperidone
      ER will be 6 mg/day. The primary objective will be to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with
      paliperidone ER using Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) total scores. Participants
      safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS is a medical scale that assesses various symptoms of schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions [a false belief held in the face of strong differing evidence, especially as a symptom of psychiatric disorder] and hallucinations [imagining things], and withdrawal into the self). The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The total score is the sum of all 30 PANSS items, with a range of 30 (absent) to 210 (extreme ill).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Subscale Scores at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS is a medical scale that assesses various symptoms of schizophrenia. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The total score is the sum of all 30 PANSS items, with a range of 30 (absent) to 210 (extreme ill). Positive syndrome subscale ranges from 7 to 49, higher change scores indicate worsening. Negative syndrome subscale ranges from 7 to 49, higher change scores indicate worsening. General Psychopathology subscale ranges from 16 to112, higher change scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Marder Subscale Scores at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale to assess the neuropsychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). Positive symptoms subscale consists of 8 items with total score range of 8-56; negative symptoms subscale and disorganized thoughts subscale, each consists of 7 items with total score range of 7-49, uncontrolled hostility/excitement subscale and anxiety/depression subscale, each consists of 4 items with total score range of 4-28. Higher change score indicates greater severity.</description>

    <description>PANSS is a medical scale that assesses various symptoms of schizophrenia. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The total score is the sum of all 30 PANSS items, with a range of 30 (absent) to 210 (extreme ill). Percentage of participants with at least 20 percent improvement of PANSS total score was measured.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7 point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher change scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PSP assesses the degree of a participant's dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior. The score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate the degree of difficulty (1, absent to 6, very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Based on the four domains there will be one total score. Participants with a score of 71 to 100 have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; =&lt;30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision.</description>

    <description>The self-administered sleep VAS scale (0-100 milimeter [mm]) rates quality of sleep (QoS) and daytime drowsiness (DD). Participants indicate mark on the scale to represent how well they have slept in the previous 7 days, score ranges from 0 mm (very badly) to 100 mm (very well); and how often they have felt drowsy within the previous 7 days, from 0 mm (not at all) to 100 mm (all the time).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>PANSS is a medical scale that assesses various symptoms of schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions [a false belief held in the face of strong differing evidence, especially as a symptom of psychiatric disorder] and hallucinations [imagining things], and withdrawal into the self).

          <description>PANSS is a medical scale that assesses various symptoms of schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions [a false belief held in the face of strong differing evidence, especially as a symptom of psychiatric disorder] and hallucinations [imagining things], and withdrawal into the self). The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology).

          <description>PANSS is a medical scale that assesses various symptoms of schizophrenia. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The total score is the sum of all 30 PANSS items, with a range of 30 (absent) to 210 (extreme ill). Percentage of participants with at least 20 percent improvement of PANSS total score was measured.</description>
