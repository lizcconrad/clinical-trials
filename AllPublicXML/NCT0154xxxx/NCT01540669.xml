      The aim of the study is to test the effect of polydextrose on whole gut transit time and
      gastrointestinal symptoms in a dose-responsive manner.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the promising, yet largely unsubstantiated, benefits of fiber supplementation,
      particularly polydextrose, on symptoms of functional constipation, the objective of this
      clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 2-week supplementation of a
      proprietary polydextrose fiber product, in a dose-ranging fashion, on whole gut transit time
      and gastrointestinal symptoms in adults with functional constipation.
