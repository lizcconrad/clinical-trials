    <textblock>
      Study wants to compare central corneal thickness (CCT) obtained through 3 different
      no-contact instruments and to compare them with contact ultrasound pachymetry, actually the
      gold standard technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Corneal pachymetry is the measurement of corneal thickness, usually expressed in microns (μ).

      Pachymetry is systematically used for the monitoring of corneal oedema, for the management
      and assessment of the progression risk of the ocular hypertension, for the diagnosis, the
      management and follow-up of keratoconus, as well as it is important in the pre and
      postoperative management of corneal surgical procedures. CCT is a factor well known to
      influence tonometry. Its assessment is fundamental in glaucoma practice to allow a correct
      intraocular pressure (IOP) evaluation.

      The purpose of this study is to compare CCT measurements using four different instruments:
      Scheimpflug camera tomography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT),
      anterior chamber SD-OCT and ultrasound pachymetry.
