  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central objective of this study will be to evaluate a standardized, evidence-based
      regimen versus a conventional regimen for uterotonic drug dosing for elective cesarean
      delivery

      The investigators primary hypothesis is that the proposed uterotonic drug regimen, when
      compared to conventional dosing regimen, during elective cesarean delivery will:

      1. Reduce the overall amount of oxytocin and other uterotonic agents used to obtain
      satisfactory uterine tone.

      Secondary outcomes to be evaluated will be:

        1. Reduce the side effects associated with uterotonic drug use

        2. Reduce the time to establishment and maintenance of adequate uterine tone
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current guidelines for the administration of oxytocin during cesarean delivery are
      diverse, empiric, and vague. A stepwise, standardized, checklist driven algorithm for the use
      of oxytocin and other uterotonic agents during cesarean delivery is needed to guide
      practitioners in a clear and concise manner. This algorithm should encompass laboring and
      non-laboring women, as well as prophylactic and therapeutic uses of oxytocin and other
      uterotonic agents.

      More specifically, the investigators believe that the following points should be incorporated
      into a protocol: 1) oxytocin should be used in initial doses of less than 5 IU; 2) oxytocin
      should not be administered as a rapid IV bolus; 3) an initial rapid infusion of oxytocin
      should be followed by a maintenance infusion; 4) higher initial and infusion doses of
      oxytocin offer no clinical benefit and should be avoided; and 5) if it appears that oxytocin
      is not producing effective uterine contractions, other uterotonic drugs acting via different
      pathways should be considered in a standardized way.

    <description>&quot;Standard Care Group&quot; (reflects current clinical regimen at BWH) will receive a 500 mL bag of oxytocin (30 IU/500 mL) to be connected to the IV, and controlled per obstetrician request. The obstetrician and anesthesiologist will be asked to consider this infusion &quot;oxytocin&quot;. If inadequate uterine tone exists in which the obstetrician desires alternative uterotonic agents, these will be provided on their request (e.g. methylergonovine maleate (methergine) 0.2 mg IM (intramuscular) or carboprost tromethamine (hemabate) 0.25 mg IM. The time of the requests will be recorded.
If uterine tone remains inadequate at 15 min, misoprostol 600 mcg will be given buccally.</description>
