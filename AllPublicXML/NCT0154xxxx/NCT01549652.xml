  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid medications are commonly used for pain relief. When given over time, physical
      dependence can occur. This results in unpleasant side effects--such as agitation and
      nausea--if opioid medications are suddenly stopped. This study aims to test the use of the
      drug ondansetron to reduce the symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal and to prevent the
      progression of opioid physical dependence, thereby allowing future investigators to better
      test the role of physical dependence in the development of addiction and also possibly
      improving acceptance of abstinence-based programs for addiction.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in baseline of Objective Opioid Withdrawal Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in baseline OOWS scores will be measured on 3 study days, over the span of 1.5 months. The baseline OOWs score is measured at T=-10 min., after Ondasetron/Placebo infusion at T=15 min., and after the Naloxone infusion at T=35 and T=45 min.</time_frame>
    <description>Originally developed by Handelsman, the OOWS score is a well-characterized measure of opioid withdrawl in humans. The OOWS is a 13-item instrument documenting physically observable signs of withdrawal, which are rated as present (1) or absent (0) during the observation period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Baseline of Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in baseline SOWS scores will be measured on 3 study days, over the span of 1.5 months. The baseline SOWs score is measured at T=-10 min., after Ondasetron/Placebo infusion at T=15 min., and after the Naloxone infusion at T=35 and T=45 min.</time_frame>
    <description>The SOWS score is composed of 16 subjective symptoms rated on a scale of 0 to 4 (0=not at all, 4=extremely) based on what subjects were experiencing at the time of testing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Beck Depression Inventory is measured once at the start of each study visit, over the span of 1.5 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory yields a single score between 0 and 63; higher scores indicate more severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Pain inventory is measured once at the start of each study visit, over the span of 1.5 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will complete daily Brief Pain Inventories (Short Form), a 9-item multi-dimensional pain and functionality survey (Appendix).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline of Physical Vital Signs</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in baseline of physical vital signs is measured over the span of 1.5 months on 3 study days. Baseline physical vital signs are measured at T=-10, after Ondasetron/Placebo infusion at T=15, and after the Naloxone infusion at T=35 and T=45.</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate, respiratory rate, and pupil diameter increases after precipitated OW will be measured. Heart rate will be monitored by EKG, and respiratory rate will be counted by direct observation over a period of thirty seconds. Pupil diameter will be measured using a research caliber digital automated pupillometer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum Factors</measure>
    <time_frame>Serum factors are measured at the end of every study visit, over the span of 1.5 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Serum cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels will also be tested as measures of withdrawal, as these have been shown to increase in the setting of opioid withdrawal and have even preceded physical signs of withdrawal according to a single case report. Blood without additives will be collected in a plain tube (5 mL) and serum (2 mL) will be sent to Stanford University laboratories for serum immunoassay of cortisol levels. Additional blood will be collected into a lavender top (EDTA) tube and sent to Stanford University laboratories for adrenocorticotropic hormone testing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in baseline of pain sensitivity are measured over the span of 1.5 months on 3 study days. Baseline pain sensitivity is measured at T=-10, after the Ondasetron/Placebo infusion at T=15, and after the Naloxone infusion at T=35 and T=45</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure cold pressor pain as another measure of physical dependency that may change with ondansetron treatment.</description>

    <description>Prevention of Physical Dependence: After 1 month of oral morphine therapy, patients will go to the Stanford human opioid physiology lab for opioid withdrawal testing for Visit #1. Patients will be randomized in a double-blind fashion to treatment crossover assignments (placebo vs. 32 mg ondansetron) that will be conducted on 2 separate visits at least 1 week apart. Patients will continue to take oral morphine therapy until both study visits are complete.
Treatment of Opioid Withdrawal: Patients will be randomized into 2 groups: control arm (placebo) or prevention arm (8 mg ondansetron). Patients will go to the Stanford human opioid physiology lab for opioid withdrawal testing for Visit #1. After Visit #1, patients will undergo 1 month of oral morphine therapy. Patients will be instructed to take a treatment pill (placebo vs. ondansetron) with each dose of morphine. Then, patients will return to the Stanford human opioid physiology lab for Visit #2, which will be identical to Visit #1.</description>
