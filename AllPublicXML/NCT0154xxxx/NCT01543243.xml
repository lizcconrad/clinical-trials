      This study aims to examine

        1. the feasibility

        2. immediately

        3. long term effects on postural control and strength of mechanical SR-WBV intervention in
           a frail elderly population.

    <textblock>
      This study is based on the guideline of falls management exercise programs (FaME) designed
      exercise from Skelton and Dinan.

      The FAME program is structured so that four biocybernetic pillars are embedded in the three
      successive stages of training.

      The biocybernetic pillars:

        1. improving the balance

        2. improvement in functional capacity

        3. improvement in bone density and muscle mass Overthrowing 4) improving the security
           (reducing anxiety).

      The training phase should reach the following goals:

        1. Skilling up: with the aim of improving improve neuromuscular control, postural control
           and strengthening of large muscle groups of the lower extremity.

        2. Training Gain: with the aim to improve functional abilities.

        3. Maintaining the Gains: with the goal of muscle mass and bone density and introduce them
           to build complex multi-sensory exercises.

      We started the FaME program with assistance from the pilot study, &quot;Effects of stochastic
      resonance therapy on postural control in the elderly population&quot; (KEK Bern: No.228/09, Trial
      Registry: NCT01045746). It was found that a whole-body vibration with stochastic resonance
      (SR-WBV) enables that strength, coordination, and balance training while standing, in the
      exercise training gain phase is possible.

      For this reason, this study will examine the feasibility and the immediately and long term
      effects of SR-WBV with 6 Hz, Noise 4 on postural control and strength in frail elderly.
