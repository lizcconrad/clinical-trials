  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of local analgesia with
      ropivacaine versus placebo on postoperative pain during the first 24 hours following
      bilateral surgery of all four third molars under general anesthesia.

    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives of this study are to compare regional anesthesia by ropivacaine
      versus placebo for the bilateral resection of all four third molars under general anesthesia,
      in terms of:

      A. intraoperative use of propofol and remifentanil B. postoperative pain (EVN) at different
      time points C. in-hospital analgesic consumption D. time to first rescue analgesic request E.
      time spent in the post interventional treatment room F. length of hospital stay G. side
      effects H. analgesic consumption at home I. analgesic consumption (total) J. patient
      satisfaction K. Chronic pain after surgery
