    <textblock>
      This single site study will be conducted at the UT Southwestern Simmons Cancer Center. This
      study is designed to measure drug concentrations in the blood of 18 female breast cancer
      patients who require doxorubicin (30 minute infusion) and cyclophosphamide (30 minute
      infusion) as part of standard medical care. Up to a total of 40 adult female participants
      will be consented for the study at the cancer center. Eighteen of these participants are
      needed to complete the study. The others will likely be screen failures. The participants
      will have no more than 100 ml of blood drawn via a peripheral intravenous catheter just prior
      to the doxorubicin infusion, and then at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12-24, and 24-72 h after
      the beginning of the doxorubicin infusion. The 5 hour blood draw is optional. The intravenous
      catheter will be removed when the participant is discharged from the cancer center on day 1.
      The participant will be asked to return to the cancer center at 12-24 and 24-72 hours to have
      the final 2 blood draws conducted. The participants must be treated with Doxorubicin and
      Cyclophosphamide in order to participate in this pharmacokinetic analysis study.

  <detailed_description>

      The study will require a total of 11 participant contacts over 3 days (1 day outpatient
      clinic visit for doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide infusions and blood draws, 2 follow up
      outpatient clinic visits for blood draws) with no more than 100 mL of blood being drawn. All
      blood draws will be collected for the purpose of research.

      Screening and Informed Consent Procedures

        1. The participant's height, weight, medical history, comorbid conditions, and current
           medications will be obtained from the electronic medical record (EMR).

           Update 1 : January 12, 2012

        2. Study personnel will provide the participant with additional information about the study
           and provide the participant with the opportunity to ask any questions. Each participant
           will then be asked if she is willing to provide informed consent.

        3. Information from the routine physical examination including vital signs
           (temperature,respiratory rate, blood pressure, heart rate) will be collected from the
           medical chart.

      Procedures and Evaluation during the Research

        1. Each participant will then have no more than10ml of blood drawn 8 times, at t=0h
           (predose),at the end of the doxorubicin infusion, at the end cyclophosphamide infusion,
           and 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12-24, and 24-72 h following the beginning of doxorubicin infusion.
           All blood draws will be performed using the peripheral intravenous catheter being used
           for standard medical care. Labels on blood samples will not contain participant name,
           but a randomly generated participant identification number.

        2. All blood samples will placed on ice and immediately transported to Dr. Richard Leff's
           laboratory for sample preparation.9 Samples will be spun in a refrigerated centrifuge
           and then placed in a -80oC freezer. As explained below, Dr. Leff or his laboratory will
           not have access to any participant identifiers.

        3. The participant is discharged from the cancer center (for research purposes) after the 4
           hour blood draw, unless the participant is willing to stay for the 5 hour blood draw.

        4. The participant will return to the cancer center at 12-24 and 24-72 hours for blood
           draws.

        5. The participant is discharged from the study after the 24-72h blood draw. Follow-up:
           Participants will be asked to return to the cancer center for 12-24 and 24-72 hour blood
           draws.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females,

          -  age 18 years of age or older, of all racial and ethnic origins that are scheduled to
             receive the first cycle of a single intravenous dose of doxorubicin (30 minute
             infusion) and cyclophosphamide (30 minute infusion) as part of standard medical care
             for breast cancer.

          -  English and/or Spanish speaking participants are eligible to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or nursing or unwilling to use a reliable contraception method during the
             study. The effects of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide on pregnancy are unknown. In
             addition, the metabolic changes that accompany pregnancy may alter the
             concentration-time profile of doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide, so that the pregnancy
             and post-partum state would be a confounding variable.

          -  Participants unwilling to comply with study procedures.

          -  CrCl &lt; 10 ml/min

          -  Participants requiring peritoneal or hemodialysis

          -  Serum bilirubin &gt; 1.19 mg/dL

               -  Alter doxorubicin concentrations: carbamazepine, cyclosporine, fosphenytoin,
                  paclitaxel, phenytoin, sorafenib, valspodar, verapamil

               -  Alter cyclophosphamide concentrations: cyclosporine, nevirapine, ondansetron

               -  All other drugs will be reviewed during screening of the patient
