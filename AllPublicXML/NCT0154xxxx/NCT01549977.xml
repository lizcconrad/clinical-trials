    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of febuxostat, once daily (QD), compared
      to placebo as an add on to stable anti-anginal therapy, on the total exercise time of
      participants with Chronic Stable Angina.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study. This study
      is comprised of a single-blind placebo run-in qualifying phase lasting approximately 3 weeks
      and a double-blind treatment phase lasting 12 weeks. A safety follow-up visit is scheduled
      for 2 weeks after last dose of study drug.

      All participants will undergo 3 visits during a 3 week, run-in phase (Days -21 to Day 1).
      During the run-in phase, all participants will receive single-blind placebo. Two exercise
      treadmill tests (ETTs) will be conducted using the modified Bruce Protocol at Day -14 and at
      Day -7. The results from the Day -7 ETT will be considered as Baseline.

      A total of approximately 100 participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either febuxostat
      80 mg once daily (QD) or placebo QD in a double-blind treatment for 12 weeks, and 5 more
      visits.

      All participants will complete the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) and Euroqol 5 dimension
      (EQ-5D) quality-of-life measurements at Day 1, Week 6 and Week 12/Early Termination (ET)
      Visit. The investigator will also rate the overall severity of the participant's angina at
      each visit based on the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Grading of Angina (CCSGA).

      This 12-week phase 2 proof-of-concept study was designed to assess the effect of febuxostat
      as an add-on to stable anti-anginal therapy on the total exercise time of participants with
      chronic stable angina and a serum urate ≥5 mg/dL. At this time, Takeda has decided to
      terminate the study for business reasons.
