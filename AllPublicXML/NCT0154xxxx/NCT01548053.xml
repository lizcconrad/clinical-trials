  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related forms of dementia currently affect over 400,000
      individuals in Canada and the numbers of community dwelling older adults with AD is rapidly
      growing. AD is associated with over $15 billion annually in care costs. Most individuals with
      AD are under the care of primary care providers (PCPs) including family physicians and
      primary care nurses. The evaluation and management of AD is challenging for PCPs and the
      quality of care provided to older adults with AD by PCP could be improved which would
      optimize outcomes for this vulnerable population. Provision of quality care to older adults
      with AD involves implementation of best practices as outlined in guidelines such as the
      Canadian Consensus Conference Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia.
      Utilizing a group of dementia researchers, PCPs, other knowledge users, and individuals
      affected by AD, this project will develop practical, clinically relevant resources for
      primary care physicians and nurses to aid in the evaluation of older adults with AD. A
      knowledge tool, the Primary Care - Dementia Assessment and Treatment Algorithm (DATA Tool)
      will be introduced into several primary care settings in Ontario using educational sessions
      with PCP with additional support from internet resource and a dementia care manager. The
      quality of dementia care provided to older adults newly diagnosed with AD will be assessed in
      the three years preceding the intervention compared to the year following the implementation.
      This project will also describe the process of knowledge exchange with PCPs, including
      potential barriers and facilitators of knowledge uptake and examine if the care provided
      during the intervention was patient-centred through interviews with patients and caregivers.

      Research Objectives:

        1. Develop knowledge tools to facilitate assessment and treatment of AD by PCPs based on
           best evidence;

        2. Transfer these knowledge tools into a variety of primary care settings in Ontario; and,

        3. Evaluate the effects of this intervention on dementia quality of care, PCP application
           of knowledge, and the patient-centeredness of care.

    <description>The evaluation of quality indicators (QI) using chart audit data will be undertaken following initial assessment of dementia will be used to assess the quality of care provided to individuals with dementia. The change in number of QI satisfied following the intervention will be compared to a historical group of individuals assessed for dementia by each PCP in the 3 years preceding the intervention.</description>

    <description>The implementation plan consists of educational sessions and a dementia care manager (DCM). The educational sessions consist of two components: a 1.5 hour group-based DATA tool implementation workshop with primary care providers (PCPs); and, a 1 hour follow-up session at study mid-point. The DCM will facilitate application of the DATA tool and provide direct support to PCPs during the study.</description>
