      The Purpose of this study is to compare the effects of 2 types of dietary fiber, psyllium and
      microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), on glycemic measures in subjects with impaired fasting

      This study will be conducted at a single study center. Approximately 40 subjects with
      pre-type 2 diabetes will be enrolled and randomized in this study.

      This 22-week study consists of 3 periods: an 8-week treatment period (Visits 2-4), a 6-week
      washout period, and an 8-week treatment period (Visits 5-7).
