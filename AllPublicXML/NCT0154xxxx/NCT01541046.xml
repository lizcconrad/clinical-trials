  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infantile colic is a common medical condition which remains a frustrating problem for parents
      and health care providers with no clear treatment guidelines. To fill the void in existing
      literature, we present a protocol to examine whether probiotics are effective in decreasing
      infantile colic symptoms when compared to placebo treatment.

      We hypothesize that oral administration of the probiotic L. reuteri DSM 17938 will reduce
      symptoms of infantile colic in breastfed infants in comparison to placebo.

      An interim analysis will be conducted after 50 infants randomized to monitor both safety and
      efficacy.

      Infantile colic is one of the most commonly reported medical problems within the first three
      months of life causing appreciable distress for both parents and pediatricians. The reported
      incidence of infantile colic ranges from 3% to 28% in prospective studies and up to 40% in
      retrospective surveys.

      The pathogenesis of infantile colic remains elusive despite decades of research. It appears
      that multiple independent origins might be involved: amongst them infant's difficult
      temperament, inadequate mother-infant communication or maternal anxiety, transient lactase
      deficiency, exposure to cow's milk, abnormal gastrointestinal function, maternal smoking
      during pregnancy or after delivery. Consequently, various treatment approaches have been
      tried to alleviate this condition.

      Recent studies have suggested that changes of intestinal microflora of a newborn may play an
      important role in pathogenesis of infantile colic. Therefore, dietary supplementation with
      probiotics has been proposed for the improvement of this condition.
