  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint, crossover, single dose study to compare
      the pharmacodynamics of Torasemide-PR 10 mg, Torasemide-IR10 mg and furosemide-IR 40 mg. 30
      patients of both sexes with CHF with a maximum imbalance of 60:40% in either direction will
      be included in the study. Patients with compensated heart failure, grade II or III as defined
      by the European Society of Cardiology, with a duration of ≥ 3 months at the time of inclusion
      documented in the patient's record or patients who previously required diuretic therapy.

      Principal variable will be the efficiency of sodium excretion that will be assessed as the
      ratio between the average drug-induced natriuresis and the average drug recovered in urine
      over 24 hours.

      The difference between the efficiency of 24 hour sodium excretion following administration of
      torasemide PR and furosemide will be formally tested by means of a Students t-test for paired
      samples. The test will be two-sided at 5% significance level. Efficiency changes over time
      will also be assessed, however will not be subject to formal statistical testing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able to understand the nature of the study.

             (CEIC).

          3. Male and female, ≥ 18 years at the time of the informed consent signature.

             therapy.
