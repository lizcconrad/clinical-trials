    <textblock>
      This new model to manage patient expectations was developed based on our international study
      conducted in four countries. The model is designed to address the main issues that lie at the
      core of initiatives to manage patient expectations and improve patient satisfaction. It is a
      structured interventional set of activities, which gives the clinician an opportunity to meet
      patient expectations and needs and thereby, improve patient satisfaction.

      The interventional model comprise teachable-learnable communicative steps occurring between
      the clinician and the patient which are: Gather information on the patient's expectations and
      perception of the hospitalization, Respond, Provide relevant information and Document the
      intervention.

      The intervention includes all frontline care givers; however, most of the activities will be
      done by the nursing staff. The set of activities will be executed by the nurses at three
      separate periods of time during the patient's hospitalization: time of admission,
      intermediate time and at time of discharge.

      The study is based on the hypothesis that a structured interventional model will
      significantly improve patient satisfaction during hospitalization.

    <time_frame>A questionnaire will be handed directly to the included patients after discharge has been ordered by a physician. The time frame for outcome measuring is anticipated to be within an average of 1-6 hours before the patient leaves the department.</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Danish National Patient Satisfaction Survey Instrument(20 questions)supplemented with 17 validated questions related to patient expectations, satisfaction and demographic data.
The primary question is:
In general, to what extent did your entire experience during the hospitalization meet your expectations? Using any number from 0 to 10, where 0 represents that your expectations were completely unmet and 10 represents that your expectations were completely met - what number would you use to rate this hospital stay?</description>
