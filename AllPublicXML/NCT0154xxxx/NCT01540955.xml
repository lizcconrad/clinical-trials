  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are over 2 million breast cancer survivors in the US today. Along with extended
      survival, many women experience short and long-term after effects of treatment, which may
      decrease their quality of life and contribute to other health problems. Cognitive
      complaints---difficulties with memory, concentration, and planningâ€”are commonly reported
      after adjuvant treatments for breast cancer. This study is designed to test the efficacy of a
      5 week group-based cognitive rehabilitation intervention on improving cognitive complaints
      and test performance, in comparison to women who will receive the same intervention at a
      later time (wait-list control). Women will also have an EEG test performed before and after
      the intervention program to see if improvements in cognitive complaints and performance can
      be documented by examining the EEG.

    <textblock>
      Previous pilot work (non-randomized, pre-post design) has shown that this intervention was
      effective in improving post-intervention cognitive complaints and neuropsychological (NP)
      test performance. Because practice effects may influence NP performance, it is important to
      compare the intervention participants to women who are not exposed to the intervention. Thus,
      this randomized controlled trial will compare the active intervention to a control group of
      patients who will receive the intervention at a delayed time point. The primary outcomes are
      improvements in cognitive complaints and NP test performance 2 months after completion of the
      intervention program. Quantitative EEG (QEEG) measurements will be used as a secondary
      exploratory endpoint to see if this may be an effective biomarker of cognitive performance.
