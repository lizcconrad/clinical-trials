  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Poor wound healing and the development of surgical site infection (SSI) continue
      to occur and remain a significant cause of disability among operated patients. In spite of
      the substantial advances in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis and
      prevention it remains one of the most common complications in conventional abdominal surgery
      with an incidence in the literature between 4% and 17%. As it is known that surgical sutures
      potentiate the development of wound infection the search for an ideal suture material,
      suitable for all purposes has been pursued by surgeons for decades.

      Hypothesis: In line with in-vitro results the investigators hypothesize that the use of
      antibacterial skin sutures with triclosan poliglecaprone 25 reduces the rate of SSI after
      open abdominal surgery Methods: To prevent microbial colonization of suture material in
      operative wounds and therefore to prevent SSI, triclosan-coated poliglecaprone 25 suture
      materials with antibacterial activity will be tested against un-coated suture material for
      skin closure after open abdominal surgery of 200 patients. The study is planed as a single
      center, randomized controlled trial. After ethical approval the patients will be
      consecutively enrolled from 2011 to 2012 in the Department of Visceral Surgery, University
      Hospital Basel, Switzerland. The patients will be followed for 30 days (day 3,7 and 30) to
      detect and document wound complications. Wound complications will be classified according to
      Center for Disease Control and Prevention Standard guidelines. Data will be collected and the
      rate of SSI will be analysed in both groups.

      Expected value of the proposed project: If the investigators can confirm the proposed
      hypothesis in our study this could be a promising and feasible approach to lower SSI after
      open abdominal surgery and might be also used in other surgical fields. By lowering the rate
      of SSI the investigators might offer a new and cost saving procedure to the surgical
      community.
