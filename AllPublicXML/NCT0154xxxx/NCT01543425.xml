  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is often associated with a chronic stress and HHSG axis plays a pivotal role in
      maintaining homeostasis. The literature reports that pain in patients treated with opioids,
      significant changes are taking place in this axis with a collapse in hormone concentrations
      that are correlated with the decline on tests of quality of life and psychological testing.
      The investigators hypothesis is that this &quot;endocrinopathy&quot; could also be present in patients
      treated for neuropathic pain with other drug classes as opiates (antidepressants,
      antiepileptics), and may explain, at least in part, the impairement of the quality of life of
      these patients.
