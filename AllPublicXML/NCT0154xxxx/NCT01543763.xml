      This is a open-label non-randomized, dose escalation and expansion Phase Ia/b study to
      determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pazopanib in
      combination with PCI-24781 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Study rationale/purpose

      Pazopanib is a potent, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor44 of VEGFR-1, -2, -3, PDGFR-α
      and -β and c-kit approved for metastatic renal cell carcinoma based on phase III data showing
      a significant prolongation of PFS (5 mos in pretreated patients and 8.3 mos in
      treatment-naïve patients). In addition recent data was presented this year, but is not yet
      published, with treatment-refractory sarcoma patients that showed a PFS was significantly
      prolonged from a median of 20 vs. 7 weeks. As can occur with all antiangiogenic agents,
      resistance to pazopanib may develop. Epigenetic modification with HDAC inhibitors may
      overcome drug resistance by causing an increase in accessibility of DNA to chemotherapeutic
      agents and may therefore significantly potentiate their cytotoxicity. Combination trials with
      chemotherapy agents are ongoing (clinicaltrials.gov.) To our knowledge, a combination trial
      of HDACi with anti-angiogenesis agents has not yet been performed and represents an unmet
      medical need.

      PCI-24781 is a pan HDAC inhibitor. In cell lines tested, up-regulation and down-regulation of
      genes known to result in changes with signal transduction, oxidation, metabolic changes,
      apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation and angiogenesis were seen. In addition, ongoing
      single agent and combination trials have shown the drug to be effective and well-tolerated.

      Hypothesis: Combining an antiangiogenic agent, such as pazopanib, with an epigenetic
      modifier, such as histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) PCI-24781, can increase the efficacy
      of pazopanib as well as overcome development of resistance to pazopanib.
