  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent scientific evidence shows that FM patients improve exercise capacity, symptoms and
      quality of life with the holding of regular exercise, especially aerobic exercise. Swimming
      is an aerobic workout of low impact, but no study has evaluated the effect of this activity
      in patients with fibromyalgia.

      Randomized controlled trial with blinded evaluator, which will be evaluated patients with
      fibromyalgia were divided into two groups.

      The intervention group will hold an exercise program of swimming (freestyle) and the other
      considered the control group held a walking program.

      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a syndrome characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal pain and chronic,
      with points called &quot;hot spots&quot;, specific, sensitive and painful on palpation. Objective: To
      evaluate the efficacy of swimming in reducing the generally pain and improve the quality of
      function, of life and exercise capacity in patients with fibromyalgia. Material and Methods:
      82 patients will be screened, diagnosed with fibromyalgia, who can swim the front crawl. Will
      be selected at UNIFESP outpatient clinics and also through advertisement in a newspaper. One
      group held the swimming training and the other group (control) will walk training. The
      Participants perform exercises (swimming or running) three times a week for 50 minutes, for
      12 weeks. The exercises will be held at the anaerobic threshold determined by cardiopulmonary
      exercise testing. Measuring instrument: Questionnaires VAS (visual analogue scale) for pain,
      FIQ (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire) to assess the quality of life related to disease, and
      also the SF-36 (short form health survey), which assesses quality of life in general.
      Cardiopulmonary stress test to assess cardiorespiratory fitness to sit and stand up and test
      to assess functional capacity. All participants will conduct an initial evaluation, after 6
      and 13 weeks of training.
