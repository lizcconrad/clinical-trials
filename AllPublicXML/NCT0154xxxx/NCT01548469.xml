  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that using &quot;Bio Mineral&quot; toothpaste for 4 weeks will decrease
      plaque and gingivitis of mild periodontitis patients compared to patients using &quot;Perio Total
      Care&quot; toothpaste.

      This study is Single blind, Randomized, Active-controlled Comparative clinical trial to
      evaluate clinical efficacy and safety following the application for 4 weeks of Bio Mineral
      toothpaste in patients with mild periodontitis.

      This study is Single blind, Randomized, Active-controlled Comparative clinical trial to
      evaluate clinical efficacy and safety following the application for 4 weeks of Bio Mineral
      toothpaste in patients with mild periodontitis. 30 patients of treatment group and 30
      patients of control group, total 60 patients will be enrolled to this study. Every patients
      will use investigational toothpaste 2 times everyday for 4 weeks and brush their teeth at
      least 3 minutes each time with 1ml of toothpaste.
