      The purpose of this study is to evaluate diagnostic imaging techniques using 124I-NM404
      PET/CT in human brain tumors. This goal will be accomplished by quantifying tumor uptake and
      determining the optimal PET/CT protocol, comparing PET tumor uptake to MRI, and calculating
      tumor dosimetry. The long-term goals of this research are to improve the diagnosis and
      treatment of malignant brain tumors by using radioiodinated NM404

    <time_frame>24- and 48 hours post injection</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor to blood pool ratio (tumor SUVmax to superior sinus SUVmean) was calculated at each time point. Tumor to blood pool is calculated by using tumor/lesion SUVmax and dividing by blood pool SUVmean from placing a region of interest in the posterior sagittal sinus near the confluence of sinuses. Imaging performed at 24- and 48 hours post injection.</description>
