    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Calculated Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joint Count Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Disease activity score based on 28 joint counts (DAS28) is a composite measure of disease severity and it incorporates four specific measures of disease: swollen joint count (SJC) of 28 joints, tender joint count (TJC) of 28 joints, Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity by visual analogue scale (VAS), and acute-phase inflammatory marker [erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in millimeter/hour (mm/h), or C-reactive protein (CRP) in milligram/liter (mg/L)]. For the purposes of this study, ESR was used whenever possible to calculate the DAS28 (DAS28-ESR). Higher the scores, greater is the disease activity. A DAS28 score of less than or equal to (&lt;/=) 3.2 = low disease activity, a DAS28 score of &gt;3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index and Simplified Disease Activity Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) was calculated as the sum of the following parameters: SJC + TJC + VAS Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity + VAS Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity. VAS assessments involved a 10-cm horizontal scale from 'no disease activity' to 'maximum disease activity'. CDAI scores ranged from 0 to 76, with higher scores indicating increased disease activity. Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) was calculated as the sum of the following parameters: SJC +TJC + Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity + Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity + CRP. SDAI scores ranged from 0 to 86, with higher scores also indicating increased disease activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Physician Global Assessment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Physician's Global Assessment of disease activity was assessed using a 0 to 100 millimeter (mm) horizontal VAS. The left-hand extreme of the line equals 0 mm, and is described as &quot;no disease activity&quot; (symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and the right-hand extreme equals 100 mm, as &quot;maximum disease activity&quot; (maximum arthritis disease activity). Change from baseline = scores at observation minus score at baseline. An increase in score from baseline represented disease progression and/or joint worsening, no change represented halting of disease progression, and a decrease represented improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events and Non-serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 to 3 (0=no difficulty and 3=inability to perform a task in that area). HAQ-DI total scores expressed as overall mean score with range 0-3: 0-0.25=normal functioning; 0.25-0.5=mild functional limitation; 0.5-1=moderate functional limitation; more than 1=significant functional limitation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participant's fatigue. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-F score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the participant's health status.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Calculated Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joint Count Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate at Week 24</title>
        <description>Disease activity score based on 28 joint counts (DAS28) is a composite measure of disease severity and it incorporates four specific measures of disease: swollen joint count (SJC) of 28 joints, tender joint count (TJC) of 28 joints, Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity by visual analogue scale (VAS), and acute-phase inflammatory marker [erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in millimeter/hour (mm/h), or C-reactive protein (CRP) in milligram/liter (mg/L)]. For the purposes of this study, ESR was used whenever possible to calculate the DAS28 (DAS28-ESR). Higher the scores, greater is the disease activity. A DAS28 score of less than or equal to (&lt;/=) 3.2 = low disease activity, a DAS28 score of &gt;3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Tender Joint Count</title>
        <description>A tender joint count (TJC) is the most specific clinical method to quantify abnormalities in participants with RA. It is associated with the level of pain. Twenty-eight joints were assessed for tenderness. Joints were classified as tender (1)/not tender (0) giving a total possible TJC score of 0 to 28.</description>

        <description>The Physician’s Global Assessment of disease activity was assessed using a 0 to 100 millimeter (mm) horizontal VAS. The left-hand extreme of the line equals 0 mm, and is described as “no disease activity” (symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and the right-hand extreme equals 100 mm, as “maximum disease activity” (maximum arthritis disease activity). Change from baseline = scores at observation minus score at baseline. An increase in score from baseline represented disease progression and/or joint worsening, no change represented halting of disease progression, and a decrease represented improvement.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Score</title>
        <description>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participant's fatigue. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-F score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score).

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Score</title>
          <description>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participant's fatigue. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-F score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the participant's health status.</description>
