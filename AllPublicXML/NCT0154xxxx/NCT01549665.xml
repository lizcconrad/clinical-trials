  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is a major complication following allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) which may cause acute life-threatening morbidity or
      chronic disabilities. Although corticosteroid, the primary agent to treat GVHD, may be
      effective for some patients, outcomes of those who are refractory to corticosteroid are
      dismal. Secondary agents can be used for steroid-refractory cases; however, their efficacy is
      variable and usually limited. The quality of life issue of chronic GVHD is especially
      important for pediatric survivors who have longer life expectancy than adults. Many in-vitro
      and in-vivo data support immunoregulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)and
      possibilities of treating diseases caused by immune dysregulation such as GVHD. Recent data
      revealed that bone marrow-derived MSCs were very useful to treat steroid-refractory acute
      GVHD, which led to improved overall survival compared with controls. More recently, a number
      of reports suggest MSCs may also be useful in treating chronic GVHD as well as acute GVHD. It
      has been also reported that third party MSCs are also useful as well as those from autologous
      or HLA-matched donors. The investigator recently demonstrated that MSCs obtained from
      umbilical cord blood (UCB) have similar immunosuppressive properties as bone marrow-MSCs.
      UCB-MSCs can be obtained without doing any harm to donors that it may be more appropriate
      source of MSCs than bone marrow for off-the-shelf use. However, little is known about the
      safety and efficacy of UCB-MSCs in treating GVHD. Therefore, the investigator designed this
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UCB-MSCs in treating pediatric patients with
      steroid-refractory acute or chronic GVHD.
