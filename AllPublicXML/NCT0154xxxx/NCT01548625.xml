      Purpose: A growing body of epidemiological data suggests an increased risk of cardiovascular
      events associated with air pollutants. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated as
      a potential mechanism for the adverse effects of air pollutants and genetic polymorphisms of
      the glutathione-s-transferases (GSTs) have been shown to participate in the antioxidant
      defenses to air pollutants. This study examined the dose effects of diesel exhaust exposure
      on the cardiovascular system in healthy middle-aged subjects.

      Participants: Six healthy 50-75 year-old male and female subjects with GSTM1 null genotype
      had 3 sequential exposures to the diesel exhausts at concentrations approximately 100 µg/m3,
      200 µg/m3, and 300 µg/m3 for 2 hours with a about 2 weeks of interval between exposures.

          -  Normal resting ECG.

          -  Oxygen saturation greater than 94% at the time of physical exam.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             coronary bypass surgery.

          -  Cardiac pacemaker.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (&gt; 150 systolic, &gt; 90 diastolic).

          -  Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer disease.

          -  A history of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, cancer, rheumatologic diseases,
             immunodeficiency state, known cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory diseases
             such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or severe asthma.

          -  Participants must refrain from all over-the-counter NSAIDs for a period of two weeks
             prior to exposure. Low-dose aspirin will be acceptable. Medications not specifically
             mentioned here may be reviewed by the investigators prior to a participant's inclusion
             in the study.
