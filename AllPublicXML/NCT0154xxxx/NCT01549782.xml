  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal and pelvic radiotherapy (RT) reduces the renewal capacity of the epithelium. Rectal
      biopsies obtained from patients receiving pelvic RT have revealed atrophy of surface
      epithelium, acute cryptitis, crypt abscesses, crypt distortion and atrophy, and stromal
      inflammation. Modifications in intestinal microbiota, such as an increase in the number of
      pathogens, may contribute to intestinal injury. The prebiotic effect of a carbohydrate is
      assessed by its capacity to stimulate the proliferation of healthy bacteria (Bifidobacterium,
      Lactobacillus) rather than pathogenic bacteria (Clostridium, E. coli).

      The hypothesis of the study is that a mixture of inulin and fructooligosaccharide could
      modulate Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and reduce the intestinal injury in patients
      affected of gynaecological cancer and treated with abdominal radiotherapy.
