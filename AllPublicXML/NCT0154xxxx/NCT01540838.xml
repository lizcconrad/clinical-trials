  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this trial is to test if mortality of childhood bacterial meningitis can
      be reduced by slow, continuous infusion of cefotaxime initially, instead of the traditional
      bolus administration four times daily (qid), combined with high-dose paracetamol orally, when
      both treatments are executed for the first 4 days. The series will be collected at Hospital
      Pediátrico David Bernardino, Luanda, Angola.

      The recruitment of patients begins, the conditions permitting, in early 2012. The criteria
      for patient participation is a child at the age of 2 months to 15 years who presents with the
      symptoms and signs suggestive of bacterial meningitis, for whom a lumbar puncture is
      performed, and the cerebrospinal fluid analysis suggests bacterial meningitis.

    <textblock>
      The principal objective of the study is to examine if mortality of childhood bacterial
      meningitis can be reduced by slow continuous infusion of cefotaxime combined with high-dose
      paracetamol orally for the first 4 days (instead of the traditional qid administration of
      cefotaxime without concomitant paracetamol). Children qualifying for entry (see criteria
      below), whose guardian has given informed consent,will be randomized into 2 treatment arms
      (see details below)and receive the treatments in a double blind fashion (see details below).
      Primary and secondary outcomes (detailed below) will be evaluated according to predefined
      criteria and time points (see below).

      Results will be analyzed for all patients in ITT datasets and in prespecified subgroups
      (etiology, nutritional status, etc.) in both crude and adjusted analysis. The efficacy
      results will be expressed as OR with 95% confidence intervals.
