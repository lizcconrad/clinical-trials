  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research is to examine the result of rotator cuff repairs
      following acute shoulder dislocations and to investigate whether timing of surgery following
      acute shoulder dislocations affects patients perception of pain, function, and strength
      following surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a higher risk of rotator cuff tears following dislocation when the individual is
      greater than 40 years old. Rotator cuff tears after dislocation of the shoulder are more of a
      challenge to repair particularly if there is a delay in diagnosis. Clinical experience would
      suggest that rotator cuff repair within the first month of injury allows for better results
      in acute rotator cuff tears without shoulder dislocation. There are no reported results for
      rotator cuff repairs following shoulder dislocation and timing of repair. If we find that
      early repair provides better results this will be important for Primary Care Providers and
      Emergency Department physicians to refer these patients early for evaluation and subsequently
      earlier treatment.

        Study population will include patients age 35 years and older who have sustained an acute
        rotator cuff tear following shoulder dislocation who underwent a rotator cuff repair either
        by open or arthroscopic techniques between January 1, 2001 and June 1, 2011.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  age 35 years or older with acute rotator cuff tear following documented shoulder
             dislocation requiring reduction, subjects sustained acute rotator cuff tear following
             shoulder dislocation that was treated surgically with open and/or arthroscopic
             technique between January 1, 2001 and June 1, 2011, surgical intervention within 6
             months of dislocation, minimum follow up time of one year from surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  rotator cuff tears without shoulder dislocation, known previous rotator cuff disease,
             history of other trauma to the shoulder, inability to provide informed consent, other
             suspect pathology (ie: tumor, infection).
