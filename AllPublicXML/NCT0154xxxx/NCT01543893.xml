    <textblock>
      Resistance training is widely used in training and rehabilitation. During recent years
      elastic resistance training has become increasingly popular for preventing or relieving
      neck/shoulder/arm pain among sedentary employees. While most research studies documenting
      positive effects of such interventions have used training instructors, most training in
      practice does not use an instructor but rather depends on information from other sources such
      as the internet. Here the investigators examine - in a outcome assessor blinded randomized
      controlled trial - the effect of 2 weeks elastic resistance training for the
      neck/shoulder/arm with personal versus video instruction on technical execution.
