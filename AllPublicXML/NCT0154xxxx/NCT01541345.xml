  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since there are no clinical studies available comparing the gold standard (autogenous bone
      graft plus resorbable membrane) to the promising combination of xenogenic bone graft loaded
      with rhBMP-2 in combination with a collagen membrane for localized ridge augmentation, the
      present exploratory study has been designed.

      The aim of the present study is therefore to test whether or not the application of a
      xenogenic bone block loaded with rhBMP-2 will results in clinically, radiographically and
      histologically similar outcomes as the gold standard (autogenous bone block) for the
      regeneration of chronic ridge defects.

      The investigators expect that there is no difference in bone quantity and quality between the
      two methods and that the use of the test treatment will be more user and patient friendly
      according to the patient perception/acceptance since no second surgical site will be
      necessary as well as cause less complications.
