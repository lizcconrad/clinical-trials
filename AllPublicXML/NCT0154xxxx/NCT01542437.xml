    <textblock>
      Patients with stage IIIB and IV lung adenocarcinoma and progression to first-line
      chemotherapy were enrolled to receive afatinib 40 mg/day. Mutational EGFR and HER-2 status
      were assessed by RT-PCR. HER2 amplification was evaluated by FISH. Plasma HGF levels were
      measured by ELISA before and 2 months (mo) after the start of treatment. We assessed changes
      in serum HGF levels and their association with objective response rate (ORR), PFS and overall
      survival (OS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the main cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, accounting for 1.6
      million deaths in 2012. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) histology comprises ap-proximately
      85% of cases. At the time of diagnosis, 75% of the patients have locally advanced or
      metastatic disease, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. Although treatment options
      for these patients remain limited, drugs targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) have proved to be a highly effective therapy in NSCLC patients harboring sensitizing
      EGFR mutations.

      Afatinib, a second-generation irreversible TKI, confers a theoretical advantage over
      re-versible TKIs in patients with acquired resistance. Through covalent binding to the kinase
      domain of EGFR, afatinib down regulates signaling from all homodimers and heter-odimers
      formed by ERBB receptor family members including EGFR, HER2 (ErbB2), HER3 (ErbB3) and HER4
      (ErbB4). HER2 mutations in NSCLC are rare, being found in approximately 1-4% of lung
      adenocarcinomas.

      In contrast with reversible TKIs, the mechanisms of resistance to irreversible TKIs have not
      been fully elucidated, and identification of biomarkers that predict response to these drugs,
      particularly in patients progressing after first line therapy, is needed. In this study we
      assess the usefulness of plasma HGF concentrations as a predictor of response to afatinib in
      patients with advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma.

    <description>Patients received a daily oral 40mg dose of afatinib. Treatment was continued until docu-mented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 was used to evaluate toxicity. In patients with severe toxicity (grade ≥3) afatinib was temporary discontinued until the patient recovery to at least grade 1 toxicity and continued with a dose reduction to 30 mg/day. Dose reduction below 30mg/day was not allowed. Patients experiencing more than one grade ≥3 event, those with grade ≥2 toxicity after dose reduction, and/or those showing no recovery within 14 days discontinued treatment.</description>
