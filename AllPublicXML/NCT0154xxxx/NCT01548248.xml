  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in Europe. The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety
      of insulin detemir (Levemir®) used as basal insulin on the glycaemic control, weight and
      incidence of hypoglycaemic events in insulin treated subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes
      treated with insulin NPH under normal clinical practice conditions in Slovakia.

        Any subject with type 1 or type 2 diabetes treated with human insulin NPH in whom at the
        discretion of the participating physicians it was decided to switch insulin treatment to
        the long-acting insulin analogue insulin detemir in combination with insulin aspart. The
        selection of the subjects was at the discretion of the participating physicians.
