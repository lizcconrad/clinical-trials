  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vietnam is currently experiencing two epidemics -- injection drug use and HIV. HIV infection
      is rising rapidly, primarily among injecting drug users (IDUs). Most young IDUs keep daily
      contact with their family or live in their parent's home. The burden on their families is
      substantial, and even greater if the IDU is HIV+. In this study, the investigators conduct an
      intervention pilot to develop and evaluate a family intervention to improve outcomes over
      time for Vietnamese IDUs and their families. This two-year study is conducted in Phu Tho, a
      province located about 80 km from Hanoi, Vietnam's capital.

      Two teams with complementary expertise collaborate to implement this study: the UCLA team and
      the Vietnamese team from the Vietnam National Institute of Hygiene &amp; Epidemiology (NIHE). The
      study has two phases:

        -  In Phase 1, the investigators develop the content, format and an implementation plan for
           the intervention from a focus group of 10 service providers, administrators and
           community leaders, and through in-depth interviews with 40 IDUs (20 HIV+ and 20 HIV-)
           recruited from the local drug rehabilitation center (the &quot;06 Center&quot;) and from two local
           communities (Duu Lau and Gia Cam), as well as in-depth interviews with 20 of the IDUs
           family members (FM). Based on the findings, the investigators collaborate on designing a
           Vietnamese-specific family intervention for IDUs and their family members.

        -  In Phase 2, the investigators pilot the intervention in the local commune health centers
           in Viet Tri, Phu Tho. Eighty IDUs (HIV+/HIV-) and 80 of their family members are
           recruited from 4 communes and the 06 Center in Viet Tri city, and randomized into a
           intervention group and a control group. After the 4-week intervention, 3-month and
           6-month follow-ups are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the intervention.
           Participants randomized to the control group only complete the assessments (baseline,
           3-, and 6-month) at the same time points.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vietnam is facing the challenge of dual epidemics -injection drug use and HIV. HIV infection
      is rising exponentially, primarily among injecting drug users (IDUs). Because Vietnamese are
      highly family oriented, most young IDUs have daily family contact or live in their parents'
      homes. The burden on the family is substantial, and even greater if the IDU is HIV+. The
      investigators hypothesize that with assistance, families can be part of the solution for both
      HIV and HIV+ IDU. This family intervention in Vietnam is based on the Social Action Theory
      and Social Network Theory, aimed at increasing families' capacities to effectively cope with
      the impact of IDUs and HIV. The study provides an opportunity to test culturally-specific
      intervention content and delivery. In addition, the intervention pilot will provide an
      opportunity to obtain project implementation experience in the local settings. The study also
      provides the opportunity to pilot test outcome measures.

      The specific aims of the study are:

        1. To document the challenges of drug use and HIV for IDUs and their family members;

        2. To examine the acceptability and feasibility of a family-based intervention for IDU and
           their family members;

        3. To examine whether the IDUs and family members in the intervention group, compared to
           those in the standard care group, will have significantly improved health, mental
           health, and quality of life outcomes, including health seeking, reduced sexual and drug
           use risk behaviors, increased HIV testing, and reduced caregiver burden; and

        4. To examine how outcomes of the IDUs and family members are mediated by family indicators
           such as family cohesion, stress and symptom management, stigma and harm reduction, HIV
           disclosure, and treatment adherence.

    <description>The IDUs will be assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short-Form 36 (SF-36). The MOS-SF-36 consists of the following domains: physical functioning; role limitation (physical); role limitation (emotional); social functioning; mental health; energy/vitality; pain; and general health perception. The score for each domain ranges from 0 to 100 with higher values indicating higher functional status.</description>

    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 3- and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>All of the participants including both IDUs and family members will be assessed by the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale. This measure, developed by the World Health Organization, is a 20-item self-report scale that is widely used as a screening tool, covering affective, psychological and somatic symptoms associated with depression. Results from this measure will be used as an indicator of psychological (including psychosis) and emotional functioning that can be associated with drug use.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Drug use</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 3- and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Measures will include data on alcohol use and other drug use. For the IDU participants, their drug use will be measured by a biomarker (Urine drug screen) at the baseline, since the drug rehabilitation sites routinely collect urine to test for drug use. Positive results will be interpreted as signifying drug use, regardless of self-report.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual risk</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 3- and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This is assessed using the Risk Assessment Battery (RAB; Metzger, 1995) Collecting data on self-reported HIV risk behaviors is especially relevant as there is a well-documented association between drug use and participation in high risk sexual behaviors related to HIV-transmission.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver burden</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 3- and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This is assessed using the Perceived Caregiver Burden Scale (PCB) (Stommel et al., 1990). This scale has been used in our studies in Thailand and China (Lee et al., 2009b) to assess caregiver burden in terms of perceptions and feelings about family members' physical and emotional health, family relationships, social life, work, and finances.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Family/social support</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 3- and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This is measured by two instruments. Social Support Questionnaire (Short; SSQ6) is a 6-item assessment to measure satisfaction of social support. Number of social support providers is captured up to 9 people in various support dimensions (Sarason et al., 1983). Medical Outcomes Study- Social Support Scale (MOS-SS) is a 20-item scale that measures the strength of perceived social support available. The scale consists of five dimensions: emotional support, informational support, tangible support, positive social interaction, and affection.</description>
