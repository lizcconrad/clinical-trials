  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe traumatized patients (ISS &gt; 15) admitted to emergency department (ED) University
      Hospital Innsbruck with obvious bleeding and/or who are at risk for significant hemorrhage
      will be screened by rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) assays during ED treatment and
      subsequent surgical/radiological interventions for having coagulopathy (T0). If a patient
      meets the inclusion criteria (T1) and is recruited for the study, a first study related blood
      sample (40mL) will be drawn, and data collected. Subsequently, 100 patients will be
      randomized to receive Fibrinogen concentrate and/or Prothrombin complex concentrate and/or
      FXIII concentrate for reversal of coagulopathy, while the other 100 patients will receive
      fresh frozen plasma (FFP),respectively.

      Treatment failure will be registered if bleeding persists and ROTEM parameters do not improve
      after two times dosages of study drug. In these cases haemostatic rescue therapy will be
      administered. CFC (fibrinogen concentrate and/or PCC, and/or FXIII concentrate) will be
      administered to patients randomized to receive FFP and FFP will be administered to patients
      of the CFC group.

      In cases unresponsive to comprehensive treatment or normal ROTEM combined with diffuse
      bleeding, other haemostatic medications can be administered (e.g rFVIIa, DDAVP, VWF/FVIII
      concentrate) as judged by the anesthetist in charge. The need and type of any rescue therapy
      will be documented and a ROTEM will be performed thereafter.

      At admission to ICU (T0 ICU), 24h (T24 ICU) and 48h(T48 ICU) thereafter further study related
      blood samples are drawn (40mL each).

      The indications for transfusion of red blood cells or platelets, administration of
      antifibrinolytics, treatment of acidosis, hypothermia, hypocalcemia and volume replacement
      are similar for both groups and treatment is performed according to clinical routine.

      Besides coagulation management during ED treatment until 24h on ICU, patient's care is not
      influenced by the study and follows clinical routine.
