      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of steady-state ranolazine on the steady
      state PK of metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

      The primary objective of this study is as follows:

      • To evaluate the effect of steady-state ranolazine on the steady state PK of metformin in
      subjects with T2DM.

      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To examine the safety and tolerability of metformin when co administered with ranolazine
           at steady-state in subjects with T2DM.

        -  To determine the steady-state PK of ranolazine in subjects with T2DM receiving
           metformin.
