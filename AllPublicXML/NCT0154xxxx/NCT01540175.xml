    <textblock>
      Autologous stem cell rescue is an established therapy in high risk neuroblastoma and relapsed
      Hodgkin's lymphoma and an experimental therapy in some other solid and brain tumors to
      facilitate the use of very intense chemotherapy beyond bone marrow tolerance. It is usually
      tolerated with acceptable toxicity and graft failure is practically not existent. But whereas
      immune reconstitution in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) setting is
      widely studied, the investigators have no comprehensive data available in the autologous
      setting regarding recovery of the innate and adaptive immune system. However, observations in
      patients with autoimmune disease undergoing autologous HSCT suggest not an exact recovery of
      the patient's pre-transplant immune system but some re-education during reconstitution of
      immune function.

      Also, recent developments of cancer-directed immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies and
      immunocytokines rely on activity of the patient's own immune system via complement-mediated
      or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. These novel therapies are given either with or
      shortly after conventional chemotherapy. To find the optimal time point for administration of
      immunotherapy, it is important to know how and when immune effector cells recover after
      conventional myelosuppressive and/or immunosuppressive chemotherapy which are used in
      Induction regimens.

      Researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital want to study the research participant's
      immune profile once prior and at multiple set time points after autologous stem cell infusion
      during the recovery process. In a subset of participants the investigators want to study the
      recovery of lymphocyte subsets and function after one course of conventional chemotherapy
      preceding the high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. That way the
      investigators hope to learn about the pace and order of recovery and the functional capacity
      of different compartments of the immune system during reconstitution.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To describe the immune reconstitution of T cell-, B cell- and natural killer (NK) cell-
           compartment in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplant as part of their
           treatment for a malignancy.

      The design for this study will be a prospective, longitudinal observational study. Immune
      reconstitution will be measured in the course of autologous stem cell transplant using serial
      blood samples analyzed for cell counts, immune cell phenotyping (demonstrating the expression
      of specific receptors on the cell surface) and functional lymphocyte assays. These blood
      samples will be obtained once prior and at defined time points after stem cell infusion
      either while the research participant is hospitalized or during the scheduled clinic visit.

      Immune recovery from conventional chemotherapy will be measured using serial blood samples
      analyzed for cell counts, immune cell phenotyping, and NK cell functional assays. These blood
      samples will be obtained once prior and at defined time points after completion of courses #1
      and #4 of Induction chemotherapy while the research participant is hospitalized or during the
      scheduled clinic visit.

    <description>The order and magnitude of recovery of the different subtypes of leukocytes will be summarized by descriptive statistics. The pattern of immune reconstitution will be evaluated using longitudinal approaches such as Mixed effect models or GEE approach and implement in SAS 9.2 using PROC MIXED or PROC GENMOD.
In addition, NK cell number, receptor and ligand genotype and phenotype and functional capacity will be compared at specific time points (28 days, 8 weeks and 6 months post autologous transplant) to the baseline values using paired one sample signed rank test.</description>

Research participants with high risk neuroblastoma may also agree to have blood samples taken before and twice in the recovery period (days 0, 7 and 15-18) of Induction chemotherapy courses one and four.</description>
