  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim is to study the efficacy of mentholyptus drops in improving the
      palatability of PEG-electrolyte solution used in bowel cleansing for colonoscopy. The study
      is a randomized controlled trial which will include patients undergoing elective colonoscopy
      at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. Patients will be randomized into one of
      two study arms using a computer generated randomization list. Patients assigned to the
      intervention arm will be asked to have candy (Halls®) during the whole 2 hours period while
      drinking the PEG solution unlike the control arm patients who will only receive the PEG
      solution. All patients will then be evaluated for the tolerability of the preparation while
      taking into account the palatability of the solution as main outcome and the remaining volume
      of the PEG solution and side effects as secondary outcomes.

    <description>patients will be asked to assess the palatability of the colon preparation solution (Fortrans®) by giving it a score on a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being disgusting and 5 being tasty after drinking the whole solution and immediately prior to the colonoscopy</description>
