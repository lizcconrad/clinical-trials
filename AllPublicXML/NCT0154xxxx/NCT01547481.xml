      This proposal is focused on developing a reliable, valid, and reproducible imaging techniques
      and statistical methodology for segregation of various forms of Parkinsonism from healthy
      adults without Parkinsonism. We focus on early diagnosis of Parkinsonism, other tremor
      disorders, and determine how imaging might be used to improve diagnosis. The purpose of this
      protocol is to gather a multi-modal dataset to explore and validate the investigator's
      previous research findings in prior studies.

        Subjects with PD, MSA-P, ET, or PSP will be recruited based on clinical criteria from the
        UAB Comprehensive Parkinson Disease and Movement Disorder Clinic located at The Kirklin
        Clinic at UAB. This center sees over 3,500 patients annually. Individuals with RBD will be
        recruited from the UAB University Hospital and UAB Highlands Sleep Disorders Center and
        will be identified through patient contact with a UAB Department of Neurology physician.

        Diagnosis of clinically definite PSP, with the following features:

          -  Gradually progressive disorder.

          -  Onset after age 39

          -  Supranuclear palsy* and postural instability with falls in the first year of disease
             onset*.

          -  No evidence of other disease.

        Parkinsonism of Other or Undetermined Cause (POC) Age 35-85

        Diagnosis of parkinsonism of undetermined other other cause by a movement disorders
        specialist, with the following features:

          -  Signs and symptoms of Parkinsonism including

               1. Bradykinesia

               2. Mixed or resting tremor

               3. Rigidity
