  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the effect of Losmapimod on blood vessels in
      patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Although COPD is a lung disease,
      it is also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (e.g. heart attacks
      and stroke). The investigators believe that this is a result of inflammation within the body,
      which damages the lining (endothelium) and walls of blood vessels. These changes can promote
      the development of fatty deposits within the walls of arteries (atherosclerosis) which can
      rupture and block arteries causing damage.

      The study aims to enrol sufficient COPD subjects (stratified by fibrinogen level) so that 60
      patients complete the study. Study patients will have a 50% chance of receiving either
      Losmapimod or Placebo. Patients will be expected to attend for up to 12 visits, over a 24
      week period. The visits consist of an initial screening visit, and 2 pre-dose imaging visits
      to include a PET-CT scan and an optional MRI scan. The next 7 visits (at 2-4 weekly
      intervals) involve blood tests and safety evaluations. A number of procedures including heart
      tracings (ECGs), non-invasive vascular measurements and lung function tests at the start and
      at the end of the study. Repeat imaging with PET-CT and MRI will be performed at the end of
      the study and a follow-up visit.

      The purpose of the study is to see if the study medication has a beneficial effect on
      vascular function and structure. It is envisaged that this trial will help define more
      evolutionary biomarkers to focus on to help COPD patients in the future.
