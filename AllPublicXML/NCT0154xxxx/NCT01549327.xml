  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer, exposure to up-to-date cancer information
      and support as well as guidance to access the most appropriate health care services is
      crucial for cancer self-management and support. Timely access to high quality cancer
      information is suggested to contribute to patient empowerment - defined as the perception of
      being better able to manage illness demands. With the advent of the information age,
      individuals are increasingly turning to online health information resources. The use of
      rigorous web-based tools is found to be an engaging and convenient way to access health
      information, while being tailored to people's needs and preferences. The present study seeks
      to examine the effects of a recently developed high quality and person-centred web-based
      tool, the Oncology Interactive Navigator (OIN) on patients' empowerment as well as document
      its cost-effectiveness. Participants newly diagnosed with colorectal cancer will be randomly
      assigned to experimental or control groups with the former having unrestricted access to the
      OIN for 8 months. Participants in the control group will receive care as usual. Information
      on background, medical characteristics, and empowerment will be collected as well as
      cost-effectiveness indicators. If producing the desired effects, the OIN could be proposed
      for national implementation across Canadian cancer centers. Work is currently underway to add
      over 23 types of cancer diagnosis to the OIN.

    <description>The main outcome for this trial is empowerment which is multidimensional. Key dimensions of empowerment are measured using five constructs from the health education impact Questionnaire system (reference). Repeated measures using analysis of variance will be used to compare patterns of change in empowerment constructs across time between trial groups.
