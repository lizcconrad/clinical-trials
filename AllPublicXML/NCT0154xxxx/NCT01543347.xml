      This study is aimed at demonstrating the efficacy of temocillin in the treatment of
      complicated Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) due to confirmed Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamases
      (ESBL) producing or AmpC hyperproducing Enterobacteriaceae in the United Kingdom.

    <textblock>
      The spectrum of activity together with the route of excretion of temocillin makes it a good
      candidate for the treatment of urinary tract infections. Several studies have shown very good
      clinical and microbiological activity in uncomplicated and complicated cystitis and
      pyelonephritis in adults and in pyelonephritis in children older than 2 months. However there
      is no specific study performed on Urinary Tract Infections due to broad spectrum ß-lactamases
      producing strains.

      In this context, this study is aimed at demonstrating the efficacy of temocillin in the
      treatment of complicated Urinary Tract Infection due to confirmed Extended Spectrum
      Beta-Lactamases (ESBL) producing or AmpC hyperproducing Enterobacteriaceae in the United
      Kingdom. The investigators will also evaluate the tolerance of the drug by monitoring the
      adverse event and the incidence of eventual Clostridium difficile associated infection.
