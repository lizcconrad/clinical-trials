    <textblock>
      Living-donor kidney transplantation has been considered as the best treatment for patients
      with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Kidney donation from living donors has been performed
      widely under their noble humanity and a belief that donation would not harm the donor.
      Although the overall evidences proposed that living kidney donor have medical outcomes
      similar to those in general population, several reports have demonstrated the potential risks
      for development of hypertension, proteinuria, and ESRD. Thus, all efforts should be
      concentrated on ensuring their safety and preserving the function of their remained kidney
      during anesthesia maintenance.

      Inhaled anesthetics have been frequently used for the induction and maintenance of general
      anesthesia. The metabolism of certain inhaled anesthetics can produce inorganic fluoride,
      which may be directly nephrotoxic through impairments of renal concentrating ability. The
      typical inhaled anesthetics commonly used nowadays are sevoflurane and desflurane. The
      defluorination of sevoflurane can results in increased serum inorganic fluoride ion
      concentrations, but any neprhotoxic effect of sevoflurane has not been proven yet in human.
      On the other hand, desflurane is extremely resistant to defluorination, and desflurane does
      not appear to be nephrotoxic.

      The inhaled anesthetics which are currently used in general anesthesia have no clinical
      evidence of nephrotoxicity, but the possible risks cannot be excluded entirely, especially in
      the patients who one kidney is donated. The purpose of the current retrospective, single
      center study was to evaluate and compare postoperative renal function of living kidney donor
      after nephrectomy under sevoflurane or desflurane anesthesia, and make evidence-based
      recommendations of proper inhaled anesthetics for anesthesia of living kidney donor.

    <description>We collect laboratory data of the patients which were underwent at preoperative period and during postoperative periods. The laboratory data includes hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), platelet, prothrombin time (PT), albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) which was calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula with age, gender, race, and serum creatinine as variables.</description>
