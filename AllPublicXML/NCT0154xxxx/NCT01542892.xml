  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several trials have found that nutritional supplementation can elicit an increased rate of
      skeletal muscle protein synthesis following a single bout of exercise in both young and older
      individuals. However, there have been no studies that have investigated if nutritional
      supplementation and exercise can cause a sustained increase in physical functioning and fat
      free mass, particularly in older adults with functional limitations. This study will compare
      the effects of a nutritional supplement versus a placebo on exercise training induced changes
      in physical functioning older adults who are at risk for mobility disability.

      Exercise Intervention: Participants will complete exercise sessions 3 times per week for 6
      months. The exercise sessions will involve walking, lower extremity strength exercises,
      flexibility, and balance training.

      Supplement Intervention: Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the
      nutritional supplement or placebo. The participants will consume on beverage immediately
      after each exercise session.

      Primary Outcome: The primary outcome will be the time to walk 400 meters, expressed as
      average gait speed during the 400 M walk. All participants must be able to walk 400 meters in
      &lt;15 minutes at walking at their normal speed. The 400 M walk will be assessed at baseline,
      3-months, and 6-months, with the changes at 6-months being the primary outcome.

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        -  Stair Climb Test

        -  Body Composition

        -  Skeletal muscle cross sectional area

        -  Isokinetic/Isometric peak torque/power

        -  Hand-grip strength

        -  Nutritional status

        -  Quality of Life/Depressive symptoms Expected enrollment: 150 (80 at Tufts University
           (Boston, MA, USA), 70 at University of Uppsala (Uppsala, Sweden))
