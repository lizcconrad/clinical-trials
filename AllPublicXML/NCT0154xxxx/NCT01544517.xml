  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A five day quadruple concomitant therapy is as effective and safe as a 10 day sequential
      therapy for eradication of H. pylori infection.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators studied 180 consecutive patients with H. pylori infection who were
      randomized to 5-day concomitant therapy (90 patients) and to 10-day sequential therapy (90
      patients). 6 and 10 weeks after the end of therapy, patients were evaluated for their H.
      pylori status by 13C Urea Breath Test. Side effects and costs of either regimen were
      evaluated. In patients whose H pylori status at entry was assessed by endoscopy, culture was
      performed and antimicrobial resistance was determined
