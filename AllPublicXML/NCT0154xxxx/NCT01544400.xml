  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Athletes in particular elite athletes have obsessional food and body concerns, in bond with a
      worship of the performance more and more invading, which lead to clinical and subclinical
      eating disorders. These eating disorders differ according to the disciplines and are
      difficult to diagnose in athletes because there are insufficiently described.

      Our aim at estimating the frequency of eating disorders in athletes and describing eating
      disorders by means of somatic, dietetic and psychological evaluations.
