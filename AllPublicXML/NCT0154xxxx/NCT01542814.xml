      This image-acquisition study is designed to acquire the study image data and establish and
      document the clinical findings for each subject. The acquired data will be used to support
      FUJIFILM protocol FMSU2011-003B (Clinical Evaluation of FUJIFILM 3Dimensional Digital
      Mammography) and future regulatory submissions.
