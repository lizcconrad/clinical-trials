      Primary

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate tumour pathological complete response rate after six
      cycles of neoadjuvant docetaxel and cyclophosphamide in an Asian population.

      Secondary

      To assess:

        1. Pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacogenomics (PG) of docetaxel cyclophosphamide in Asian
           patients,

        2. Safety and toxicity of docetaxel cyclophosphamide in Asian patients, and

        3. To determine efficacy of short course (3 days) filgrastim in primary and secondary
           prophylaxis against febrile neutropenia in patients receiving docetaxel and
           cyclophosphamide.

      Study Design and Duration

      Simon Optimal two-stage Phase II design will be used for this trial. With a null hypothesis
      of p0=5% and an alternative hypothesis of p1=20%, significance level, α=5% and power,
      (1-β)=90%, a total of 41 patients will be required, with 21 patients to be recruited for the
      first stage.

      Hence, 21 to 41 patients will be recruited at National Cancer Centre Singapore over 36 months

      Patient Sample

      Patients with newly diagnosed, histological confirmed HER-2 negative clinically node positive
      or locally advanced (cT3-T4, N0-3 or cTx, T0-4, N2-N3) primary breast cancer without evidence
      of metastatic disease.

      Dosage/ Dosage Form, Route and Dose Regimen

      Node Positive or Locally Advanced HER2 Negative Breast Cancer proceed to Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 +
      Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 q21 days x 6 proceed to surgery

      NOTE: cyclophosphamide is administered by intravenous infusion over 10 minutes followed by
      docetaxel over 90 minutes Patients will receive further chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine
      therapy and targeted therapy as per institutional guidelines after surgery.

      Patients with clinical non-response after 4 cycles of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide are most
      unlikely to have a pathological complete response. Hence, discontinuation of study and cross
      over to an anthracycline based chemotherapy is allowed at that point at the discretion of the
      treating oncologist. These patients will be classified as pathological non complete response.

      Patients with progressive disease at any time will discontinue study treatment and receive
      salvage therapy.

      Efficacy Measurements

      Pathological response will be assessed by evaluation of resected surgical specimen after
      completion of protocol treatment.

      Safety Measurements

      Vital signs, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, adverse events
      (AEs), serial laboratory safety tests. Proportion of patients with febrile neutropenia
      despite primary prophylactic G-CSF will be reviewed when 6,12 ,18, 24 and 30 patients have
      been accrued. Increase in number of doses of primary prophylactic G-CSF will be implemented
      if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of proportion exceeds 20%.

      Data Analysis

      All patients who have received at least 1 dose of study treatment will be included in the
      safety and efficacy analyses.

      Pharmacokinetic (PK), Pharmacogenetic (PG) and Correlative Studies

      Consent will be obtained for future analysis of any stored preoperative tumour biopsy
      specimens for possible gene expression profiles predictive of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide.
      Patients will undergo blood sampling for docetaxel and cyclophosphamide PK studies on cycle 1
      day 1 (see page 22 for detailed timing). Whole blood will be collected at baseline for
      genotyping for CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, ALDH, GST, ABCB1, SLCO1B3, PXR, CAR, HNF4α
      genes

      ALL PATIENTS WITH SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS MUST BE FOLLOWED UP FOR OUTCOME.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer.

          -  Patients must have either locally advanced (cT3-T4, N0-3 or cTx, T0-4, N2-N3) or lymph
             node positive breast cancer

          -  Age &gt;21 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the
             use of docetaxel in patients &lt;21 years of age, children are excluded from this study
             but will be eligible for future pediatric phase 2 combination trials.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 10 years.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%; see Appendix A).

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes &gt;3,000/mL

               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mL

               -  platelets &gt;100,000/mL

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR

               -  creatinine clearance &gt;40 mL/min for patients if creatinine levels above
                  institutional normal

          -  The effects of docetaxel on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  HER2 positive breast cancer

          -  Metastatic breast cancer

          -  Patients who have had any chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to entering the study.

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, lenograstim or filgrastim.

          -  History of pre-existing peripheral neuropathy

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because chemotherapy in general including
             docetaxel and cyclophosphamide used in this study are pregnancy class D agents with
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with chemotherapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with chemotherapy. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used
             in this study.

          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with chemotherapy or other agents administered during the
             study. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             anti-retroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Patients with prior malignancies are excluded except for basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin and carcinoma in-situ of the cervix who have received curative treatment.

          -  Inclusion of Women and Minorities

          -  Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.

          -  Protocol precautions and restrictions

          -  Patients who are pregnant or actively breast feeding are not eligible to participate
             in this study as stated in 3.2.8. Female patients of child bearing potential will be
             required to use reliable methods of contraception for the duration of the study and
             until 4 weeks after the last dose of study treatment.
