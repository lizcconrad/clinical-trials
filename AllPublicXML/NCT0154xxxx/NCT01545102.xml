      Cardiac rehabilitation is the ideal comprehensive intervention for patients with chronic
      heart failure (CHF), since it addresses the complex interplay of medical, psychological and
      behavioural factors facing these individuals. Structured exercise training within a cardiac
      rehabilitation programme is firmly recommended for these patients. However, it is
      questionable whether patients are achieving an adequate dose of exercise to provide optimal
      benefits. The essential components for setting optimal training include the appropriate mode,
      duration, frequency and intensity of exercise. UK surveys of cardiac rehabilitation describe
      the frequency and duration of training, but here is scant information on exercise intensity.
      However, it is apparent that randomised controlled trials of exercise training use doses more
      than 4 times greater than in UK current practice. The Eastbourne Exercise Cardiology Research
      Group has demonstrated that although patients benefit from improved quality of life and
      submaximal fitness after a hospital outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programme, they do not
      achieve the increases in important prognostic indicators reported by the majority of exercise
      training trials.

      The critical factor in terms of eliciting a sufficient training effect while minimising risk
      is the intensity of the exercise performed. It is now widely accepted that the traditional
      methods of using fixed percentages of maximal heart rate or oxygen uptake to set exercise
      intensity include serious errors. The European Society of Cardiology recommends that
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing should be used to provide an objective evaluation of the
      metabolic demand of exercise. This allows physiologically meaningful reference points to be
      established for aerobic exercise prescription and is the solution to defining safe and
      effective training intensities. The next step is to determine whether this information can be
      transferred to a practical cardiac rehabilitation environment to set and monitor exercise
      intensity

      Background Heart failure is a chronic, costly and life-threatening disorder that constitutes
      a significant burden for individuals and the National Health Service [There are 27,000 new
      cases reported per annum in the UK. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is recommended as the ideal
      comprehensive intervention since it addresses the complex interplay of medical, psychological
      and behavioural factors facing CHF patients and carers.

      Study Aim Primary objective to describe the exercise intensity, defined by oxygen uptake
      (VO2) in terms of the individual physiological thresholds, in CHF patients undergoing CR
      according to current guidelines Primary end point: VO2 Secondary objectives Secondary
      objectives of this study are:-

        1. To measure resting and exercising energy expenditure in order to a) establish the value
           of 1 MET (resting metabolic rate) for patients with CHF, and b) to establish the MET
           value (defined as multiples of resting metabolic rate) for exercises performed in CR
           sessions

        2. To measure affective responses (feeling very bad - feeling very good; levels of energy -
           tiredness and tension - calmness) to exercise during CR sessions

        3. To measure weekly physical activity level in CHF patients undergoing Phase III and IV
           CR.

      For the secondary analysis the following secondary end points and parameters will be
      established

        1. MET values, defined as multiples of resting oxygen uptake or resting metabolic rate (1
           MET), for different CR exercises

        2. Ratings of affective response on the Feelings Scale (FS) and ratings of perceived
           activation on the Felt Arousal Scale (FAS).

        3. Average daily activity over 7 day period in terms of steps per day and periods spent
           sitting, standing and walking
