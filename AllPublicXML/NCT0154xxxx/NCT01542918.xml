    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study, which means that the goal is to see if the study treatment is safe.
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Lenalidomide at different dose levels, and
      to test the safety of Lenalidomide alone or in combination with Rituximab (also known as
      Rituxan®).

      Rationale for the Proposed Study

      There is evidence that immunomodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide stimulate immune effectors
      such as natural killer (NK) cells, and thus promote rituximab efficacy via ADCC. Because of
      the evidence for synergy between rituximab and lenalidomide in NHL, patients who do not
      respond to lenalidomide monotherapy will receive combined intravenous plus intraventricular
      rituximab in addition to lenalidomide. To maximize delivery to the central nervous system
      (CNS), the investigators propose to administer rituximab via both intravenous and
      intraventricular routes. The rationale for intraventricular administration of rituximab is
      the demonstration that approximately 0.1% of systemically administered rituximab penetrates
      the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) but that intraventricular administration of rituximab is both
      feasible and achieves high concentrations that are associated with anti-lymphoma activity.
      This study will thus build upon the two Phase 1 trials of intraventricular rituximab that
      have been conducted at UCSF to define the safety of the intraventricular route of
      administration; this study will, however, be the first to evaluate the combination of
      intraventricular plus intravenous treatment.

      The rationale for intravenous administration of rituximab in recurrent CNS lymphoma is that
      the blood-brain-barrier is likely partially disrupted, particularly when there is
      lymphoma-associated contrast enhancement detectable on the MRI, and the fact that there is
      evidence for activity when rituximab is administered intravenously, both as monotherapy
      (Batchelor et al., 2011) and potentially in combination with chemotherapy.
