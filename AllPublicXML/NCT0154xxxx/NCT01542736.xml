    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the efficacy of the combination of reduced dose
      craniospinal radiation (reduced from standard of care dosing at 36 Gy to 24 Gy) with
      concurrent carboplatin and vincristine administration for metastatic classical histology
      medulloblastomas and high-risk supratentorial PNETs and metastatic PNETs.
