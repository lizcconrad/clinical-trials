      This project aims to investigate the efficacy of two models to treat Posttraumatic Stress
      Disorder (PTSD) for Cambodian refugees in primary care. The first step in both models is
      giving a medication, which is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin-norepinephrine
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI/SSRN), with paroxetine being the first-line agent. For those
      patients who still have PTSD, the second step is either another medication or a culturally
      sensitive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The investigators hypothesize that patients
      will improve in both models, but more so in the the CBT model.

      This project aims to investigate the efficacy of two models to treat PTSD for Cambodian
      refugees in primary care. The first step in both models is giving a medication (an SSRI/SSRN,
      e.g., paroxetine). For those who still have PTSD, the second step is either adding another
      medication (e.g., prazosin) or providing culturally sensitive cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT). We hypothesize that patients will improve in both models, but more so in the the CBT
      model. The primary outcome measure is PTSD severity as assessed by the PTSD Checklist (PCL).
      Eligibility requirements include having PTSD and having been old enough to remember the Khmer
      Rouge period.

      <pre_assignment_details>In Step 1 of the protocol, patients were given an SSRI/SSRN to determine eligibility for Step 2. If a patient still had PTSD (PCL &gt; 30) after Step I, the patient was assigned to an arm of Step 2, which was Medication or CBT augmentation. Of 114 patients started in Step I, 22 met criteria for entry to Step 2, the study proper, addressing study aims.</pre_assignment_details>
