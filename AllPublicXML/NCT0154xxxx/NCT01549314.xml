      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ivacaftor, a recently FDA-approved CFTR
      potentiator, improves bone micro-architecture and strength in patients with cystic fibrosis
      with at least one G551D CFTR mutation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, has recently been FDA approved for the treatment of cystic
      fibrosis in patients with at least one G551D CFTR mutation. Given the possible role of CFTR
      in bone, we hypothesize that this medication may also improve bone health in CF patients. The
      purpose of this study is to test this hypothesis using high resolution peripheral
      quantitative computed tomography, a research tool that measures bone micro-architecture and
      volumetric bone density and has the ability to detect small changes in bone that might
      otherwise be missed with standard bone imaging techniques such as bone density testing.
