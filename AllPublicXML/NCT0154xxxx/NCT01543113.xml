    <textblock>
      Background: Metastatic melanoma has a devastating prognosis and is one of the top causes of
      cancer death in young patients. Until now, available therapies were few and unreliable, but
      recent understanding of melanomas' molecular pathways has improve their classification and
      new clinical strategies have been proposed.

      Initial studies showed that B-Raf/N-Ras mutations (respectively V600E and Q61) are the most
      frequent alteration being present in 70 to 80% of melanomas, characterizing non Chronic
      Sun-induced Damage skins (CSD). These include Superficial Spreading Melanomas (SSM) and
      Nodular Melanomas (NM). Other studies showed that c-Kit mutations are presently the
      predominant activating mutation (20 - 40 %) in Acro-Lentiginous Melanomas (ALM), Mucous
      Melanomas (MM) and in melanomas arising on CSD skin. c-Kit mutation pattern is more complex
      with four exons being affected leading to different mutations, which incidence and biological
      impact are less documented.

      BRAF/NRAS genetics alterations drive constantly cell growth, being thus attractive targets.
      Spectacular results have indeed been obtained with the BRAF inhibitor that targets the V600E
      BRAF-mutated form. Data from GIST disease revealed that the different c-Kit mutations
      modulate differently c-Kit function and the response to targeted therapies.

      Because c-Kit targeted therapy is a critical clinical issue, the investigators aimed to
      identify the most frequent mutations present in our population to propose appropriate
      screening test and adapt the therapy.

      Methods: 250 melanoma samples corresponding to an homogeneous white-Caucasian population
      (Brittany, France) will be screened. c-Kit exons 11, 13, 17 and 18 will be sequenced (direct
      sequencing and pyrosequencing when possible). c-Kit copy number will be quantified by q-PCR
      and level of c-Kit determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC, CD117). Samples will also be
      analyzed for B-Raf mutations in codon 464, 466, 469 and 600, and for N-Ras mutations in codon
      12, 13 and 61 (Pyrosequencing).

      Expected Results:

      Taken together, the investigators anticipate that the present genetic analysis of the tumours
      from patients with advanced melanoma will first document the type and frequency of cKit
      mutations, will confirm or not that BRAF, NRAS and cKit mutations are mutually exclusive and
      document their repartition in the melanomas sub-types. Finally this study will clue
      researchers in to how well patients will respond to a therapy that targets the
      growth-promoting proteins BRAF/NRAS and cKIT.
