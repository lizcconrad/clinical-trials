    <textblock>
      This prospective study of 60 slides of basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin aims to
      determine whether:

        1. The process of cryofixation prior to generating formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE)
           H&amp;E sections alters the histology in skin tumor specimens.

        2. Which specific histologic parameters are altered between previously cryofixed versus
           routine FFPE sections. Histologic observations will be recorded by two
           dermatopathologists and two Mohs surgeons and statistically analyzed.

      Generating formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained
      permanent sections from previously cryofixed tissue is a common practice used to confirm
      diagnosis of frozen section histology. In dermatology, this practice can be used to examine
      Mohs layers and its debulk as well as routine nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) biopsies after
      initial histologic diagnosis with frozen sections. Even though freezing tissue can introduce
      histologic artifacts, there have been no studies documenting whether this occurs specifically
      in cryofixed tissues that are subsequently thawed for permanent FFPE H&amp;E histology. The
      purpose of our study is to determine whether the freeze-thaw process used to generate
      permanent sections after cryofixation introduces significantly detectable histologic
      differences compared to permanent sections that were not previously cryofixed. Thirty debulk
      specimens of basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas will be prospectively collected. Each
      specimen will be split so that half is processed as cryofixed permanents and the other half
      as noncryofixed permanents. The investigator will show each slide in random order to a group
      of four blinded participants (two dermatopathologists and two Mohs surgeons). Each
      participant must first rate the overall quality of histology. Then, each participant will
      rate each slide on the quality of cellular morphology, nuclear morphology, color and contrast
      of stains, intactness of specimen, and other miscellaneous artifacts. These data will then be
      analyzed for statistical significance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (age 18 or over) with a biopsy proven routine basal cell or squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin who are scheduled for treatment with the Mohs procedure by
             Dr. Christopher Miller at the University of Pennsylvania's Division of Dermatologic
             Surgery will be included. Both female and male patients will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas of more complex histopathology
             will be excluded from the study. Complex histopathology of a tumor is defined as
             features with aggressive, moderately to poorly differentiated, or unusual
             histopathology.
