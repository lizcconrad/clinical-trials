    <textblock>
      An prospective / retrospective multicenter observational study whose objectives are to
      understand the interactions between hepatitis c virus and Non Hodgkin lymphomas. The
      characteristics , evolution and treatment of diseases will be observed from the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Main objectives are:

        -  Description of the clinical and histological characteristics, treatment and evolution of
           these NHL.

        -  Study their physiopathology by immunological, virologic and molecular studies.

      The study included prospective or retrospective patients with B- Cell Non-Hodgkin lymphomas
      (NHL) associated with chronic hepatitis C. The patients are diagnosed or in remission of
      lymphoma, in relapse or failure of treatments.

      The enrolment period is 6 years and the total study lasts 8 years.

        -  &quot;Prospective patients&quot; are followed every 6 months during one year, and all the years
           during 2 or 5 years.

        -  &quot;Retropective patients&quot; are followed all the years during 2 or 5 years. At each
           follow-up, a blood sample of 50ml is withdrawn allowing ancillary studies.

      The enrollment is estimated at 140 patients.
