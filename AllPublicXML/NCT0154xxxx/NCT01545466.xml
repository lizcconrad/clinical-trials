  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal describes a randomized controlled pilot trial investigating feasibility,
      safety, and migraine frequency in patients with migraines who undergo an 8 week mindfulness
      based stress reduction (MBSR) program compared to a wait-list control group.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary research has shown MBSR to be effective in chronic pain syndromes and other
      mind/body interventions have shown good promise in the treatment of headaches. A randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) of yoga in migraine without aura patients by John and colleagues
      showed that yoga resulted in a significant decrease in headache frequency, pain index, and
      symptomatic medication usage compared to a self-care group. This RCT demonstrated that
      patients with headaches may benefit from a mind-body intervention. However, their yoga
      protocol was not specified, and participants were instructed to practice the technique only
      during the prodromal phase of a headache (prior to the pain becoming severe), so as an
      abortive intervention at the time of a headache. Thus, the investigators of this trial are
      proposing to evaluate the effect of MBSR on adults with migraines compared to an education
      control group. This study will add to the John study because, unlike many other mind-body
      interventions, MBSR offers the distinct advantage of a standardized protocol that has been
      used both clinically and in numerous research studies across a wide variety of conditions.
      Furthermore, MBSR teaches participants a daily practice that, if effective, could serve as a
      prophylactic intervention.
