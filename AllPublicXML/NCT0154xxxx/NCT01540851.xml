  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this research are to:

      Conduct a proof of concept randomized controlled trial with up to 300 patients undergoing
      primary total knee replacement (TKA) at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). The trial will
      compare a &quot;Care Navigator&quot; post-discharge intervention versus &quot;Usual Care&quot; post discharge
      management of patients undergoing TKA. The intervention will focus on the challenging process
      of transitions from the acute care hospital to inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation, and
      from inpatient rehabilitation to home.

      The principal goals of the trial are:

        1. To establish whether &quot;Care Navigator&quot; intervention improves functional outcomes as
           compared with the &quot;Usual Care&quot; treatment six months after TKA surgery.

        2. To establish whether &quot;Care Navigator&quot; intervention is cost effective six months after
           TKA surgery.

      The investigators hypothesize that:

        1. Incorporating the Care Navigator role into the &quot;Usual Care&quot; treatment will increase TKA
           patients' rate of adherence to the rehabilitation protocol and improve functional
           outcomes.

        2. Addition of a Care Navigator is cost-effective.

      The &quot;Post-TKA Care Navigator&quot; proof of concept intervention will be implemented as a
      randomized controlled trial. The investigators aim to identify and enroll a cohort of up to
      300 subjects who have decided to undergo total knee replacement (TKA) at BWH. Subjects will
      be patients of the five orthopedic surgeons at Brigham and Women's Hospital who perform the
      most TKAs: Drs. Wright, Brick, Ready, Martin and Thornhill. Subjects will be followed from
      about two weeks prior to the operation to six months after discharge.

      The investigators will assign patients into two groups, at random: 1) receiving current
      standard of post-operative care and 2) adding &quot;Post-TKA Care Navigator&quot;. The role of the Care
      Navigator will be to follow up with patients via frequent telephone conversations, ranging
      from weekly during the first month to bi-weekly for the next 6 weeks to monthly by the 14th
      week post op. subjects assigned to the care navigator will receive up to 10 telephone calls
      over a period of 5 months. The goal of the Care Navigator would be to ensure or encourage
      compliance with physical therapy, triage patient concerns, questions and complaints, and
      identify those patients that require a call from a clinician to address a problem in the
      recovery process. For those issues that can be resolved easily at home the navigator would
      suggest strategies. The value of the post-TKA Care Navigator will be assessed by comparing
      functional status, satisfaction with surgery, utilization of health care, adherence to
      physical therapy, range of knee motion and intervention costs across the two randomized
      groups.
