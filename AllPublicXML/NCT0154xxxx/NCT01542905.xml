  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine clinical and neuropsychiatric effects of Korean Red
      Ginseng and examine changes in brain structure, function and metabolites. A total of 60
      healthy volunteers will be recruited and will be assigned to either Korean Red Ginseng group
      or placebo group. Individuals will be examined through clinical assessment,
      neuropsychological function tests and neuroimaging.
