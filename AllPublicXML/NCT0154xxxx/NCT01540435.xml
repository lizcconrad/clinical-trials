      This randomized, controlled, multicenter, non-comparative phase II trial compares an
      intensified perioperative treatment of patients with resectable synchronous or metachronous
      colorectal liver metastases to primary surgery and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrence rates after R0-resection of colorectal liver metastases are still very high (about
      60-70 %). Therefore, multidisciplinary treatment of these patients is frequently used in
      order to achieve a beneficial impact regarding progression-free and overall survival. The
      point in time of treatment, pre- and/or postoperative, is still a matter of debate. In the
      EORTC 40983 trial, perioperative chemotherapy with 5-Fluorouracil and oxaliplatin
      (FOLFOX-Regimen) displayed a non-significant benefit in 3 year disease free survival in the
      intent to treat population (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.02) (Nordlinger, Sorbye et al. 2008).
      The combined analysis of two adjuvant trials, with a (non-contemporary) 5-FU Bolus regimen,
      showed a non-significant prolongation of median disease free survival (DFS) from 18.8 to 27.9
      months (p=0.058) and OS from 47.3 to 62.2 months (p=0.095) (Mitry, Fields et al. 2008).
      However, postoperative treatment with 6 months of FOLFOX is often used in daily practise.
      Thus, further investigation is urgently warranted.

      This phase II trial evaluates two strategies with intensified perioperative or postoperative
      treatment regimens. Current studies established the role of the FOLFOXIRI regimen in the
      metastatic setting (Falcone, Ricci et al. 2007). A further intensification of a three drug
      regimen with bevacizumab seem to be feasible yielding response rates up to 84% and a disease
      control rate up to 100% (Falcone 2008; Bruera, Santomaggio et al. 2010; Masi, Loupakis et al.
      2010). Regarding the efficacy, evaluation of FOLFOXIRI and bevacizumab in preoperative
      treatment for resectable CLM seems to be promising. Postoperative treatment with FOLFOX for 6
      months was chosen for arm A.

             weeks before randomization. Or in case of synchronous disease with intact primary; the
             primary tumor have to be R0 resectable together with the liver metastases and the
             patient has a non-obstructive primary tumor and is able to receive preoperative
             chemotherapy before surgery. Synchronous rectal primary is not allowed.
