  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to determine whether there is a difference in the physiological
      effects of theobromine when provided via a single serving compared to multiple servings
      adding up to the same amount of theobromine provided on a day.

      This study also aims to study the pharmacokinetics of theobromine after administration once
      per day versus administration 4 times per day.

      Hypothesis: the effects on heart rate are less pronounced when a high dose of theobromine is
      given in 4 smaller doses.
