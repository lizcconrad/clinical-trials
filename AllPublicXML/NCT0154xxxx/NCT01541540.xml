  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed clinical trial, REACH, will enroll 538 persons with hypertension. All subjects
      will continue with their prescribed medications. Our main objective is to assess whether
      preventive e-counseling (provided through a website of the Heart and Stroke Foundation)
      improves blood pressure and cardiovascular risk status over a 12-month interval. REACH will
      also evaluate improvement in lifestyle behaviors that include diet, exercise, smoking, and
      adherence to prescribed medications. Finally, we will quantify the amount of e-counseling
      support that is required during REACH to evoke a significant reduction in blood pressure. It
      is hypothesized that e-Counseling (vs. Control) will significantly improve blood pressure and
      lifestyle behaviours at the 12-month assessment. The findings of this trial will provide
      information that is critical to our understanding of how internet-based programs can help to
      improve blood pressure and to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease.

Each email will contain an e-link to lifestyle counseling activities designed to enhance motivation and skill to initiate and maintain lifestyle change. e-Counseling includes video-based education and counseling as well as e-tools to self-monitor and reinforce adherence to self-management behavior for exercise, diet, prescribed medications and smoke-free living.</description>
