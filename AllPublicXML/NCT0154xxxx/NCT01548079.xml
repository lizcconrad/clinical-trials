  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an open-label trial, 20 otherwise healthy morbidly obese patients scheduled for bariatric
      surgery will be administered 20 mg/kg/day ursodeoxycholic acid for three weeks until the day
      before surgery. The maximum dose will be 3 g/day. Twenty other patients will serve as
      controls. Serum from days 1 and 21 will be analyzed for routine liver tests, bile acids, a
      complete lipid profile including FA and in addition for 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and
      fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19), markers for bile acid synthesis its intestinal
      stimulation. For the evaluation of insulin resistance and possible pre-diabetes, plasma will
      be taken for the estimation of homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index and oral glucose
      tolerance test (OGTT) will be performed at days 1 and 21. At surgery, a liver biopsy (0.5-1
      g) and a white adipose tissue (WAT) specimen (1 cm2) will be taken and immediately frozen in
      liquid nitrogen for messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein preparation for
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western analysis, respectively,
      histopathological Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) grading, and measuring of hepatic
      and white adipose tissue (WAT) lipase activity. In all patients at randomization, abdominal
      ultrasound will be performed for the detection of NAFLD and gallstones and a blood sample
      will be taken for the analysis of polymorphisms of hepatic lipid synthesis, storage, fatty
      acid (FA) oxidation and export genes. Six month after operation, HOMA, OGTT and abdominal
      ultrasound will be repeated.

    <description>Trial objectives are to determine whether (i) Hepatic and/or visceral white adipose tissue (WAT) lipase activity determines fatty acid (FA) release/balance from lipid triglyceride (TG) droplets and FA-mediated lipotoxicity in NAFLD; differences in hepatic and/or WAT activity could explain individual susceptibility to pure NAFL versus NASH (ii) UDCA (20 mg/kg/day) improves insulin resistance in patients with NAFLD (iii) UDCA improves hepatobiliary transporter expression in NAFLD</description>
