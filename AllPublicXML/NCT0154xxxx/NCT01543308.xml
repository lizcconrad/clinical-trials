  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The protein composition of HDL is complicated. The investigators have identified 40 distinct
      proteins associated with HDL by proteomics technology, and these proteins have been confirmed
      to be related to the function of anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, improvement of
      endothelial function, inhibition of thrombosis and so on. And the investigators also found
      that the levels of some proteins in HDL changed in patients with coronary heart disease,
      compared with the healthy control group.

      So, this study is to conduct in the two following aspects: enlarge the sample size to verify
      the preliminary results to find new research ideas of pathogenesis and biomarkers for
      coronary heart disease; and study the changes of HDL protein composition in patients with
      coronary heart disease before and after statins treatment using proteomics technology in
      order to find the mechanism of statins pleiotropic effects and indicators for evaluating the
      treatment effectiveness.
