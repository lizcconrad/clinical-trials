  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominoplasty is one of the most commonly performed procedures in plastic surgery. The
      appearance of the scar is a major factor contributing to the aesthetic outcome of the
      procedure and depends largely on the technique of wound closure. The investigators routinely
      used resorbable subcutaneous sutures and resorbable intracutaneous sutures for this closure.
      To overcome the potential detrimental effects of sutures in skin closure, surgical adhesives
      were introduced as a new technology. The new PrineoTM wound closure system was created to
      combine the effectiveness of 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate (Dermabond TM) together with a
      self-adhering mesh to make closure of long skin incisions even more safe and reliable.
      PrineoTM has the potential to offer a patient several benefits over traditional wound closure
      with sutures.A patient treated with Prineoâ„¢ can shower immediately following a procedure
      because the product forms a watertight barrier over the incision. PrineoTM can be easily
      removed, often with less pain than is sometimes associated with suture removal, after the
      natural wound healing process is complete (approximately 12 to 25 days). Other benefits are
      that it forms a microbial barrier and provides even distribution of tension across the length
      of the incision to ensure wound edge approximation throughout the wound healing process.
      Furthermore, it reduces subcuticular closure time as compared to subcuticular suturing.

      However, these potential advantages have not been proven until now, as the methods used to
      assess the aesthetic outcome were not reproducible in most assessments, and none of these
      studies assessed patient satisfaction.1-3 Moreover, none was performed in a plastic surgical
      patient population. For these reasons, the investigators prospectively studied the results of
      wound closure after abdominoplasty with randomized use of PrineoTM and conventional suturing
      to assess the possible difference in outcome between these two methods.

      Abdominoplasty is one of the most commonly performed procedures in plastic surgery. The
      appearance of the scar is a major factor contributing to the aesthetic outcome of the
      procedure and depends largely on the technique of wound closure. The new PrineoTM wound
      closure system was introduced to combine the effectiveness of 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate
      (Dermabond TM) together with a self-adhering mesh.Fifty-two women and 8 men aged between 21
      and 65 years scheduled for abdominoplasty were included in the study. Two weeks
      postoperatively, the wounds were examined and graded according to the Hollander Cosmesis
      Scale. At 3- and 6-month follow-up, the aesthetic outcome of the abdominal scar was evaluated
      with the Vancouver Scar Scale. Six months postoperatively, the patients were further asked to
      score their part of the Patient Scar Assessment Scale.The Hollander Cosmesis Scale indicated
      a significantly more favourable overall result with PrineoTM at 2 weeks after surgery. The
      Vancouver Scar Scale demonstrated a better cosmetic outcome in favour of PrineoTM 3 and 6
      months after surgery The Patient Scar Assessment Scale scores 6 months after surgery
      indicated that the patients noted significantly less pain, thickness and irregularity with
      PrineoTM.Based on the investigators results, the investigators conclude that PrineoTM is a
      safe and effective substitute for superficial skin closure, with good cosmetic results and no
      increase in wound complications. The use of PrineoTM decreases operative times and enhances
      patients' postoperative comfort
