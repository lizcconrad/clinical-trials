  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the ongoing efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability of an additional 212 weeks of treatment with eteplirsen injection in Duchenne
      muscular dystrophy (DMD) subjects who have successfully completed the 28 week eteplirsen
      study: Study 4658-us-201. This study will also evaluate the correlation between biomarkers
      for DMD and the clinical status of participating DMD subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multiple dose extension study to assess the ongoing efficacy, safety,
      and tolerability of weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of eteplirsen in DMD subjects who have
      successfully completed Study 4658-us 201.

      Subjects will have the opportunity to enroll in this study during the last visit of Study
      4658-us-201 (Week 28). Eligible subjects will receive once weekly IV infusions of eteplirsen
      (50 or 30 mg/kg) for an additional 212 weeks. Subjects will receive the same dose of
      eteplirsen they received in Study 4658-us-201. Subjects will thereafter continue to receive
      once weekly IV infusions of eteplirsen for up to an additional 72 week period (through week
      284). If commercial eteplirsen becomes available during this additional 72 week period,
      participation in the study will be discontinued as subjects transition to commercial
      eteplirsen.

      Safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK), and biomarker assessments will be performed at
      scheduled visits; adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications and therapies will be
      continuously monitored.

      If review of data from this open label study suggests that continued treatment with
      eteplirsen is warranted, this study may be extended by protocol amendment or subjects who
      successfully complete this study may have the opportunity to participate in a separate follow
      on, open label eteplirsen study.
