  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-randomized, multi-center, open-label study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics and
      the safety and tolerability of danoprevir (RO5190591) and ritonavir in healthy volunteers and
      patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Participants will be administered
      repeated daily doses of danoprevir and ritonavir. The anticipated time on study treatment is
      10 days.
