  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the aetiology of postpartum uterine atony, hypoxia is considered an important factor
      although some suggest that peripheral oxygen saturation is not influenced by oxygen
      inhalation in women during the first and second stages of labor. Enhancing oxygen delivery to
      myometrium through additional inhaled oxygen may improve uterine contractions. Therefore, it
      is reasonable to consider that oxygen inhalation may promote myometrial contraction and
      prevent postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) due to uterine atony. The tendency for the uterus to
      relax in women encountering respiratory problems immediately after cesarean section under
      general anaesthesia further strengthened this theory.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of oxygen inhalation immediately
      after vaginal delivery on blood loss. The investigators hypothesized that inhaled oxygen
      helps to maintain uterine retraction during immediate postpartum period and hence reduces
      vaginal blood loss.

    <time_frame>two hours</time_frame>
    <description>The volume of blood loss was measured by weighing a sheet soaked from the end of the delivery to 2h after birth. Because it is important to collect the blood accurately, we used a specially designed operating sheet and an electronic scale to weigh all the material (with a 1 g deviation range). The quantity of blood (ml) = (weight of used materials - weight of materials prior to use)/1.05. Hemoglobin concentration was estimated on admission and 24 h after delivery</description>
