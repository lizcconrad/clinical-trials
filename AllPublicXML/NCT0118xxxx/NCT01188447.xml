    <textblock>
      The goal of this cohort study is to evaluate the safety and potential impact of an active
      strategy that allows paramedics to assess very low-risk trauma patients with the Canadian
      C-Spine Rule (CCR) and transport them to the Emergency Department without immobilization. The
      specific objectives of the study are to determine safety, determine the clinical impact and
      evaluate performance.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  consecutive alert, stable adults evaluated by the paramedics with potential c-spine
             injury after sustaining acute blunt trauma. Patient eligibility will be determined at
             the time of paramedic arrival at the scene based on the following criteria:

          -  &quot;Potential c-spine injury after sustaining acute blunt trauma&quot; will include patients
             with either:

               -  neck pain with any mechanism of injury (subjective complaint by the patient of
                  any pain in the posterior aspect of the neck),

               -  no neck pain but some visible injury above the clavicles, and/or

               -  neither neck pain nor visible injury, but significant mechanism of injury as
                  determined by the paramedic at the scene.

          -  &quot;Alert&quot; is defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 (converses, fully oriented, and
             follows commands).

          -  &quot;Stable&quot; refers to normal vital signs(systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or greater and
             respiratory rate between 10 and 24 breaths per minute).

          -  &quot;Acute&quot; refers to injury within the past 4 hours.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under the age of 16 years,

          -  Patients with penetrating trauma from stabbing or gunshot wound,

          -  Patients with acute paralysis (paraplegia, quadriplegia),

          -  Patients with known vertebral disease (ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis,
             spinal stenosis, or previous cervical spine surgery), or

          -  Patients referred from another hospital and transported between facilities.
