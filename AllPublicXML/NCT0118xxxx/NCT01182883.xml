  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - IMC-A12 is an experimental substance designed to inhibit a protein called Type I
      Insulin-Like Growth Factor Receptor (IGF-1R), which can be found on cancer cells and can
      promote cancer growth. Temsirolimus is a drug that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has
      approved to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma in adults. Researchers do not know if the
      combination of IMC-A12 and temsirolimus will work in children, but want to determine whether
      these two drugs may be an effective treatment for recurrent tumors.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety and effectiveness of IMC-A12 and temsirolimus in treating
           children and adolescents with solid tumors.

        -  To determine possible side effects of the combination of IMC-A12 and temsirolimus.

      Eligibility:

      - Children and adolescents between 12 months and 21 years of age who have solid tumors that
      have not responded to or have relapsed after standard treatment.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and imaging
           studies.

        -  Participants will receive IMC-A12 and temsirolimus in 28-day cycles of treatment.
           IMC-A12 will be given as an infusion over 1 hour, once a week, for 4 weeks. Temsirolimus
           will also be given after IMC-A12 over 30 minutes, once a week, for 4 weeks.

        -  Participants may continue to receive IMC-A12 and temsirolimus for up to 2 years unless
           serious side effects develop or the treatment stops being effective.

        -  Participants will have additional physical exams, blood and urine tests, and imaging
           studies regularly during each treatment cycle.

        -  Participants will be followed at regular intervals after the end of the study to collect
           tumor response and progression data....

      Background

        -  IMC-A12 is a fully recombinant IgG1monoclonal antibody to the insulin-like growth factor
           receptor (IGFR). It acts as an antagonist of IGF-1 and IGF-2 ligand binding and blocks
           ligand binding to IGF-1R and inhibits downstream signaling of the two major insulin-like
           growth factor pathways: MAPK and PI3K/AKT.

        -  Temsirolimus is a small molecule inhibitor of mTOR, which like rapamycin and everolimus
           forms a complex with FK506-binding protein (FKBP)12 and mTOR, inhibiting mTOR and
           leading to anti-proliferative effects, including G1 phase cell cycle arrest and
           apoptosis.

        -  Inhibition of mTOR signaling leads to upregulation of IGF-1R signaling which leads to
           activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Pediatric pre-clinical models have demonstrated
           synergistic anti-tumor effects combining IGF-1R antibodies and mTOR inhibitors.

      Objectives

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose of IMC-A12
           (anti-insulin growth factor-1 receptor monoclonal antibody) administered as an
           intravenous infusion once weekly in combination with temsirolimus administered
           intravenously once weekly to children with refractory solid tumors.

        -  To define the toxicities of the combination regimen and characterize the
           pharmacokinetics of IMC-A12 in combination with temsirolimus in this patient population.

        -  Secondary objectives include defining in a preliminary fashion antitumor activity,
           assessing biologic activity of IMC-A12 and temsirolimus and assessing the incidence of
           IGFR expression and mTOR pathway activation in recurrent or refractory solid tumors of
           childhood.

      Eligibility

        -  Patients &gt; 12 months and less than or equal to 21 years of age with a diagnosis and
           histologic verification (except patients with intrinsic brain stem tumors, optic pathway
           gliomas or pineal tumors and elevations of serum or CSF alpha-fetoprotein or beta-HCG)
           of measureable or evaluable relapsed or refractory solid tumors. Current disease state
           must be one for which there is no known curative therapy, or therapy proven to prolong
           survival.

        -  Must have fully recovered from acute toxic effects from all prior therapy, which has
           been completed within the specified prior time frame.

        -  Have adequate organ function as determined by laboratory evaluation including normal
           random or fasting blood glucose within the upper normal limits for age and grade &lt; 2
           serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

        -  Subjects with uncontrolled infection, known type I or type II diabetes mellitus, known
           bone marrow involvement or who have received prior monoclonal antibody therapy targeting
           IGF-1R or temsirolimus are not eligible.

      Design

        -  This is a phase I study of IMC-A12 administered every 7 days as a 1-hour intravenous
           infusion at a starting dose of 6 mg/kg. Temsirolimus will be administered intravenously
           over 30 minutes immediately after IMC-A12 on a once weekly schedule, at a starting dose
           of 15 mg/m(2).

        -  One cycle of therapy is considered to be 28 days. Therapy may continue for up to 2 years
           in the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  All patients will have required trough blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of
           IMC-A12 and temsirolimus and immunogenicity studies collected at the same time as select
           routine safety labs. Optional participation in additional pharmacokinetic studies and
           correlative biology studies will be offered.
