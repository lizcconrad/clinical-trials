  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the combination of
      3F8 and GM-CSF has on the patient and the cancer.

      Antibodies are made by the body to attack tumors and to fight infections. 3F8 is the name of
      one kind of antibody. It is made by mice, and it can attack neuroblastoma in people. 3F8 has
      been used safely in many patients, and it has killed cancer cells in some patients. One way
      it can kill cancer cells is by causing the patient's own white blood cells to attack the
      cancer. Granulocytes are one kind of white blood cell. GM-CSF increases the number of
      granulocytes in people, and it makes the granulocytes better able to kill the cancer cells.

    <description>This phase II, open-label, single arm trial assesses the anti-NB activity of high-dose 3F8 (80 mg/m2/day), which is used in cycles 1-2, with return to standard 3F8 dosage (20 mg/m2/day) in subsequent cycles. Clinical results will be compared to those in the predecessor trials which used only the standard 3F8 dosage. Starting with A(8), patients no longer receive high dose 3F8 but receive only standard dose 3F8 (20mg/m2/day) for all cycles.</description>

    <description>3F8 is dosed at 80 mg/m2/day (cycles 1-2) or 20 mg/m2/day (cycles 3 and beyond) and infused iv over 30-90 minutes. 13-cis-retinoic acid is dosed at 160 mg/m2/day, divided into two doses, x14 days. If a dose is missed, it can be made up at the end of the cycle. It is not taken on same days as 3F8. *High-dose 3F8 will be administered only for patients enrolled on protocol from A(0) to A(7). Starting with A(8), patients receive standard dose (20mg/m2/day) during cycles 1 and 2.</description>
