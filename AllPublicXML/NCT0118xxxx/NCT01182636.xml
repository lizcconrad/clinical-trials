      The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the test formulation
      of adapalene gel 0.1% (PLIVA Research &amp; Development Ltd.) as compared to the already marketed
      formulation, Differin® (adapalene 0.1%) topical gel (Galderma Laboratories) in patients with
      acne vulgaris.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female, 12-40 years of age inclusive.

          -  Signed informed consent form, which meets all the criteria of the current FDA
             regulations. For patients under the age of majority in the state they are enrolled,
             the patient's parent or legal guardian will be required to sign the consent form and
             the patient will sign an IRB approved &quot;assent to participate&quot; form.

          -  If female and of child bearing potential, prepare to abstain from sexual intercourse
             or use reliable method of contraception during the study (i.e. condom, Intrauterine
             device, hormonal contraceptives). Patients on hormonal contraceptives must have been
             on the same hormonal contraceptive for 3 months prior to the baseline visit and
             continue throughout the duration of the study.

          -  Have moderate to severe facial acne as defines as: at least 20 but no more that 60
             facial inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) and at least 25 but no more than
             100 non-inflamed lesions (open and closed comedones) and have a Physician's Global
             Assessment score of 3, 4, or 5.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has more than 2 facial nodular lesions, any nodules present will be documented
             but will not be included in the inflammatory lesion count.

          -  Patient has active cystic acne.

          -  Patient has acne conglobate.

          -  Patient with significant facial hair such as beards or tattoos or excessive facial
             scarring that, in the Investigator's opinion, may interfere with the evaluation of the
             patient's acne.

          -  Patients with facial sunburn.

          -  Any dermatological condition other than acne vulgaris that, in the Investigator's
             opinion, may interfere with the evaluation of the patient's acne (e.g. rosacea,
             psoriasis, dermatitis).

          -  Females who are pregnant, lactating, or likely to become pregnant during the study.

          -  History of allergy or sensitivity to adapalene or other retinoids, or history of any
             drug hypersensitivity or intolerance which, in the Investigator's opinion, would
             compromise the safety of the patient or the study.

          -  Significant history or current evidence of chronic infectious disease, system
             disorder, organ disorder, or other medical condition that, in the Investigator's
             opinion, would place the study participant at undue risk by participation.

          -  Use of any topical antibiotics, topical steroids, or topical anti-inflammatory
             products used on the face, any oral antibiotics known to treat acne, any systemic
             steroids, or any systemic anti-inflammatory agents (other than the use of
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents) within 28 days of the first dosing day.

          -  Use of oral isotretinoin (Accutane®) within 6 months. Use of topical tretinoin
             (Retin-A®), adapalene (Differin®), tazarotene (Tazorac®), or azelaic acid (Azelex®)
             within 28 days of the first dosing day.

          -  Receipt of any drug as part of a research study within 30 days prior to dosing.

          -  Female patients who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on the same type
             and strength of hormonal contraceptive for at least 3 months prior to enrollment in
             the study and throughout the duration of the study.

          -  Patients should not use any medicated facial products (soaps, lotions, moisturizers,
             etc.) or other medicated facial cleansing agents for 14 days prior to study
             enrollment.

          -  Previous participation in this study.
