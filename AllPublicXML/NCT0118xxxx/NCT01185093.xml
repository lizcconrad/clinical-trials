      The main objectives of the study is to

        -  Evaluate the knowledge acquisition and retention of 4th-grade students who participate
           in the St. Jude Cancer Education for Children Program

        -  To examine the relationship between outcome measures (knowledge acquisition and
           knowledge retention) with covariates of interest such as self-reported age and gender

        -  To compare the knowledge scores among schools and identify the schools that may show
           better improvement than others and factors associated with improvement

      The subjects in this research study will be current 4th-grade students at elementary schools
      in Memphis, Tennessee who choose to participate in the Program. These participants are not
      patients of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The Program will be implemented over a
      three-day period. Each student will attend two presentations and six hands-on activities led
      by St. Jude faculty and research staff on topics within their expertise, such as cells and
      cancer, and healthy living. Printed materials to be distributed as part of the St. Jude
      Cancer Education for Children Program have been developed by a multi-disciplinary team of St.
      Jude employees and local educators and reviewed by national experts for scientific accuracy
      and appropriate readability. Material includes three illustrated children's books, a
      laboratory manual, and activity sheets.

      One pre- and two post-tests will be administered by designated school teachers. The tests
      consist of 10 multiple-choice questions per each of three modules(cells, cancer, and healthy
      living), validated by a group of experts for readability and content relevance. Knowledge
      acquisition will be assessed by taking the differences from first post-test to pre-test
      scores, obtained from 10 questions on each component of the intervention, and using
      one-sample signed rank test to evaluate the improvement in the knowledge scores. A similar
      analysis will be undertaken by taking the differences from the 2nd post-evaluation to the 1st
      post-evaluation for each participant to assess knowledge retention.

    <description>Each participant will attend two presentations and six hands-on activities led by St. Jude faculty and research staff on topics within their expertise, such as cells and cancer, and healthy living. The pre-test will take place within 7±1 days before the program presentations and before students receive copies of the printed material. Two post-tests will take place. The first post-test will be administered within 7±1 days after the final scheduled program presentation and will be a measure of knowledge acquisition. The second post-test will take place 90±7 days post-intervention and will be a measure of knowledge retention.</description>

        A convenience sample of schools that agree to participate in the St. Jude Cancer Education
        for Children Program. 2-3 public schools and 2-3 private schools will be selected in order
        to achieve a fair representation of the Mid-South area. Based on average class sizes, this
        study expects to enroll at least 200 public school students and about 100 private school
        students.
