      Background:

        -  The hepatitis B vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective in preventing
           transmission of the hepatitis B virus. Response rates to the initial three doses of the
           vaccine are high, with significant or even complete immune response. However, this level
           has been reported to decline rapidly within the first year and more slowly thereafter.
           There is little data on the durability and long-term protection provided by the
           hepatitis B vaccine administered to adults in the United States.

        -  Vaccinated individuals are believed to be protected against hepatitis B virus infection
           because of a memory immune response. Even if antibody levels are low, the immune system
           will still be able to produce enough antibody to neutralize the hepatitis B virus.
           Therefore, booster doses of the vaccine are not recommended, except for some high-risk
           individuals such as patients on dialysis. Researchers are interested in determining the
           durability of the immune response of the hepatitis B vaccine in adults with low or
           intermediate risk for hepatitis B virus infection.

      Objectives:

      - To examine the long-term immune status of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and
      negative individuals who received the hepatitis B vaccine during adulthood, compared with the
      immune status of individuals who acquired natural immunity by recovering from acute hepatitis
      B during adulthood.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who were vaccinated against hepatitis B at least 10
           years ago.

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who contracted and recovered from acute hepatitis B
           at least 10 years ago.

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have well-controlled HIV and were vaccinated
           against hepatitis B at least 10 years ago.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have a single outpatient study visit and potential follow-up visits as
           part of this protocol.

        -  Participants will complete a questionnaire assessing possible risk factors for hepatitis
           B infection, and will provide blood samples to test for hepatitis B antibodies and other
           immune system studies.

        -  Participants will receive a letter or phone call with the results of the blood tests:

        -  Those who no longer have protective levels of antibody against the hepatitis B virus
           will be offered a booster dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. To monitor immune response to
           the booster vaccine, additional study visits will be scheduled at 1 and 3 weeks
           following the booster.

        -  Those who have chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus will be advised to follow up
           with their primary care physician, and may be eligible to participate in ongoing
           treatment trials for chronic hepatitis B.

        -  Those who have abnormal blood tests will be referred back to their primary care
           physician for investigation of the abnormal tests results, and may also be referred to
           other National Institutes of Health protocols.

        -  Additional tests will evaluate immune response to the measles, mumps, and rubella
           (German measles) viruses. Some participants may be advised to have an additional MMR
           vaccine through their primary care physician.

      Hepatitis B vaccine is very effective at preventing infection with the hepatitis B virus
      (HBV). Several studies have reported on the long-term efficacy of the HBV vaccine and
      indicate a decline in titers of antibody against hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) over
      time. However, most of these studies were performed in persons vaccinated as infants or
      children. This protocol is designed to examine the long-term immune status of HIV positive
      and negative individuals who were vaccinated during adulthood, and to compare it to the
      immune status of individuals who acquired natural immunity by recovering from acute hepatitis
      B during adulthood. Individuals who lost the vaccine-induced humoral immune response, will be
      offered a booster vaccination and their immune response to the booster vaccination will be
      assessed. In this study, we will recruit 150 subjects who were vaccinated secondary to their
      job-related risk of acquiring HBV infection. An additional 50 subjects who had spontaneously
      recovered from acute hepatitis B (Bullet) 10 years ago, 50 patients with well-compensated HIV
      infection who received HBV vaccine (Bullet) 10 years ago and 10 subjects who were never
      vaccinated and never infected with the hepatitis B virus will be enrolled as comparison
      groups. All subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess their HBV exposure
      risk as well as factors that may affect their immune response. Immunological assays include
      the quantitation of HBV-specific antibodies and the qualitative and quantitative assessment
      of HBV-specific memory B cells and T cells at the indicated time intervals after vaccination
      or after recovery from acute hepatitis B. Additional immunological assays include testing for
      antibody to measles, mumps and rubella (German measles) viruses to compare the longevity of
      antibody response to these vaccines or natural infection to the antibody response to the
      hepatitis B vaccine or natural infection. The results of this study will help to answer the
      question whether a booster vaccination is required and at which time after the primary
      vaccination course it should be considered.
