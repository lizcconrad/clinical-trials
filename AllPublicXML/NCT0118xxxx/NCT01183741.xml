  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of the Sotera ViSi, an investigational
      device, to auscultation (measurement with a cuff) in determining systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure (BP) in adult subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center blinded study that will enroll approximately 150 adult
      subjects. Trained auscultators will perform the standard auscultation BP measurements. They
      will be blinded to each other's measurements and from the ViSi measurements.

      The study population will be randomized into two groups based on the side of the blood
      pressure measurement: the left arm group (LAG) and the right arm group (RAG).

      The randomization ratio of the LAG and RAG will be 1:1. There will be forced stratification
      in order to ensure that the study subjects meet the required arm circumference and blood
      pressure distributions as specified in the SP10:2008 and ISO 81060-2:2009(E) standards.

        Eligible subjects are adults of any ethnic background who consent to spot-check blood
        pressure measurements and in whom paired blood pressure measurements with the ViSi will be
        feasible during a single visit. Subjects need to be greater than 12 years of age on the
        date of measurement and need to meet all the other inclusion and exclusion criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is greater than 12 years of age at the time of screening.

          -  Subject's upper arm circumference is between 20cm and 55cm.

          -  Subject is willing to undergo the Informed Consent process prior to enrollment in the
             study.

          -  Subject is willing and able to participate for up to 60 minutes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is participating in another clinical study that may interfere with the results
             of this study.

          -  Subject is unable to have a blood pressure measurement taken from either arm for any
             reason.

          -  Subject is evaluated by the Investigator and found to be medically unsuitable for
             participation in this study.
