  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After treatment for Hodgkin disease, secondary cancer, in particular breast cancer induced by
      treatment, are the first cause of death.

      The investigators will estimate the risk to develop breast cancer in this population of women
      treated for hodgkin disease, and will propose women at high rish to participate in an
      intensive screening program based on an annual detection based on mammography, echography,
      and RMI.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>efficacy of the screening</measure>
    <time_frame>15 years</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of the screening will be evaluated by the rate of early stage breast cancer detected. The rate of in situ, &lt; 10 mm(T1b), and N0 will be estimated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>interest</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of interest is the % of women at high risk who will accept the intensive screening</description>

    <measure>adhesion</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>15 years</time_frame>
    <description>The compliance will be evaluated yearly. The number of exam realised compared to the theoric number and the time between 2 exams will be estimated.</description>
