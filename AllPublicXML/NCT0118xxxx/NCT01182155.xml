    <textblock>
      Patients treated with radiation therapy for lung tumors can experience inflammation after
      treatment. This study hopes to evaluate the use of breath analysis to evaluate changes in the
      composition of exhaled breath in patients undergoing radiotherapy. If changes can be
      detected, this may ultimately serve as biomarkers for identifying patients at highest risk
      for radiation-induced lung injury (radiation pneumonitis).
