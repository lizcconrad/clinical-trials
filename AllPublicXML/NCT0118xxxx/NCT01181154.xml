      The hypothesis based on retrospective data is that, the rate of overall response-rate (PR +
      CR) at 1 year will be much higher in the rituximab arm (80%) than in the placebo arm
      (20%).Thirty four patients (17 in each arm) will be include (amendment n°6 - 15/10/2013) over
      a 3 year period (amendment n°3 - 11/12/2012).

      The primary aim of the study is to assess the efficacy (overall response rate at 1 year) of
      rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) in AIHA due to warm autoantibody when
      administered at the initial phase of the disease. All eligible patents with a newly diagnosed
      AIHA (within 6 weeks after diagnosis) will be treated by corticosteroids at standard dose
      (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) and will be randomized into 2 arms: Rituximab or placebo 1000 mg on
      days 1 and 15 in a 1/1 ratio. As soon as at least a partial remission (PR) of AIHA will be
      achieved, the daily dose of prednisone will be tapered following the rules provided by the
      protocol.
