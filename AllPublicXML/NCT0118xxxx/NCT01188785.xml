      Phase 0 - Open label, Single dose study of siG12D LODER in Patients with operable
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

      The primary endpoint:

      To assess efficacy and local distribution of siRNA out of eight high dose siG12D LODERs in
      patients diagnosed with operable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

      The Secondary endpoint:

      Short term tolerability and safety assessment

      Phase I - This study is designed to investigate the safety of siG12D LODER (Local Drug
      EluteR) in patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

      The primary endpoint:

      To asses efficacy of siG12D LODER and local distribution in non-operable patients by
      histopathology measurements, local distribution by RNA analysis.

      To define the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT)

      The Secondary endpoint

        1. To determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D)

        2. To define and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)

        3. In the event of surgery, assessment of siG12D LODER local distribution and efficacy will
           be based on histopathology measurements and RNA analysis.

        4. Progression free survival - only by long term follow-up

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigational agent siG12D LODER (Local Drug EluteR) is a miniature biodegradable
      polymeric matrix that encompasses anti KRASG12D siRNA (siG12D) drug, designed to release the
      drug regionally within a pancreatic tumor, at a prolonged rate of 12-16 weeks.

      The majority of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas involve mutations in the KRAS oncogene (the
      most common is G12D), therefore stable administration of KRASG12D siRNA has the potential to
      silence and lead to apoptosis of such cancer cells and thereby slow and even halt the tumor
      growth.

    <description>Phase 0 - subjects diagnosed with an operable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas will have 8 siG12D LODER placed in tumor. The siG12D LODER will be placed in the subject's tumor using an EUS biopsy needle.
Phase I - subjects diagnosed with locally non-operable advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. These subjects will have one of three different siG12D LODERs dose levels placed in tumor - Either 1 siG12D LODER, 2 siG12D LODERs or 8 siG12D LODERs. The siG12D LODER/s will be placed in the subject's tumor using an EUS biopsy needle.</description>
