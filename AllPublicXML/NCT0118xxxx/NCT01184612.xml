    <textblock>
      Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a communication style demonstrated to decrease drug and
      alcohol use. A five session MI intervention (BSF) was implemented in the Swedish correctional
      system. The intervention was delivered by counsellors with workshop only MI training (BSF) or
      by counsellors with workshop MI training followed by peer group supervision based on audio
      taped feedback (BSF+).

      Aim was to examine whether BSF in prisons reduces drug and alcohol use more effectively than
      interviews conducted according to the usual planning interview routine (UPI).

    <description>5 sessions was conducted by prison staff according to usual working practices, with the exception that content was structured into 5 sessions and audio recorded. The provision of a government decree served as a basis for the intervention, covering planning of prison activities and post release arrangements including strategies for drug use cessation.</description>

    <intervention_name>Motivational Interviewing; MI</intervention_name>
    <description>MI is a communication style defined as a collaborative, person-centred form of guiding to elicit and strengthen motivation to change. The method is based on four principles: showing empathy; developing discrepancy between the subject's current behaviour and an alternate, more desired, behaviour; reinforcing self-efficacy; and &quot;rolling&quot; with resistance to change. Client arguments for change are elicited and reinforced in an atmosphere that is empathic, collaborative and supportive of autonomy. The choice to change and the responsibility for change remain with the client.</description>
