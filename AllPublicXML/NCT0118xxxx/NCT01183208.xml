      A Phase I, Single-Centre, Double-Blind, Randomised, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group,
      Pharmacokinetic and Safety Study to Evaluate Systemic Exposure and Local Vaginal Exposure to
      Lidocaine and Prilocaine and the Metabolites 2,6 DiMethylAlanine (2, 6, DMA) and O-Toluidine;
      and the Safety and Tolerability of PSD502 in Female Healthy Volunteer Subjects Following

      The study drug is a metered-dose anaesthetic spray, which is being developed for the
      treatment of premature ejaculation (PE). The use of anaesthetic in topical creams has been
      well established, and there is a licensed topical anaesthetic cream in the market with the
      same active ingredients as the spray (eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics cream 5%,
      lidocaine &amp; prilocaine). The use of a cream does not result in the concentrated drug being in
      direct contact with the cells, unlike the spray.

      Six clinical studies have already been carried out for the spray; two involved the
      recruitment of 556 PE patients with some being dosed for up to 1 year. These studies have
      demonstrated a prolongation of intravaginal ejaculatory latency time and no safety concerns
      for male patients or their female partners. The partners of clinical study participants have
      been asked to report health changes during the studies. Reports of vaginal numbness were
      uncommon; however, effects of the transfer to a partner cannot be excluded. This study is
      being conducted to determine the effects of the drug on the whole body in females as well as
      local vaginal exposure to the spray. This study will be conducted in order to support a
      marketing application in the United States (US) at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration.

             these must have been stable for a period of 3 months. If a barrier method is being
             used, this should be latex based and not polyurethane based)

          -  Female subjects who are post-menopausal must have been post-menopausal &gt;1 year and
             have confirmed elevated serum follicle stimulating hormone at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of a significant medical condition that would preclude further study

             hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus infection

          -  Safety testing: abnormalities at screening, in particular liver function tests, which

             in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Significant abnormality of the vaginal mucosa or cervix that would preclude

             PSD502

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse within 1 year prior to screening

             undertaking the study procedures, including, but not limited to, the following:

               -  Uro-gynaecological disease or recent surgery within 8 weeks of screening which
                  would make intravaginal application or vaginal examination/colposcopy difficult
                  or painful OR

               -  Ongoing significant psychiatric disorder (e.g., bipolar disease,
