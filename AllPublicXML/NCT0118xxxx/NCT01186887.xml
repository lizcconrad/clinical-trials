  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to directly compare the clinical outcomes of both the celecoxib and
      placebo groups following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The study will have
      short and long term goals. Validated outcome measures will aim to quantify pain control at 2
      weeks after surgery, as well as knee function at 2 year follow-up. Groups will be compared
      using pain control scales, and functional knee outcome scores. The first null hypothesis
      tested by this study is that the celecoxib group experiences equal pain control compared with
      the placebo group. The second null hypothesis is that no knee function difference will be
      found between the celecoxib and placebo groups.

    <description>The treatment group will receive 400 mg Celecoxib p.o. preoperatively and the control group will receive a placebo between 1 and 3 hours pre-op, when other standard medications are administered. The treatment group will receive 200 mg of Celecoxib orally twice per day post operatively, for a duration of 5 days based on dosing protocols shown to be well tolerated and effective in treating pain following ambulatory surgery. The control group will receive a 5 day supply of placebo pills. Both groups will receive standard post surgical narcotic prescription (Oxycodone IR 5 - 10 mg po qid prn and acetaminophen 325 - 650 mg PO qid prn</description>
