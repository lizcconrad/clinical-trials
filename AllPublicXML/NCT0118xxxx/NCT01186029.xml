  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at whether the addition of a fairly new drug for the treatment of
      post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and post-discharge nausea and vomiting(PDNV)will
      provide added efficacy if added to 2 drugs that are already used as a standard of care for
      PONV and PDNV.

      The patients that will be looked at will be deemed at higher risk for PONV and PDNV based on
      the procedure they are having done and/or on patient risk factors.
