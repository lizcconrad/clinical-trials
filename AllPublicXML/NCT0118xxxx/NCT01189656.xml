      vaccine on HBeAg-positive, chronic hepatitis B patients, and provide evidence for the next
      dosing regimen.

      The current study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical
      trial. The eligible subjects are assigned randomly into 2 arms, the Vaccine + Lamivudine
      group and the Placebo + Lamivudine group, respectively, by a ratio of 2:1. The efficacy
      variables include the change of HBV DNA load at Week 72, and at each visits the rate of
      subjects with HBV DNA titer reducing &gt; 2 logarithms ,the change of HBeAg and HBsAg titer, the
      change of ALT, HBsAg/HBeAg serum conversion rate, the INF-gamma expression level in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), the amount of HBV-specific CTL, the change of
      expression level of peripheral cytokines (IL-4,IL-10,IL-12 and INF-gamma) against the
      baseline level.
