  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The multi-centric, open label, single arm and self controlled study is planned to assess the
      efficacy of orally administered Sigmart in subjects with recurrent angina after coronary
      revascularization. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that orally
      administered Sigmart can improve the major Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) result in recurrent
      angina subjects.
