  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of 3 different approaches to exercise
      training in women with early stage breast cancer who have completed all primary treatments
      (except hormone therapy, if appropriate). Prior research in women with early stage breast
      cancer has shown that some treatments may have an adverse impact on physical fitness levels
      leading to feelings of fatigue and poor quality of life. Supervised exercise training has
      been shown to reduce some of these side-effects. However, all the exercise programs have
      followed essentially the same approach. This study is designed to see if a different approach
      to exercise training is more effective than the conventional approach currently in use.
