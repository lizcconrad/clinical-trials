    <textblock>
      This research study is being done because patients with a history of chest radiation
      treatment for Hodgkin's disease have been shown to be at increased risk for developing lung
      cancer a number of years out from treatment. The risk appears to be further increased among
      patients with a smoking history. In this study, the CT scans will be read and interpreted by
      the study radiologist, and the results recorded in a consistent manner. Depending on the
      findings of the initial CT scan, we will then either repeat the scan in 1 year, or if
      indicated, send you for further scans or a biopsy. The information collected in this study
      will help researchers and clinicians in providing more concrete recommendations and screening
      guidelines for future survivors of Hodgkin's disease who have had similar exposures to
      radiation and/or chemotherapy and smoking.

    <description>A chest CT uses special radiographic equipment using x-rays to capture images of the chest, and with the aid of a computer, processes the images to create cross-sectional pictures or &quot;slices&quot; of the areas of interest. The images can then be printed out or examined on a monitor. The CT scanner is a large unit with a hole running directly through its center, giving the appearance of a doughnut. During the scanning, patients will lie flat on their back on a table, and they are periodically asked to hold their breath. The table will first move through the scanner to determine the correct starting position. The rest of the scans are made as the table moves more slowly through the cavity in the scanner.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 5 years or longer from initial Hodgkin's disease diagnosis

          2. Current age 18 or older

          3. Received mediastinal irradiation and/or alkylating-agent based chemotherapy

          4. Smoking history of 10-pack years or more, or current smoker

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a history of lung cancer

          2. Patients currently receiving treatment for another cancer diagnosis (patients with
             another cancer, but currently disease-free and not receiving treatment are eligible)

          3. Patients with known diagnosis of any metastatic cancer

          4. Pregnant women. Female patients must: be at least one year post-menopausal, have had a
             hysterectomy, or have a serum pregnancy test to confirm that they are not pregnant.
             These measures must be taken in order to avoid doing a CT scan of a pregnant woman.
