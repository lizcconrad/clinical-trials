  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LE-DT is a novel, proprietary delivery system of docetaxel developed by NeoPharm, Inc.
      Docetaxel (currently marketed as Taxotere) is an anti-microtubule agent that prevents cell
      division. By removing toxic detergent used in Taxotere, the form of LE-DT, shows reduced
      toxicity and comparable therapeutic efficacy in pre-clinical study. The clinical evidence
      obtained from the NeoPharm Phase I study shows fewer side effects and possibly administered
      at higher dose to induce greater effectiveness of LE-DT. In addition, docetaxel has shown
      positive activity of protein bound taxane therapy in treating patients with pancreatic
      cancer. The current Phase II study is designed to accomplish the following objectives:

        1. Assess the antitumor effect of 110 mg/m2 LE-DT administered intravenous (IV) every three
           weeks in pancreatic cancer patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease

        2. To evaluate the progression-free survival and overall survival

        3. To correlate secreted protein acid rich in cysteine expression with tumor response

        4. To evaluate the safety of LE-DT, in particular peripheral neuropathy, water retention as
           well as myelotoxicity

        5. To correlate pharmacogenetic variations in patients with LE-DT pharmacodynamic
           endpoints, including toxicities.

             SPARC assay.

          3. Patients must have clinical or radiographic evidence of locally advanced or metastatic
             pancreatic cancer with measurable disease.

          4. Male or non-pregnant and non-lactating female:

               -  If a female patient is of child-bearing potential, as evidenced by regular
