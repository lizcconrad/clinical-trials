  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study examines actigraphic, observational, psychometric and associated repeated
      measurements obtained prior to and during psychopharmacological treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Baseline actigraphic measurements, multi-symptom operationally defined observations and
      psychometric data will be established and repeated to measure treatment response. Additional
      biological and biometric measures that have potential to further characterize the cohorts
      under study or treatment response will be collected as practical and when possible.

    <measure>Actigraphic Measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>Three week actigraphic measurement periods</time_frame>
    <description>Actigraphic measurements are recorded every 30 seconds during three week measurement periods. The actigraphic measurements will be made utilizing an Actiwatch (AW-64 Phillips-Rispironics, Inc.), placed on the subject's non-dominant wrist. The measurements will occur every thirty seconds for approximately 21 consecutive days. Actigraphic measurements collected at this frequency reflect circadian patterns of interest; discern sleep states and characterize activity and activity patterns.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Operationally Defined Observations</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomly repeated treatment course observational measurements during actigraphic measurement periods</time_frame>
    <description>The Systematic Observation Scaleâ„¢ utilizes operationally defined symptoms that are presented to the primary observer (self or parent) for determination regarding the percentage of time symptoms are present. Target symptoms will be defined at baseline. Systematic Observation Scale measurements will be obtained at baseline and weekly post-treatment for periods defined as treatment initiation, treatment adjustment or treatment-course longitudinal.</description>

        Children and adults, male or female receiving or anticipating pharmacological intervention
        and their non-affected first degree relatives will be invited to participate based on
        institutional actiwatch availability. Since children are the focus of the Child
        Psychopharmacology Institute they will be the primary recruitment focus, however, adult
        subjects may include non-affected first degree relatives or others who represent designated
        cohort groups and will be accepted based on actiwatch availabilty.
