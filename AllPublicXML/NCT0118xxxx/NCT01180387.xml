  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Reproductive Medicine Network (RMN) is a nationwide cooperative network of 7 clinical
      sites and a data coordination center, and is sponsored in 5 year increments by The Eunice
      Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The RMN is
      charged with designing, implementing and publishing high quality clinical research in
      reproductive medicine. It has been in existence for over 15 years and has performed several
      seminal clinical trials that have fundamentally changed clinical practice in this field. In
      addition, many worthy ancillary protocols have been generated and published.

      It is this latter fact, as well as the continued interest by investigators both inside and
      outside the RMN for access to DNA or serum samples from the previously performed trials, that
      has motivated the present investigators to proactively begin a biologic samples repository
      from the ongoing and pending RMN clinical trials. Ideally, this repository would allow
      investigators to seamlessly access trial samples for many years into the future, and thus
      greatly amplify the use of resources and the impact of the RMN.

      The RMN plans to collect baseline serum samples (5 cc) and DNA for storage and eventual DNA
      extraction. The whole blood will also be collected by the clinical sites.

      As part of the RMN effort, pregnancies conceived as part of the study protocols are entered
      into a pregnancy registry if the subjects consent to be part of the registry. Saliva samples
      from the child conceived as part of the protocols, as well as the parent from whom the DNA
      was not collected as part of the original protocols will be collected at that time. The
      newborn's saliva will be collected with up to 5 saliva sponges, the tips of which are cut off
      and stored using an Oragene® kit. The adults will be asked to provide 2 cc of saliva, which
      will be stored with the same kits. These saliva samples will be stored at -20°C.

      Two of the RMN studies involve assessing semen parameters. As part of this protocol, we
      anticipate collecting semen samples from male subjects.
