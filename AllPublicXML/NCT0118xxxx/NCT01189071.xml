      This will be a randomized two arm prospective study to evaluate postoperative ureteral stent
      pain. One arm will be given 3 days of preoperative darifenacin and the control group will
      have the standard of care which is no preoperative anticholinergic medication. The primary
      endpoints will be decreased pain scores and less ER visits and hospital admissions for stent
      difficulty. These will be assessed by a pain diary completed by the participant as well as a
      questionnaire when the participant returns to clinic for stent removal. Also included in
      evaluation of the primary end point will be patient phone calls, ER visits and admissions for
      stent difficulty. Secondary endpoints will be narcotic and postoperative anticholinergic use.
      This will also be assessed with the pain diary completed by the participant. Participants
      will be included in the study if they are undergoing a procedure that a stent will likely be
      required. This will include participants who will have ureteroscopy or extracorporeal shock
      wave lithotripsy and a stone 1 cm or larger. Also participants with stones smaller than 1 cm
      who due to anatomy of the ureter or kidney will likely need a stent on preoperative
      evaluation will also be included in the study. Included as well in the study are participants
      who will undergo renal or ureteral surgery that a ureteral stent will be utilized.
      Participants will be randomized after consent is obtained into two groups. One group will
      receive standard of care which is no preoperative anticholinergic medications. The second
      group will receive the three day treatment with darifenacin pre procedure. Participants in
      the second group will be instructed on side effects of darifenacin and given appropriate
      contact information prior to initiation of the medication. Both groups will be followed
      postoperatively with a pain diary. Postoperative follow up will continue until the stent is
      removed 1-2 weeks after the procedure. The exact time of stent removal will depend on the
      success and nature of the surgery and will be at the discretion of the surgeon. Participants
      will be able to voluntarily stop the medication for any reason as well as if they have
      serious side effects from the medication. Data to be collected from each group includes age,
      gender, race, prior ureteral stents, prior renal or ureteral surgery, past medical history,
      allergies, current medications and urinary complaints.

      The purpose of the study is to determine if preoperative dosing of darifenacin will assist in
      postoperative ureteral stent pain. This will be a randomized two arm prospective study to
      evaluate postoperative ureteral stent pain. One arm will be given 3 days of preoperative
      darifenacin and the control group will have the standard of care which is no preoperative
      anticholinergic medication. The primary endpoints will be decreased pain scores and less ER
      visits and hospital admissions for stent difficulty. These will be assessed by a pain diary
      completed by the participant as well as a questionnaire when the participant returns to
      clinic for stent removal. Also included in evaluation of the primary end point will be
      patient phone calls, ER visits and admissions for stent difficulty. Secondary endpoints will
      be narcotic and postoperative anticholinergic use. This will also be assessed with the pain
      diary completed by the participant. Participants will be included in the study if they are
      undergoing a procedure that a stent will likely be required. This will include participants
      who will have ureteroscopy or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and a stone 1 cm or
      larger. Also participants with stones smaller than 1 cm who due to anatomy of the ureter or
      kidney will likely need a stent on preoperative evaluation will also be included in the
      study. Included as well in the study are participants who will undergo renal or ureteral
      surgery that a ureteral stent will be utilized. Participants will be randomized after consent
      is obtained into two groups. One group will receive standard of care which is no preoperative
      anticholinegic medications. The second group will receive the three day treatment with
      darifenacin pre procedure. Participants in the second group will be instructed on side
      effects of darifenacin and given appropriate contact information prior to initiation of the
      medication. Both groups will be followed postoperatively with a pain diary. Postoperative
      follow up will continue until the stent is removed 1-2 weeks after the procedure. The exact
      time of stent removal will depend on the success and nature of the surgery and will be at the
      discretion of the surgeon. Participants will be able to voluntarily stop the medication for
      any reason as well as if they have serious side effects from the medication. Data to be
      collected from each group includes age, gender, race, prior ureteral stents, prior renal or
      ureteral surgery, past medical history, allergies, current medications and urinary
      complaints.

Darifenacin: an M3 selective anticholinergic medication. M3 muscarinic receptors are felt to be related to bladder and ureteral contractility. The ureteral and bladder spasms related to ureteral stents are felt to be due to inappropriate contractions. By using a selective M3 receptor, it is felt that there will be fewer side effects. Participants will be placed on the standard 15 mg oral daily dosage for 3 days prior to the stent being placed, day 3 being the am of the surgery.</description>
