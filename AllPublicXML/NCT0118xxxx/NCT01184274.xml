  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because SB939 has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and in
      some people and seems promising, but we are not sure if it can offer better results than
      standard treatment.

      In Part A of this study, SB939 was given to children with solid tumours. The purpose of Part
      A of this study is to ind the highest dose of a new drug SB939 that can be giben to children
      without causing very severe side effects that are tolerable.

      In Part B of this study, SB939 will be given to children with leukemia. The purpose of Part
      B, is to see whether the dose that was determined to be the best dose for patients with solid
      tumours is also the best dose for children with leukemia.

      In Part C of this study, SB939 will be given together with 13-cis-retinoic acid. The purpose
      of Part C, is to see whether the SB939 dose that was determined to be the best dose in Part A
      is also the best dose when given in combination with 13-cis-retinoic acid.

             potential may not participate unless they have agreed to an effective contraceptive
             method. Pregnant or breast feeding females will not be entered on this study due to
             the potential fetal and teratogenic adverse events.
