  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical research is to analyze the survival of a cohort of patients
      newly diagnosed (incident cases) with idiopathic PAH, familial or associated with the use of
      anorectics (isolated pulmonary vascular disease without comorbidity) and identify prognostic
      factors using a dynamic model for predicting survival, including prognostic factors evaluated
      repeatedly at pre-specified periods during follow-up. In a second step, the investigators
      define using this model combinations of parameters to better define the therapeutic goals in
      PAH (functional class, exercise testing, hemodynamic, echocardiographic variables, biological
      parameters).

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease characterized by an intense
      proliferation of pulmonary arterial wall causing increased progressive pulmonary vascular
      resistance, leading to right heart failure and death. Established prognostic factors at
      diagnosis were identified 20 years ago at a time when there is no specific treatment for
      describing the natural history of disease.

      Over the last 10 years, new therapeutic classes (similar to prostacyclin, antagonists of
      endothelin receptors, inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 5) have been developed and improved
      symptoms, exercise capacity, and hemodynamics in patients with PAH. With the availability of
      these new molecules, the clinician is now faced with difficult treatment decisions regarding
      the choice of initial treatment and the need for road treatments combined during evolution.
      Therapeutic purpose and effect of these different therapeutic strategies on the long-term
      survival remain poorly understood.

      If it has been clearly demonstrated that clinical parameters (NYHA functional class),
      functional (test 6-minute walk) and hemodynamic (cardiac output and pulmonary vascular
      resistance) measured before initiation of treatment have a major role in determining the
      prognosis, with the contribution of new molecules is important to evaluate the prognostic
      value of changes in these factors during follow-up under specific treatment. At the baseline
      assessment, including repeat cardiac catheterization rights, it is also important to evaluate
      other prognostic criteria substitution, including methods of noninvasive evaluation
      (echocardiography, biomarkers).

    <description>A dynamic model for predicting survival will be used, including prognostic factors evaluated repeatedly at pre-specified periods during follow-up:
Right Heart Catheterization: mean pulmonary arterial pressure at rest or during exercise, and pressure pulmonary artery occlusion
Echocardiographic variables
Biomarkers (brain natriuretic peptide(BNP), N Terminal Pro BNP, Big-endothelin, Isoprostanes)
Functional Class of the New York Heart Association(NYHA)
