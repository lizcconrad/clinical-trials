  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women are randomised to supplementation with fish oil, methyl tetrahydro folic acid,
      both or a placebo during the second half of pregnancy. Biochemical measures are determined in
      maternal blood during pregnancy and in cord blood.

      Non invasive follow up examinations of infants at ages 4, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8, 9 and 9.5 years
      focus on long term effects of supplementation anthropometric development, neurological
      development and allergy risk.
