  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients participating in this study will have a diagnosis of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. This
      study will evaluate whether the addition of an investigational drug called RAD001 given
      together with Imatinib will better target leukemia stem cells, causing them to die. Stem
      cells are a small population of cells, existing primarily within the bone marrow, and are
      believed to be responsible for the ongoing risk of disease relapse.
