      The objective of the study is to estimate the prevalence of anti-JCV antibodies in multiple
      sclerosis (MS) participants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional, multi-center, multi-national, epidemiological study to estimate
      the prevalence of anti-JCV antibody in MS participants. This study will provide an estimate
      of the prevalence of anti-JCV antibody in the MS population and will investigate
      inter-country differences.

        Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients will be enrolled in Europe, Canada, and Australia.

        Patient enrollment from each country will be commensurate with the distribution of MS
        patients among all participating countries.
