  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective randomized controlled study comparing the efficacy of micro-focused
      ultrasound when used in conjunction with 1550-nm erbium-doped fractionated laser versus
      1550-nm erbium-doped fractionated laser alone for treatment of striae distensae(stretch
      marks).

      Each side of thigh (or abdomen) was randomized to receive 1550nm-fractionated laser treatment
      every 2 weeks for a total of 4 treatments on one side and the contralateral side received
      micro-focused ultrasound treatment and 1550nm-fractionated laser alternatively every 2 weeks
      for a total of 4 treatments with site-match control area of baseline striae on each side.

      The primary outcome measure by two dermatologists blindly compared the two areas of striae
      distensae on each side from live subjects using a questionnaire and quartile rating scale on
      the final follow-up visit.

      This study was a pilot study designed to determine the feasibility of these procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary outcomes were qualitative measurements of the mean striae width in the
      treatment area before(week0) and after treatment(week10) and subject satisfaction was
      determined by a satisfaction questionnaire.
