  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to develop and test a tailored Internet-delivered
      psychological treatment for patients with mild to moderate major depression and comorbid
      anxiety symptoms and compare its efficacy to a non-tailored treatment and to an active
      control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has emerged as a promising way to
      administer evidence-based psychological treatments. Mild to moderate major depression has
      previously been found to treatable via the Internet, with the provision that minimal
      therapist guidance is given. However, previous research has not taken the issue of
      comorbidity into account. It is well known that major depression often is accompanied by
      anxiety and in addition the symptom profile in major depression may differ substantially. The
      idea behind the proposed research is to tailor the Internet intervention according to the
      symptom profile. By used a large set of treatment modules (text-based) we aim to diagnose and
      then prescribe modules. In a randomized trial we want to compare this procedure (e.g.,
      tailored CBT) with the standard Internet-delivered CBT. We will also include a control group
      in the form of a supervised online discussion group who will later receive CBT.
