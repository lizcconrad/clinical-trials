  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dextromethorphan has been reported affording neuroprotection on dopaminergic neurons and
      having protective effect against inflammation-related neuron damage. These anti-inflammatory
      and neuroprotective effects of dextromethorphan would suggest potential clinical benefits of
      dextromethorphan add-on therapy to valproate for bipolar disorder patients. This hypothesis
      was based on the findings that the mood stabilizers have been reported to be neuroprotective
      through the release of neurotrophic factors such as GDNF from astroglia. Thus, the
      combination treatment of mood stabilizers and dextromethorphan might improve the therapeutic
      efficacy for bipolar disorder patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patient aged ≧18 and ≦65 years.

          2. A diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder according to DSM-IV criteria made by a
             specialist in psychiatry.

          3. A total of HDRS score at least 18 or YMRS score at least 14 at screen.

          4. Signed informed consent by patient or legal representative

          5. Patient or a reliable caregiver can be expected to ensure acceptable compliance and
             visit attendance for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women of childbearing potential not using adequate contraception as per investigator
             judgment or not willing to comply with contraception for duration of study.

          2. Females who are pregnant or nursing.

          3. Patient has received dextromethorphan, or other selective cyclo- oxygenase 2 (Cox-2)

             double-blind medication.

             rhinitis, anaphylactic shock) precipitated by dextromethorphan.

          8. Patient has received electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) within 4 weeks prior to first
             dose of doubleblind medication.

          9. Diagnosis of or treatment for esophageal, gastric, pyloric channel, or duodenal

             to receiving first dose of double-blind medication.

         10. Inclusion in another bipolar disorder study or study for another indication with
             psychotropic's within the last 30 days prior to start of study.
