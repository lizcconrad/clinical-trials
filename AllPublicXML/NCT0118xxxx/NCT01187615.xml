  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized Phase I study to define the safety
      profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and potential pharmacokinetic interaction of
      regorafenib in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin in patients with Stage IIIB or Stage
      IV nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and to determine the impact of the combined
      administration on the pharmacokinetics of regorafenib, pemetrexed, and cisplatin.

      In Part A of this trial, regorafenib will be administered in a sequential dosing with a seven
      day wash out period before the next infusion of pemetrexed and cisplatin. Regorafenib will be
      administered at a dose of 160 mg qd from Day 2 to Day 14 followed by a 7 days break.

      In Part B of this trial, regorafenib will be administered continuously from Day 1 to Day 21.
      Only in Cycle 1, regorafenib dosing will start on Day 2 in order to assess the
      pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed and cisplatin without concomitant regorafenib dosing.
