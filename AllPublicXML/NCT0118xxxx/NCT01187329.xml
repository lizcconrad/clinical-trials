  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall research plan is to test the hypothesis that intraoperative treatment of
      hyperinsulinemic normoglycemic clamp (HNC) in cardiac surgical patients improves myocardial
      function and short-term outcomes compared with standard glucose management.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim #1:To determine whether intraoperative use of HNC affords cardioprotective
      benefits measured by improved echocardiographic measures of myocardial function, serum
      markers of cardiomyocyte injury, and hemodynamic indices measured immediately (at end of
      surgery) and during the short-term (initial hospitalization).

      Specific Aim #2 and #3 To determine the mechanism of HNC by laboratory analysis of right
      atrial tissue.

      Specific Aim #2 To determine if HNC decreases flux via HBP and cellular markers of injury.

      Specific Aim #3 To determine if HNC augments glucose uptake and utilization.

    <description>Prior to anesthetic induction, a baseline blood glucose value will be obtained, followed by an insulin infusion of 5 mU.Kg-1.min-1. When blood glucose is &lt;110 mg/dL, a variable continuous infusion of glucose (dextrose 20%) supplemented with potassium (40 mEq/L) and phosphate (30 mmol/L) is administered to preserve normoglycemia (80-110 mg/dL). The glucose infusion is titrated to target glucose levels by checking blood glucose every 5 - 15 min with Accu-Check (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) glucose monitor. At sternal closure, insulin infusion is decreased to 1 mU/Kg/min. On admission to the ICU, insulin treatment follows the ICU protocol. The dextrose infusion is slowly weaned off over 2 - 4 hrs maintaining blood glucose &gt; 80 mg/dL. Arterial blood glucose is measured every 30 - 60 min for 2 hrs, then, as stated in ICU protocol.</description>

    <description>Baseline arterial blood glucose will be obtained before anesthetic induction. Repeat measurements are performed every 30-90 min. Glucose &gt;150 on CPB will receive insulin according to intraoperative protocol. After surgery, insulin is given according to ICU protocol. Target glucose &lt; 180 mg/dL.</description>
