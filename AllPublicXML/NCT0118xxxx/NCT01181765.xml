  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to estimate the efficacy of infliximab in inducing and maintaining
      healing of lesions in the mucosa of subjects with Crohn's disease involving their small
      bowel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Landmark trials in Crohn's disease demonstrated the efficacy of infliximab in inducing and
      maintaining clinical remission. Furthermore, the endoscopic sub-studies within these trials
      demonstrated the ability of infliximab to rapidly induce and maintain mucosal healing as
      evidenced by the complete absence of mucosal breaks in the colon and terminal ileum.
      Unfortunately, conventional colonoscopy does not allow intestinal exploration beyond a very
      restricted portion of the small bowel (at most 10-15 cm of the terminal ileum). A study that
      systematically examines the changes in the small bowel mucosa during Crohn's disease
      symptomatic improvement is clearly needed.

      This study consists of 20 subjects and 30 weeks of follow up. All subjects will undergo
      wireless camera endoscopy at three (3) visits, namely: at Screening, at Week 10 and at Week
      26. Infliximab is administered at (5) visits, namely: at Baseline (week 0), Week 2, Week 6,
      Week 14 and Week 22. In some subjects, an ileal-colonoscopy may be performed at Week 26.
