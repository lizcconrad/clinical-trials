  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to follow up with all of the pediatric brain tumor patients who
      received proton beam radiation therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) for which
      there is baseline neuropsychological testing in order to measure changes, if any, in
      neurobehavioral functioning (executive skills, emotional/behavioral functioning, and adaptive
      abilities) and their use of special education services at one year or more post-treatment.
      The investigators will also correlate neurobehavioral data with pertinent clinical
      information. Participation will be maximized through the use of mail-in, parental- and
      self-report questionnaires.

      The purpose of this study is to longitudinally examine neurobehavioral functioning outcomes
      and use of special education services in brain tumor and CNS tumor patients treated with
      proton radiation at MGH. Furthermore, we seek to correlate neurobehavioral data with
      pertinent clinical information. We anticipate better neurobehavioral functioning to be
      associated with use of protons (vs. photons, as reported in the literature). We also
      anticipate the need and utilization of special education services to be lower in brain and
      CNS tumor patients treated with protons (vs. photons, as reported in the literature). Lastly,
      we anticipate greater neurobehavioral deficits in patients whose proton radiation treatment
      involved the craniospinal axis compared to those who received proton radiation to the
      involved field.
