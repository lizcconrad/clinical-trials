    <textblock>
      This study in patients with stable schizophrenia will investigate the effect of nicotine on
      arousal, cognitive task and social cognition after acute dose administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned drug),
      placebo-controlled, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), three-way-crossover trial
      (patients may receive different interventions sequentially during the trial) in patients with
      stable schizophrenia. The three-way-crossover treatment phase will consist of three blinded
      treatment periods separated by a wash out period (the period allowed for the entire
      administered drug to be eliminated from the body) of 2 to 7 days. The study duration for each
      patient will be approximately 8 weeks. Each patient enrolled will be randomized to receive
      Treatment A (1mg nicotine per dosing), Treatment B (2mg nicotine per dosing) or Treatment C
      (placebo) during one of their treatment period. The study drug (nicotine or placebo) will be
      administered three times daily on Day 1 of each treatment phase as a mouth spray, separated 2
      to 3 hours from each other (i.e. 0h; and 2 to 3h; and 4 to 6h post first dosing). Three
      different blocks of cognitive assessments will follow, one after each drug administration.
      Safety evaluations include adverse event monitoring, vital signs and clinical laboratory
      tests. Each patient participating will receive 3 identical study drug administrations per
      dosing day (2 to 3 hours from each other), resulting in an overall dose of 3 mg nicotine
      (Treatment A), 6 mg nicotine (Treatment B) or 0 mg nicotine (Treatment C) per dosing day. By
      the end of the study, after the 3-way crossover, each patient will have received 9 mg
      nicotine via mouth spray.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  In- or outpatients with schizophrenia stably treated (same primary medication) for at
             least 2 months with antipsychotic therapy (treatment with more than 1 antipsychotic
             drug is acceptable provided dose levels have been stable for &gt; 2 months). Fluctuations
             in dose levels of the primary antipsychotic treatment are acceptable provided the dose
             levels remain constant as from 2 weeks prior to dosing

          -  A known (by the site) disease history of at least 12 months

          -  DSM-IV criteria for Schizophrenia
