  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interactive telephony technologies offer a potentially highly effective, patient-centered
      communication modality by guiding parents at home through interactive discussions that can
      gather information and actively reinforce recommendations and treatments. Interactive
      telephony systems are particularly well suited for use in vulnerable populations since access
      to the telephone is nearly universal, and the system does not rely on reading printed text.
      The investigators propose to develop and evaluate an integrated patient-centered health
      information system, the Personal Health Partner (PHP). The PHP will use fully automated,
      interactive, conversations to gather personal health data and counsel parents before
      scheduled visits, exchange that data with the child's primary care clinician via the
      electronic health record (EHR), and offer personalized follow-up assessment and counseling
      after visits. The information technology-based approach to be evaluated in this project will
      link parents and children outside the clinical setting with their primary care center and
      will offer comprehensive assessments AND counseling to reinforce and support parental
      behavior change.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large gap exists between what is recommended for effective primary care of children and
      what actually takes place in pediatric primary care settings, especially in the areas of
      preventive care. Furthermore, although medication management (safety and effectiveness)
      issues have emerged as an important factor for children, little is known about how medication
      is actually used by families at home.

      With growing use of the electronic health record (EHR) come new opportunities to link
      patient-centered information with clinical health information systems. Linkage of these
      systems has the potential to inform and activate parents, provide much richer data to drive
      decision support at the point-of-care, and to provide ongoing support for long-term behavior
      change following primary care visits. The use of conversational technologies as the
      foundation for the project offers a number of unique advantages especially the support of
      lower-literacy populations and near-universal access. Systems like the Personal Health
      Partner (PHP) represent a model for the future of ambulatory care and the sustainable,
      affordable delivery of higher quality and safer care by primary care clinicians in the
      future.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Parents of children will be enrolled in the study if they meet a set of eligibility
             criteria which includes:

               1. Age 0 - 11 years old

               2. A primary care patient at Boston Medical Center

               3. An English speaking child and parent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children will be considered ineligible for the study if they plan to move away from
             the Boston area in less than 3 months, or are participating in another primary care
             research project with content that overlaps the content within this study. Currently,
             there are no studies being conducted that would lead to exclusion.
