  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with Primary Immune Deficiency (PID) may develop severe, life-threatening
      infections as a result of inherited defects in the genes that normally instruct blood-forming
      cells to develop and to fight infections. PID diseases include Severe Combined Immune
      Deficiency (SCID), leaky SCID, Omenn syndrome (OS), and Reticular Dysgenesis (RD). PIDs may
      be treated by transplantation of bone marrow stem cells from a healthy person or, in some
      cases, by enzyme replacement or by gene therapy. Patients with SCID were among the first to
      receive bone marrow stem cell (also called hematopoietic cells) transplantation (HCT) more
      than 40 years ago, and HCT is the standard treatment today for this group of diseases. Since
      PID diseases are rare, there are not enough patients at any single center to determine the
      full range of causes, natural history, or best methods of treatment. For this research study
      many PID centers across North America have organized into the Primary Immune Deficiency
      Treatment Consortium (PIDTC) to pool their experience and study PIDs together. The overall
      goal of this study is the prospective evaluation of children with SCID and related disorders
      who are treated under a variety of protocols at participating institutions. The study aims to
      identify variables contributing to the best outcomes for HCT.

      This study follows participants with SCID prospectively, meaning the study enrolls
      participants where there is a plan to receive a blood and marrow transplant, enzyme therapy,
      or gene therapy in the future. Participants are then followed according to a schedule set out
      by the study protocol after the procedure. There are no experimental therapies on this study.

      The study plans to enroll over 200 participants with SCID. By studying new participants
      undergoing treatment for SCID, the goal is to learn more about: (1) outcomes from the
      treatment of SCID in the modern era of medicine (2) what factors lead to the best long-term
      outcomes, such as best donor, conditioning regimen, timing of transplant, etc., and (3) what
      impact newborn screening and the early diagnosis of SCID has had on the long-term outcomes
      following BMT or gene therapy. Information is also being gathered on how and when the immune
      system recovers after BMT, quality of life for long-term survivors, and about whether
      children develop normally after treatment.

      This natural history study is the largest coordinated prospective study of participants with
      SCID ever performed. Information that we will learn, both now and in the future, will help
      doctors and other health professionals to better treat children with SCID.
