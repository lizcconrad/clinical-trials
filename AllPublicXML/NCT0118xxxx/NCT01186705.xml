  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a new drug called MK-2206 for metastatic colorectal
      cancer. This drug is being tested in a subgroup of patients with colorectal cancer whose
      tumors have changes in certain genes that may make them more likely to respond to this new
      medication. As tumors develop, the cells within the tumor acquire mutations within genes,
      allowing them to grow more effectively. We will be testing your tumor for mutations involving
      two genes - KRAS and PIK3CA. Patients whose tumors have a normal copy of the KRAS gene and a
      mutation within the PIK3CA gene will be eligible to participate in this study.

      This study is a phase 2 study. The goal of a phase 2 study is to find out what effects, good
      and/or bad, a new treatment has against a certain type of cancer.
