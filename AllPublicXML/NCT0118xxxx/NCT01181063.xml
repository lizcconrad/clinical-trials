    <textblock>
      Due to the complexity of orally inhaled products (combination of a formulation and a
      device)and the topical nature of drug delivery to the lung for efficacy in vitro-in vivo
      correlation(IVIVC) for inhaled dosage forms is not generally known.

      The rationale of this pilot study is to gain in vivo data of the Budesonide/formoterol EH
      product variants under development and compare pulmonary deposition (administration with
      charcoal) of different product variants of Budesonide/formoterol EH with Symbicort TH.

      In order to reduce variability, a crossover design is chosen. An open study design is
      regarded appropriate because the study is a pilot and the primary study variables are
      pharmacokinetic(PK) parameters derived from drug concentrations in plasma. Wash-out period of
      at least 3 days between the study treatment administration days is considered sufficient for
      the elimination of budesonide and formoterol.

      The single dose study is suitable for this kind of study, where the aim is to compare
      products and the therapeutic response is not measured.

      The dose level selected is 2 inhalations (single dose) for all products. The administration
      of 2 inhalations enables the determination of budesonide and formoterol concentrations in
      plasma.

      In this study the investigational products are administered concomitantly with oral charcoal
      to block the GI absorption and to assess the pulmonary deposition of the active substances.

      Comparison of pulmonary deposition between the products is considered more relevant than
      systemic exposure at this point of product development. In the pivotal PK study total
      systemic exposure will also be assessed.

      Blood samples for formoterol analysis will be collected up to 24 hours and for budesonide
      analysis up to 12 hours after dosing to cover at least 80% of the total area under the
      concentration-time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC∞).
