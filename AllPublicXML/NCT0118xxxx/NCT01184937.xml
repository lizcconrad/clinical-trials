  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with end-stage kidney disease, transplantation is the treatment of choice,
      offering improved quality of life by restored metabolism and freedom from dialysis. However,
      demands regarding the acquirement of knowledge in life post transplantation are high. In
      order to reduce rejection episodes, graft loss and the negative consequences of life-long
      immunosuppressive medication, it is essential for kidney recipients to possess knowledge
      about important aspects regarding immunosuppressive medication, graft surveillance and the
      benefit of specific lifestyle behavior. Consequently, patient education is required for this
      patient group. This randomized controlled trial is investigating the effect of a structured
      patient education program on kidney recipients' knowledge, coping and quality of life

    <description>Knowledge level is measured by a self-administrated knowledge questionnaire consisting of 19 items addressing knowledge in relation to three areas: medication, rejection and lifestyle. Each item is rated using a 5 points scale, anchored on the left with the wording &quot;totally disagree&quot;(1), &quot;rather disagree&quot; (2) &quot;either agree or disagree&quot; (3), &quot;quite agree&quot; (4) and to the left with &quot;totally agree&quot;(5). Patients are asked to put a ring around a number to indicate their level of agreement with each item.</description>

    <description>Coping is measured by the following self-administrated questionnaires: &quot;The Generalized Self-efficacy Scale&quot;, &quot;The Long-term Medication Behavior Self-efficacy Scale&quot; and &quot;The Moriscy Compliance scale&quot;. In addition, the number of missing observations in the patients` &quot;transplant diaries&quot; is counted.(The &quot;transplant diary&quot; contains patients own daily observations of graft function and signs of rejection). Number of missing observations are counted from observation start and during a period of 7-8 weeks. The percent of missed observations of total possible observations are estimated.</description>

    <description>All patients receive standard care. Experimental group receive a structured patient education program based in self-care theory and pedagogical theory, build upon the the principles of the &quot;Pro-Self education program&quot;. The intervention program consist of five weekly one-to-one sessions with a transplant nurse, lasting about 40-60 minutes, starting during the first week after discharge and lasting until 7 weeks post transplantation. Education content consists of two levels: general knowledge level and individual knowledge. Each session has a specific program. In addition, academic detailing is used to describe patient's knowledge levels and for tailoring the education to individual needs.</description>
