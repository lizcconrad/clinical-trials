    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare individuals with cocaine dependence to recreational
      users of cocaine in terms of their brain reactivity to cocaine cues, in hopes that this
      comparison may help us better understand the transition from recreational to compulsive
      cocaine use.

    <textblock>
      Chronic cocaine exposure is associated with an intensified and broadened pattern of neural
      reactivity to cocaine and cocaine cues; prolonged use is also associated with prefrontal
      abnormalities during response inhibition. Limited research suggests that recreational cocaine
      use has similar, but attenuated, effects on neural functioning. Unfortunately, very little
      research has directly compared cocaine dependent individuals and recreational cocaine users
      in terms of their neural reactivity to cocaine cues and response inhibition. Such comparisons
      could help to elucidate the pathological neuroplasticity associated with the transition from
      cocaine use to dependence. The proposed study will assess neural reactivity to cocaine cues
      and response inhibition in recreational cocaine users using fMRI. These data will be compared
      to data from the baseline visit of an ongoing IRB approved investigation (NCT00759473) in
      cocaine dependent individuals that is using the same experimental procedures as the proposed
      study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be able to provide informed consent and function at an intellectual
             level sufficient to allow accurate completion of all assessment instruments.

          -  Subjects must report having used cocaine within the past 3 months. Subjects may meet
             criteria for abuse, but not dependence on any other substance with the exception of
             nicotine, marijuana and alcohol.

          -  Use of one of the following methods of birth control by female subjects: birth control
             pills, barrier methods (diaphragm or condoms with spermicide or both), surgical
             sterilization, use of an intra-uterine contraceptive device, or complete abstinence
             from sexual intercourse.

          -  Subjects must live within a 50-mile radius of the research facility and have reliable
             transportation.

          -  Subjects must consent to remain abstinent from all drugs of abuse (except nicotine)
             prior to the experiment.

          -  Subjects must be right-handed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing or of childbearing potential and not practicing an
             effective means of birth control.

          -  Subjects with evidence of or a history of significant hematological, endocrine,
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, or neurological disease including
             diabetes, as these conditions may affect heart rate or skin conductance measurement.

          -  Subjects with a history of or current psychotic disorder as this may impact cue
             reactivity.

          -  Subjects who are unwilling or unable to maintain abstinence from alcohol and other
             drugs of abuse (except nicotine).

          -  Subjects meeting DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence (other than nicotine,
             marijuana, or alcohol) within the past 60 days. Subjects may not meet criteria for
             cocaine dependence at any time.

          -  Subjects currently taking B-blockers, anti-arrhythmic agents, psychostimulants or any
             other agents known to interfere with heart rate and skin conductance monitoring.

          -  Subjects with a history of epilepsy or seizure disorder.

          -  Subjects with significant liver impairment.

          -  The need for maintenance or acute treatment with any psychoactive medication including
             anti-seizure medications which could potentially interfere with fMRI.

          -  Clinically significant psychiatric or medical problems that would impair participation
             or limit ability to participate in scan.

          -  Persons with ferrous metal implants or pacemaker since fMRI will be used.
