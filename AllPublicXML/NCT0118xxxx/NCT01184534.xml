      Objective:

      To compare changes in patient anxiety levels between groups of patients who either were or
      were not exposed to an informative multimedia patient education tool, in order to determine
      how the addition of such a multimedia tool will affect this parameter. Specifically, the
      study will focus on subjective anxiety as measured on pre procedure and post procedure
      patient surveys as detailed under study components.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete a questionnaire that asks how you
      feel before the procedure. It will take about 5 minutes to complete.

      After you have completed the questionnaire, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of
      a coin) to Group 1 or Group 2. You will have an equal chance of being in either group.

      If you are in Group 1, you will receive routine information before the lung biopsy and you
      will watch a video on a handheld or laptop machine with headphones. The video is designed to
      help you understand the biopsy procedure. This video should last about 5 minutes. You will
      then complete a questionnaire that asks how you feel after watching the video. It will take
      about 5 minutes to complete.

      If you are in Group 2, you will receive routine information before the lung biopsy. You will
      then complete another questionnaire that asks how you feel before the procedure. It will take
      about 5 minutes to complete.

      After your routine lung biopsy, both groups will complete a questionnaire that asks how you
      feel after the procedure. It will take about 5 minutes to complete.

      For Group 1, the total time to complete the questionnaires and watch the video will be 20
      minutes.

      For Group 2, the total time to complete the questionnaires will be 15 minutes.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation in this study will be over once you complete the questionnaire after your
      lung biopsy.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 100 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
