    <textblock>
      Sweeping or stripping of the membranes (in this paper referred to as &quot;membrane sweeping&quot;) is
      a widely utilized technique to hasten delivery for women at 37+ weeks gestation. The process
      of membrane sweeping probably causes release of prostaglandins from the decidua and the
      cervix. The efficacy of membrane sweeping is well studied, and has been shown to increase the
      number of patients in labor within 72 hours, reduce the frequency of pregnancy continuing
      beyond 41 or 42 weeks, and reduce the frequency of formal induction of labor. Thus, it is a
      safe and practical option for women who wish to avoid inductions of labor or postterm
      pregnancies.

      Group B streptococcus (GBS; streptococcus agalactiae) is a gram positive coccus that
      frequently colonizes the human genital tract. In pregnant women, GBS can cause urinary tract
      infections, chorioamnionitis, and postpartum endometritis. Newborn infants can also acquire
      GBS infection during passage through the vagina. Early onset GBS disease in the newborn can
      lead to pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis, all of which can be life-threatening. Early onset
      GBS disease has become rare since the widespread use of GBS screening and prophylactic
      treatment of pregnant women.

      The relationship between early onset GBS disease and sweeping of the membranes is not known.
      Based on the theoretical increased risk of bacterial seeding after membrane sweeping, as well
      as concern for fast labors and inadequate treatment after membrane sweeping, some
      practitioners choose not to sweep membranes in GBS positive patients. A meta-analysis did not
      show a difference in neonatal or maternal infection rates between women who underwent
      membrane sweeping and those who did not. ACOG guidelines state &quot;the risks of membrane
      stripping in GBS positive patients has not been investigated in well-designed, prospective
      studies. Therefore, data are insufficient to encourage or discourage this practice&quot;.

      Specific Aims:

      In order to help elucidate the effect of membrane sweeping in GBS positive patients, the
      investigators propose this prospective randomized trial. The investigators primary objective
      is to determine whether membrane sweeping in GBS positive women is associated with inadequate
      antibiotic treatment in labor (defined as less than four hours of antibiotic therapy prior to
      delivery). The investigators secondary objectives are to measure the effect of membrane
      sweeping on pregnancy duration, length of labor and adverse events potentially related to
      membrane sweeping such as maternal chorioamnionitis and neonatal morbidity. Randomization is
      the real research portion of this study, since offering membrane sweeping is already the
      standard of care. Patients are followed until the time of delivery, which is within 6 weeks
      of enrollment for most women.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All women presenting to the Medical Faculty Associates outpatient Obstetrics clinic
             who are 37+ weeks

          -  Are at least 18 years of age and can read and write in English

          -  Are candidates for vaginal delivery, and qualify for GBS prophylaxis by CDC criteria
             (any one of the following:

               -  have rectovaginal cultures positive for GBS

               -  have a GBS UTI this pregnancy

               -  have had an infant with GBS disease in a prior delivery) will be offered
                  enrollment in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are not candidates for vaginal delivery (placenta previa, breech
             presentation, planned repeat cesarean), will be excluded from the study.

          -  Patients who are HIV positive will also be excluded, since membrane sweeping may have
             some risks in these patients.
