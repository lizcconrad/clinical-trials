  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study's primary aim is to compare rates of sustained opioid relapse, defined as
      self-reported opioid use &gt;50% (&gt;15 of 30) of days during the first 30 days following release
      from jail, among persons treated with XR-NTX pre-release vs. controls not receiving XR-NTX.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol randomizes persons soon-to-be-released from a large urban jail to treatment
      with extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), a full opioid antagonist that prevents the
      activity of heroin and other opioids. Investigators at NYUSOM and NYC DOHMH will recruit
      heroin dependent persons from NYC jails who are soon-to-be-released, not accessing opioid
      agonist pharmacotherapy, with lowered tolerance due to incarceration, and extremely likely to
      relapse and risk accidental overdose at release. All N=40 participants receive a two-session,
      individual psychosocial intervention, Motivational Interviewing. Half (n=20) will be
      randomized to pre-release treatment with XR-NTX. Immediately and one month following release,
      participants will be offered continued psychosocial and medication-assisted treatment
      (naltrexone, buprenorphine, or methadone) at Bellevue Hospital, including a second XR-NTX
      dose among XR-NTX arm participants. The primary outcome is relapse to sustained opioid use
      during the first 30 days post-release. We hypothesize an XR-NTX arm will report significantly
      lower rates of sustained opioid relapse following release.
