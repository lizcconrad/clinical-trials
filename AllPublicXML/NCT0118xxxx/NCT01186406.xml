  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of Gliadel wafers at
      the time of surgery, followed by the combination of radiation, Temodar, and Avastin, and then
      the combination of Avastin and Temodar, after radiation is complete, on malignant brain
      tumors.

      About six weeks after surgery, subjects will begin standard radiation therapy, a fixed dose
      of Avastin every 2 weeks, and daily Temodar for the six and a half weeks of radiation.
      Beginning 2-3 weeks after the last radiation therapy, subjects will be given the same fixed
      dose of Avastin intravenously (through the vein) every 14 days. They will also be given a
      higher dose of oral Temodar to take daily the first 5 days of each 28-day study cycle.
