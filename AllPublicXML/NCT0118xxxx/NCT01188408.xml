  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LE-DT is a novel, proprietary delivery system of docetaxel developed by NeoPharm, Inc.
      Docetaxel (currently marketed as Taxotere) is an anti-microtubular network agent and is one
      of the most active agents in the treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer
      (CRPC) and other variety of cancers. Taxotere has poor solubility and is designed to be
      administered with Tween 80 in ethanol. This vehicle causes acute hypersensitivity reaction.
      By removing toxic detergent used in Taxotere, the form of LE-DT, shows reduced toxicity and
      comparable therapeutic efficacy in pre-clinical study. The clinical evidence obtained from
      the NeoPharm Phase I study shows fewer side effects and possibly administered at higher dose
      to induce greater effectiveness of LE-DT. The current Phase II study is designed to
      accomplish the following objectives:

        1. Assess the antitumor effect indicator serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) following
           the intravenous (IV) administration of 110 mg/m2 LE-DT every three weeks in patients
           with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer

        2. To evaluate the measurable soft tissue disease response using the response evaluation
           criteria in solid tumor (RECIST) methodology

        3. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)

        4. To correlate PSA expression with tumor response

        5. To evaluate the safety of LE-DT at 110 mg/m2 level, in particular peripheral neuropathy,
           water retention as well as myelotoxicity

        6. To evaluate the quality of life (QOL)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be 18 years or older and male.

          2. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the
             prostate.

          3. Patients without evidence of PSA progression must have clinical or radiographic
             evidence of metastatic disease.

          4. Must have castrate levels of testosterone (serum testosterone less than 50ng/dl) by
             either being on androgen ablation therapy with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
             (LHRH) agonist or have had a prior bilateral orchiectomy.

          5. Patients must have documented evidence of disease progression: progressive disease is
             defined as a minimum of three consecutive elevations in PSA each obtained a minimum of
             one week apart with the last value being greater than 2 ng/mL and/or new metastatic
             lesions on bone scan (minimum of 2) and/or new or progressive disease on CT or MRI
             scan.

                  antiandrogen second line therapy, the patient must demonstrate progression of
                  disease at least 4 weeks beyond discontinuation of such agents to rule out an
                  antiandrogen withdrawal response.
