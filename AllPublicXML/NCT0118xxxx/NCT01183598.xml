      This open-label, single center study will provide RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) to a
      maximum of 4 patients with Multicentric Castelman's Disease who have demonstrated benefit
      from RoActemra/Actemra in study MRA004US (Chugai Pharma USA) without major toxicities or
      significant adverse events. Patients will receive their most effective maintenance dose until
      disease progression or significant toxicity occurs.
