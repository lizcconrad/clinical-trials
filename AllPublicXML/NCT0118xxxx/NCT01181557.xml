      The aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate the prediction accuracy of EORTC
      QLQ-C30/C38 questionnaire in rectal cancer patient(RC). This study was designed to
      investigate how the quality of life (QoL) of patients with rectal cancer changes with time
      after cancer or after stomia.

      Eligible subjects were consecutively enrolled in the investigators' Institute and subjected
      to EORTC QLQ-C30/C38 questionnaire.

      Eligibility criteria: Italian people with adenocarcinoma of rectum. Exclusion criteria
      consisted of age younger than 18 years, history of psychiatric illness, and preoperative
      radiotherapy.

      Outcome measures: patient was carried out using a EORTC QLQ-C30/C38 questionnaire.To
      determine how surgery affects QoL, we divided patients into two groups: first rectal cancer
      submitted to rectal anterior resection(RAR) and latter rectal cancer submitted to rectal
      anterior resection with stomia(RARS). Differences in QoL between the two groups were analyzed
      during three time: first preoperative, second postoperative and latter six month later of
      after the stoma reconversion in RARS patients
