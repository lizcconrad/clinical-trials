    <textblock>
      This study is designed to demonstrate the value of Procalcitonin (PCT) in assisting the rapid
      diagnosis of post- operative infection that includes elevation of Procalcitonin above and
      beyond the changes seen with the acute and inflammatory response induced by cardio-pulmonary
      bypass.

      Procalcitonin is an innovative and highly specific biomarker for clinically relevant severe
      bacterial infections and sepsis. PCT supports early diagnosis and clinical decision
      making.This is a prospective single center study designed to assess the normal change in PCT
      levels following major surgery and the utilization of PCT regarding the diagnosis of
      infection and the response to treatment, following major cardiac surgery
