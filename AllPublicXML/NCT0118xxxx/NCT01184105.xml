      A phase I, single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, safety and
      pharmacokinetic study to evaluate systemic and local vaginal exposure to lidocaine and
      prilocaine and the metabolites, 2,6-dimethylaniline (2,6-DMA) and o-toluidine, in female
      healthy volunteer subjects following daily application of 60 mg PSD502 or placebo to the
      vagina and cervix for seven days

    <textblock>
      The study drug is a metered-dose anesthetic spray, which is being developed for the treatment
      of premature ejaculation (PE). The use of anesthetic in topical creams has been well
      established. The use of a cream does not result in the concentrated drug being in direct
      contact with the cells, unlike the spray.

      Seven clinical studies have already been carried out for the spray in the development of PE.
      These studies have demonstrated a prolongation of intravaginal ejaculatory latency time and
      no safety concerns for male patients or their female partners. The partners of clinical study
      participants have been asked to report health changes during the studies. Reports of vaginal
      numbness were uncommon; however, effects of the transfer to a partner cannot be excluded.
      This study is being conducted to investigate in detail the systemic exposure to PSD502 spray
      in order to assess safety in the female partner. The dose level has been chosen because the
      total dose applied to the male glans penis is 30 mg, and thus it is potentially possible that
      his partner could be exposed to this dose. Therefore, the 60 mg dose was chosen to provide
      safety information with a higher margin of exposure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female non-smokers aged 18 years old and over

             investigator

          -  Negative Papanicolaou (Pap) smear performed during gynecological examination at
             screening (i.e., Pap smear result that reads negative for any intraepithelial lesions
             and reparative or reactive changes and with no sign or presence of infection [e.g.,
             bacterial vaginosis, candida, bacterial flora, etc])
