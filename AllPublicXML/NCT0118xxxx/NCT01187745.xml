  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients suspected of having a kidney stone are usually evaluated by computed tomography (CT)
      scan. The investigators hypothesize that ultrasound (U/S) should be sufficient to evaluate
      kidneys for suspected renal stones.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients aged 18 years of age and over who are undergoing a renal stone protocol for
      evaluation of flank pain will be included.

      Pregnant patients will not be included.
