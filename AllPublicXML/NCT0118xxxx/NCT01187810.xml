    <textblock>
      The purposee of this study is to determine the safety and dosing of Fenretinide when given
      continuously for 5 days, every 3 weeks, in pediatric patients with recurrent and/or resistant
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma (NHL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fenretinide is a cytotoxic retinoid that has activity against a variety of cell lines in
      vitro in a dose-related manner. The exact mechanism of fenretinide cytotoxicity in leukemia
      and lymphoma cell lines is not known, but may include the de novo ceramide synthesis of
      ceramides and the generation of reactive oxygen species. The malignancy-specific nature of
      fenretinide-induced ceramides suggests that combinations of the drug with other ceramide
      modulating agents may have a favorable therapeutic index.

      In this study, the primary aims are to define the maximum tolerated dose, toxicity profile,
      and pharmacokinetics of IV fenretinide when given continuously in pediatric patients with
      ALL, AML, and NHL. The drug will be administered via a central venous or percutaneous
      indwelling central catheter in an inpatient hospital setting.
