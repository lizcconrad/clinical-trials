  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is associated with elevated plasma levels of IL-6 and
      TNF-α, which cannot be accounted for by obesity (Vgontzas et al Sleep Med Rev 2005;9:211-24,
      Ciftci et al Cytokine 2004;28:87-91].

      Obstructive apneas-hypopneas are accompanied by strenuous diaphragmatic contractions before
      the ensuing arousals and re-establishment of airway patency. We have shown that strenuous
      diaphragmatic contractions induced by resistive loading lead to elevated plasma levels of
      IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β (Vassi-lakopoulos et al AJRCCM 2002;166:1572-8) with concomitant
      up-regulation of the cytokines within the diaphragmatic myofibers (Vassilakopoulos et al
      AJRCCM 2004;170:154-61).

      OSAS patients exhibit frequent episodes of hypoxemia during the night. Loaded breathing is a
      form exercise for the respiratory muscles, and both acute and chronic hypoxia lead to an
      augmented plasma IL-6 response to exercise compared to normoxia (Lundby et al Eur J Appl
      Physiol 2004;91:88-93).

      In OSAS, monocytes have oxidative stress (Dyugovskaya et al AJRCCM 2002;165:934-9) and
      produce more cytokines (TNF-α) in vitro (Minoguchi et al Chest 204;126:1473-9).

      Hypothesis #1: plasma levels of IL-6 and TNF-α are increased during the night in OSAS
      patients secondary to the intermittent strenuous diaphragmatic contractions and the episodes
      of hypoxia-reoxygenation associated with the obstructive apneas-hypopneas.

      Hypothesis #2: monocytes from sleep apnea patients, exhibit augmented intracellular
      expression of IL-6 and TNF-α during the night.

      Hypothesis #3: Oxidative stress is a stimulus for cytokine upregulation in OSAS.
