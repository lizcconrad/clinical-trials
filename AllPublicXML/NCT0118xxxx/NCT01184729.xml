      The goals of this project are to 1)determine the responsiveness of the 6 Minute Push Test
      (6MPT) and 2) explore the relationship between 6MPT distance and measures of handicap,
      wheelchair satisfaction, depression, and self-reported avoidance of environmental features.

      The 6 minute walk test is a widely used assessment of aerobic capacity, function, and
      functional change in the ambulatory population. A similar clinical and research outcome
      instrument that is responsive to changes in aerobic capacity and function are lacking for
      persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). A 6 minute push test, adapted from the 6 minute walk
      test may fill the void. The primary aim of this project is to assess if distance traveled in
      6 minutes of wheelchair propulsion changes after an increase in aerobic capacity. We
      hypothesize that participants will push farther in 6 minutes after their aerobic capacity
      increases. The secondary aim is to explore the correlation between 6MPT distance and
      handicap, depression, wheelchair satisfaction, and self-reported avoidance of environmental
      features. We hypothesize increasing 6MPTdistance will be correlated with decreasing
      depression, decreasing handicap, decreasing self-reported avoidance of environmental
      features, and increasing wheelchair satisfaction. This is a low risk, high benefit study.

    <measure>Change in Oxygen uptake during 6 min Push Test From baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>Visits 1-4</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be prepared by putting a flexible mask over the mouth and nose. Heart rate during testing will be monitored by either three electrodes on the chest or by a monitor strapped around the chest. Heart rate and oxygen consumption during each 6MPT will be measured. Participants will be instructed to propel as far as possible on a 30m loop marked at 3m intervals, with 15m between pylons, and two 180 degree turns. Distance traveled in 6 minutes (m) will be computed by multiplying the number of full laps completed by 15m and adding the distance traveled in the last lap.</description>
