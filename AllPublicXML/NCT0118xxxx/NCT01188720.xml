    <textblock>
      Preliminary findings from a trial in the investigators laboratory suggest that acute exercise
      may ameliorate deficits in sexual arousal associated with use of antidepressants. The goal of
      this project is to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of an exercise-based intervention
      for these side effects in a community-based sample. The investigators hypothesize that
      general exercise will help improve sexual functioning in women taking antidepressants, and
      that exercise immediately before sexual activity - that is, acute exercise - will have an
      additional beneficial effect above and beyond that of general exercise.

             Additionally, women will be excluded if they are found to have any of the following as
             measured during the fitness assessment of the first session: a BMI over 40, waist

          -  factors associated with significant genital nerve damage, including: previous major
             pelvic surgery that may have caused nerve damage, including hysterectomy, vulvectomy,
