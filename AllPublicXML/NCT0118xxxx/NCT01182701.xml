    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a two arm randomized controlled trial with longitudinal follow-up that
      compares cognitive behavioral interventions (ENHANCE) to a control group with attention. The
      experiment will consist of a repeated measure 2 X 3 design; Condition (Experiment vs.
      Control) by Time (Pre, Post, Follow Up).
