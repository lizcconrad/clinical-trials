  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitech Respiration Ltd has developed the AnapnoGuard system, an innovative system intended
      to enhance optimal endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff inflation, by monitoring carbon dioxide (CO2)
      in upper airways of mechanically ventilated patients. Optimal ETT cuff inflation will lead to
      a reduction of complication rate related to mechanical ventilation procedure.

      This study was design in order to evaluate the feasibility of using the AnapnoGuard system.
