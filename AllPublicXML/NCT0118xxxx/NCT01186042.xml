      The purpose of this study is to find the best tests to use to investigate the differences
      between older and younger people with HIV disease. Test to be included will measures of
      memory, learning, activity levels, sleep patterns, emotional well-being and sexual health.

    <textblock>
      Advances in the treatment of chronic HIV disease over the last 20 years have resulted in
      dramatic declines in morbidity and mortality. However, emerging data suggest that chronically
      infected patients may be aging prematurely, and/or experience increased incidence of
      age-related conditions. These phenomena are poorly understood. The overall goal of the CHAIN
      project is to support the expansion of innovative research on the effects of chronic HIV
      infection, co-morbidities, and aging on the central nervous system (CNS). We propose the
      initiation of a clinical portion to better understand the nature of the aging process in
      HIV-infected patients, with an emphasis on brain disease. This is a pilot, feasibility study
      to inform the design of a larger, prospective cohort study.

      We plan to enroll 20 older HIV-infected patients (more than 50 years old) and 20 younger
      controls (20-40 years old), matched for gender and race/ethnicity. Participants will undergo
      a series of tests, at one comprehensive assessment. Demographic and medical history data will
      be abstracted from the medical record. Each participant will undergo a medical history and
      physical examination, and a battery of tests designed to evaluate neuropsychological
      function, activity, sleep patterns, frailty, emotional well-being and sexual health. These
      will consist of self-administered questionnaires and neuropsychological tests, as detailed in
      the Methods section. Innovative measures will be included such as an activity monitor worn by
      participants, and a Wii balance board to assess standing balance. Participants will be asked
      to keep a diary and wear the activity monitoring device for one month. Plasma and serum
      samples will be collected on one occasion for future testing of potential biomarkers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with HIV infection.

          -  20-40 years of age or older than 50.

          -  If taking antiretroviral therapy, on stable therapy for the past 12 weeks and not
             anticipated to require a change in therapy during the following 6 weeks.

          -  If not taking antiretroviral therapy, not anticipated to initiate therapy in the next
             6 weeks.

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent.

          -  Ability to complete the questionnaires in English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Completion of treatment for any intercurrent acute infection less than four weeks
             before study entry. Maintenance or prophylactic therapy is permitted for opportunistic
             infections.

          -  Any active psychiatric illness including schizophrenia, severe depression, or severe
             bipolar affective disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, could confound
             performance of or the analysis of the test results.

             compliance with study procedures or confound the analysis of the test results.

          -  Major neurologic disease such as multiple sclerosis or stroke, active brain infection
             (except for HIV-1), brain neoplasm, or space-occupying brain lesion.
