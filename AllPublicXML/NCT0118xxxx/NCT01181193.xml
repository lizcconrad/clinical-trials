    <textblock>
      This is non-randomized phase 2 study to assess efficacy and toxicity of long term high dose
      vitamin D3 given concurrently with chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) containing temozolomide followed
      by adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) with temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma multiforme GBM). Preoperative diagnosis of GBM will be based on magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. All patient will underwent craniotomy with partial or
      total resection of a visible tumour mass. All patients will be planned for postoperative
      three-dimensional conformal RT (3-DCRT) or intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) to residual tumour
      and/or resection bed. A total RT dose of 54-60 Gy will be delivered using 2 Gy daily
      fractions given over 5 days a week. Daily chemotherapy with temozolomide in the dose of 75
      mg/m2/day will be started at the first day of RT, and will be continued for entire period of
      RT inclusive week-end breaks. ACT will contain 6 cycles of oral temozolomide 150-200
      mg/m2/day given for 5 days every 4 weeks. Oral vitamin D3 will be administered in daily dose
      of 4000 IU. Vitamin D3 therapy will be started 1 week prior to commencing CCRT, and will be
      terminated immediately after completing last cycle of ACT. MRI scan of the brain will be
      performed at 4 months after completing CCRT, and than will be repeated every 4 months for
      first 2 years, and every 6 months for subsequent years. The study participants will be
      followed until disease progression or death. The study is expected to complete within 4
      years.
