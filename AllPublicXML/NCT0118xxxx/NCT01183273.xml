      Background Laparoscopy is the preferred surgical approach for a number of different diseases
      as it allows for diagnosis and treatment in the setting of a safe and feasible method
      offering enhanced cosmesis. The natural evolution of laparoscopy is micro-laparoscopy which
      utilizes smaller instruments and optics. Technological advancements have enabled
      miniaturization of the surgical equipment without compromising diagnostic or operative
      capabilities.

      Dr. Keith Zuccala is currently performing micro-laparoscopic gastric bypass with an identical
      safety profile as traditional laparoscopy (NSQIP data comparison between Dr. Laura Choi and
      Dr. Keith Zuccala). The current trend in laparoscopy is to minimize incisions and their size
      to decrease trauma to the abdominal wall.

      Study Design Both methods have never been compared in a prospective randomized trial to
      address the following questions.

        1. Is there a difference in outcome?

        2. Is there a decrease in postoperative pain?

        3. Does it decrease time off from work?

        4. Does micro-laparoscopy increase OR time?

        5. What is the effect on cost of micro-laparoscopy? Patients will be randomized to one or
           the other method, disclosing that to the investigators best knowledge both methods are
           equally safe and that Dr. Zuccala has performed several hundred cases using both
           methods.

      Patient Population Projected sample size would be 50 patients in each group. Accrual should
      be feasible over the course of 9-12 months.

      Data collection (patients will be followed for a total of 30 days for the purpose of this
      study)

        1. NSQIP data to assess outcome

        2. Postoperative usage of pain medication while in the hospital

        3. Time off from work

        4. OR time

        5. Direct cost of procedure as it relates to material used

      This study compares two groups of patients who have voluntarily chosen to undergo roux-n-y
      gastric bypass surgery. The groups will be randomized to receive micro-laparoscopic or
      laparoscopic surgery to be performed by the same surgeon, Dr. Keith Zuccala.

      Study Schema

        -  The patient attends an informational seminar conducted by the Bariatric Surgery
           Department

        -  The patient is scheduled for an initial consultation with the bariatric PA/NP where the
           patient provides: a letter of referral for Bariatric Surgery from primary care doctor or
           specialty physician; insurance referral; and assurance that health insurance coverage
           includes Bariatric Surgery.

        -  Following the initial consultation, the patient is scheduled for the following:
           comprehensive blood testing; psychological screening/evaluation; dietary evaluation;
           appointment with the surgeon; pulmonary evaluation (if needed); cardiology evaluation
           (if needed); gastroenterology evaluation (if needed).

        -  An appointment for medical clearance with the referring surgeon is scheduled and
           completed within three weeks of surgery. At this appointment an electrocardiogram (EKG)
           and repeat blood work will be carried out.

        -  The patient is deemed to meet all inclusion criteria.

        -  The patient is advised to follow all pre-operative instructions as advised by the
           nursing staff and explained in the Danbury Hospital Center for Weight Loss Surgery
           Guide.

        -  Surgical procedures performed are standard for those already utilized daily in the
           surgery department for gastric bypass procedures.

        -  The patient is closely observed in the hospital and given specific discharge
           instructions upon leaving the hospital

        -  The patient is followed for a maximum of 60 days after surgery and asked how many days
           of work they missed.

        -  The NSQIP data base and patient medical record are used to assess outcome, postoperative
           pain, OR time and surgery cost
