      The research proposed in this collaborative application Implementation and Evaluation of
      Formal Training for Mentors of K-Series Mentored Career Development Awards will uniquely
      study mentor training in the biomedical academic community. The randomized controlled trial
      will be conducted at 15 Clinical and Translational Science Award sites over a 21-month period
      with six months for baseline data collection, nine months for the intervention, three months
      for follow-up, and three months for analysis. The multi-site trial will be conducted to
      determine whether the resultant skills-focused, case-based, mentor training program can
      improve the mentoring skills of K series mentors.

      The trial will be conducted over a 21-month period with six months for baseline data
      collection, nine months for the intervention, three months for follow-up, and three months
      for analysis. The trial will be conducted to determine whether the resultant skills-focused,
      case-based, mentor training program can improve the mentoring skills of K series mentors. Our
      modified Wisconsin Mentoring Seminar Curriculum will consist of four 2-hour sessions
      administered within an 8-week period, using trained facilitators. Scholars will include all
      recipients of a K-Series Award at the 3 CTSA sites (e.g., K01, K08, K12, K23, K24, K99, KL2),
      who will be funded during the two-year cycle of this Administrative Supplement. We will
      randomly assign 300 K-award mentors of these scholars to a control group (n=150) or to the
      experimental intervention (n=150).
