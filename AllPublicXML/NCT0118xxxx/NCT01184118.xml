  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to find out if the use of inhaled corticosteroids has an affect
      on upper airway (UAW) collapsibility and sleep apnea risk. An inhaled corticosteroid is a
      common asthma controller medication like Flovent. Sleep apnea or sleep deprived breathing
      (SDB) is when someone stops breathing for a short period of time during sleep. For some
      reason, people with asthma have more sleep apnea and upper airway (UAW) collapsibility
      (weakness) than the general population. There are many possible reasons for this and one
      might be related to the use of inhaled corticosteroids.

      The overall hypothesis of this study is to determine whether inhaled fluticasone propionate
      (FP) increases UAW collapsibility and to assess tongue (genioglossus muscle) dysfunction as a
      potential underlying mechanism.

      To address this hypothesis, we specifically aim is to determine the effects of 16 weeks of
      treatment with inhaled FP hydrofluoroalkane-propelled metered dose inhaler (HFA-MDI), 880 mcg
      twice daily, on:

      Specific Aim 1: UAW collapsibility, as measured by Pcrit during NREM sleep; Specific Aim 2:
      Severity of obstructive SDB and sleep quality, and quality of life related to sleep apnea
      assessed on validated questionnaires (Sleep Apnea scale of the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire
      [SA-SDQ], Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI], and
      Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index [SAQLI]); Specific Aim 3: Tongue strength and fatigability
      (assessed using the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument)

    <description>Secondary goals include evaluating effects of this medication on severity of obstructive sleep disordered breathing (SDB) (validated by Sleep Disorders Questionnaire (SA-SDQ)).

    <description>The Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI) will be used. This instrument has a standard-sized air-filled polymer balloon, called tongue sensor or bulb, which can be inserted between the tongue blade and the roof of the mouth.
