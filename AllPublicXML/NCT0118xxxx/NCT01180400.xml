    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if TC-5214 or placebo (a tablet that looks like
      medicine tablet or capsule, but contains no active medicine) is safe and effective when taken
      together with another antidepressant.

    <measure>Change in EuroQol - 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) From Randomization (Week 8) to End of Treatment (Week 16)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization (Week 8) to end of treatment (Week 16)</time_frame>
    <description>A self-assessment questionnaire that provides 2 measures of health status. The EQ-5D index score is a weighted linear combination over 5 dimensions of health status. The score for each of the 5 dimensions can range from 1 to 3, and an equation is used to calculate the EQ-5D index score. The EQ-5D index score can range from possible negative values (minimum -0.415) to a maximum of 1.0. The EQ-VAS is a visual analog scale with a range of 0 to 100. For both variables, a higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

          <title>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 items (HAMD-17) total score at randomization</title>
          <description>A 17-item, clinician-rated scale that assesses depressive symptoms. The HAMD-17 consists of 17 symptoms, each of which is rated from 0 to 2 or 0 to 4, where 0 is none/absent. The HAMD-17 total score is calculated as the sum of the 17 individual symptom scores; the total score can range from 0 to 52. Higher HAMD-17 scores indicate more severe depression.</description>

        <title>Change in Depressive Symptoms From Randomization (Week 8) to End of Treatment (Week 16) as Measured by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 Items (HAMD-17) Total Score</title>
        <description>A 17-item, clinician-rated scale that assesses depressive symptoms. The HAMD-17 consists of 17 symptoms, each of which is rated from 0 to 2 or 0 to 4, where 0 is none/absent. The HAMD-17 total score is calculated as the sum of the 17 individual symptom scores; the total score can range from 0 to 52. Higher HAMD-17 scores indicate more severe depression.</description>

        <description>The Q-LES-Q-SF (Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form) measures the patient’s satisfaction with medication and overall quality of life.

        <title>Change in EuroQol - 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) From Randomization (Week 8) to End of Treatment (Week 16)</title>
        <description>A self-assessment questionnaire that provides 2 measures of health status. The EQ-5D index score is a weighted linear combination over 5 dimensions of health status. The score for each of the 5 dimensions can range from 1 to 3, and an equation is used to calculate the EQ-5D index score. The EQ-5D index score can range from possible negative values (minimum -0.415) to a maximum of 1.0. The EQ-VAS is a visual analog scale with a range of 0 to 100. For both variables, a higher score indicates a better health state.</description>
