  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to determine if there is a difference between two treatment
      methods of spine joints that are not moving as they should as determined by tenderness over
      the spine and activity of the muscles along side the spine with movement.

      The hypothesis is that there will be no difference between the two types of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two specialised instruments used for treating manipulable lesions of the spine will be
      compared using muscle relaxation response of the erector spinae muscles and correction of the
      spinal manipulable lesion.

    <measure>Pressure pain threshold over the spinous process</measure>
    <time_frame>An average of 5 minutes from the end of the first treatment</time_frame>
    <description>An instrument used to measure pressure in kilograms is placed over the spinous process of the vertebra involved and the level of pressure is recorded when the sensation of pressure changes to pain.</description>

    <time_frame>An average of 5 minutes from the end of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Surface electromyography will be used pre-treatment and post-treatment to determine if a change in muscle activity occurs with flexing the lumbar spine.</description>
