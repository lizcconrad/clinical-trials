          -  The patient has a concomitant disease likely to interfere with the study medication
             (e.g. capable of altering absorption, metabolism or elimination of the study drug).

          -  The patient has a history of psychosis (e.g. schizophrenia or psychotic depression),
             either previously or currently, or a score ≥ 3 on Item 2 (thought disorder) or 3

          -  The patient has hypersenstivity or contraindications to MAO B inhibitors.

          -  The patient has a current history of severe dizziness or fainting on standing, due to
             postural hypotension.

             disease.

          -  The patient has participated in a previous clinical trial within 30 days of entry into
             the study (screening visit) or has received treatment with any investigational
             compound within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to screening. The

             visit. Note: Use of SSRIs will be permitted, provided the dose is kept as low as
             possible and remains stable throughout the trial.

          -  The patient is receiving treatment of his/her parkinsonian symptoms with a MAO
             inhibitor. Note: Patients receiving amantadine, COMT inhibitors, DA agonists and/or

             dose at screening.

          -  The patient has received treatment with any agent known to significantly inhibit or
             induce drug-metabolizing enyzmes (e.g., barbiturates, phenothiazines, etc.) within 4

          -  The patient has received treatment with a depot neuroleptic within one injection
             cycle, or oral neuroleptics within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit. Patients who
             are receiving a low dose of an oral neuroleptic for treatment of psychotic symptoms
             (e.g., hallucinations) related to their Parkinson's disease or anti-parkinsonian
             medication, and who meet all other entry criteria, will be considered for enrollment,
             with approval of the CRO Medical Monitor. The Investigator must agree not to increase
             the dose of the oral neuroleptic during the trial, unless required for significant
             worsening.

          -  The patient has received treatment with a drug that has hepatotoxic potential, e.g.,
             tamoxifen, within 4 weeks, or received radiation therapy or a drug with cytotoxic
             potential, e.g, chemotherapy, within one year prior to the screening visit.

          -  The patient has a history or a current diagnosis of HIV, tests positive for Hepatitis
             B surface antigen, tests positive for Hepatitis B core antibody, but negative for

          -  The patient has any abnormality that the investigator deems to be clinically relevant,
             either on medical history, physical examination, ECG or a diagnostic laboratory test.

          -  In the judgment of the Clinical Investigator the patient is likely to be non-compliant
             or uncooperative during the study.

          -  Ophthalmologic history including any of the following conditions: albino patients,
             family history of hereditary retinal disease, progressive and/or severe diminution of
             visual acuity (i.e., 20/70), retinitis pigmentosa, retinal pigmentation due to any
             cause, any active retinopathy or ocular inflammation (uveitis), or progressive, severe
             diabetic retinopathy.
