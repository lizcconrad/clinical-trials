  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are: to evaluate the safety and tolerability of rFVIIIFc
      administered as a prophylaxis (Arm 1), weekly (Arm 2), on-demand (Arm 3), and surgical
      treatment regimen; to evaluate the efficacy of the rFVIIIFc tailored prophylaxis regimen (Arm
      1); to evaluate the efficacy of rFVIIIFc administered as an on-demand (Arm 3) and surgical
      treatment regimen. The secondary objectives of this study are: to characterize the PK profile
      of rFVIIIFc and compare the PK of rFVIIIFc with the currently marketed product, Advate®; to
      characterize the range of dose and schedules required to adequately prevent bleeding in a
      prophylaxis regimen, maintain hemostasis in a surgical setting, or to treat bleeding episodes
      in an on-demand, weekly treatment, or prophylaxis setting.

    <textblock>
      Participants are assigned to one of three treatment regimens: 1) a tailored prophylaxis
      regimen, 2) a weekly dosing regimen, or 3) an on-demand regimen. Treatment continued for 28
      (±2) to 52 (±2) weeks. PK assessments for all participants are conducted on varying
      schedules, according to participants' group assignments. Additionally, two subgroups are
      defined. One subgroup of participants undergo PK profiling with a single dose of the
      comparator Advate®. A second subgroup consists of participants from any of the treatment arms
      that required surgery during the study. Depending upon country location, participants might
      have the option of continuing treatment within study 8HA01EXT (NCT01454739).

    <time_frame>up to 52 weeks ± 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An inhibitor test result ≥0.6 Bethesda units (BU)/mL, identified and confirmed by re-testing of a second sample obtained within 2 to 4 weeks, was considered positive. Both tests were to be performed using the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda Assay by the central laboratory. The incidence rates along with the 95% confidence interval (CI) were summarized for all titers for subjects with 50 or more exposure days (EDs) to rFVIIIFc and a valid inhibitor test after the 50th exposure. In addition, the incidence rates for all subjects regardless of their exposure days to rFVIIIFc were also summarized. The 95% CI was calculated using Clopper-Pearson exact method.</description>

    <description>On rFVIIIFc Day 0, all participants underwent pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis with 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc to estimate their PK parameters and guide the appropriate dose or interval of dosing. A subset of participants (Sequential PK subgroup) also had PK analyses performed with a single dose of 50 IU/kg Advate (Advate Day 0) within 8 weeks prior to rFVIIIFc Day 0. A &gt;= 96 hour washout was performed before the PK dose of Advate or rFVIIIFc was administered. Repeat PK profiling with a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc was conducted at Week 14 or after 12 to 24 weeks of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc.
After PK assessments, all participants started twice weekly treatment with 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc via intravenous (IV) injection on Day 1 and 50 IU/kg on Day 4, followed by individualized dose and interval modification within the range of 25 to 65 IU/kg every 3 to 5 days, as determined by rFVIIIFc PK analysis, to maintain a trough level of 1% to 3% (or higher, as clinically indicated) FVIII activity.</description>

          <title>Arm 1: Individualized (Tailored) Prophylaxis</title>
          <description>On rFVIIIFc Day 0, all participants underwent pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis with 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc to estimate their PK parameters and guide the appropriate dose or interval of dosing. A subset of participants (Sequential PK subgroup) also had PK analyses performed with a single dose of 50 IU/kg Advate (Advate Day 0) within 8 weeks prior to rFVIIIFc Day 0. A &gt;= 96 hour washout was performed before the PK dose of Advate or rFVIIIFc was administered. Repeat PK profiling with a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc was conducted at Week 14 or after 12 to 24 weeks of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc.
After PK assessments, all participants started twice weekly treatment with 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc via intravenous (IV) injection on Day 1 and 50 IU/kg on Day 4, followed by individualized dose and interval modification within the range of 25 to 65 IU/kg every 3 to 5 days, as determined by rFVIIIFc PK analysis, to maintain a trough level of 1% to 3% (or higher, as clinically indicated) FVIII activity.</description>

            <description>On rFVIIIFc Day 0, all participants underwent pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis with 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc to estimate their PK parameters and guide the appropriate dose or interval of dosing. A subset of participants (Sequential PK subgroup) also had PK analyses performed with a single dose of 50 IU/kg Advate (Advate Day 0) within 8 weeks prior to rFVIIIFc Day 0. A &gt;= 96 hour washout was performed before the PK dose of Advate or rFVIIIFc was administered. Repeat PK profiling with a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc was conducted at Week 14 or after 12 to 24 weeks of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc.
After PK assessments, all participants started twice weekly treatment with 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc via intravenous (IV) injection on Day 1 and 50 IU/kg on Day 4, followed by individualized dose and interval modification within the range of 25 to 65 IU/kg every 3 to 5 days, as determined by rFVIIIFc PK analysis, to maintain a trough level of 1% to 3% (or higher, as clinically indicated) FVIII activity.</description>

            <description>On rFVIIIFc Day 0, all participants underwent pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis with 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc to estimate their PK parameters and guide the appropriate dose or interval of dosing. A subset of participants (Sequential PK subgroup) also had PK analyses performed with a single dose of 50 IU/kg Advate (Advate Day 0) within 8 weeks prior to rFVIIIFc Day 0. A &gt;= 96 hour washout was performed before the PK dose of Advate or rFVIIIFc was administered. Repeat PK profiling with a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc was conducted at Week 14 or after 12 to 24 weeks of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc.
After PK assessments, all participants started twice weekly treatment with 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc via intravenous (IV) injection on Day 1 and 50 IU/kg on Day 4, followed by individualized dose and interval modification within the range of 25 to 65 IU/kg every 3 to 5 days, as determined by rFVIIIFc PK analysis, to maintain a trough level of 1% to 3% (or higher, as clinically indicated) FVIII activity.</description>

            <description>On rFVIIIFc Day 0, all participants underwent pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis with 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc to estimate their PK parameters and guide the appropriate dose or interval of dosing. A subset of participants (Sequential PK subgroup) also had PK analyses performed with a single dose of 50 IU/kg Advate (Advate Day 0) within 8 weeks prior to rFVIIIFc Day 0. A &gt;= 96 hour washout was performed before the PK dose of Advate or rFVIIIFc was administered. Repeat PK profiling with a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc was conducted at Week 14 or after 12 to 24 weeks of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc.
After PK assessments, all participants started twice weekly treatment with 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc via intravenous (IV) injection on Day 1 and 50 IU/kg on Day 4, followed by individualized dose and interval modification within the range of 25 to 65 IU/kg every 3 to 5 days, as determined by rFVIIIFc PK analysis, to maintain a trough level of 1% to 3% (or higher, as clinically indicated) FVIII activity.</description>

The efficacy period in Arm 3 began at the time of last PK rFVIIIFc sampling timepoint and ended at the date of the last study visit. Periods of PK evaluations and surgery/rehabilitation are not included in the efficacy period.</description>

        <description>Please see Outcome Measure 20 for a definition of the efficacy period. A bleeding episode started from the first sign of a bleed, and ended 72 hours after the last treatment for the bleeding, within which any symptoms of bleeding at the same location, or injections less than or equal to 72 hours apart, were considered the same bleeding episode. All injections given from the initial sign of a bleed until the last date/time within the bleed window were counted. The resolution of a bleed was defined as no sign of bleeding following injection for the bleed. Bleeding episodes that presented in multiple locations are included as a single event in the overall summary for the number of injections to resolve that bleeding episode but are included in summaries for each location.</description>

            <description>On rFVIIIFc Day 0, all participants underwent pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis with 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc to estimate their PK parameters and guide the appropriate dose or interval of dosing. A subset of participants (Sequential PK subgroup) also had PK analyses performed with a single dose of 50 IU/kg Advate (Advate Day 0) within 8 weeks prior to rFVIIIFc Day 0. A &gt;= 96 hour washout was performed before the PK dose of Advate or rFVIIIFc was administered. Repeat PK profiling with a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc was conducted at Week 14 or after 12 to 24 weeks of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc.
After PK assessments, all participants started twice weekly treatment with 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc via intravenous (IV) injection on Day 1 and 50 IU/kg on Day 4, followed by individualized dose and interval modification within the range of 25 to 65 IU/kg every 3 to 5 days, as determined by rFVIIIFc PK analysis, to maintain a trough level of 1% to 3% (or higher, as clinically indicated) FVIII activity.</description>

        <title>Hemophilia-Specific Quality of Life Index for Adults (Haem-A-QoL) Questionnaire: Change From Baseline to Week 28</title>
        <description>The Haem-A-QoL consists of items pertaining to 10 domains specific to living with hemophilia and was administered to adult participants (17 years and older). The 10 domains are: physical health, feeling, view of yourself, sports/leisure, school/work, dealing with hemophilia, and treatment (time frame for all 7 domains, during the last month) and future, family planning, and outlook for the future (time frame for all 3 domains, recently). Lower scores represent better QoL; therefore, a negative change from baseline represents improvement during the course of the study. Scores on a scale range between 0 and 100. Participants in Arm 1 were stratified by their prestudy regimen (either prophylaxis or on-demand).</description>

            <description>On rFVIIIFc Day 0, all participants underwent pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis with 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc to estimate their PK parameters and guide the appropriate dose or interval of dosing. A subset of participants (Sequential PK subgroup) also had PK analyses performed with a single dose of 50 IU/kg Advate (Advate Day 0) within 8 weeks prior to rFVIIIFc Day 0. A &gt;= 96 hour washout was performed before the PK dose of Advate or rFVIIIFc was administered. Repeat PK profiling with a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc was conducted at Week 14 or after 12 to 24 weeks of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc.
After PK assessments, all participants started twice weekly treatment with 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc via intravenous (IV) injection on Day 1 and 50 IU/kg on Day 4, followed by individualized dose and interval modification within the range of 25 to 65 IU/kg every 3 to 5 days, as determined by rFVIIIFc PK analysis, to maintain a trough level of 1% to 3% (or higher, as clinically indicated) FVIII activity.</description>

        <title>Hemophilia-Specific Quality of Life Index for Children (Haemo-QoL) Questionnaire: Change From Baseline to Week 14 and Week 28 in Haemo-QoL III Total Score</title>
        <description>The Haemo-QoL III, a quality of life assessment instrument for adolescents with hemophilia, was administered to participants from 13 to 16 years old. This instrument assesses domains specific to living with hemophilia and consists of 12 domains: physical health, feeling, view of yourself, family, friends, others, sports and school, treatment, perceived support, dealing with hemophilia, future, and relationships. Total HAEMO-QoL score is the sum of all raw scores for all subscales for participants for whom at least the minimum number of required questions have been answered. Total scores are presented as the Transformed Scale Score (TSS) from 0-100%, with lower scores indicating a better quality of life. A negative change indicates improvement.</description>

            <title>Arm 1: Individualized (Tailored) Prophylaxis</title>
            <description>On rFVIIIFc Day 0, all participants underwent pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis with 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc to estimate their PK parameters and guide the appropriate dose or interval of dosing. A subset of participants (Sequential PK subgroup) also had PK analyses performed with a single dose of 50 IU/kg Advate (Advate Day 0) within 8 weeks prior to rFVIIIFc Day 0. A &gt;= 96 hour washout was performed before the PK dose of Advate or rFVIIIFc was administered. Repeat PK profiling with a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc was conducted at Week 14 or after 12 to 24 weeks of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc.
After PK assessments, all participants started twice weekly treatment with 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc via intravenous (IV) injection on Day 1 and 50 IU/kg on Day 4, followed by individualized dose and interval modification within the range of 25 to 65 IU/kg every 3 to 5 days, as determined by rFVIIIFc PK analysis, to maintain a trough level of 1% to 3% (or higher, as clinically indicated) FVIII activity.</description>

Prior to rFVIIIFc treatment, on rFVIIIFc Day 0, all participants underwent pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis with rFVIIIFc in order to estimate participant's PK parameters and guide the appropriate dose or interval of dosing. Repeat PK profiling with a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc was conducted at Week 14 or after 12 to 24 weeks of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc.
A subset of participants (Sequential PK Subgroup) also had PK profiling performed with a single dose of 50 IU/kg Advate (Advate Day 0) within 8 weeks prior to rFVIIIFc Day 0. A &gt;= 96 hour washout from Advate or any other FVIII product was performed before the first PK dose of rFVIIIFc was administered.</description>
