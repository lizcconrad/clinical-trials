    <textblock>
      Approximately 200 families corresponding to 800 persons are included in the study. The study
      investigate the efficacy of vitamin D fortification of bread and milk on vitamin D status in
      serum. Participants receive milk and bread twice a week. Half of the participants receive
      vitamin D fortified products and the other half similar non-fortified products. The study
      starts in September and runs for 6 months during winter, the period where it is not possible
      to produce vitamin D in the skin through sunlight exposure. The hypothesis is that the usual
      fall in vitamin D status can be prevented by vitamin D fortified food.
