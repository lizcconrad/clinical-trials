  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the procedural and post-procedural safety and efficacy
      of AeriSeal therapy at up to 4 subsegments during a single treatment session in patients with
      GOLD Stage III/IV homogeneous or heterogeneous emphysema.

    <textblock>
      Emphysema is a progressive, debilitating disease characterized by destruction of lung tissue
      as a result of inflammation caused by exposure to noxious inhaled agents for extended
      periods. The most common cause of this condition is cigarette smoking, although genetic,
      occupational, and environmental causes account for up to 10% of cases. Despite aggressive
      public health initiatives aimed at discouraging the use of cigarettes, smoking-related lung
      diseases remain a significant cause of disability and death worldwide. Due to the number of
      current and new smokers, emphysema is expected to remain a leading cause of morbidity and
      mortality for years to come.

      The AeriSeal System is a novel device system being developed for the treatment of advanced
      emphysema. The AeriSeal System is administered bronchoscopically, and designed to provide the
      physiological benefits of lung volume reduction without the risks and cost of major surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of advanced emphysema as defined by FEV1/FVC&lt;70%
             predicted, FEV1 of &lt;50% predicted, TLC &gt; 100% predicted, and RV &gt; 135% predicted.

          -  Patients must have persistent symptoms despite medical therapy and either not be
             candidates for Lung Volume Reduction Surgery (LVRS) or have elected not to undergo
             LVRS.

          -  Patients must be &gt; 40 years of age, have symptoms despite medical therapy, and have
             none of the prespecified co-morbid conditions that could influence study outcomes or
             their ability to tolerate bronchoscopy.
