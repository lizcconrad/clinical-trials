  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells
      (MSCs) derived from human umbilical cord/placenta at a dose of 1.0E+6 MSC/kg in subject for
      the therapy of severe aplastic anemia (SAA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a condition that involves a low level of red blood cells,
      white blood cells, and platelets without evidence of another bone marrow disease. Patients
      with severe aplastic anemia produce too few blood cells, causing fatigue, easy bruising and
      bleeding, and susceptibility to infections. In many cases, the very low blood counts result
      from an autoimmune process. The patient's own immune system damages their stem cells in bone
      marrow.

      Although immune-suppressing drugs, such as corticosteroids, CsA and ATG, have been used in
      the treatment of SAA, however, many studies have indicated that the overall response rate to
      these drugs is less than 60%. Addition, the severe side effects of these immune-suppressing
      drugs have also been observed. The management of SAA patients therefore remains
      unsatisfactory and targeted therapies are needed. Human MSCs isolated from human umbilical
      cord/placenta have been shown to have immunosuppressive, stimulating hematopoiesis and tissue
      repairing properties. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MSC
      transplantation in the SAA patients.

      This study will last 2 to 3 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either
      MSC transplant and CsA therapy (experimental group) or CsA therapy alone (control group).
      Patients will undergo MSC transplant at the start of the study on Day 0. After 3 months,
      patients will receive the second MSC transplantation. After six and twelve months from the
      first transplantation, patients will be evaluated.
