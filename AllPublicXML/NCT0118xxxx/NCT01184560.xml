      The purpose of this study, conducted academic Pilot research purposes, this is not clear as
      to permit. when orlistat to sibutramine merge if there are additional effects of BMI and
      group, which has an attribute that is greater for the combined effect is to analyze.

        -  Study phase: Investigator-initiated clinical study (Pilot study)

        -  Method of blinding: Double-blind

        -  Control: Placebo-controlled

        -  Assignment method: Randomization (Sibutramine monotherapy group: Orlistat and
           Sibutramine combination group = 1 : 1)

        -  Studied disease: Obesity

        -  Study population: Subjects eligible for inclusion/exclusion criteria

        -  Dosing period: Total 18 weeks Run-in period (2 weeks), dosing period (12 weeks) and
           post-dosing observation period (4 weeks)

      After the screening period, patients eligible for inclusion/exclusion criteria would
      administer Sibutramine placebo and Orlistat placebo during 2 weeks of the run-in period,
      Subsequently, subjects are randomized to 2 groups of the Sibutramine monotherapy group and
      the Orlistat and Sibutramine combination group. Sibutramine monotherapy group would receive
      Sibutramine 10mg once daily and Orlistat placebo three times daily for 12 weeks; the Orlistat
      and Sibutramine combination group would receive Sibutramine 10mg once daily and Orlistat
      120mg three times daily for 12 weeks. After completing the dosing period, the occurrence of
      adverse events would be checked for 4 weeks and the study would be completed.

      Body weight, abdominal CT(Computed Tomography)(visceral fat examination), body fat analysis,
      etc. would be measured before the study initiation and after 14 weeks of treatment, and
      comparatively analyzed. A two sample t-test is conducted for the inter-group comparison and a
      paired t-rest is conducted for the comparison between baseline and after 14 weeks after the
      study initiation.

    <description>A lipase inhibitor used for weight loss. Lipase is an enzyme found in the bowel that assists in lipid absorption by the body. Orlistat blocks this enzyme, reducing the amount of fat the body absorbs by about 30%. It is known as a &quot;fat blocker&quot;. Because more oily fat is left in the bowel to be excreted, Orlistat can cause an oily anal leakage and fecal incontinence</description>
