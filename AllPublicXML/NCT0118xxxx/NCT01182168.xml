  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of gemcitabine and cisplatin plus Everolimus
      (also called RAD001) at different dose levels. We want to find out what effects, good and/or
      bad, this treatment has on you and your cancer.

      Gemcitabine and cisplatin are standard chemotherapy drugs that are commonly used to treat
      advanced urothelial cancer. Everolimus is a pill that works by shutting down some of the
      pathways in cancer cells that make tumors grow. Laboratory studies have shown that Everolimus
      appears to improve the activity of cisplatin against cancer cells.
