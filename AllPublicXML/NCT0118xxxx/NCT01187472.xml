      This protocol was opened to collect long term survival information on subjects enrolled in a
      previous study which evaluated the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and concomitant
      chemoradiotherapy with organ preserving optional surgery on overall survival, time to
      progression, pattern of disease recurrence in patient with locally advanced head and neck
      cancer. The last surviving subject was last treated in 1989, and was lost to follow up in
      2010.

        Eligibility Criteria:

        Eligibility Criteria:

        Subjects previously enrolled in a treatment protocol for locally advanced head and neck
        cancer who met the following criteria:

          1. Patients with Stage IV carcinoma of the nasal or oral cavity, nasopharynx pharynx,
             larynx, paranasal sinuses, cervical esophagus, or hypopharynx are eligible. Patients
             with Stage III carcinoma of the nasopharynx, base of tongue and hypopharynx are also
             eligible. Therapy is given with curative intent.

             Prior to entry in the study the resectability and standard treatment options for each
             patient will be determined during a joint evaluation by a team composed of an
             attending surgeon, a radiation oncologist and a medical oncologist. In addition the
             timing and feasibility of surgery will be determined in each patient prior to
             initiation of therapy. The unequivocal demonstration of distant metastasis confers in
             eligibility.

          2. Measurable disease is not required, but all disease will be carefully evaluated.

          3. Patients must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous
             cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma or lymphoepithelioma.

          4. Patients must have not received prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

          5. Patients must have performance status of &gt;60%

          6. Patients must have a WBC count of &gt;3.5, an ANC count &gt;1500 and a platlet count of
             &gt;100,000.

          7. The serum creatinine must be equal to or less than 1.5 m/dlor the calculated
             creatinine clearance must exceed 50cc/min.

          8. Patient must be free of significant infection or other severe complicating medical
             illness.

          9. Pregnancy will constitute an absolute contraindication to entrance on this protocol.
