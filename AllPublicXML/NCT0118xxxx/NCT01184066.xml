  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 5-year survival after a first diagnosis of breast cancer is 13% lower in black than in
      white American women, an alarming disparity that cannot be explained by stage of disease at
      presentation. Nonadherence to breast cancer treatment and treatment delays from diagnosis to
      initiation of treatment may be among the reasons for worse breast cancer outcomes in black
      women. This recognition is critical because it suggests that breast cancer survival disparity
      can be decreased through clinical interventions that increase adherence to chemotherapy. The
      ACTS (Attitudes, Communication, Treatment, Support) Intervention is a onetime, intensive
      psycho-educational intervention using a race-matched breast cancer survivor interventionist
      to: address Attitudes, including perceptions and stressors, that may impact adherence to
      clinical visits and treatment; encourage and model patient Communication with health care
      providers regarding physical and emotional needs, with attention to race-discordant
      situations; and provide tailored, understandable information about Treatment and its
      rationale. The Support component is threaded throughout the intervention via the presence of
      a race-matched breast cancer survivor and supportive video messages from the black community.
      This study is a randomized controlled trial that will test the efficacy of the ACTS
      Intervention vs. Usual Care on the primary outcomes of adherence to recommended breast cancer
      chemotherapy.
