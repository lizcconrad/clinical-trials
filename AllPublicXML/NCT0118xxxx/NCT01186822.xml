  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 26 week randomized controlled study. The study consists of, in order, an enrollment
      visit, followed by clinic visits at 2 weeks, 14 weeks and at 26 weeks. There will also be
      telephonic assessments at 8 weeks and 20 weeks. Clinic visits will involve comprehensive
      assessments of the patients lung condition, including post-bronchodilator spirometry, Shuttle
      walk distance, BODE index, health status (SGRQ) and symptoms (CCQ). Sputum and serum samples
      will also be collected at these visits for microbiological and inflammation analysis. Sputum
      will be obtained with the Lung Flute as an induction device and Pulse Oximetry will be
      assessed prior to and after use of the Lung Flute. Clinic and telephonic visits will collect
      information regarding compliance with the use of the Lung Flute, adverse events and
      exacerbation history.

    <description>The Lung Flute arm participants were instructed to blow twice in to the Lung Flute device vigorously enough to make the reed oscillate, followed by 5 normal breaths. This was repeated 10 times, followed by 3 huff coughs to complete 1 cycle. Two such cycles were recommended twice a day. One of these cycles was performed under supervision of the study personnel at the time of enrollment and at each subsequent study visit. Baseline COPD medication regimen was continued in all participants, although the primary physicians of the participants could make medically necessary changes. Chest physical therapy, additional breathing exercises and formal pulmonary rehabilitation programs were not prescribed to any of the participants during the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects between and including the ages of 30 and 80 years. Females of
             childbearing potential may be included provided they are not pregnant or are not
             nursing.

          2. Subjects with a diagnosis of moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease as defined by the Global Initiative for COPD (GOLD, 2008 update) and who meet
             the following criteria for stage ll - IV disease:

             a) Subjects must have a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FEV ratio &lt;70% and FEV1 of &lt;80% of
             the predicted value for age, height, and sex using the NHANES III standards
             (Hankinson, 1999).

          3. Subjects must have a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years.

          4. Subjects must have stable disease for at least 1 month prior to enrollment with no
             changes in the maintenance treatment for COPD in this period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of an exacerbation or other significant disease instability during the month
             preceding enrollment.

          2. A primary diagnosis of asthma or bronchiectasis.

          3. Inability to vibrate the reed of the Lung FluteÂ® consistently because of severely
             expiratory flow rate.

          4. Subject with any evidence of significant concomitant clinical disease that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the conduct of the study or safety
             of the subject.

          5. Pregnant or nursing females or females intending to become pregnant during the course
             of the study.

          6. Use of any investigational drug within one month or 6 half-lives (which-ever is
             greater) of the enrollment visit.

          7. Inability to comprehend or willingness to follow the study requirements including
             attendance at out-patient clinic visit and participation in testing as called for by
             the protocol.

          8. Patients currently using the Lung Flute. -
