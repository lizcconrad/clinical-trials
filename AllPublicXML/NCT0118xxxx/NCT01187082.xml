      Hypothesis:the effect of bladdertraining in groups for patients with OAB (overactive bladder
      syndrome) equals the effect of bladdertraining individually for patients with overactive
      bladder.

      The effect of the training is measured in a 3 dimensional scope by the means of 3 primary
      outcome measures used in the statistical evaluation. Symptoms of OAB (either
      (1)urgencyepisodes or (2)urgencyincontinence) and (3)quality of life (VAS score).

      Program consisting of 3 hourly sessions with bladdertraining and daily training with a pocket
      bladder schedule. patients are randomised either for groups or individual training with a
      continence nurse over a period of 2 months.
