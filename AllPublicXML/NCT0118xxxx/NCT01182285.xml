  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Patients who have advanced thyroid cancer have a low long-term survival rate. These
           types of thyroid cancer do not respond well to conventional surgery or radiation, or to
           specific thyroid cancer treatments such as radioactive iodine treatment and thyroid
           hormone for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression.

        -  Valproic acid has long been approved as an anticonvulsant to treat seizures in patients
           with epilepsy. It has also been used to treat bipolar disorder. Recent studies have
           shown that valproic acid has promising effects in thyroid cancer treatment because it
           may help destroy cancer cells and help conventional treatments be more effective.
           However, valproic acid is not approved for thyroid cancer and is therefore an
           investigational drug.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether valproic acid can inhibit tumor growth or induce tumor cell death.

        -  To determine whether valproic acid can make tumor cells increase their uptake of
           radioiodine.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced-stage thyroid cancer that is either
      unresponsive to conventional treatments or fails to absorb radioiodine.

      Design:

        -  Eligible participants will continue on the standard thyroid hormone suppression therapy
           and begin receiving valproic acid for a total of 10 weeks. Participants will keep a
           study diary to record doses and side effects, and will have regular clinic visits to
           provide blood samples and receive additional valproic acid.

        -  After 10 weeks, participants will have a Thyrogen scan to measure radioiodine uptake
           after valproic acid therapy. Tumor biopsies and blood samples will be taken at this
           time.

        -  If there is increased radioiodine uptake on the scan, participants will have additional
           radioiodine therapy.

        -  If there is no increased uptake on the scan, participants will continue on valproic acid
           for 7 more weeks. After 16 total weeks of treatment, additional blood samples and scans
           will be taken. Participants may continue to take valproic acid if the thyroid cancer
           appears to be responding to the treatment.

        -  Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 3, 6, 9 (for patients continuing on valproic acid
           only), and 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Patients who have advanced differentiated thyroid cancers (Stage IV) have a five-year
      survival of only 25%. Clinically this results in more aggressive growth, metastasis,
      decreased or loss of iodine uptake in the tumor, and tumors that may be refractory to
      conventional treatment: surgical resection, radioactive iodine treatment and thyroid hormone
      for Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression.

      In thyroid cancer, valproic acid, at clinically achievable concentrations, has an
      antiproliferative and differentiating effect.

      We hypothesize that valproic acid may inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation in
      thyroid cancer cells so that 131-I may detect residual disease and be more effective for
      radioiodine ablation of thyroid cancer cells of follicular cell origin.

      Objectives:

      The primary goal of this study is to determine if valproic acid will have an antineoplastic
      and differentiation effect in patients with advanced and or metastatic thyroid cancer of
      follicular cell origin.

      Eligibility:

      Unresectable advanced and/or poorly differentiated thyroid cancers of follicular cell origin
      (excluding anaplastic and medullary thyroid cancer) that have no uptake (less than 1%) on
      radioiodine scan or are unresponsive to radioiodine therapy.

      Elevated serum thyroglobulin (Tg) level (greater than 100ng/ml on thyroid hormone; greater
      than 10ng/ml off thyroid hormone).

      Design:

      This will be an open label phase II study to assess the efficacy of valproic acid therapy as
      an antiproliferative and differentiation agent in patients with incurable differentiated
      thyroid cancer (unresponsive and/or radioiodine negative and unresectable).

      Oral valproic acid will be administered to reach a therapeutic serum level (50 to 100
      microgram/ml).

      The number of patients to be enrolled is 25 with an interim analysis of response once 13
      patients are evaluable for response. It is anticipated that five patients may be enrolled per
      year.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Advanced/poorly differentiated thyroid cancers of follicular cell origin that
                  have no uptake (less than 1%) on radioiodine scan or are unresponsive to
                  radioiodine therapy. Unresponsiveness to radioiodine therapy is defined as a
                  patient s thyroglobulin not falling to less than 2ng/ml within 6 months after
                  previous radioiodine ablative treatment.

               2. Extensive (invasive) loco-regional tumor mass and/or metastatic spread, rendering
                  patient inoperable.

               3. Thyroglobulin (Tg) levels greater than or equal to 100 ng/ml in the absence of Tg
                  antibodies. Patients who are Tg-antibody (Tg-Ab) positive may be included despite
                  a lower Tg level if they have detectable disease on cross sectional imaging. (The
                  presence of Tg-Ab may lead to falsely low Tg levels and therefore render the Tg a
                  less sensitive marker of disease. However, Tg-Ab has been shown to also act as a
                  tumor marker, and will be used as an endpoint for the study in patients who are
                  Tg-Ab positive.).

               4. Within 18 months of enrollment, patients must have had an radioactive iodine
                  (RAI) scan, showing no or therapeutically insignificant RAI uptake (less than or
                  equal to 1%).

               5. Initial therapy must have included total/near-total thyroidectomy and RAI
                  ablation therapy.

               6. Patients must have had no chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biologic therapy for
                  their malignancy in the month prior to treatment and must have recovered from all
                  side effects of therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.

               7. Greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

               8. Must be able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document.

               9. Clinical performance status of Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group (ECOG) less
                  than or equal to 1.

              10. Life expectancy of greater than three months.

              11. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum beta-human chorionic
                  gonadotropin (HCG) within 72 hours prior to study entry and must be willing to
                  practice effective birth control to prevent pregnancy while receiving treatment
                  and for three months after treatment is discontinued. All males of child
                  fathering potential must also be willing to practice effective birth control.

              12. Laboratory results must be within the following parameters before entry:

          -  Absolute Neutrophil Count greater than 750 cells/mm(3)

          -  Hemoglobin greater than 8.0 gm/dl

          -  Platelet count greater than 75000/mm(3)

          -  Creatinine less tha 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Total protein greater than 6.4.

          -  Total bilirubin should be less than 1.5 times ULN.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) serum glutamic oxaloacetic (SGOT), alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) less than 1.5 times
             ULN.

          -  Amylase less than 1.5 times ULN

          -  Ammonia less than 1.5 times ULN

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Allergy to valproic acid.

          2. Current coexisting malignancy other than basal cell carcinoma.

          3. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

             Valproic acid is a known teratogen, causing primary neural tube defects, facial
             abnormalities, and skeletal malformation; therefore pregnant women will be excluded.
             Additionally, patients that become pregnant while on study protocol will be
             discontinued immediately.

          4. Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other major medical illnesses.

          5. Patients taking tolbutamide, warfarin, zidovudine, benzodiazepines, clonazepam,
             diazepam.

          6. Seizure disorder.

        <title>RAI (Radioactive Iodine) Uptake and Tg (Thyroglobulin) Level Compared Pre and Post- Valproic Treatment</title>
        <description>Complete response (CR) is increased Rai uptake on post- valproic acid therapy at week 10, AND a decrease in Tg level to less than 2 ng/ml (or a decrease in Tg-Ab level to less than 2.0 IU/ml) at 10 weeks AND disappearance of all lesions at 16 weeks. Partial response (PR) is increased Rai uptake on post-valproic scan at week 10, OR a decreased Tg level (or a decrease in Tg Ab (Tg antibody) level by more than 20%) at 10 weeks AND 30% decrease in target lesion at 16 weeks. Stable disease (SD) is no change in RAI uptake AND Tg levels (or TG-Ab level) AND no significant change of lesions at 16 weeks. Progressive disease (PD) is tumor mass increases OR Tg levels (or Tg-Ab levels) increases over 10 weeks OR at least 20% increase in target lesion at 16 weeks.</description>
        <time_frame>Entry to study and after 10 weeks of treatment for Phase 1, and 10 weeks of treatment to 16 weeks of treatment for phase 2.</time_frame>

          <title>RAI (Radioactive Iodine) Uptake and Tg (Thyroglobulin) Level Compared Pre and Post- Valproic Treatment</title>
          <description>Complete response (CR) is increased Rai uptake on post- valproic acid therapy at week 10, AND a decrease in Tg level to less than 2 ng/ml (or a decrease in Tg-Ab level to less than 2.0 IU/ml) at 10 weeks AND disappearance of all lesions at 16 weeks. Partial response (PR) is increased Rai uptake on post-valproic scan at week 10, OR a decreased Tg level (or a decrease in Tg Ab (Tg antibody) level by more than 20%) at 10 weeks AND 30% decrease in target lesion at 16 weeks. Stable disease (SD) is no change in RAI uptake AND Tg levels (or TG-Ab level) AND no significant change of lesions at 16 weeks. Progressive disease (PD) is tumor mass increases OR Tg levels (or Tg-Ab levels) increases over 10 weeks OR at least 20% increase in target lesion at 16 weeks.</description>

        <title>Best Overall Response</title>
        <description>Best overall response was assessed by radioiodine uptake. Complete response (CR) is increased Rai (radioiodine) uptake on post- valproic acid therapy at week 10, AND a decrease in Tg (thyroglobulin ) level to less than 2 ng/ml (or a decrease in Tg-Ab (thyroglobulin antibodies) level to less than 2.0 IU/ml) at 10 weeks AND disappearance of all lesions at 16 weeks. Partial response (PR) is increased Rai uptake on post-valproic scan at week 10, OR a decreased Tg level (or a decrease in Tg Ab (Tg antibody) level by more than 20%) at 10 weeks AND 30% decrease in target lesion at 16 weeks. Stable disease (SD) is no change in RAI uptake AND Tg levels (or TG-Ab level) AND no significant change of lesions at 16 weeks. Progressive disease (PD) is tumor mass increases OR Tg levels (or Tg-Ab levels) increases over 10 weeks OR at least 20% increase in target lesion at 16 weeks.</description>
