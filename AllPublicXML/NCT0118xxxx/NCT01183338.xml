      The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of the Sotera ViSi, an investigational
      device, to standard devices in estimating the level of blood oxygen (SpO2) in adult human
      subjects.

      This study is a single-center blinded study that will enroll up to 15 adult subjects, male or
      female, of any ethnic background.

      SpO2 and pulse rate measurements reported by ViSi will be compared with simultaneous
      measurements of blood SaO2 and pulse rate made by an FDA-cleared CO-oximeter and pulse
      oximeter, respectively. The paired measurements will be made in a well-controlled environment
      under optimal laboratory conditions.

        Healthy adult volunteers, male or female, of any ethnic background. To the extent possible
        while still achieving timely enrollment, subjects should vary from one another in their
        physical characteristics. Each subject must also meet all of the inclusion and exclusion
        criteria prior to study entry and give informed consent to participate in this study.

          -  Subject is a healthy volunteer capable of undergoing controlled hypoxemia to the level
             of 70% SaO2 (±3%) with no or minimal medical risk.

          -  Subject is willing and able to participate in the measurement period for up to two
             hours.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             study.

          -  Subject is unable or unwilling to have a blood gas and oxygen saturation measurements
             taken from either wrist/hand.

          -  Subject is deemed by the Investigator to be medically unsuitable for participation in
             this study.
