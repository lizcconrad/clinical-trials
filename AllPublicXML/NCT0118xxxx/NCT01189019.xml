  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this fifth year of anti-VEGF therapy for neovascular AMD, retinal physicians are
      collecting groups of patients who either do not or only partially respond to anti-VEGF
      therapy. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2mg ranibizumab specifically for
      patients with fibrovascular PEDs that have not resolved following at least 6 consecutive
      injections of ranibizumab or bevacizumab over the previous 12 months. The investigators
      hypothesize that the 2mg dose will be able to completely eliminate the persistent PEDS in
      these patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study

          -  Age &gt; 50 years

          -  Active or recurrent neovascular age-related macular degeneration involving the fovea
             on FA

          -  Presence of persistent fibrovascular pigment epithelial detachment on OCT following a
             minimum 6 previous treatments in previous 12 months with ranibizumab and/or
             bevacizumab. Patients may have received more than 12 months of anti-VEGF therapy.

          -  ETDRS Best Corrected Visual acuity 20/32 - 20/400

             transpupillary thermotherapy, Previous subfoveal focal laser photocoagulation
             involving the foveal center, History of vitrectomy, submacular surgery, or other
             surgical intervention for AMD, Previous participation in any studies of

             glaucoma) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could either, Require medical or
             surgical intervention during the 12-month study period to prevent or treat visual loss
             that might result from that condition, or If allowed to progress untreated, could
