  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SCAN Memory Program Evaluation study is an evaluation of a randomized controlled trial
      intervention consisting of a care management program for cognitively-impaired health plan
      members and for their informal/family caregivers. The program includes collaboration between
      the health plan, partnering medical groups, and community organizations.

      Program activities include: 1) telephonic-structured assessments with informal caregivers
      conducted by SCAN Memory Program care managers; 2) problem identification as a result of
      these assessments; and 3) pre-established protocols and procedures for problem resolution.
      ACCESS, the prototype for the SCAN Memory Program, was developed and tested in San Diego
      County and was very successful in helping affected patients and their caregivers.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Health plan member eligibility includes having a visit-based ICD-9
        diagnostic code for dementia or a dementia-specific medication (including donepezil,
        rivastigmine, galantamine, and memantine) within administrative data any time prior to data
        inquiry for potential subjects. The health plan member must have a caregiver who can
        communicate by telephone and though that person might also be a health plan member, health
        plan membership for caregivers is not required. All subjects must be living in the
        community and if in a nursing facility, this must be for rehabilitation or respite care but
        not for long term care. Caregivers must be able to communicate in English or Spanish.

        Exclusion Criteria: Person with dementia whose potential participation is declined by their
        physician. Those who do not have a family or informal caregiver cannot participate and
        caregivers who do no have telephone access or the capacity to consent to research
        evaluation are excluded. Patients who reside in nursing facilities as permanent residents
        are not eligible.
