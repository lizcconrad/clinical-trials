  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine the maximum dose of a certain chemotherapy drug
      (irinotecan) that can be tolerated as part of a combination of drugs. There is a combination
      of chemotherapy drugs typically used to treat cancer of the colon and rectum: 5-Flurouracil
      (5-FU), leucovorin, and irinotecan; the combination is known as FOLFIRI. At the present time,
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this drug combination for the treatment
      of cancers of the colon and rectum. The FDA has also approved the use of a drug called
      bevacizumab (or Avastin) in combination with FOLFIRI, and this is considered one of the
      standards of care for all patients with colon and rectal cancer which has spread.

      The best dose of irinotecan to use in the combination of FOLFIRI and bevacizumab is not
      known. Earlier studies have shown that higher doses of irinotecan can be used safely as part
      of the FOLFIRI combination, but it is unclear whether these same doses will be safe when
      bevacizumab is added to this combination.

    <description>Participants with UGT1A1*/*1 genotype will receive escalating doses of FOLFIRI (folinic acid+fluorouracil+irinotecan) and bevacizumab. The initial dose of irinotecan will be 260 mg/m2 administered as a 120 min intravenous infusion every two weeks. The dosage of irinotecan will be increased to 310, 370, and 420 mg/m2, and further irinotecan doses will be increased by 14%. 5-FU will be administered as a 400 mg/m2 bolus right after the end of the irinotecan infusion, followed by 2,400 mg/m2 over a 46 h continuous infusion plus LV 200 mg/m2 every two weeks. Bevacizumab will be administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg over 15-30 min IV (after an initial 90 min infusion without a reaction) every two weeks. The first dose will be administrated on day 2 (48 hours after the first irinotecan administration), while the second dose on day 14 (the same day as the second irinotecan administration). No dose escalation will be performed for 5-FU, LV or bevacizumab.</description>
