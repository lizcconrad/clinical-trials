  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DNA vaccines, which are small pieces of DNA also known as plasmids, have several advantages
      over traditional vaccines such as live attenuated virus and recombinant protein-based
      vaccines. DNA vaccines appear to be well tolerated in humans. Therefore, the investigators
      have developed our DNA vaccine, VGX-3100, to include plasmids targeting E6 and E7 proteins of
      both HPV subtypes 16 and 18. The investigators have chosen to deliver our candidate vaccines
      via electroporation (EP) using the CELLECTRA constant current device to deliver a small
      electric charge following intramuscular (IM) injection, since animal studies have shown that
      this delivery method increases the immune response to our DNA vaccine leading to a decrease
      in the size of tumors caused by HPV 16 and 18. In study HPV-001, the vaccine was given to
      subjects with a history of CIN 2 and 3 who had been previously treated by surgery. This study
      is proposed to vaccinate the same subjects with a fourth dose of the VGX-3100 to determine
      the safety and immune response.
