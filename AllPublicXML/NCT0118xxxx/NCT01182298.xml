      -  Peginterferon alfa-2a has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
           to treat adults with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with liver disease who
           have not been previously treated with interferon-alpha drugs (which improve immune
           system response to infection). Ribavirin has been approved by the FDA and is usually
           given in combination with interferon drugs such as peginterferon alfa-2a for treatment
           of chronic HCV.

        -  Recent research shows that Latino whites do not respond as well to treatment with
           peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin as non-Latino whites. Various factors such as
           excessive weight, gender, and insulin resistance were evaluated to explain this
           difference, but research suggests that underlying factors related to Latino or
           non-Latino background, possibly genetic and immune differences, may be affecting the
           response to HCV infection and treatment. However, more research is needed on the
           effectiveness of peginterferon and ribavirin in Latino subjects with HCV, and with
           combined and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and viral response of peginterferon alfa-2a and
      ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C in Latino participants with and without HIV
      co-infection.

      This is an observational study. The observed treatment is received and managed through their
      primary care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C is a major health problem affecting 100- 300 million individuals worldwide.
      Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection leads to cirrhosis in approximately 20% of subjects
      over a period of 1-20 years. Hepatitis C is now the most common indication for liver
      transplantation in the United States. infection occurs in one-third of all HIV-infected
      individuals, and the natural history among HIV-1 infected individuals demonstrates higher
      levels of HCV viremia, faster rates of progression and cirrhosis. There have been very few
      studies addressing the lower therapeutic response rates in minorities outside of African
      Americans. A recent study showed that Latino white subjects respond less effectively (34%)
      than non Latino white subjects (49%) given the same treatment even after adjusting for
      various important factors. As the current landscape for treatment of HCV changes, it would be
      important to evaluate factors responsible for therapeutic response in Latino patients.

      This is a study to address the genetic, epigenetic, and proteomic expression during therapy
      for chronic hepatitis C in Latino participants with and without HIV co-infection. One hundred
      Latino participants who have evidence of chronic hepatitis C with and without HIV who are
      receiving treatment for HCV will be enrolled. The results of this study will enable us to
      explore reasons for the differential therapeutic response rates with Hepatitis C treatment in
      Latino participants with and without HIV coinfection.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A subject must satisfy all of the following criteria to be eligible to participate in this
        study:

          1. Latino ethnicity. Latino ethnic background will be defined as a geographic,
             historical, and cultural heritage shared among persons from Spanish-speaking countries
             in South and Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Both parents and all
             grandparents of the participant have to be Latino, with Spanish as the primary
             language. Participants have to be white; native aboriginal Indians, Asians, and blacks
             will be excluded.

          2. Age greater than or equal to 18 years.
