      Research Hypothesis: VGX-3400 (DNA plasmids encoding the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase
      (NA), and M2e-NP antigen of the H5N1 avian influenza virus) administered to healthy adult
      males by IM injection followed by EP will be generally well tolerated and immunogenic.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent in accordance with institutional guidelines. If required by

             information (PHI)

          -  Male subjects 20-39 years of age

          -  Healthy subjects as judged by the Investigator based on medical history, physical
             examination, and normal results for an ECG, CBC, serum chemistries, CPK and urinalysis
             done up to 30 days prior to enrollment and administration of study drug

          -  Current nonsmoker

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≤30 kg/m2

          -  Able and willing to comply with all study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Positive serological test for HIV virus, hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus
             surface antigen (HBsAg);

          -  Any concurrent condition requiring the continued use of systemic or topical steroids
             (excluding inhaled and eye drop-containing corticosteroids); or the use of
             immunosuppressive or immune modifying agents within 3 months prior to Day 0 other than
             corticosteroids; or systemic or topical corticosteroids which must be discontinued &gt; 4
             weeks prior to Day 0

          -  Administration of any blood product within 3 months of enrollment

          -  Administration of any non-study vaccine in the 6 weeks prior to study enrollment

          -  Subject is currently participating or has participated in a study with an
             investigational compound or device within 30 days of signing informed consent;

          -  Metal implants at the site of injection, however, metal implants elsewhere are
             permitted and do not represent an exclusion criterion;

             participant who had a non-anaphylactic adverse reaction to pertussis vaccine as a
             child);

             process includes but is not limited to:

               -  A process that would affect the immune response;

               -  A process that would require medication that affects the immune response;

               -  Any contraindication to repeated injections or blood draws;

               -  A condition that requires active medical intervention or monitoring to avert
                  grave danger to the participant's health or well-being during the study period;

               -  A condition or process for which signs or symptoms could be confused with
                  reactions to vaccine, or;

               -  Any condition specifically listed among the exclusion criteria.

          -  Subjects with known prior illness or who is at risk for H5N1 Influenza A virus
             infection, i.e. exposure in the two weeks prior to study Day 0 to a person with known
             H5N1 Influenza virus infection or travel in the 2 weeks prior to Day 0 or during the
             course of the study to a region with known current cases of H5N1 Influenza virus
             infection;

          -  Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for
             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (i.e. infections disease) illness must
             not be enrolled into this study;

          -  Any other conditions judged by the investigator that would limit the evaluation of a
             subject.
