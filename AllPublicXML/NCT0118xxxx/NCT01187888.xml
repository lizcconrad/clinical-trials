  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether rasagiline is effective in the treatment of
      Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), a rapidly progressing disease with a symptomatology
      similar to Parkinson's Disease. The major aim of this study is the limitation or halting of
      the process of neurodegeneration and influence postural instability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a rapidly progressing disease with a median survival
      after onset of symptoms of 5.8 years.PSP is characterized by early falls, vertical
      ophthalmoparesis, akinetic-rigid features, prominent bulbar dysfunction and
      fronto-subcortical dementia. So far there is no treatment for the disease as the negative
      outcomes of the vast majority of studies make it impossible to set standards. As the majority
      of patients experience severe falls and vertigo already in the early phase of the disease,
      the drug of desire would be able to slow disease progression with a special focus on postural
      instability and exert neuroprotective effects. The monoamino oxidase inhibitor Rasagiline
      might be able to influence progression of PSP.

    <description>Since there is no established treatment regimen for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) patients, the only well characterized medication is L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) therapy. Since this therapy may exert a small effect in PSP patients, begin with L-DOPA therapy or increase in L-DOPA therapy will be used in this trial as rescue medication.</description>
