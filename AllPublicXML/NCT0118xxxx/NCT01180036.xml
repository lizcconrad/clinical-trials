      The primary outcome of this study is to determine whether or not the B cell targeting with
      Rituximab is more effective than Cyclosporine in inducing long term remission of proteinuria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In IMN, experimental data suggests that B cells are involved in the pathogenesis of the
      disease. To date, the best proven therapy for patients with MN consists of the combined use
      of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide (CYC). Since the mechanism of action of CYC includes
      suppression of various stages of the B cell cycle including B cell activation, proliferation,
      and differentiation and inhibition of immunoglobulin secretion, it lends credence to the
      hypothesis that B cells abnormalities are involved in the pathogenesis of MN. Given the key
      role of IgG antibodies in MN, it is reasonable to postulate that suppression of antibody
      production by depleting B cells may improve or even resolve the glomerular pathology and be
      reflected by a reduction in proteinuria. Thus, a case could be made for using an agent
      capable of selectively depleting B cells, and therefore halting the production of
      immunoglobulins against antigens potentially present in the glomeruli. This approach could
      stop the initiating sequence of pathogenic events and result in resolution of the. The P.I.
      believes that the application of selective B cell targeting with Rituximab (RTX) will prove
      at least equal, or even superior, both in the production of short term and long term control
      of the NS and be safer than any current therapeutic regimen used to treat MN.

      Based on this rationale, we conducted a pilot trial in 15 newly-biopsied patients (&lt;3 years)
      with IMN and proteinuria &gt;5g/24h despite ACEi/ARB use for &gt;3months and systolic BP &lt;130mmHg.
      Mean baseline creatinine was 1.4 mg/dl. Thirteen males and 2 females, median age 47 (range
      33-63), were treated with RTX (1g) on days 1 and 15. At six months, patients who remained
      with proteinuria &gt;3g/24 received a second identical course of RTX. Baseline proteinuria of
      13.0±5.7g/24h (range 8.4-23.5) decreased to 6.0±7.0 g/24h (range 0.2-20) at 12 months (mean ±
      SD). In the fourteen patients who completed a 12 months follow-up complete remission
      (proteinuria &lt;0.3g/24h) was achieved in 2 patients and partial remission (&lt;3g/24h) in 7
      patients. In 5 of these 7 patients, proteinuria was &lt;1.5g/24h and follow up at 18 months
      showed that 3 of these 7 patients on PR achieved CR of proteinuria. Five patients did not
      respond. The mean drop in proteinuria from baseline to 12 months was 6.2± 5.1g (p=.002,
      paired t-test). There were a limited number of minor side-effects. Initial CD20+ B cell
      depletion was seen in all patients. However, at 3 months, CD20+ B cells were starting to
      recover with five patients &gt;35 cells/µl (range 35-152).(50) These data contrasts with
      previous work by Ruggenenti et al. using RTX given weekly (375 mg/m2) for 4 weeks.
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis showed that RTX levels in this 2-dose regimen were 50% lower
      compared to non-proteinuric patients, which could potentially result in undertreatment.

      Based on these results, we recently conducted a study postulating that in patients with MN, 4
      weekly doses of RTX would result in more effective B cell depletion, a higher remission rate
      and maintaining of the same safety profile compared to patients treated with RTX dosed at 1g
      x 2. Twenty patients (11 failures to prior therapy) with MN and proteinuria &gt;5g/24h received
      RTX (375mg/m2 x 4), with retreatment at 6 months regardless of proteinuria response. A
      detailed PK was conducted simultaneously along with immunological analyses of the adaptive
      immune compartment (T and B cells) to ascertain the impact of RTX on lymphocyte
      subpopulations. Baseline proteinuria of 11.9±4.9g/24h decreased to 4.2±3.8g/24h and
      2.0±1.7g/24h at 12 and 24 months, respectively (p&lt;0.001) while creatinine clearance increased
      from 72.4±33 at baseline to 88.4 ±31.5 ml/min/1.73m2 at 24 months (p=0.02).

      Of 18 patients who completed 24-months follow up, 4 are in complete remission, 12 are in
      partial remission (CR + PR = 80%), 1 has a limited response (&gt;50% drop in P but &gt;3.5g/24h)
      and 1 patient relapsed. When interpreting these results we should take into account that &gt;50%
      of these patients had failed previous immunosuppressive therapy. This study also emphasizes
      that proteinuria is reduced gradually and may take several months to reach its nadir an
      observation that is in agreement with previous reports in patients with MN treated with
      prednisone in combination with a cytotoxic agent but without the short-term toxicity seen
      with alkylating agents. Kidney function remained stable or improved in all patients.

      Serum RTX levels were similar to those obtained with 2 doses of RTX. Four 4 doses of RTX did
      result in more effective B cell depletion but proteinuria reduction was basically identical
      to the results obtained using RTX 1000mg on days 1 and 15. Thus, we believe that this
      particular dosing regimen with retreatment at 6 months should be used in a randomized-control
      trial comparing RTX to Cyclosporine (the standard of care for IMN in the US). We believe that
      RTX will prove equal or superior to Cyclosporine in the treatment of MN and could represent
      the new standard of care for patients with this disease

    <description>Patients randomized to the Cyclosporine arm will be started at a dose of CsA = 3.5 mg/kg/day p.o. divided into 2 equal doses given at 12 hour intervals. Target trough CsA blood levels are 125 to 175 ng/ml. Patients will have their doses adjusted according to their blood levels of CSA as monitored every 2 weeks until the target trough level is reached. If a complete remission is achieved by 6 months, CSA will be tapered and discontinued over a three-month period. If after 6 months there has not been a reduction in proteinuria of at least 25% of baseline values, the drug will also be discontinued. If there has been a &gt;25% reduction in baseline proteinuria (but not complete remission) the CSA will be continued for an additional 6 months.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the Cyclosporine arm will be started at a dose of (CsA = 3.5 mg/kg/day p.o. divided into 2 doses for 12 months). Target trough CsA blood levels, as determined in whole blood by HPLC, are 125 to 175 ng/ml. A persistent and otherwise unexplained increase in serum creatinine &gt;30% would prompt an approximate 25% dose reduction of CSA, aiming for a corresponding 25% reduction in CSA trough level. If with this dose reduction the creatinine does not return to within 30% of baseline levels within 3 weeks, then a second dose reduction of approximately 25% with similar reduction in CSA trough level will be used. If the creatinine does not fall to baseline values with this second dose reduction, the drug will be discontinued. At the end of 12 months, Cyclosporine will be tapered by 1/3 of the maintenance dose monthly and hence discontinued after 3 months.</description>
