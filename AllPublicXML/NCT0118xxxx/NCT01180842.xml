  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators research question is whether or not yoga effectively alleviates symptoms of
      pain, sleep disturbance, anxiety and depression in children with cystic fibrosis. If yoga
      does prove to be effective, the investigators will educate our CF population about the
      benefits they may experience if they choose to incorporate yoga into their CF therapy. The
      investigators will also go on to do further research of other complementary alternative
      medicine therapies.

      This is a pre/post-test study with 20 subjects. The subjects will serve as their own
      controls. Each subject will participate in six yoga sessions over a ten week period.
      Subjects' symptoms will be evaluated with the use of questionnaires. The investigators will
      also test cortisol levels on weeks -2, -1, 1, 6, 7, 8. Cortisol is a hormone that is affected
      by stress. Testing of cortisol throughout the study will help us determine the subjects'
      stress level throughout the study.
