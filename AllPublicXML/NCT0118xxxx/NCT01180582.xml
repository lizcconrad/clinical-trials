  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is twofold: 1) to use RSA to determine the migration patterns of
      the PA coated Triathlon Total Knee Arthroplasty components during the first 2 years
      postoperatively and thus determine the proportion of cases where adequate fixation is
      achieved, and 2) to use DEXA scanning to document peri-prosthetic bone mineral density
      changes in response to the PA coated Triathlon Total Knee arthroplasty over the first two
      postoperative years.

      In addition, gait assessment and validated outcome questionnaires will be utilized to
      quantify changes in functional status of subjects after surgery and migration patterns will
      be compared to results obtained from previous studies of uncemented total knee arthroplasty
      components conducted at this centre. Questions to be asked are: 1. Do the components achieve
      adequate fixation to the underlying bone? 2. What are the migration patterns (translations
      and rotations) of the PA coated arthroplasty components during the first two years
      postoperatively and are they different from that seen for other implants that have been
      studied with RSA at this institution? 3. For what proportion of implants does migration
      continue to increase during the two year follow-up? 4. Are inducible displacements, measured
      at weight-bearing follow-ups, consistent over time and do they indicate that adequate
      fixation has been achieved? 5. Are there changes over time in bone mineral density of
      peri-prosthetic bone in the PA coated Triathlon total knee arthroplasty? 6: Where do changes
      in bone mineral density occur? 7: Is there a significant difference in health status and
      functional outcome before and after total knee arthroplasty using PA coated Triathlon total
      knee arthroplasty components? 8: Are there changes in gait symmetry and centre of mass (COM)
      displacements as assessed with the Walkabout Portable Gait Monitor pre- and post-operatively
      and how does study gait data compare to asymptomatic gait? and finally, Question 9: Are there
      differences in the micromotion patterns between the when compared to other samples of knee
      implants in our RSA database?
