      The purpose of this study is to determine whether daily oral supplements of multivitamins
      (including vitamins B-complex, C and E) along with Iron and folic acid given to non-pregnant
      women results in lower prevalence of anemia in preparation for pregnancy when compared to
      daily iron and folic acid supplements or folic acid alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, more than half a million women die from pregnancy or childbirth-related
      complications, most of them in developing countries. The global community committed to
      reducing the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters between 1990 and 2015 (MDG5). Women
      die from a range of complications in pregnancy, childbirth or the postpartum period. 80% of
      maternal deaths are due to severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections,
      hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and obstructed labor. Additionally, low birth weight and
      neonatal mortality are common problems in developing countries. The benefit of periconceptual
      folate on preventing congenital anomalies has been established in randomized trials; however,
      the role of other nutrients needs to be examined further. Anemia is strongly associated with
      adverse perinatal outcomes including maternal mortality and low birthweight.
