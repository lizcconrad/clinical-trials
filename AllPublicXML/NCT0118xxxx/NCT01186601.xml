  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as an open label, single-dose, explorative study with patients
      with histologically proven cancer and, preferably, tumor positive lesions in previously
      performed nuclear medicine imaging examinations.

      The investigational drug will be given as a single administration in a dose of &lt;/= 0.1 mg
      BAY94-9392 (300 MBq, +/- 10%). The total duration of the study for each patient will be
      approximately 8 days.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males/females &gt;/= 18 years

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of primary prostate cancer (biopsy proven) and scheduled for
             radical prostatectomy or patients with prostate tumor recurrence (Patients with
             advanced tumor disease and a high likelihood to display lymph node metastasis are to
             be preferably included.)

          -  ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 0-2, determined within
             one week prior to treatment with BAY94-9392

          -  Patient had an [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT for detection, or staging, or
             restaging, or therapy response assessment that still showed tumor mass with high
             certainty for a cancer such as melanoma, or colorectal cancer, or head &amp; neck cancer
             for which FDG-PET/CT is used in clinical routine, and the primary cancer disease is
             histologically confirmed. In case of recurrent disease confirmation of the primary
             tumor is sufficient

          -  No clinically relevant deviations in renal function as determined by Cockcroft and
             Gault method using serum creatinine at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable medical disease other than
             cancer or inflammation (e.g. poorly controlled diabetes, congestive heart failure,
             myocardial infarction within 12 months prior to planned injection of BAY94-9392,
             unstable and uncontrolled hypertension, chronic renal or hepatic disease, severe
             pulmonary disease) which could compromise participation in the study

          -  Known sensitivity to the study drug or components of the preparation

          -  Previous treatment with BAY94-9392 in this study
