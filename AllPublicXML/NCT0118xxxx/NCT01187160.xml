      The purpose of this study is to assess if the da Vinci® Robotic Surgical System (Intuitive
      Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) allows for &quot;adequate exposure&quot; for transoral resection of
      hypertrophic lingual tonsils in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.

      Visit 1 - Outpatient Clinical Setting. The patient will be evaluated prior to treatment in
      the outpatient clinical setting in a way which is consistent for routine workup prior to any
      surgery of the tongue base for sleep apnea. This will include sleep nasendoscopy (see below),
      and if it is predicted pre-treatment that the transoral robotic approach may be appropriate
      then the patient will be given the option of participating in the study. This will include a
      review of the patient's pre-operative sleep study and a nasopharyngolaryngoscopic exam to
      assess for lingual tonsillar hypertrophy. A pre-operative MRI will be obtained to provide
      quantitative measurement of the patient's tongue base hypertrophy.

      Visit 2 - Sleep Nasendoscopy. The patient will undergo sleep nasendoscopy as outlined below,
      in order to assess the involvement of the tongue base in the patient's sleep disordered
      breathing. This is a routine diagnostic procedure. Patients are pharmacologically induced
      into a light phase of sleep and the upper airway is visualized directly with a
      nasopharyngolaryngoscope. Anesthetic management will be performed in standard fashion, using
      propofol titrated to an endpoint of moderate sedation, as is typically done for procedural
      sedation in esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Administration will be logged to permit analysis of
      dosing requirements. Respiratory pattern will be monitored noninvasively and logged to permit
      correlation of obstruction to propofol administration.

      Visit 3 - Intraoperative Setting. The patient will undergo an evaluation for &quot;adequate
      exposure&quot; for transoral robotic surgery and if &quot;adequate exposure&quot; is achieved then they will
      undergo transoral robotic surgery for lingual tonsillar hypertrophy to treat obstructive
      sleep apnea.

      Visit 4 - Postoperative Setting. This will be in the inpatient and/or outpatient setting
      within three weeks of surgical procedure. The patient will undergo routine postoperative
      clinical evaluation.

      Visit 5 - Postoperative Testing. The patient will undergo a follow-up sleep study to
      determine efficacy of the surgical procedure at three months post-operatively, the standard
      interval used to determine the outcome of the procedure.

    <description>The da Vinci® Robotic Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) is a manual image-guided surgery system that is computer enhanced rather than computer guided robotic surgery in which the surgeon programs the computer to do the surgery and the robot does the surgery (also known as a milling device). Use of the da Vinci® Robotic Surgical System in the aforementioned configuration in fact facilitates an exact translation of the surgeons hand and finger movements at the console to precise and tremor-free movements of the arms and instruments.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is 18 or older at time of treatment.

          -  Patient must present with indications for surgical management of the tongue base to
             treat obstructive sleep apnea.

          -  Written informed consent and/or consent waiver by IRB.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-operative exclusion criteria:

          -  Unexplained fever and/or untreated, active infection.

          -  Patient pregnancy.

          -  Previous head and neck surgery precluding transoral/robotic procedures.

          -  The presence of medical conditions contraindicating general anesthesia or transoral
             surgical approaches.

          -  Intra-operative exclusion criteria (It is recognized that sometimes patients cannot be
             excluded from study participation until prepared in the surgical suite such that their
             anatomy is exposed and available for medical analysis. The following situations
             represent instances whereby patients would be excluded from this study based upon
             anatomical findings not evident in the pre-operative setting):

          -  Inability to adequately visualize anatomy to perform the diagnostic or therapeutic
             surgical approach transorally.
