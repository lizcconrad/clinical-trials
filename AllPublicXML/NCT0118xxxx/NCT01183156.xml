      NordICC (The NordICC Initiative on Colorectal Cancer, NCT00883792) is a multicenter
      randomised trial to investigate the effect of screening colonoscopy on CRC incidence and
      mortality. In Poland, in Warsaw area, at least 10,000 subjects 55-64 years of age are to be
      invited to screening colonoscopy. A personal letter of invitation containing date and hour of
      appointment is mailed to every individual randomised to the screening group. Up to 60% of
      invitees do not respond to the initial invitation and reminding letter. The aim of this study
      is to compare the effect of reminding letter and educational intervention on attendance to
      screening colonoscopy in nonresponders to initial invitation to screening colonoscopy.

The aim of the meeting is to overcome barriers to screening colonoscopy. The program of the meeting is tailored to individual needs, doubts, and concerns of the participating group as assessed using brief survey at the beginning of the meeting. The major points to be discussed are: risk and benefit of screening, colorectal cancer risk, pain and sedation, preparation to colonoscopy, consecutive stages of the procedure, comfort and embarrassment.</description>
