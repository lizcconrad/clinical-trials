      This Research Plan proposes Stage 1 Research integrating evidence based practices to address
      the needs of mothers referred to child welfare for substance abuse. Mothers with a history of
      methamphetamine abuse and child neglect will be recruited. Using an intensive community based
      treatment, mothers will receive substance abuse treatment combined with parenting skills
      training and psychosocial support for basic needs (e.g., housing, employment). This project
      will include a feasibility study (n = 5), followed by a small randomized pilot (n = 24) to
      examine the efficacy of the Integrated Treatment for Substance Abuse and Neglect compared to
      treatment as usual, with a population of substance abusing neglectful mothers referred
      through the Department of Child Welfare.
