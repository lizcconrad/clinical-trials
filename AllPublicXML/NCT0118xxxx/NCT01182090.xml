      Objective:

      This prospective randomized trial evaluated outcomes of colposacropexy performed either by
      open or by conventional laparoscopic approach as therapy for uterovaginal prolapse. Surgical
      techniques, efficacy and overall results are compared.

      Methods:

      In this prospective study 40 consecutive patients with uro-genital prolapse are randomized to
      sacropexy: 20 by an open approach, 20 by a conventional laparoscopy approach. Anchorage is
      achieved in both groups by two polypropylene meshes.

      Check-ups were scheduled at 3, 6, 12 months and then yearly. Pre-operative patient
      characteristics, operative and post-operative events and follow-up results are recorded.

      Surgical technique In both open or laparoscopic approach the anterior vaginal wall is
      dissected from the bladder to expose a vaginal wall area of at least 3 x 5 cms where the mesh
      will be attached with four-five Polyglycolic 0 sutures. The procedure is repeated for the
      posterior vaginal wall, where the mesh will be attached with three-four Polyglycolic 0
      sutures.

      The sacral promontory surface is prepared and 1 or 2 non-reabsorbable 0.0 sutures are placed
      into the sacral periosteum about 2 cm below the promontory. A sub-peritoneal tunnel is
      created through which meshes are passed avoiding traction to the sacrum. The peritoneum is
      closed over the meshes.

    <description>Operative morbidity according to Clavien-Dindo classification, measure of perioperative pain with Visual Analogue Score VAS, post-operative adverse events constitute the outcome measures, together with operating time, intra-operative blood loss and length of hospital stay.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective and objective success rate, Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Success rate: subjective success is absence of symptoms related to prolapse or incontinence using Urogenital Distress Inventory (URI-6) and Impact Incontinence Quality of Life (IIQ-7). Patient satisfaction is defined by replies to the questions of whether the patient is satisfied and would repeat the operation. Objective success is defined as no vaginal prolapse greater or equal to grade 2 at any vaginal site, while the patient performed Valsalva's manouever.</description>
