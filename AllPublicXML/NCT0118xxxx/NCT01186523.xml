      In order to examine potential gender differences in the weight loss response to exercise, the
      investigators propose to compare equal energy expenditure of exercise for overweight men and
      women using levels of exercise energy expenditure that the investigators have previously
      shown to prevent weight gain or promote weight loss. The investigators will randomize men and
      women to an exercise group, 5 days/week, for 9 months, with an energy expenditure of 400
      kcal/exercise session, a group with 600 kcal/ exercise session, or a control group. 1)The
      investigators hypothesize that men and women randomized to sedentary control will gain
      weight, those randomized to 400 kcal/exercise session will maintain weight (will not gain),
      and those randomized to 600 kcal/exercise session will lose ~5% of body weight. 2) The
      investigators hypothesize there will be no differences for weight loss between genders at
      either 400 or 600 kcal of energy expenditure of exercise since men and women will have equal
      amounts of energy expenditure of exercise. 3) The investigators hypothesize that men and
      women randomized to 400 kcal/exercise session will completely compensate for the energy
      expended during exercise by altering energy intake and/or spontaneous activity and that men
      and women participants randomized to 600 kcal/exercise session will not completely
      compensate. The investigators believe the findings from this study could have important
      implications for exercise guidelines for weight loss.

    <textblock>
      Exercise is recommended by virtually every public health organization; however, the role of
      exercise is generally considered secondary to energy restriction for the treatment of
      obesity. Indeed, an argument can be made that suggests exercise is not effective for weight
      loss. Meta-analytic studies consistently find small amounts of weight loss due to exercise
      without energy restriction. It is critical to note that there are actually very few
      randomized controlled trials using exercise alone for weight loss. We believe that there are
      3 critical flaws in the vast majority of the literature. 1)Participants are not supervised
      and is generally recorded by self report and is likely poorly estimated and in general,
      overestimated. 2)The amount of exercise used is usually prescribed from the guidelines for
      recommended levels for physical fitness and to diminish cardiovascular disease, not the
      amount that may be necessary for weight loss. 3)The energy expenditure of the exercise is
      rarely reported.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to expend either 400 or 600kcal per exercise session
      (or a control group) and will exercise 5 days per week for 9 months. All exercise sessions
      will be supervised and the length of the exercise session will be based upon energy
      expenditure (kcal/min) at a give heart rate range. To account for improvements in fitness,
      energy expenditure will be measured monthly and adjustments to the daily exercise
      prescription will be altered accordingly.
