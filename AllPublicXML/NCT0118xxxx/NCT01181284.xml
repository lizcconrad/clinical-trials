  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension(PAH) suffer from chronic shortness of breath,
      and have impaired survival related to progressive right ventricular failure. Abnormal
      vasoreactivity to nitric oxide(NO) plays a role in the pathophysiology of PAH.
      Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitor (PDE5 inhibitors) sildenafil have been shown to be
      beneficial in PAH, but extent of benefit is variable.

      The broad aim of this investigation is to determine whether the modulating effect of
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on vascular smooth muscle responsiveness to the
      nitric oxide pathway that we have observed in an animal model of Congestive Heart
      Failure(CHF) can be exploited in humans with PAH. Furthermore, we have identified a group of
      genes TAO kinase I, IL-10, Rho kinase, Raf1, bile acid coenzyme A and Fmr1 that are modulated
      by long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) in our animal model, and
      therefore may also be modulated by ACEI in patients with PAH
