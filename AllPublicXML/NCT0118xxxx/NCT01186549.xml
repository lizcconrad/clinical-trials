      Objectives: Injection pain and hypotension are two main adverse effects of propofol which
      distresses patient. The aim of this prospective double blind study was to compare the effect
      of ephedrine -lidocaine combination with lidocaine and ephedrine on injection pain and
      hemodynamic changes due to propofol induction.

      Methods: 165 adult patients, aged 20 to 60 yr, Patients were randomly allocated to one of 5
      groups (33 patients per group): lidocaine 0.5 mg/kg(L) ,ephedrine 30microgram/kg (E30),
      ephedrine 70 microgram/kg(E70), lidocaine 0.5mg/kg -ephedrine 30 microgram/kg(LE) or 2ml
      saline (S) intravenously. After one minute propofol 2 mg/kg into a dorsal hand vein was
      injected. Face pain scale and verbal rating scale, arterial blood pressure and heart rate
      were recorded before induction, just before intubation, and one minute after intubation
