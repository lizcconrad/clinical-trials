  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in southern China
      and Southeast Asia. While infection with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is believed to be necessary
      for the development of NPC, non-viral environmental factors have also been implicated to
      increase the risk of NPC including consumption of salted fish and other nitrosamine
      containing preserved foods, formaldehyde and wood dust exposure, and cigarette smoking. In
      addition to environmental factors, it is widely accepted that genetic susceptibility also
      plays an important role in the pathogenesis of NPC. Polymorphisms in genes involved in
      nitrosamine metabolism and DNA repair have been suggested to be associated with NPC risk, and
      various chromosomal regions linked to NPC development have been reported. These associations
      highlight the role of both environmental and genomic components in the etiology of NPC.

      There is a longstanding history of international collaborative studies to elucidate the role
      of environmental and genetic factors associated with NPC between investigators in Taiwan and
      the USA. A case-control study (375 cases; 327 controls) was conducted in the early 1990s, and
      a large multiplex family study that was completed in 2006 (358 families; 3,216 individuals).
      Results from these studies have provided some of the most comprehensive epidemiological
      evidence regarding factors linked to NPC development to date.

      As a next logical step, the opportunity now exists to undertake a genome-wide association
      study of NPC in Taiwan with carefully collected environmental exposure data to systematically
      examine environmental and genetic factors associated with NPC, and to evaluate gene-gene and
      gene-environment interactions. The investigators propose a case-control study of 2000 NPC
      cases (both retrospective [n=800] and prospective [n=1,200]) and 2,000 age-gender-matched
      hospital controls in northern Taiwan. The study objectives are to: 1) evaluate putative
      environmental exposures and NPC; 2) assess the effect of genetic factors, including both
      single nucleotide polymorphism and copy number variation through analysis of both main effect
      and gene-gene interaction; 3) investigate gene-environment interactions by testing for
      interactions between significant genome-wide genetic variations and EBV and other identified
      environmental risk factors; and 4) examine the natural history of EBV infection.
