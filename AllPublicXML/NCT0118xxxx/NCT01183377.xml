  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women's evermore presence in professional and athletic sports has revealed sound evidence on
      the existence of female athlete triad among the world's elite female athletes. This triad
      consists of eating disorders, amenorrhea and osteoporosis. It has been stated that all female
      athletes are potentially at risk, but it is not clear to what extent those exercising at
      different levels are at risk of this syndrome/triad. Since the manifestation of this triad is
      often denied, or under-reported, appropriate screening methods are required to identify the
      symptoms. There is still no clear-cut information available on the incidence of this triad in
      Iran. And there are religious and cultural differences between Iran's elite female athletes
      and those in other countries. Therefore, in order to meet Iranian female athletes' needs, the
      investigators decided to determine the frequency of the female athlete triad in Iran.
