    <textblock>
      Magnesium is the second most abundant ion in human cells and plays fundamental roles in
      several enzymatic reactions: it is involved in ATP production, in the phosphorylation of
      proteins, in glucose metabolism and in the contraction of cytoskeleton.

      Several epidemiological studies demonstrated that low dietary magnesium intake is inversely
      associated with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and metabolic syndrome.

      Magnesium could be related to important haemodynamic and metabolic anomalies: at vascular
      level it acts as an antagonist of calcium, especially in vascular smooth muscle cells, thus
      its deficit could enhance vascular contraction; with regard to glucose metabolism, magnesium
      is involved in the physiopathological mechanism of insulin resistance, through a reduction in
      cellular uptake of glucose. This condition and the subsequent compensatory hyperinsulinemia
      can ultimately lead to increased synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and to endothelial
      dysfunction. Thus, magnesium depletion and subsequent alterations can increase the risk of
      developing vascular disease such as atherosclerosis and has been associated with
      cardiovascular events.

      Several clinical trials have explored the possible beneficial effect of magnesium
      supplementation on blood pressure, plasma lipids and insulin resistance but the results are
      often contradictory. One of the possibilities for these unclear results could be that in some
      of them the interventions started too late when haemodynamic and metabolic changes are more
      difficult to revert.

      The investigators hypothesis is that magnesium supplementation in a population at increased
      genetic risk of developing metabolic syndrome but without it could improve blood pressure and
      the other metabolic syndrome related components.

      Thus, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of oral supplementation of
      magnesium (16.2 mmol/day of magnesium pidolate) on metabolic syndrome's components in a
      sample of 15 subjects who are at increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome since have a
      positive familiar history of type II diabetes mellitus and/or metabolic syndrome(AHA/NHLBI
      criteria).
