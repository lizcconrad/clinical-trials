  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide clinical data regarding safety and clinical effectiveness
      of the ActiSight Needle Guidance System in assisting radiologically guided percutaneous
      needle biopsy or aspiration of pulmonary lesions, which is a common procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, single-arm study. At least three centers in Canada will
      participate in the study and at least 4 different experienced staff radiologists will perform
      the procedures for the study.

      A total of forty eight (48) consecutive subjects meeting the eligibility criteria, scheduled
      for clinically indicated CT guided lung biopsy or aspiration procedure at the participating
      centers will be invited to enroll in the study. To ensure diversity in the study population,
      consecutive patients will be enrolled in the following groups until these groups are fully
      enrolled:

      Lesion size ≥1.0 cm and ≤ 1.5 cm: 10 patients; Lesion size &gt;1.5 and ≤ 3.0 cm: 19 patients;
      Lesion size &gt;3.0 cm: 19 patients.

      A maximum of 24 patients will be enrolled at each center.

      Informed consent will be signed prior to the procedure. Subject data collection on the day of
      the procedure will include demographics, relevant medical history and vital signs. Enrolled
      subjects will undergo CT guided percutaneous lung aspiration and/or biopsy as clinically
      indicated by a qualified physician, utilizing the ActiSight Needle Guidance System. Subjects
      will be followed-up as outlined below to assess adverse events related to the procedure. A
      subject's enrollment in the study will be completed after the follow-up visit or after
      resolution of any procedure related adverse event.

      A procedure difficulty classification is defined for this study, based on existing
      literature. Difficulty levels for all procedures will be recorded and included in the final
      report.
