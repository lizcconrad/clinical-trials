  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the G4 System when
      worn for up to 7-days by children and adolescent subjects (6 to &lt;18 years-old) with type 1
      diabetes mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Device performance will be primarily evaluated in terms of the proportion of G4 System values
      that are within ±20% of the study meter reference value for glucose levels &gt;80 mg/dL and ±20
      mg/dL at meter glucose levels &lt;80 mg/dL. This proportion will be compared to the proportion
      of such points observed in the DexCom clinical study that will be used to apply for FDA
      approval of the G4 System (PTL 900360) for adults.

      Safety data of the G4 System will also be collected and safety will be characterized by the
      incidence of Adverse Device Effects, Serious Adverse Device Events, and Unanticipated Adverse
      Device Effects experienced by study participants.

        This clinical study population will consist of a minimum of 64 and up to 80 subjects with a
        previous diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. It is desirable to achieve an equal number
        of subjects enrolled into each of the following four subgroups as defined in the FDA
        guideline for Age Ranges of Pediatric Subgroups:

          -  Female children* 6-12 years-old

          -  Female adolescents** 13-17 years-old

          -  Male children 6-12 years-old

          -  Males adolescents 13-17 years-old

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Age 6 to &lt;18 years-old;

          -  2. Have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus and are on multiple daily
             injections (MDI) or Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) insulin therapy;

          -  3. Willing not to inject insulin or wear an insulin pump insertion set within 3 inches
             from the Sensor site during Sensor wear;

          -  4. Willing to use only the blood glucose meter provided to them for self-monitoring of
             blood glucose (SMBG) during Sensor wear, and willing to adhere to the
             protocol-specified fingerstick schedule during home use;

          -  5. Willing to participate in three consecutive 7-day Sensor wear periods;

          -  6. Willing to take a minimum of 7 fingersticks per day during home use (2 for
             calibration purposes, 5 for comparative purposes);

          -  7. Willing to refrain from the use of acetaminophen during the Sensor insertion period
             and for at least 24-hours prior to Sensor insertion;

          -  8. Willing not to schedule an magnetic resonance (MRI) scan, computed tomography (CT)
             scan, or x-ray, for the duration of the study;

          -  9. Both subject and guardian are able to speak, read, and write English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Have extensive skin changes/diseases that preclude wearing the Sensor on normal
             skin (e.g. extensive psoriasis, recent burns or severe sunburn, extensive eczema,
             extensive scarring, extensive tattoos, dermatitis herpetiformis) at the proposed wear
             sites; 2. Subjects who have a known allergy to medical-grade adhesives; 3. For
             participants of childbearing potential: are pregnant as demonstrated by a positive
             pregnancy test within 72 hours of insertion (sexually active participants of
             childbearing potential must use birth control during this study); 4. Have a hematocrit
             that is less than 30%, or greater than 55%; 5. Current participation in another
             investigational study protocol (if a subject has recently completed participation in
             another drug study, the subject must have completed that study at least 30 days prior
             to being enrolled in this study); 6. Have any condition that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would interfere with their participation in the trial or pose an
             excessive risk to study staff (e.g., known history of hepatitis B or C).
