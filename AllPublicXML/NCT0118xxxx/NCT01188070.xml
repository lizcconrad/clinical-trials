  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More and more family members are providing care to their loved ones with prolonged and
      progressive illnesses. Chronic intense caregiving represents a situation of chronic stress,
      which takes a toll on one's mental and physical health including an increased risk for the
      development or worsening of heart disease. Identification of effective self-care
      interventions for family caregivers is warranted to improve their emotional wellbeing and
      minimize the harmful effects of chronic stress on the heart. This Program Project Grant aims
      to promote health and reduce cardiovascular risk in family caregivers (FCG) of persons with
      chronic illness. In two studies the investigators will test two interventions,
      psycho-education(ED) and physical exercise(EX), individually and in combination. The first
      study will target FCG of African American dementia patients; the second will focus on FCG of
      heart failure patients. Parallel designs, interventions and measures will create synergy as
      will integration of all data management and analyses within a Bio-behavioral Science and
      Measures Core. This Core will also provide high level guidance and interpretation of model
      testing resulting from analysis of the common data set. The combined de-identified data set
      will allow for elucidating the biological mechanisms of stress-induced cardiovascular risk,
      further developing the model, and stimulating future research, while the shared core support
      will provide substantial efficiency; neither could be achieved outside of a Program Project
      approach. These collective efforts will generate important data whereby future care can
      significantly enhance the lives of FCG and minimize their risk of cardiovascular disease, the
      number one cause of disability and death in the United States.

      We hypothesize that FCGs who receive the combined PSYCHED+EX intervention will have better
      psychological functioning (lower levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and caregiver burden
      and higher levels of flourishing), behavioral outcomes (improved sleep quality and greater
      physical function), cardiovascular risk measures (improved resting heart rate, blood
      pressure, heart rate recovery, oxygen consumption, lipids, glucose, and inflammatory
      markers), neuroendocrine function (salivary cortisol) and overall health outcomes (improved
      function, muscle strength, and endurance) compared to psycho-education and usual
      care-attention control from baseline to six months later mediated by improvements in process
      outcomes (lower perceived stress and higher self-efficacy).
