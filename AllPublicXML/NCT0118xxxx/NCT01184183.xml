  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA), surgical removal of the blockage in the neck artery, is the
      accepted management of choice for significant blockage of the carotid artery. Previous
      studies showed improved perioperative outcomes and prevention of recurrent blockage by the
      use of the patch to close the surgical incision in the artery. The ideal patch reduces
      bleeding and prevents recurrent blockage.This is looking at long-term results toward
      improvement with the use Accuseal patch than Bovine Patch.

      This study will be a prospective, randomized, evaluation comparing the outcomes resulting
      from the use of two different patches (Accuseal vs Bovine Pericardial) used for CEA.Our
      proposed study will evaluate the perioperative (within 30 days of operation) and long-term (6
      month, 1 year, 2 year, 3 year) complications associated with the Accuseal and Bovine
      Pericardial patches. This will include thrombosis of the carotid artery, and the degree of
      recurrent plaque formation of the patched artery as determined by duplex ultrasound
      evaluation in the perioperative and long-term periods.Patients will be blinded to the type of
      patch they received.Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) (used in this case for time to the event
      analysis) will be used for time to restenosis, time to stroke, and time to late death.

    <description>Accuseal patch - The Goretex Company has since designed a new patch, &quot;the Accuseal,&quot; which is marketed as decreasing the intra-operative time (i.e, having a short hemostasis time) without affecting the perioperative stroke rate.
Bovine Pericardial patch - The Bovine Pericardial patch has been used for nearly two decades, since the late 1990s. However, studies based on retrospective review of data in which patients received the Bovine Pericardial patch, reported the clinical outcomes post-operative stroke, death, time to hemostasis and recurrent restenosis.</description>
