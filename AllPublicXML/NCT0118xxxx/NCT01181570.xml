  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect and safety of adalimumab in approximately 20 subjects
      with mild to moderate psoriasis and sleep apnea and will be conducted in one treatment center
      located in Montreal.

      Patients with psoriasis often have additional disorders such as obesity. Obese patients are
      more at risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea. This is believed to be caused by both the
      collapse of upper airways and inflammation (swelling). Adalimumab, a drug currently approved
      by Health Canada for the treatment of psoriasis, blocks tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      (TNF-alpha). This chemical is present at higher levels in patients with sleep apnea. It is
      believed that adalimumab could improve obstructive sleep apnea by lowering the levels of
      TNF-alpha.

             related procedures.

          -  Patient must be able and willing to self-administer subcutaneous (SC) injections or
             have a qualified person available to administer SC injections.

             study drug, including latex (a component of the pre-filled syringe).

             PUVA (psoralen and ultraviolet A)) less than 30 days before Day 0.

          -  Use of investigational chemical agents within 30 days or five half-lives prior to Day
             0, whichever is longer.

          -  Use of any biological therapy for the treatment of psoriasis less than 90 days before
             Day 0.

          -  Current use of oral or injectable corticosteroids or during the study. Inhaled
             corticosteroids for stable medical conditions are allowed.

             history of recurrent infections, unstable ischemic heart disease, congestive heart
             failure, recent stroke (within the past 90 days), chronic leg ulcer or any other
             condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the patient at risk if
             participating in the study.

          -  Has a history of neurologic symptoms suggestive of central nervous system (CNS)
             demyelinating disease (e.g. optic neuritis, visual disturbance, gait disorder/ataxia,

             ≥ 150 µmol/L.

          -  Current use or plan to use anti-retroviral therapy at any time during the study.

          -  Is known to have immune deficiency or is immunocompromised.
