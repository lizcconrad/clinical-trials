  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The term 'hypersomnia' describes a group of symptoms that includes severe daytime sleepiness
      and sleeping long periods of time (more than 10 hours per night). Sometimes, hypersomnia is
      caused by a problem with the quality of sleep occurring at night, for instance when nighttime
      sleep is disrupted by frequent breathing pauses. In other cases, however, hypersomnia occurs
      even when nighttime sleep is of good quality. These cases of hypersomnia are presumed to be a
      symptom of brain dysfunction, and so are referred to as hypersomnias of central (i.e., brain)
      origin, or primary hypersomnias.

      The causes of most of these primary hypersomnias are not known. However, our group has
      recently identified a problem with the major brain chemical responsible for sedation, known
      as GABA. In a subset of our hypersomnia patients, there is a naturally-occurring substance
      that causes the GABA receptor to be hyperactive. In essence, it is as though these patients
      are chronically medicated with Valium (or Xanax or alcohol, all substances that act through
      the GABA system), even though they do not take these medications.

      Current treatment of central hypersomnias is limited. For the fraction of cases with
      narcolepsy, there are FDA-approved, available treatments. However, for the remainder of
      patients, there are no treatments approved by the FDA. They are usually treated with
      medications approved for narcolepsy, but sleep experts agree that these medications are often
      not effective for this group of patients.

      Based on our understanding of the GABA abnormality in these patients, we evaluated whether
      flumazenil (an medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of overdose of GABA
      medications or the reversal of GABA-based anesthesia) would reverse the GABA abnormality in
      our patients. In a test tube model of this disease, flumazenil does in fact return the
      function of the GABA system to normal. The investigators have treated a few patients with
      flumazenil and most have felt that their hypersomnia symptoms improved with this treatment.

      To determine whether flumazenil is truly beneficial for primary hypersomnia, this study will
      compare flumazenil to an inactive pill (the placebo). All subjects will receive both
      flumazenil and the placebo at different times, and their reaction times and symptoms will be
      compared on these two treatments to determine if one is superior. Currently, flumazenil can
      only be given through an injection into a vein (i.e., intravenously). This study will
      evaluate this intravenous dosing as well as a new form of flumazenil, which is taken as a
      lozenge to be dissolved under the tongue. If this study shows that flumazenil is more
      effective than placebo in the treatment of hypersomnia, it will identify a potential new
      therapy for this difficult-to-treat disorder.

    <measure>Change in Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) Median Reaction Time</measure>
    <time_frame>10, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 minutes after drug administration (averaged for all time points for each subject)</time_frame>
    <description>The PVT measures the reaction time to button press following the presentation of a visual stimulus, reported here as the median reaction time for multiple presentations during the 10 minute task. The measure used was the change in median reaction time from baseline to drug administration, where the median reaction time at each of the time points (below) was averaged to provide a single on-treatment value for median reaction time. The measure was then calculated as baseline value - treatment value, such that higher numbers denote improvement from baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>10, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 minutes after drug administration (averaged for all time points for each subject)</time_frame>
    <description>A PVT lapse is defined as a reaction time exceeding 500 msec following the presentation of a single stimulus, which are then summed for the entire 10 minute PVT testing period. The measure used was the change in the frequency of lapses from baseline to drug administration (calculated as baseline value - average value with study drug, where higher numbers denote improvement from baseline).</description>

    <time_frame>10, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 minutes after drug administration (averaged for all time points for each subject)</time_frame>
    <description>The PVT duration of lapse domain is defined as the reciprocal of the reaction time averaged across the slowest 10% of responses. The measure used was the change in duration of lapse domain from baseline to drug administration (calculated as baseline value - average value with study drug, where lower numbers denote improvement from baseline).</description>

    <time_frame>10, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 minutes after drug administration (averaged for all time points for each subject)</time_frame>
    <description>The optimum response times is defined as the reciprocal of the reaction time averaged across the fastest 10% of responses. The measure used was the change in optimum response time from baseline to following drug administration (calculated as baseline value - average value with study drug, where lower numbers denote improvement from baseline).</description>

    <measure>PVT Additional Measure #4, Change in False Response Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>10, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 minutes after drug administration (averaged for all time points for each subject)</time_frame>
    <description>The false response frequency is defined as the number of button presses when no stimulus is presented. The measure used was the change in false response frequency from baseline to drug administration (calculated as baseline value - average value with study drug, where higher numbers denote improvement from baseline).</description>

    <time_frame>10, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 minutes after drug administration (averaged for all time points for each subject)</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of the 10 minute PVT testing period, subjects were asked to rate their current level of sleepiness along a line, which was transformed into a numeric value from 1-10, such that high levels indicated more severe subjective sleepiness. The measure used was the change in this rating from baseline to drug administration (calculated as baseline value - average value with study drug, where higher numbers denote improvement from baseline).</description>

    <measure>Change in Stanford Sleepiness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 minutes after drug administration (averaged for all time points for each subject)</time_frame>
    <description>The Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) is a subjective rating of sleepiness, with score ranging from 1 to 7, where higher values reflect more severe sleepiness. The measure used was change in SSS from baseline to drug administration (calculated as baseline value - average value with study drug, where higher numbers denote improvement from baseline).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Electroencephalogram (EEG) Power</measure>
    <time_frame>following drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>EEG signals reflect the state of excitability of the cerebral cortex and correlate highly with levels of behavioral arousal. This is quantifiable as 'power' of the signal (microvolts squared/signal frequency). The EEG signals will be acquired and stored for off-line power analysis and comparison between treatment conditions.</description>

        <description>The PVT measures the reaction time to button press following the presentation of a visual stimulus, reported here as the median reaction time for multiple presentations during the 10 minute task. The measure used was the change in median reaction time from baseline to drug administration, where the median reaction time at each of the time points (below) was averaged to provide a single on-treatment value for median reaction time. The measure was then calculated as baseline value - treatment value, such that higher numbers denote improvement from baseline.</description>

The measure used was the change in false response frequency from baseline to drug administration (calculated as baseline value - average value with study drug, where higher numbers denote improvement from baseline).</description>
