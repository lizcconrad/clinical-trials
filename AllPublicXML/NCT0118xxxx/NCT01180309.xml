      Purpose To investigate the relationship between lingual frenum and possible alterations in
      the articulation of phonemes.

      Methods This is a quantitative observational study, the individual operative kind with
      transversal time reference. The population sample consisted of 16 individuals, each one with
      their phonological system complete. The data were captured through an application form that
      contained relevant aspects as to the qualitative-classification of the lingual frenum,
      quantitative-relation of mouth opening, with and without the tongue in the papillae, tongue
      mobility and ERT - 78 phonologically balanced words.

    <measure>Relation between lingual frenulum altered and articulation phonetics</measure>
    <description>The quantitative assessment, we could classify the lingual frenulum as normal, values above 60%; questions to amend the frenulum-values between 50% and 60% and changed (short and / or anterior)-values below 50%.
Finally, we carried out the assessment phonetics (AF) and it was applied Exam 12 Phonetic-Phonological ERT. This test, is composed of 78 pictures phonologically balanced, lexical repertoire familiar to the individual and easily recognizable pictorial.</description>
