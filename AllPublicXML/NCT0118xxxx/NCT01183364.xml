    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to determine the recommended doses of
      STA-9090 (ganetespib) and docetaxel for the treatment of subjects with solid tumor
      malignancies. The safety and tolerability of the treatment will also be evaluated.

    <description>Pharmacokinetics of STA-9090 (ganetespib) and Docetaxel. This includes concentrations of these drugs in patients' blood at various protocol-specified times relative to the time of dose administration. These will be summarized by parameters including maximum concentration, total exposure and how fast the patient's body gets rid of the drug (known as Cmax, AUC, t1/2, respectively).</description>

    <description>One treatment cycle will consist of weekly treatments for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period. Treatment cycles will be repeated every 3 weeks. STA-9090 will be administered on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle and docetaxel will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle. Each agent will be administered as a separate 1-hour intravenous infusion.</description>
