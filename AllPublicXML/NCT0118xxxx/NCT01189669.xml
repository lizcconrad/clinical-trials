  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dietary intervention study designed to assess the impact of long chain (LC) n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in young women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
      Considering that LC n-3 PUFA have been reported to have a beneficial affect on many of the
      adverse metabolic and hormonal aspects of PCOS, it was hypothesised that dietary
      supplementation with LC n-3 PUFA would have a beneficial therapeutic impact.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a chronic condition affecting young women of reproductive
      age. Long-term, safe and efficacious treatments are needed for women with this condition, and
      dietary therapy may have an important role in its treatment. LC n-3 PUFA have been shown to
      be potent biological regulators, involved in the amelioration of many of the adverse
      metabolic risk factors which are often present in women with PCOS. The aim of this study was
      to explore the impact of LC n-3 PUFA on fasting and post-prandial lipid metabolism, as well
      as on the hormonal profile of women with PCOS.
