    <textblock>
      The objective of this pivotal study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the EVAHEART LVAS
      as a bridge-to-transplant for subjects with end stage heart failure. Subjects will be
      followed for 180 days after the EVAHEART LVAS implant or until cardiac transplant or explant
      for recovery (+ 60 days or discharge). If after 180 days post-implant the subject has not
      received a cardiac transplant or the device has not been explanted, the subject will continue
      to be followed monthly.
