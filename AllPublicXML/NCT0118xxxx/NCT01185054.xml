      The objective of this study is to clarify the current standard of care by determining if
      Electrolyte Maintenance Solution (EMS) is truly the optimal fluid to be used in low-risk
      children who present to an Emergency Department (ED) with &lt; 72 hours of vomiting or diarrhea.

    <textblock>
      Gastroenteritis remains a major cause of morbidity amongst Canadian children. The primary
      treatment focus revolves around the use of Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) to treat
      dehydration and replace intravascular volume. Since diarrheal disease in Canadian children
      usually results in mild dehydration and minimal sodium losses, the use of low sodium
      Electrolyte Maintenance Solutions (EMS) has become the standard of care. However, given that
      North American children infrequently develop severe dehydration, it is unclear if the routine
      use of EMS is justified. When pediatricians directly dispense EMS, 16 children need to be
      treated to prevent 1 unscheduled office visit, however the upper bound of the 95% confidence
      interval is an astounding 508 patients. In addition, EMS is considered by some to be
      prohibitively expensive, with 15% of pediatricians believing it to be too expensive for their
      patients to purchase. An additional 40% report that taste is a major barrier to consumption.
      As a result, oral fluid replenishment is often underutilized and IV rehydration employed
      instead. Our goal is to provide evidence to guide the selection of the optimal ORT fluids in
      low-risk children, thus increasing its use, enhancing its success, and reducing the reliance
      on intravenous rehydration. We hypothesize that the strict adherence to EMS use in low-risk
      children may actually be counterproductive by resulting in reduced fluid intake and
      potentially increasing the use of intravenous rehydration.
