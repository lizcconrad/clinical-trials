    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the combination of pazopanib and everolimus in patients
      that have a malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or
      palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective, or metastatic or locally
      advanced unresectable kidney cancer. In this research study the investigators are testing the
      safety of the combination of pazopanib and everolimus as well as to find the appropriate dose
      to use for further studies.

      -  This protocol has two parts, Phase I and Expansion Cohort. Once the maximum tolerated
           dose has been identified in the Phase I portion, an expansion cohort of patients with
           metastatic or locally advanced unresectable kidney cancer will be enrolled.

        -  Each treatment cycle lasts 4 weeks during which the participant will be taking pazopanib
           and everolimus orally daily.
