  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major aim of the this study is to replicate findings of previous research that examined
      the effects of acute exercise on sexual arousal in women in a novel population, namely, women
      taking antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or selective
      serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) class. In previous studies it has
      been found that acute, moderate-intensity exercise facilitated physiological sexual arousal
      responses in healthy, sexually functional women. However, it is known that antidepressants
      may induce sexual dysfunction, and thus in the present study, the investigators are examining
      whether acute exercise may facilitate sexual responses in women with taking antidepressants,
      including women with antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction.

          -  currently receiving a consistent dosage of escitalopram, citalopram, sertraline,
             desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, or duloxetine

          -  currently sexually active

          -  willing and able to exercise

          -  experiencing regular menstrual cycles

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  currently taking more than one psychoactive medication

          -  factors indicating risk of cardiovascular activity, including acute or chronic
             cardiovascular illness, including clinically significant hypertension (defined as
             self-reported hypertension or &quot;blood pressure greater than 140/90&quot; or receiving
             medications designed to treat hypertension); recent chest pain; frequent or recurrent
             faint or dizzy spells; severe or untreated exercise-related asthma; or musculoskeletal
             illness or injury that would be expected to worsen with physical exercise.
             Additionally, women will be excluded if they are found to have any of the following as
             measured during the fitness assessment of the first session: a BMI over 40, waist
             circumference over 40 inches, waist-to-hip ratio of greater than 0.9, systolic blood
             pressure greater than 150 or diastolic pressure over 95, or resting heart rate over
             90.

          -  factors associated with significant genital nerve damage, including: previous major
             pelvic surgery that may have caused nerve damage, including hysterectomy, vulvectomy,
             circumcision, colostomy, cystostomy, or serious bladder, rectal, or abdominal surgery;
             or neurological impairment due to diabetes, stroke, pelvic nerve damage secondary to
             trauma, cancer treatments, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis or spinal cord
             damage.

          -  factors associated with non-normative endocrine function, including: perimenopausal or
             menopausal status, or &gt;1 missed menstrual period in the previous 6 months; or
             currently pregnant, breastfeeding, or having breastfed within the past 3 months; or
             reporting clinically significant untreated renal or endocrine disease

          -  untreated serious mental health conditions

          -  sexual aversion or distress due to history of unwanted sexual contact
