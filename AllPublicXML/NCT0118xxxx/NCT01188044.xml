  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One way to assess impacts of nutrition supplements to health is to measure physical activity.
      Physical activity can be measured with small devices called &quot;accelerometers&quot;. Before they can
      be used, the devices need to be validated in the population in question. Objectives of this
      study are to test accelerometers in field conditions and validate their use in 16-18 months
      old Malawian toddlers. This study does not have a pre-set hypothesis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accelerometers have not been validated in children under 2 years of age. In this study 50
      toddlers from Lungwena will be recruited. The participants will wear an ActiGraph GT3X+
      -accelerometer fitted on their waist with an elastic belt for 7 days. During the measuring,
      they will have two videotaped one-hour activity observations while wearing and additional
      accelerometer device fitted on their ankle. The output from the two devices will be compared
      to observed activity classified with CPAF-method.

    <description>Videotaped observation of physical activity is classified by CPAF-method. Vector magnitude of the ActiGraph device attached to hip is compared to this gold standard and cut-off point values are determined by ROC curve analysis. Values are presented in counts/15 seconds. Sensitivity and specificity of the determined cut-point values in predicting the right activity class are also calculated.</description>
