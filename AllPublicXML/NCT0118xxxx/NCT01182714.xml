  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total abdominal hysterectomy is a common gynaecological operation performed worldwide. In
      Hong Kong, it was the most common gynaecological open procedure done and the number of
      hysterectomies performed increased by almost 50% in 2004 when compared to 1999. In-dwelling
      catheter use after uncomplicated abdominal hysterectomy has been the standard method for
      bladder treatment after the operation. It is traditionally advocated to assess urinary output
      and to prevent post-operative urinary retention as patients with abdominal wound are unable
      to increase the intra-abdominal pressure to aid voiding. However, in-dwelling catheters have
      been associated with increased white cell counts and higher rates of positive urine cultures,
      and subsequently urinary tract infection can lead to increased morbidity, duration of
      hospital stay, and overall healthcare cost.

      Duration of catheter use post-operatively is generally based on custom rather than
      evidence-based knowledge and therefore varies considerably. The current practice of the
      investigators hospital is to leave an in-dwelling catheter in-situ for 24 hours after an
      uncomplicated open gynaecological surgery. Schiotz et al showed that twenty-four-hour
      catheterization after common gynaecological procedures was associated with a low rate of
      voiding problems after catheter removal. Post-operative urinary retention leading to bladder
      atony may increase the long-term morbidity through increased risk of infection, detrusor
      instability and voiding difficulties. In-dwelling catheter in the immediate post-operative
      period will help to combat this problem. However, this has to be balanced against the
      potential risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infection which varies from 5% to 43% in
      the published trials.

      A prospective randomized study comparing immediate versus delayed catheter removal following
      hysterectomy showed that delayed removal after operation was not associated with an increased
      rate of febrile events or urinary tract infections, but a significantly higher subjective
      pain assessment. The size of the catheter used was 16F which was not the standard 12F that
      the investigators used in the investigators hospital setting. It is postulated that if a
      smaller caliber in-dwelling catheter is used, it will not result in an increased subjective
      pain assessment, and the catheter can be left in-situ for 24 hours without causing increased
      adverse outcomes but possibly reducing recatheterisation rate post-operatively.
