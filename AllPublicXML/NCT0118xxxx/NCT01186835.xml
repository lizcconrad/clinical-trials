  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether the use of botulinum toxin (Dysport ®) in
      conjunction with a hyaluronic acid filler (Restylane®) will improve the appearance of
      wrinkles on the forehead and glabella (area between the eyebrows) better than botulinum toxin
      alone. These two products have been FDA approved to improve the appearance of facial
      wrinkles.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Two blinded dermatologists will rate each photograph of each subject at baseline, week 2, month 3, and month 6. The raters will provide a glabellar wrinkle score and a forehead wrinkle score for each photograph. The raters will not know what treatments the subjects received or at what point in time the photographs were taken.</description>

    <measure>Measure: Percent Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Two blinded dermatologists will also rate the percent improvement between the before and after photographs (Appendix III).
A live blinded dermatologist will determine which side looks better at week 0, week 2, month 3, and month 6.
A subject self-evaluation will be administered at week 2, month 3, and month 6.
A subject satisfaction questionnaire will be administered at month 6.</description>
