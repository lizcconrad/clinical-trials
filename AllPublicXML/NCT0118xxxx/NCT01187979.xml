  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of a cash-incentivised prevention
      intervention on reducing HIV incidence rates in high-school learners in rural KwaZulu-Natal.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impact of the cash incentivised intervention will be assessed using a matched pair,
      cluster randomised controlled trial design. The 14 selected high schools in the Vulindlela
      School Circuit will be matched in pairs. The matched pairs of schools will be the unit of
      randomisation. Baseline measurements, using a standardised tool (structured questionnaire and
      biological specimens) will be undertaken simultaneously in each matched pair and will include
      all eligibly enrolled and consenting learners in the respective schools. On completion of
      baseline measurements in each matched pair of schools, the randomisation code for the pair
      will be revealed and the intervention will be implemented in the intervention school. All
      schools will receive the same prevention intervention but only the intervention school will
      receive the cash incentives. Follow-up measurements will be undertaken approximately 12 and
      24 months after implementation of the intervention using a similar standardised assessment
      tool to that used at baseline. At baseline and during follow-up assessments in intervention
      and control schools, linked HIV and substance use testing will be undertaken in all learners
      and pregnancy testing in female learners. Other secondary endpoints will be assessed using a
      structured questionnaire.
