  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study adds irinotecan, temozolomide and bevacizumab to the chemotherapy regimen
      currently used to treat Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT). The investigators are
      doing this study to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the combination of irinotecan,
      temozolomide and bevacizumab has on the patient and the DSRCT cancer.
