      This study in young and elderly healthy subjects will investigate the effect of nicotine on
      arousal, cognitive task and social cognition after acute dose administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor subject knows the name of the assigned drug),
      placebo-controlled, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), three-way-crossover trial
      (participants may receive different interventions sequentially during the trial) in young and
      elderly healthy volunteers. The three-way-crossover treatment phase will consist of three
      blinded treatment periods separated by a wash out period (the period allowed for the entire
      administered drug to be eliminated from the body) of 2 to 7 days. The study duration for each
      volunteer will be approximately 8 weeks. Each volunteer enrolled will be randomized to
      receive Treatment A (1mg nicotine per dosing), Treatment B (2mg nicotine per dosing) or
      Treatment C (placebo) during one of their treatment period. The study drug (nicotine or
      placebo) will be administered three times daily on Day 1 of each treatment phase as a mouth
      spray, separated 2 to 3 hours from each other (i.e. 0h; and 2 to 3h; and 4 to 6h post first
      dosing). Three different blocks of cognitive assessments will follow, one after each drug
      administration. Safety evaluations include adverse event monitoring, vital signs and clinical
      laboratory tests. Each volunteer participating will receive 3 identical study drug
      administrations per dosing day (2 to 3 hours from each other), resulting in an overall dose
      of 3 mg nicotine (Treatment A), 6 mg nicotine (Treatment B) or 0 mg nicotine (Treatment C)
      per dosing day. By the end of the study, after the 3-way crossover, each volunteer will have
      received 9 mg nicotine via mouth spray.

             or if sexually active, be practicing a highly effective method of birth control and

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening
             and a negative urine pregnancy test at admission (each study period)

             insufficiency, thyroid disease, infection, or any other illness that the investigator
             considers clinically significant should exclude the subject (Subjects with
             well-controlled hypertension will be allowed to participate)

          -  Significant history of or current psychiatric or neurological illness

          -  Smoking cigarettes (or equivalent) or the use of nicotine based products, within 3
             months prior to study drug administration. Current use of any medication for smoking
             cessation such as nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion or varenicline
