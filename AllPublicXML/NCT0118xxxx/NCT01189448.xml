  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background : When a mother contracts toxoplasmosis during pregnancy, the parasite may be
      transmitted from to her unborn child. This results in congenital toxoplasmosis, which may
      cause damage to the eyes and nervous system of the child. To date, no method has been proved
      effective to prevent this transmission. In France, spiramycin is usually prescribed to women
      who have toxoplasma seroconversion in pregnancy, however its efficacy has not been
      determined. The standard treatment for toxoplasmosis is the combination of the antiparasitic
      drugs pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, but this strategy has not been evaluated for the
      prevention of mother-to-child transmission.

      Purpose : Randomized phase 3 trial to determine whether pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine is more
      effective than spiramycin to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis.

      The protocol is a comparison of 2 strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission of T.
      gondii following maternal seroconversion.

      Screening for toxoplasmosis is mandatory in France. Patients with confirmed seroconversion
      will be eligible for the trial, after 14 weeks gestational age.

      Participants will be randomly allocated to one of the treatment groups, and will receive
      open-label pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine or spiramycin.

      The protocol will not change the usual procedures for prenatal diagnosis, nor will it change
      the management of infected fetuses and neonates.

Follow-up includes clinical and biological tolerance, according to usual recommendations. Monthly fetal ultrasound is performed. Prenatal diagnosis with amniocentesis is offered after 18 weeks gestation, usually 4 weeks after the maternal infection.
Treatment is be stopped or changed in case of toxicity. If prenatal diagnosis shows fetal infection with T. gondii, management is to be determined by the clinicians with the patient. If the prenatal diagnosis is negative the treatment can be stopped in order to reduce the risk of intolerance, providing that the mother receives at least 4 weeks of therapy.</description>
