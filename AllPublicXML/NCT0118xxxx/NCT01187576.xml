      Background The present study protocol describes the trial design of a primary care
      intervention cohort study, which examines whether an extended, multi-professional physical
      activity referral (PAR) intervention is more effective in enhancing and maintaining
      self-reported physical activity than ordinary physical activity recommendations. The study
      targets patients with newly diagnosed hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes.

      Secondary outcomes include: need of pharmacological therapy; blood pressure/plasma glucose;
      physical fitness and anthropometric variables; mental health; health related quality of life;
      and cost-effectiveness. Methods/Design The study is designed as a long-term intervention.
      Three primary care centres are involved in the study, each constituting one of three
      treatment groups: 1) Intervention group (IG): multi-professional team intervention with PAR,
      lifestyle brochure; 2) Control group A (CA): ordinary recommendations on health behaviours,
      lifestyle brochure; and 3) Control group B: treatment as usual (retrospective data
      collection).

      The intervention is based on self-determination theory and follows the principles of
      motivational interviewing. Physical activity is measured with the International Physical
      Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and expressed as metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-minutes per
      week. Physical fitness is estimated with the 6-minute walk test in IG only. Variables such as
      health behaviours; health-related quality of life; motivation to change; mental health;
      demographics and socioeconomic characteristics are assessed with an electronic study
      questionnaire that submits all data to a patient database, which automatically provides
      instant feed-back on the patients' health status.

      Cost-effectiveness of the intervention is evaluated continuously and the intermediate

      - 3 - outcomes of the intervention are extrapolated by economic modelling. The first
      statistical analyses and compilation of results will be performed one year after inclusion of
      the first patient or when the IG and CA have included 60 and 30 eligible patients
      respectively. Discussion By helping patients to overcome practical, social and cultural
      obstacles and increase their internal motivation for physical activity we aim to improve
      their physical health in a long-term perspective. The targeted patients belong to a patient
      category that is supposed to benefit from increased physical activity in terms of improved
      physiological values, mental status and quality of life, decreased risk of complications and
      maybe a decreased need of medication.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes or hypertension or both and consecutive
        primary care patients with suspected type 2 diabetes or hypertension will be screened for
        inclusion. The diagnose criterion for type 2 diabetes in both the Intervention and the
        Control groups is defined as a 2 x fasting plasma glucose (fP-glu) ≥ 7.0 mmol/l according
        to WHO guidelines [29]. The diagnose criterion for hypertension is defined as a resting
        systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg. Hypertension is
        confirmed by a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring: a systolic blood pressure ≥
        135 mmHg and/or a

          -  13 - diastolic blood pressure ≥ 85 mmHg
