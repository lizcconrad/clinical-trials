  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, open-label, non-comparative, Phase IIIb trial to assess the
      convenience, safety and efficacy of the new Gonal-F fbm [recombinant follicle stimulating
      hormone (r-FSH)] liquid formulation, in common setting for ovulation induction (OI) and also
      in in-vitro fertilization (IVF).

        <description>Pregnancy rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with diagnosis of pregnancy, who underwent OI/IUI. Clinical pregnancy: Evidence of pregnancy by clinical or ultrasound parameters at 12 weeks after fertilization. Biochemical pregnancy: Evidence of conception based only on biochemical data in the serum or urine before ultrasound evidence of a gestational sac. Ongoing pregnancy was defined when the pregnancy had completed 20 weeks of gestation.</description>
