  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if early Barrett's specialized intestinal
      metaplasia can be detected by measuring early increased blood supply of the esophageal
      tissue, with 4 Dimensional Elastic Light-Scattering Fingerprinting, (4D-ELF) technology in
      real time.

    <description>To determine if early increase blood supply (EIBS), as measured in Barrett's glandular mucosa segment, can predict the presence of Dysplasia in patients with known diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus (BE).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>determine if EIBS can predict presence of BE in patients undergoing upper endoscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>EIBS measurements taken from buccal mucosa and esophagus will be compared in patients without BE, patients with BE without dysplasia, and patients with BE dysplasia. EIBS measurements will be obtained from normal squamous mucosa in the mouth, proximal esophagus, areas of BE in the distal esophagus, and measurements from the gastric cardia/hiatal hernia (at least 4 cm below the Z line.</description>
