      At the conclusion of study AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 (NCT00071799), eligible participants could
      be enrolled in an optional extension phase in order to continue treatment with azacitidine
      until it became commercially available; the continued treatment was for ethical and safety
      reasons only and not to provide additional efficacy data.

      At the conclusion of study AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 (NCT00071799), eligible participants could
      be enrolled in an optional extension phase in order to continue treatment with azacitidine
      until it became commercially available; the continued treatment was for ethical and safety
      reasons only and not to provide additional efficacy data.

      During the extension phase, participants were treated based on 28-day cycles and monitored
      for hematologic, nonhematologic, and renal toxicities. Recommended monitoring procedures
      included complete blood count with differential and platelets at least once each cycle prior
      to dosing and as needed, bone marrow biopsy and aspirate as clinically indicated, and
      additional tests or more frequent monitoring at the investigator's discretion based on the
      patient's clinical status. The azacitidine dose could be modified for toxicities. Laboratory
      data were not collected during the extension phase.

          <title>International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)</title>
          <description>The international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) is a standard for risk assessment in primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) that categorizes prognoses taking into account cytogenetics, cytopenias, blasts and blood counts. The scale is 0-3.5 at .5 increments. Scores of 2.5-3.5 represent high risk which corresponds to poorer prognosis. The assessment was performed by the Independent Review Committee.</description>
