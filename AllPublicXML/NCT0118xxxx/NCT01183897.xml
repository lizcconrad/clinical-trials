    <description>This phase II study of the anti-GD2 murine IgG3 monoclonal antibody 3F8 combined with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) will assess response in of primary refractory neuroblastoma in bone marrow (i.e., incomplete response to standard treatment).</description>

    <description>This phase II, open-label, single arm trial assesses the anti-NB activity of high-dose 3F8 (80 mg/m2/day), which is used in cycles 1-2, with return to standard 3F8 dosage (20 mg/m2/day) in subsequent cycles.Clinical results will be compared to those in the predecessor trials which used only the standard 3F8 dosage. Starting with A(6), patients no longer receive high-dose 3F8 but receive only standard dose 3F8 (20mg/m2/day) for all cycles The patients have primary refractory BM disease. Protocol treatment is through 24 months.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR63-65 will be used to assess MRD in BM. 13-cis-retinoic acid is started no later than after cycle 4 (i.e., after response is scored), but sooner if CR is achieved after cycles 1, 2, or 3, or if early HAMA develops.</description>

             disease.
