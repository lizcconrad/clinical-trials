      This study will evaluate the effect of a senior center-based comprehensive therapeutic
      lifestyle intervention delivered through group-based counseling and motivational interviewing
      (MINT-TLC) among 250 hypertensive African American or Latino seniors age 60 and older in a
      randomized control trial.

    <description>Physical activity is assessed using the Yale Physical Activity Scale (YPAS) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Data collected with the YPAS will be reported as a final total activity dimension score. Data collected for the IPAQ will be expressed in MET-min per day or categorically (low, moderate, high).</description>

    <description>This intervention is based on established clinical practice guidelines for prevention and treatment of hypertension, which recommend weight loss (if overweight), limiting sodium and alcohol intake, regular physical activity, and eating a low-fat diet that is rich in fruit and vegetables. Seniors will attend weekly group classes conducted by trained research assistants for the first 12 weeks (intensive phase); followed by three individual motivational interview (MINT) sessions that will occur monthly over the next three months (extended phase); and finally each senior will receive three bi-monthly booster MINT sessions in the remaining six months (maintenance phase).</description>

    <description>Seniors randomized to the control arm will receive a single individual brief advice session on therapeutic lifestyle changes recommended for blood pressure reduction. In addition, they will be given print versions of the NHLBI publications &quot;Your Guide to Lowering Blood Pressure&quot;; and &quot;Facts about the DASH Eating Plan.&quot; Sessions will be delivered by trained research assistants.</description>
