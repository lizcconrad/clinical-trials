  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To supplement the current evidence of the effect of Pradaxa® (dabigatran etexilate) on
      coagulation parameters, including a calibrated thrombin time test, in patients with moderate
      renal impairment undergoing elective total hip- or knee-replacement surgery, this PK/PD study
      will be conducted.

    <measure>Dabigatran Concentration in Plasma, Estimated From Local Hemoclot®</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, day of surgery 1 hour (h) and 2h after drug intake (di) for late finalization of surgery, 4h and 8h after di for early finalization of surgery, 15 minutes (min) before di at days 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, at day 6 also 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h and 24 after di</time_frame>
    <description>The Hemoclot® test kit measures the dTT (diluted Thrombin time). In the present trial, as a first step, the dTT in calibration samples that had known Dabigatran concentrations was measured locally with the Hemoclot® test kit, and a linear calibration curve was fitted to the data from the calibration samples. Thereafter, for each patient at each time-point, the dTT was measured with the Hemoclot® kit and the Dabigatran concentration was read off from the calibration curve.
These estimated concentrations are compared with concentrations measured in parallel with HPLC-MS/MS.
As the trial objective is the method comparison and not the detection of the absolute concentrations of either of the methods, the result is reported as a relative bioavailability [%], see &quot;Statistical Analysis 1&quot; below. Only concentrations &gt;= LLOQ (Lower Limit of concentration) are included in the quantitative comparison.</description>

    <description>The Hemoclot® test kit measures the dTT (diluted Thrombin time). In the present trial, as a first step, the dTT in calibration samples that had known Dabigatran concentrations was measured centrally with the Hemoclot® test kit, and a linear calibration curve was fitted to the data from the calibration samples. Thereafter, for each patient at each time-point, the dTT was measured with the Hemoclot® kit and the Dabigatran concentration was read off from the calibration curve.

        <title>Dabigatran Concentration in Plasma, Estimated From Local Hemoclot®</title>
        <description>The Hemoclot® test kit measures the dTT (diluted Thrombin time). In the present trial, as a first step, the dTT in calibration samples that had known Dabigatran concentrations was measured locally with the Hemoclot® test kit, and a linear calibration curve was fitted to the data from the calibration samples. Thereafter, for each patient at each time-point, the dTT was measured with the Hemoclot® kit and the Dabigatran concentration was read off from the calibration curve.
These estimated concentrations are compared with concentrations measured in parallel with HPLC-MS/MS.
As the trial objective is the method comparison and not the detection of the absolute concentrations of either of the methods, the result is reported as a relative bioavailability [%], see &quot;Statistical Analysis 1&quot; below. Only concentrations &gt;= LLOQ (Lower Limit of concentration) are included in the quantitative comparison.</description>
