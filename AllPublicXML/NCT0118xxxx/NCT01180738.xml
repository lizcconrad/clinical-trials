      The purpose of this study is to compare two different walking training programs for persons
      with chronic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) and overground walking training (OWT) are
      two interventions commonly applied for enhancing gait and balance in patients with chronic
      stroke. BWSTT and OWT are often used by clinicians separately or in tandem. While various
      aspects of the two interventions have been investigated in the past, limited research has
      been conducted to compare the effects of the two interventions in patients with chronic
      stroke.

      Longer training durations may not always be feasible due to limited reimbursement options,
      lack of clinic accessibility, or transportation restrictions for patients with chronic
      deficits following stroke. A short burst of training consisting of a ''booster''-like
      protocol may provide a convenient option for some patients with chronic stroke to improve
      necessary functional skills in a short period of time.

      The primary purpose of this pilot study is to compare walking speed immediately and 3-months
      after a short-burst of body-weight support treadmill training (BWSTT) or overground walking
      training (OWT) for adults with chronic stroke. Twenty participants with chronic stroke will
      be recruited and screened to determine eligibility for the study. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to either BWSTT or OWT for 30 minutes, 5 days per week for 2 weeks. Outcome
      measures will include assessments of gait speed, endurance, walking pattern, fear of falling,
      balance confidence, anxiety, and activity and participation in daily life. Outcomes will be
      tested prior to (pre-test) and immediately after (post-test) the assigned intervention and
      again 3-months after completing the intervention (retention).
