    <textblock>
      Background:

      Patients with severe mental illness (SMI) have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk
      factors (CVRF) than the general population and a control of these risk factors poorer.
      Serious mental illness often causes health teams to focus interventions in mental illness and
      put aside the CVRF.

      Objectives:

      This project aims to assess the CVRF, stratify the cardiovascular risk, adequate drug
      treatment to reduce this risk and evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention by
      professional community nurses in patients with SMI.

      Materials and Methods:

      Prospective study of a cohort of patients over 18 years with a diagnosis of SMI with two
      cross sections to evaluate the cardiovascular risk and adequacy of drug treatment. The
      investigators calculate the risk to the cardiovascular risk tables with the SCORE (Systematic
      Coronary Risk Evaluation) for countries of low cardiovascular risk and the of Framingham
      REGICOR (Heart registry of Girona, Spain). The adequacy of pharmacotherapy will be assessed
      contrasting it with the recommendations of the Program of Preventive Activities and Health
      Promotion of Family medical association. The intervention will be conducted by professional
      nurses and consist of an initial psycho-educational intervention, and two more reinforcement
      throughout twelve months, of duration less than 30 minutes that will be addressed in an
      integrated manner the clinical situation with regard to cardiovascular risk. If necessary,
      pharmacological treatment will be prescribed. Twelve months after the first intervention, a
      second evaluation on cardiovascular risk and the effectiveness of the intervention will be
      performed.
