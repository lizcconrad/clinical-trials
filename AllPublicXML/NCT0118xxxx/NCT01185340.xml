  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether LY2216684 12 milligrams (mg) or 18
      mg flexible dose once daily is superior to placebo once daily in the adjunctive treatment of
      participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) who are partial responders to their
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment.

      Following the Confirmation (CF) Phase, participants were randomized to adjunctive LY2216684
      or adjunctive placebo if they had &lt;25% improvement in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating
      Scale (MADRS) total score over the past 3 weeks and a current MADRS total score ≥14.
      Participants who did not meet criteria received adjunctive placebo to preserve the blind.

    <measure>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Global Functional Impairment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) was completed by the participant and used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on their work (Item 1), social (Item 2), and family life (Item 3). Each item is measured on a 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) point scale with higher values indicating greater disruption. The Global Functional Impairment Score is the sum of the 3 items, and scores ranged from 0 to 30 with higher values indicating greater disruption in the participant's work life (work/school impairment score), social life (social life/leisure activities impairment score), and family life (family life/home responsibilities impairment score). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

    <measure>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in Fatigue Associated With Depression (FAsD) Impact Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fatigue Associated with Depression (FAsD) is a participant-rated scale with a total of 13 items. Six of the 13 items ask how often participants experience different aspects of fatigue with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Seven of the 13 items ask how often fatigue impacts various aspects of the participant's lives with responses from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The impact subscale score was derived by taking the mean of Items 7 through 13 (applicable items only). Item 12 applied only to participants with a spouse or significant other, and Item 13 applied to participants who had a job or who went to school. The FAsD impact subscale score ranges from 1 to 5. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline subscale score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline subscale score-by-visit.</description>

    <time_frame>Randomization up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) captured occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal ideation was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any 1 of 5 suicidal ideation questions, which included a wish to be dead and 4 different categories of active suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. Suicidal ideation and behavior are defined as treatment-emergent (TE) if not present at baseline. Percentage of participants was calculated by dividing the number of participants with suicide-related TE events by the total number of participants at risk, multiplied by 100%. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Event module.</description>

    <description>LY2216684: flexible dose of 12 or 18 milligrams (mg), administered orally, once daily (QD) for 8 weeks, adjunctive to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
Prior to entering the Adjunctive Treatment (AT) Phase, participants completed a 3-week Confirmation (CF) Phase where they received placebo (administered orally, QD) adjunctive to their SSRI. After the CF Phase, and after randomization criteria were met, participants were randomized to the LY2216684 treatment arm.
For the first 2 weeks of the AT Phase, participants received a starting dose of 12 mg QD. Then, based on efficacy and tolerability, the dose could be increased to 18 mg QD over the next 6 weeks. Participants who had their dose increased to 18 mg QD could have had their dose decreased to 12 mg QD. Participants who completed the AT Phase or discontinued early had the option to enter the Discontinuation (DC) Phase.
During the 1-week abrupt DC Phase, participants maintained their SSRI treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms. The MADRS had a 10-item checklist. Items were rated on a scale of 0 to 6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

          <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</title>
          <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms. The MADRS had a 10-item checklist. Items were rated on a scale of 0 to 6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

        <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) was completed by the participant and used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on their work (Item 1), social (Item 2), and family life (Item 3). Each item is measured on a 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) point scale with higher values indicating greater disruption. The Global Functional Impairment Score is the sum of the 3 items, and scores ranged from 0 to 30 with higher values indicating greater disruption in the participant's work life (work/school impairment score), social life (social life/leisure activities impairment score), and family life (family life/home responsibilities impairment score). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in Fatigue Associated With Depression (FAsD) Impact Subscale Score</title>
        <description>The Fatigue Associated with Depression (FAsD) is a participant-rated scale with a total of 13 items. Six of the 13 items ask how often participants experience different aspects of fatigue with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Seven of the 13 items ask how often fatigue impacts various aspects of the participant's lives with responses from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The impact subscale score was derived by taking the mean of Items 7 through 13 (applicable items only). Item 12 applied only to participants with a spouse or significant other, and Item 13 applied to participants who had a job or who went to school. The FAsD impact subscale score ranges from 1 to 5. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline subscale score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline subscale score-by-visit.</description>

Each item was rated on a 4-point scale (0-3), giving maximum scores of 21 for anxiety and depression subscale. Scores of 11 or more on either subscale were considered to be a significant 'case' of psychological morbidity, while scores of 8-10 represent 'borderline' and 0-7 represent 'normal'. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline subscale score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline subscale score-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Probability of Participants Who Have a Greater Than or Equal to 50 Percent Improvement in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score at Week 8</title>
        <description>A greater than or equal to 50 percent improvement (that is, a decrease from baseline) in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score was defined as response criteria. The MADRS is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms. The MADRS had a 10-item checklist. Items were rated on a scale of 0 to 6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). A categorical repeated measures analysis modeled the probability of response at each visit, and the estimated probabilities were adjusted for treatment, visit, baseline MADRS total score, and treatment-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Depression Subscale Score</title>
        <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a 14-item questionnaire with 2 subscales: anxiety and depression. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale (0-3), giving maximum scores of 21 for anxiety and depression subscale. Scores of 11 or more on either subscale were considered to be a significant 'case' of psychological morbidity, while scores of 8-10 represent 'borderline' and 0-7 represent 'normal'. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline subscale score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline subscale score-by-visit.</description>

        <description>The Fatigue Associated with Depression (FAsD) is a participant-rated scale with a total of 13 items. Six of the 13 items ask how often participants experience different aspects of fatigue with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Seven of the 13 items ask how often fatigue impacts various aspects of the participant's lives with responses from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The experience subscale score was derived by taking the mean of Items 1 through 6, and the average score was the mean of Items 1 through 13 (derived by taking the mean of all applicable items for each participant). Item 12 applied only to participants with a spouse or significant other, and Item 13 applied to participants who had a job or who went to school. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

        <description>The Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) is a self-administered, 16-item questionnaire measuring degree of enjoyment and satisfaction experienced in various areas of daily life during the past week on a 5-point Likert scale (1=very poor and 5=very good). The total raw score is the sum of Items 1 to 14 and ranges from 14 to 70. The raw scores are converted to and expressed as the percentage of the maximum possible score. Higher scores indicate higher levels of enjoyment/satisfaction. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

        <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) captured occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal ideation was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any 1 of 5 suicidal ideation questions, which included a wish to be dead and 4 different categories of active suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. Suicidal ideation and behavior are defined as treatment-emergent (TE) if not present at baseline. Percentage of participants was calculated by dividing the number of participants with suicide-related TE events by the total number of participants at risk, multiplied by 100%. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Event module.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Suicidal Ideation and Behaviors Assessed by Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</title>
          <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) captured occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal ideation was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any 1 of 5 suicidal ideation questions, which included a wish to be dead and 4 different categories of active suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. Suicidal ideation and behavior are defined as treatment-emergent (TE) if not present at baseline. Percentage of participants was calculated by dividing the number of participants with suicide-related TE events by the total number of participants at risk, multiplied by 100%. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Event module.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in Arizona Sexual Experiences (ASEX) Scale</title>
        <description>The Arizona Sexual Experiences (ASEX) scale was used to assess sexual functioning in both males and females. The ASEX total score for the male and female version was calculated as the sum of the responses (rated from 1 [extremely] to 6 [no/never]) of the 5 items of the ASEX scale. Total scores ranged from 5 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater sexual dysfunction. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline score-by-visit.</description>
