    <textblock>
      This proof of concept study proposes to evaluate the feasibility of a
      communications-technology-based chronic care and patient relationship management program to
      improve diabetes self management among adult diabetic patients in an urban safety net
      population by providing between-visit reminders and chronic disease support through cell
      phone text messaging.

      The investigators hypothesize that diabetic patients enrolled in the program will be less
      likely to miss scheduled appointments and will have greater perceived self-efficacy and
      improved patient satisfaction concerning chronic disease management. No-show rates among
      patients enrolled in the program are expected to be lower than among patients receiving
      standard care.

    <measure>Patient Engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient engagement was assessed by patient text message response rates and average response times. Response rates were calculated as a percentage from the number of patient-initiated text messages sent in response to a system-generated request for information (the numerator) divided by the total number of system-generated requests for information (the denominator). Average response times were calculated from system-recorded time stamps for outbound requests sent and inbound patient-initiated responses received.</description>

    <description>Patients will be contacted through SMS text messaging under the following circumstances:
7 days, 2 days, and 1 day before scheduled appointments. Messages will contain the date, time, and location where the appointment is scheduled. Patients will be prompted to respond with 'YES' if they are able to keep their appointment, and 'NO' if they need to reschedule. An acknowledgement of receipt will be sent in response to all patient-initiated messages.
3 days per week to request that patients respond with fasting blood sugar measurements. An acknowledgement of receipt will be sent in response to all patient-initiated messages.</description>
