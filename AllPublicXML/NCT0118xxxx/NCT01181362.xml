    <textblock>
      Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy planning is based on CT images, with tumour volumes
      defined on this volumetric information data set. However, target delineation also depends on
      disease seen endoscopically which may not be visible on CT. We are developing imaging and
      tracking technology to improve target delineation in Radiation Therapy (RT) planning for head
      &amp; neck cancer using quantitative registration of 2D endoscopic information with CT data.
      Diagnostic endoscopy is performed in the upright position. CT images and radiation delivery
      are obtained with the patient in the supine position. The accuracy of the registration will
      be improved if performed in the same position to prevent mobile soft tissue structures
      shifting between the upright and supine positions. Since therapy must be performed in the
      supine position, we intend to check the feasibility of performing endoscopy in the supine
      treatment position. We will compare and assess patient comfort and endoscopic sightlines
      during an endoscopy procedure in both the upright and supine positions.

    <description>All patients will meet the physician at the Head and Neck centre at PMH, where they will have a topical anesthetic (lidocaine endotracheal aerosol, 10 mg/dose) sprayed into both nostrils. After allowing 5-10 minutes to let the anesthetic take effect, they will have an endoscopy procedure using a flexible scope inserted through the nostrils. The procedure will first be performed while patients are sitting up. During the procedure, patients will be asked to rate their discomfort on a 10-point scale. The endoscope will then be removed. After a short rest (15 minutes), the endoscopy procedure will be repeated with patients lying down. They will again be asked to rate their level of discomfort. After another short rest for recovery, they will meet with the physician to discuss both endoscopic procedures and to complete a questionnaire on discomfort, tolerance and acceptability</description>

          -  Psychiatric or addictive disorders which would preclude obtaining informed consent or
             adherence to protocol.

          -  Concurrent illness, which prevents the subject from undergoing endoscopy.
