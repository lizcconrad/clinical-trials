  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)and MR Spectroscopy of the brain are perfect
      tools to investigate the changes in the brainstem and brain evoked by the orthodromically
      impulses of a SCS.

      In case a patient meets all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, he/she will be implanted
      with an epidural neurostimulation lead (electrode).

      The day of implant will be recorded as day 0 (table 1) and will always be a Thursday.

      Post lead implant, the patient will be hospitalized for a small week as per common practice
      in case of the intervention outside of the study.

      During hospital stay, the investigator of the study, or a representative of the product
      manufacturer, Medtronic®, will search for the optimal stimulation parameters to evoke correct
      paraesthesia coverage and pain relief. If appropriate parameters have been found, these will
      be saved in the external neurostimulator.

      After maximum one hour, the neurostimulator will be turned off again.

      On day 12, a Tuesday, a MR spectrospoy will be performed. Each patient will undergo three
      sessions.

      Each session will be divided into a MR spectroscopy session and fMRI session without
      stimulation and a session with stimulation. The MR spectroscopy session without stimulation
      will bring us the baseline in neurobiology of neuropathic pain; after measurement, the
      stimulator will be switch on and a MR spectroscopy will be performed during a longer period
      of time (10 min) in order to determine neurobiological changes in time during SCS.

      The 3 MR spectroscopy sessions will be performed on different regions in the brain (both
      talami and rostral region of anterior cingulated cortex)

    <description>To compare brain activity before and after spinal cord stimulation (with appropriate paraesthesia) using functional magnetic resonance imaging and neurobiological changes in the spectrum (gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) glutamate (Glu) glutamine (Gln) N-acetylaspartate (NAA) Choline-containing compounds (Cho) Creatine plus phophocreatine (total creatine: Cr) Myo-inositiol (Ins) Choline (Cho) Glucose (Glc) Lactate (Lac)) due to stimulation measured by MRS. The primary outcome is the difference in neurobiology between baseline and when the stimulator is on.</description>
