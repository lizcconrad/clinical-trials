  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of virtual reality simulation training in obstetrics and gynecology has not been
      widely studied. The investigators hypothesized that residents randomized to the trainer would
      not perform differently when compared with those who are not randomized. Residents in
      Obstetrics and gynecology are randomized to a 4 month training course on our simulator. They
      are objectively evaluated performing various laparoscopy tasks prior to and after the course.

    <description>The residents are timed in seconds on various laparoscopy tasks. They are also rated by an objective blinded observer in several performance categories and given a score by the observer. These times and scores are recorded upon entry into the study, after randomization to intervention or no intervention.</description>
