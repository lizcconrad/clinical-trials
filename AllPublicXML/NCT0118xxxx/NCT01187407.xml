  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if LY2216684 (flexible dose of 12 to 18 milligrams
      [mg] or fixed dose of 6 mg once daily) is superior to placebo once daily in the adjunctive
      treatment of participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who were identified as partial
      responders to an adequate course of treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      (SSRI) during an 8-week, double-blind, acute adjunctive treatment phase.

      Following the Confirmation (CF) Phase, participants were randomized to adjunctive LY2216684
      or adjunctive placebo if they had &lt;25% improvement in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating
      Scale (MADRS) total score over the past 3 weeks and a current MADRS total score ≥14.
      Participants who did not meet criteria received adjunctive placebo to preserve the blind.

    <measure>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms. The MADRS had a 10-item checklist (sadness [apparent], sadness [reported], inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts). Items were rated on a scale of 0 to 6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

    <measure>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Global Functional Impairment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS was completed by the participant and used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on their work (Item 1), social (Item 2), and family life (Item 3). Each item is measured on a 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) point scale with higher values indicating greater disruption. The Global Functional Impairment Score is the sum of the 3 items, and scores ranged from 0 to 30 with higher values indicating greater disruption in the participant's work life (work/school impairment score), social life (social life/leisure activities impairment score), and family life (family life/home responsibilities impairment score). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

    <measure>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in the Fatigue Associated With Depression (FAsD) Impact Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FAsD is a participant-rated scale with a total of 13 items. Six of the 13 items ask how often participants experience different aspects of fatigue with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Seven of the 13 items ask how often fatigue impacts various aspects of the participant's lives with responses from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The impact subscale score was derived by taking the mean of Items 7 through 13 (applicable items only). Item 12 applied only to participants with a spouse or significant other and Item 13 applied to participants who had a job or who went to school. The FAsD impact subscale score ranges from 1 to 5. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline subscale score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline subscale score-by-visit.</description>

    <description>LY2216684: flexible dose of 12 or 18 milligrams (mg), administered orally, once daily (QD) for 8 weeks, adjunctive to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
Prior to entering the Adjunctive Treatment (AT) Phase, participants completed a 3-week Confirmation (CF) Phase where they received placebo (orally, QD) adjunctive to their SSRI. After the CF Phase, and after randomization criteria were met, participants were randomized to a 12 or 18 mg flexible dose of LY2216684.
During the AT Phase, participants first received 6 mg LY2216684 QD for 3 days, followed by 12 mg QD for the next 11 days. Then, based on efficacy and tolerability, dosage could be increased to 18 mg QD over the next 6 weeks. Participants on 18 mg QD could have had their dose decreased back to 12 mg QD. Participants who completed the AT Phase or discontinued early had the option to enter the Discontinuation (DC) Phase.
During the 1-week abrupt DC Phase, participants maintained their SSRI treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The MADRS is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms. The MADRS had a 10-item checklist (sadness [apparent], sadness [reported], inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts). Items were rated on a scale of 0 to 6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Global Functional Impairment Score</title>
        <description>The SDS was completed by the participant and used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on their work (Item 1), social (Item 2), and family life (Item 3). Each item is measured on a 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) point scale with higher values indicating greater disruption. The Global Functional Impairment Score is the sum of the 3 items, and scores ranged from 0 to 30 with higher values indicating greater disruption in the participant's work life (work/school impairment score), social life (social life/leisure activities impairment score), and family life (family life/home responsibilities impairment score).

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in the Fatigue Associated With Depression (FAsD) Impact Subscale Score</title>
        <description>The FAsD is a participant-rated scale with a total of 13 items. Six of the 13 items ask how often participants experience different aspects of fatigue with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Seven of the 13 items ask how often fatigue impacts various aspects of the participant's lives with responses from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The impact subscale score was derived by taking the mean of Items 7 through 13 (applicable items only). Item 12 applied only to participants with a spouse or significant other and Item 13 applied to participants who had a job or who went to school. The FAsD impact subscale score ranges from 1 to 5. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline subscale score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline subscale score-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score of Less Than or Equal to 10 up to Week 8</title>
        <description>A MADRS total score of less than or equal to 10 was defined as remission criteria. The MADRS is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms. The MADRS had a 10-item checklist (sadness [apparent], sadness [reported], inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts). Items were rated on a scale of 0 to 6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). Percentage of participants was calculated by dividing the number of participants who meet criteria for remission by the total number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100%.</description>

        <description>The HADS is a 14-item questionnaire with 2 subscales: anxiety and depression. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale (0 to 3), giving maximum scores of 21 for anxiety and depression subscale. Scores of 11 or more on either subscale were considered to be a significant 'case' of psychological morbidity, while scores of 8 to 10 represent 'borderline' and scores of 0 to 7 represent 'normal'. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline subscale score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline subscale score-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Individual Items</title>
        <description>The MADRS is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms. The MADRS had a 10-item checklist (sadness [apparent], sadness [reported], inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts). Items were rated on a scale of 0 to 6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline item score, treatment-by-visit and baseline item score-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in The Fatigue Associated With Depression (FAsD) Average Score and Experience Subscale Score</title>
        <description>The FAsD is a participant-rated scale with a total of 13 items. Six of the 13 items ask how often participants experience different aspects of fatigue with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Seven of the 13 items ask how often fatigue impacts various aspects of the participant's lives with responses from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The experience subscale score was derived by taking the mean of Items 1 through 6, and the average score was the mean of Items 1 through 13 (derived by taking the mean of all applicable items for each participant). Item 12 applied only to participants with a spouse or significant other and Item 13 applied to participants who had a job or who went to school. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

        <description>The C-SSRS captured occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal ideation was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any 1 of 5 suicidal ideation questions, which included a wish to be dead and 4 different categories of active suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. Suicidal ideation and behavior are defined as treatment-emergent (TE) if not present at baseline. Percentage of participants was calculated by dividing the number of participants with suicide-related TE events by the total number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100%. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Event module.</description>

        <description>The ASEX scale was used to assess sexual functioning in both males and females. The ASEX total score for the male and female version was calculated as the sum of the responses (rated from 1 [extremely] to 6 [no/never]) of the 5 items of the ASEX scale. Total scores ranged from 5 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater sexual dysfunction. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline score-by-visit.</description>
