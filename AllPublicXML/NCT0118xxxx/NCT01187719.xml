      The primary objective of this two-phase trial is as follows:

        -  To determine the elimination half-life of NVP in HIV positive pregnant women receiving
           it as a single dose in labour in addition to the ZDV and 3TC with or without seven days
           phenytoin (pilot PK phase)

        -  To determine NVP resistance in HIV positive pregnant women receiving it as a single dose
           in labour in addition to ZDV and 3TC with or without seven days phenytoin (main trial
           phase)

      The secondary objectives of this two-phase trial are as follows:

        -  To determine the safety of single dose nevirapine with seven days phenytoin as a part of
           ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT vs. single dose of nevirapine without phenytoin as a part of
           ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT

        -  To determine the HIV status of the infant

        -  To determine the safety of the ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT with seven days of phenytoin on
           the newborn

      Hypothesis: phenytoin reduces the elimination half life of SD NVP and thereby decreases
      development of resistance to NVP in HIV positive pregnant Tanzanian and Zambian women.

      This trial (VITA2) will be done with phenytoin as enzyme inducer to decrease the elimination
      half-life of NVP as it has also shown a significant difference in the elimination half-life
      of NVP in the ENVI study and side effects were also transient and mild. The guidelines for
      ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT has been changed to a more complex regimen. Therefore addition of
      phenytoin OD for 7 days after delivery will not complicate the regimen for the mother.

      Tanzania and Zambia are among the countries in sub-Saharan Africa most affected by the HIV
      pandemic. In 2008, an estimated 85,000 children were living with HIV in Zambia and out of the
      89,000 children born to HIV infected women, 28,000 are infected annually. In Tanzania,
      140,000 children were living with HIV in 2007. Both countries use NVP alone or in combination
      with other drugs as ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT. Little data are available on the extent of NVP
      resistance in the Tanzanian, Zambian PMTCT setting. Moreover, there is no data available on
      the follow-up of mother-infant pair with particular focus on resistance to NVP and the
      infants HIV status. No studies have explored possibilities of reducing NVP resistance by use
      of an enzyme inducer.

      This study seeks to the effect of phenytoin on the pharmacokinetics of NVP and the
      development of NVP resistance on SD NVP as part of the ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT. This
      intervention will be part of the VITA2 trial to test the hypothesis that phenytoin reduces
      the elimination half life of SD NVP and thereby decreases development of resistance to NVP in
      HIV positive pregnant Tanzanian and Zambian women.
