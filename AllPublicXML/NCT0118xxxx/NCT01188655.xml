    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving BASDAI 40 Response at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>BASDAI is a validated self assessment tool used to determine disease activity in participant with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). Utilizing a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of 0-10 (0=none and 10=very severe) participant's answered 6 questions measuring discomfort, pain and fatigue. The final BASDAI score averages the individual assessments for a final score range of 0-10. Participants who achieved a decrease of 40 percent or more from baseline to the following visits are called as responders.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the BASFI at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>BASFI is a validated self assessment tool that determines the degree of functional limitation in AS. Utilizing a VAS of 0-10 (0 = easy, 10 = impossible), participants answered 10 questions assessing their ability in completing normal daily activities or physically demanding activities. The BASFI score is a mean score of the 10 questions.</description>

    <measure>Mean Duration of Morning Stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of morning stiffness is defined as the time elapsed when participant woke up in the morning and was able to resume normal activities without stiffness in minutes (If none was present = 0; If morning stiffness was continuing, average of duration of stiffness over the past 3 days was reported; If stiffness persisted the entire day, 1440 minutes (24h x 60 minutes) was recorded).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in ASQoL at Week 12 and Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>ASQoL is a questionnaire that assesses disease-specific quality of life (QoL). It consists of 18 statements that are relevant to the physical and mental conditions for a participant with AS: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each statement is answered by the participant as a 'Yes' (scored as 1) or 'No' (scored as 0). All item scores are summed to give a total score. Total score can range from 0 (good QoL) to 18 (poor QoL).</description>

    <description>Schober test determines agility of lumbar spine. It measures participant's ability to flex the lower back. Examiner makes a mark at fifth lumbar vertebra (L5); places 1 finger 5 cm below and another 10 cm above the mark. Participant is asked to touch the toes. Examiner measures the increase in distance between 2 fingers.</description>

It consists of 18 statements that are relevant to the physical and mental conditions for a participant with AS: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each statement is answered by the participant as a 'Yes' (scored as 1) or 'No' (scored as 0). All item scores are summed to give a total score. Total score can range from 0 (good QoL) to 18 (poor QoL).</description>
