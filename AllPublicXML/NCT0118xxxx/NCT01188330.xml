  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a disease of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of
      65. A poor outcome in this population has been well established, with very short overall
      survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS).There are numerous bad prognostic factors
      related to the disease itself or to the patient's medical condition.

      This study will evaluate the impact of a Comprehensive Geriatric assessment (CGA) performed
      at diagnosis with planned interventions according to disabilities and monthly follow-up by a
      nurse practitioner during 6 months on functional status of older cancer patients treated for
      Acute myeloid leukaemia. Functional status will be assessed with the Lawson Instrumental
      Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale at diagnosis and 6 months after randomisation.

    <description>Each month after randomization, a nurse practitioner will systematically review the intervention plan.
In case of hospitalisation, the nurse will go and meet the patient and his care giver to check each point of the intervention plan. If an action has not been done, a new proposal will be made to the patient. If the patient is at home or in institution, the nurse practitioner will call the patient and /or his care giver for the same purpose</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 70 years and older

          -  Referred for treatment following a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia.

          -  signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Terminal patients, with a life expectancy estimated to be less than 3 months, will be
             excluded from the study, due to ethical issues and the fact that they are unlikely to
             benefit from this evaluation.
