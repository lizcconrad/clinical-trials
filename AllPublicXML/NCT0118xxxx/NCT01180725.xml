      Background: Constipation is a common problem that affects nearly 60 million Americans. The
      treatment of constipation remains challenging with one half of patients dissatisfied with
      current therapy. There is a need for a food-based, natural, convenient and tasty alternative
      to the currently available OTC laxatives and fiber supplements, particularly for patients
      with occasional and mild constipation. Dried plums and prune juice have been traditionally
      used for the treatment of constipation but has not been systematically assessed in patients
      with well defined constipation. Also, the efficacy, palatability and tolerability of dried
      plums in the treatment of chronic constipation have not been examined.

      Aim: To investigate and compare the effects of dried plums and psyllium on the overall relief
      of constipation symptoms, taste and quality of life in adults with functional constipation in
      a randomized crossover controlled trial.

      Methods: We propose to study 40 subjects with functional constipation in a single blinded,
      randomized, cross-over study comparing 3 weeks of dried plums with 3 weeks of treatment with
      Psyllium

      Data analysis: The primary outcome measure will be the global relief of constipation symptoms
      as rated by the subject at the end of each phase of the study. Additionally, we will assess
      several secondary outcome measures that will include the number of Complete Spontaneous Bowel
      Movements (CSBM) per week, Quality of Life , psychological profile, patient rating of taste
      on a VAS scale, patient rating of bloating, distension, satiety and fullness and patient
      rating of constipation-related symptoms.

      Expected Results: We anticipate that treatment with dried plums will improve symptoms of
      constipation compared to the baseline. This improvement will be comparable to that achieved
      with psyllium (Metamucil) treatment. Additionally, dried plums will offer a natural, food
      based, convenient and more tasty alternative to over-the-counter laxatives and fiber
      supplements.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Constipation as defined by Rome III criteria (3,4). Patients must have symptoms for &gt;
             3 days/month for the past three months and report at least two of the following
             symptoms â‰¥ 25% of the time: straining, lumpy or hard stool, sensation of incomplete
             evacuation, sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage, use of manual maneuvers, &lt; 3
             bowel movements/week. Also, they should have insufficient criteria for IBS, and only
             rarely experience loose stools without the use of laxatives

          2. Adults between the ages of 18-75 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients taking drugs that are known to be constipating will be excluded or asked to
             discontinue medications for at least 2 weeks and reassessed. For example, we will
             recommend that patients taking calcium channel antagonists contact their respective
             primary care physicians to explore alternative medications for hypertension such as
             beta blockers or ACE-inhibitors. If the calcium channel antagonists can to be
             discontinued, patients will be re-screened at least two weeks after the medications
             are discontinued. If patients no longer meet inclusion criteria, they will be excluded
             from the study. Patients who remain constipated will be eligible for enrollment.

          2. Patients with co-morbid illnesses such as severe cardiovascular disease, chronic renal
             failure, or those with previous gastrointestinal surgery except cholecystectomy and
             appendectomy.

          3. Patients with neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, strokes, spinal cord
             injuries, and those who have problems with cognizance, i.e. a mini-mental score of &lt;15
             and/or are legally blind will be excluded.

          4. Patients with Hirschsprung' s disease, or active local anorectal problems such as anal
             fissures, bleeding hemorrhoids, etc

          5. Patients with alternating constipation and diarrhea and those who fulfill the Rome-III
             criteria for irritable bowel syndrome.

          6. Patients using fiber supplements, laxatives, PEG, Tegaserod or Lubiprostone and
             unwilling to discontinue these medications at least 2 weeks prior to the study.

          7. Subjects with a known allergy to psyllium or plums.
