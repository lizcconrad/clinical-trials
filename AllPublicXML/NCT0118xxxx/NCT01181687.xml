      Structured pain assessment is the foundation for the management of pain. Several different
      pain measurement tools exists, among them the Comfort behavioral scale (van Dijk, 2005),
      developed from the original Comfort scale (Ambuel, 1992). The psychometric properties of the
      Comfort scale have been tested in several studies, but so far no Norwegian version of the
      scale has been developed and tested. Neither has the scale been tested in spontaneously
      breathing children undergoing minor surgery. The aim of this study is to establish incipient
      psychometric properties of the Norwegian version of the scale among children aged 0-3 years
      admitted for elective minor surgery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Increase in Comfort behavioral scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours after admission to the hospital for surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Testing the hypothesis that there will be a clincal significant increase in Comfort-score when the scores from admission and after surgery are compared. The highest registered score obtained during the first 24 hours after surgery will be used for this analysis. We assume that the score at admission reflects no pain/sedation, while the scores after surgery reflect varying degree of pain</description>

    <measure>Convergent validity of the Comfort behavioral scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours after admission to the hospital for surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The correlations between each of the items of the scale and between each item and the overall Comfort behavioral scale-score will be calculated</description>

    <measure>Reduction in Comfort behavioral scale score (2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours after admission to the hospital for surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Testing the hypothesis that there will be a clinically significant reduction in Comfort-score when the scores from after the administration of pre-medication and after surgery when the child still has a laryngeal mask in place is compared. We assume that the score after premedication is given reflects a light sedation while the scores after surgery when the child still has a laryngela mask in place reflects deep sedation.</description>
