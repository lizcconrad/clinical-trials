      The Observational Study in the &quot;Real World&quot; of Implantable Electronic Cardiac Devices will
      enable the construction of an electronic database with local access to clinical information,
      which will collect and disseminate epidemiologic data on demography, cardiovascular mortality
      and morbidity, and potential risk factors for a selected group of patients. These clinical
      variables will be analyzed against the data, as based in the programming of devices and the
      diagnostics. Approved descriptive statistics and analyses will be made available via
      Internet. The study will describe statistical indexes on sub-groups representing more than
      10% of total of datasets.

      The study will be open to include any patient that had a Medtronic electronic device
      implanted, pacemakers, ICD, ICD with CRP. The study will be also adapted for devices
      implanted in the present and for devices to be implanted in patients in the future.

      This study is a Prospective, Multicenter Observational Post Market Release Study. It shall
      involve around 2,000 patients that are eligible for Implantable Cardiac Pacemakers (IPG)
      implantation, 500 patients eligible for Cardiac Resynchronization Pacemakers (CRT-P)
      implantation, 1,000 patients eligible for the implantation of Implantable Cardioverter
      Defibrillators with or without Cardiac Resynchronization Pacemakers (CDI, CRT-D), and around
      20 centers in Brazil. Patients will be consecutively enrolled in centers among those selected
      for the implantation of a Medtronic device in accordance with indications approved.
