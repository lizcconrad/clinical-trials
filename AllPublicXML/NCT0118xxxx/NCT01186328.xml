  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An experimental drug called EZN-3042 targets survivin, a protein expressed in leukemia cells
      at relapse that promotes the leukemia cells to grow. The main goal of this phase I study is
      to find out the dose of EZN-3042 that can be safely given without serious side effects both
      alone and in combination with standard chemotherapy drugs during re-induction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I multi-site study of the new investigational agent EZN-3042, which is highly
      effective at blocking survivin and inhibiting survivin protein expression. Survivin plays
      pivotal roles in tumor formation by inhibiting cell death and regulating cell cycle
      progression. The primary objective is to study EZN-3042 in children with relapsed acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients will receive 2 doses of EZN-3042 prior to initiating
      systemic therapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone and PEG-asparaginase. In addition,
      blood and bone marrow specimens will be drawn to measure minimal residual disease (MRD),
      pharmacokinetic levels of EZN-3042 and survivan expression. The study will follow a standard
      3+3 dose escalation design. We hypothesize that EZN-3042 will be safe, tolerable and
      biologically active, when given both alone and in combination with standard re-induction
      chemotherapy.
