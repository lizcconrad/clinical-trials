    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, randomized, cross-sectional comparison study examining the relative
      safety and resulting blood level profiles after administration of a new boceprevir tablet
      formulation versus its current capsule formulation for treatment of chronic hepatitis C. In
      Part 1 of the study participants will receive boceprevir tablets and capsules under fed
      conditions. In Part 2 of the study a new group of participants will receive boceprevir
      tablets and capsules under fasted conditions.

             urinalysis) must be within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the investigator
             and within an allowed expanded range supplied by sponsor. However, subject's liver
             function test results (ie, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase
             [ALT]) must not be elevated above normal limits at Screening and on Day -1. No
             rescreening of liver function tests will be allowed.
