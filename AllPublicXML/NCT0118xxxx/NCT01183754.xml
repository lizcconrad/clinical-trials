      1. To evaluate the role of VerifyNow test as prognostic marker in routine clinical practice
           using drug-eluting stents.

        2. To determine the add-on-effect of VerifyNow test beyond on conventional risk factors
           (clinical, lesions, or procedural factors).

        3. To compare the prognostic utility of VerifyNow test with several biomarkers.

    <textblock>
      Predictive role of a point-of-care assay (VerifyNow test) has not been well evaluated in
      large number of patients receiving drug-eluting stents as a routine practice.

      In addition, additional predictive effect of a point-of-care assay, as compared to
      conventional clinical factors or other biomarkers, might be clinically interesting and
      important.
