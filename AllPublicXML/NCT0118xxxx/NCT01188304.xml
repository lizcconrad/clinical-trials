  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study will investigate the
      safety and tolerability, and the effect of aleglitazar in combination with aspirin on renal
      function, renin-angiotensin system and platelet aggregation in healthy volunteers. Volunteers
      will be randomized to receive daily doses of aleglitazar or placebo in combination with
      aspirin. The anticipated time on study drug is 5 weeks.
