    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a rare inherited disorder in which certain
           white blood cells have impaired function and are unable to properly fight infections.
           SCID typically appears within the first year of life and is characterized by multiple,
           recurrent severe infections. More than 10 percent of all cases of SCID involve a
           deficiency of an enzyme called adenosine deaminase (ADA), and these SCID patients also
           tend to have impaired brain function or psychiatric disorders. Researchers are
           attempting to treat ADA-SCID patients with an experimental gene therapy, and a research
           protocol has been established for those who are participating in this therapy.

        -  Little is known about quality of life in individuals with ADA-SCID, but researchers
           believe that the effects of the disease and the treatments may cause a decreased quality
           of life in both patients and their parents. Another potential cause of decreased quality
           of life in ADA-SCID is the associated psychiatric and neurological problems caused by
           the disease. Researchers are interested in studying quality of life in individuals with
           ADA-SCID and their parents to provide more information about the disease.

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate whether gene therapy alters the quality of life or neuropsychiatric status
           of children with ADA-SCID.

        -  To monitor for intellectual, attention, memory, or specific learning disorders in
           children with ADA-SCID.

        -  To evaluate whether undergoing gene therapy has an effect on parenting stress of parents
           whose children have ADA-SCID.

      Eligibility:

        -  Children who are participating in the ADA-SCID gene therapy research protocol
           (01-HG-0189).

        -  Parents of children who are participating in the ADA-SCID gene therapy research protocol
           (01-HG-0189).

      Design:

        -  All of the testing and questionnaires will be done in the pediatric or adult clinic.

        -  Participating children will have tests of intelligence, manual dexterity, reaction time,
           basic reading and arithmetic skills, speech, and memory. These tests will be given
           before the start of the therapy, and then once a year for 5 years.

        -  Participating children will also complete questionnaires on quality of life. These
           questionnaires will be given before the start of the therapy, 3 months and 6 months
           after the therapy, and then every 6 months for a total of 5 years.

        -  Additional psychological tests may be given at the discretion of the study researchers.

        -  Parents will complete questionnaires to provide background medical information and
           report on quality of life and parental stress. The background information questionnaires
           will be given at the start of the therapy and then once a year for 5 years, the parental
           stress questionnaires will be given at the start of the therapy and then every 6 months
           for 5 years, and the quality of life questionnaires will be given at the same time as
           the child quality of life questionnaires.

        -  This protocol is separate from the gene therapy treatment protocol....

      The objectives of this study are to measure quality of life, neuropsychological sequelae and
      parental stress before and after gene therapy for ADA-SCID. The population to be studied will
      include up to five patients being treated with gene therapy at the NIH Clinical Center and
      five of their parents. The design of the study will be a non-randomized, longitudinal
      psychometric evaluation. Neuropsychological outcome measures will be the following battery:
      Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - Third Edition (WPPSI-III) or the
      Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fourth Edition (WISC-IV); the Wide Range
      Achievement Test - Fourth Edition (WRAT-4); subtests of the NEPSY; The Expressive One Word
      Picture Vocabulary Test (EOWPVT); Grooved Pegboard; Continuous Performance Test (CPT);
      Selective Reminding Test; and the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System- Second Edition.
      Quality of life will be measured with the PedsQL and parental stress will be measured with
      the Parenting Stress Index.
