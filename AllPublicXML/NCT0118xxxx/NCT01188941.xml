    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a health system navigator intervention on
      rates of linkage to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) care among newly
      diagnosed HIV-infected outpatients in Durban, South Africa. Subjects will be approached in
      the outpatient department and enrolled prior to an HIV test. Subjects will then be randomized
      to the navigator arm or the standard of care arm. Subjects in the navigator arm will receive
      scheduled phone and short message service (SMS) contacts throughout the follow-up period to
      help guide them through the HIV and TB care pathways. The navigator will provide personalized
      support to help subjects overcome barriers they may face along the way.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project is a randomized controlled trial of an intervention to improve linkage to HIV
      and TB care for South Africans undergoing HIV testing. Subjects undergoing HIV testing will
      be enrolled at three sites in the greater Durban area. These sites comprise two
      hospital-affiliated outpatient departments and primary health clinics served by a mobile
      health van. Routine TB screening, regardless of signs or symptoms, will be offered to all
      HIV-infected participants. HIV-infected participants will be randomized to determine whether
      they will be assigned to a health system navigator or will receive the current standard of
      care in Durban. Block randomization will be stratified by site and gender, with blocks of
      varying length.

      The health system navigator will help patients identify barriers to entering care and devise
      solutions, optimize use of available resources, and serve as a trusted social supporter who
      is knowledgeable about the health care system but remains outside of it. The health system
      navigator will help subjects engage the HIV and TB care system through face-to-face contact,
      telephone conversations, and short messaging service SMS text reminders which are free for
      patients to receive. These phone contacts and SMS will follow a standardized protocol. We
      will evaluate the efficacy of the intervention, as measured by increased rates of
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and, for those with TB co-infection, TB treatment
      completion. We will also evaluate the cost and cost-effectiveness of this intervention.

    <description>Subjects will be enrolled prior to an HIV test. Following TB screening, HIV infected subjects will meet with the health systems navigator who will administer a brief strengths-based interview. During this interview the participant and navigator will identify barriers to HIV and/or TB care and the resources and strengths that will be most helpful in overcoming these barriers. The health system navigator will stay in contact with participants for the next 4 months using phone calls and SMS on a standardized schedule. During the phone contacts the health system navigator will assess where the participant is on the care pathway. If the participant has not completed a step in his/her HIV or TB care, the health system navigator will help the participant draw on strengths identified in the initial interview and overcome any obstacles hindering him/her from accessing care.</description>
