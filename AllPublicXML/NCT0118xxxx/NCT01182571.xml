      The purpose of this study is to explore the symptom distress, fatigue, depression,
      uncertainty, and quality of life in heart transplant recipients, and associated factors of
      quality of life (QOL). The eligible patients are (1)who undergone heart transplantation were
      recruited from the Department of Cardiac Surgery, Nation Taiwan University Hospital,(2)18
