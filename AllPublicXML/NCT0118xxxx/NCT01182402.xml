  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve unsupervised dosing of opioid substitution
      medications. The aim of the study is to examine whether electronic compliance monitoring
      provides some advantages to patients`treatment and what kind of patients especially benefit
      from monitoring. We would also like to know if electronic compliance monitoring can prevent
      the abuse/diversion of medications and how implementing this method to wider treatment
      facilities succeeds.
