  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Responder Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>25 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of responders based on the adjusted Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment Scale (INCAT) score.
Responders were defined as those subjects who: 1) demonstrated a &quot;clinically meaningful improvement&quot; between baseline and Week 25, or 2) who were discontinued from the study for any reason after the start of IgPro10 treatment but with &quot;clinically meaningful improvement&quot; at the last study visit.
&quot;Clinically meaningful improvement&quot; was a decrease of at least 1 adjusted INCAT score point excluding an improvement of one point in the total score if this improvement was only due to a decrease in the upper limb score of 1 to 0.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Adjusted INCAT Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 34 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in INCAT score was determined at the completion visit compared to baseline and to the last measurement under the previous IVIG treatment using a non-parametric analysis to calculate the Hodges-Lehmann point estimate and the corresponding Tukey confidence interval on an exploratory basis.
The INCAT disability score ranges from 0 to 10 and is the sum of arm and leg disability each rated between 0 and 5 (where arm = 0 indicates 'no upper limb problems' and arm = 5 indicates 'inability to use either arm for any purposeful movement', and leg = 0 indicates 'walking not affected', and leg = 5 indicates 'restricted to wheelchair, unable to stand and walk a few steps with help'). Thus, a higher INCAT disability score indicates greater disability. Negative values for change in INCAT score indicate improvement, with a more negative value indicating greater improvement compared with the value at baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Maximum Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 34 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in maximum grip strength of the dominant hand. A non-parametric analysis was used to calculate the Hodges-Lehmann point estimate and the corresponding Tukey confidence interval on an exploratory basis. Positive values for change in maximum grip strength indicate improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Medical Research Council Sum Scale (MRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 34 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in MRC sum score was determined at the completion visit compared to baseline and to the last measurement under the previous IVIG treatment using a non-parametric analysis to calculate the Hodges-Lehmann point estimate and the corresponding Tukey confidence interval on an exploratory basis.
The 80-point MRC sum score is the sum of scores for eight bilateral (left and right side) muscle groups, each rated between 0 (no visible contraction) to 5 (normal movement). A higher MRC sum score indicates greater muscle contraction/limb movement. Positive values for change in MRC sum score indicate improvement, with a more positive value indicating greater muscle contraction/ limb movement compared with the value at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Severity of AEs Per Infusion</measure>

Mild: Symptoms were easily tolerated and there was no interference with daily activities.
Moderate: Discomfort enough to cause some interference with daily activities.
Severe: Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity.</description>

        <title>Change in Adjusted INCAT Score</title>
        <description>The change in INCAT score was determined at the completion visit compared to baseline and to the last measurement under the previous IVIG treatment using a non-parametric analysis to calculate the Hodges-Lehmann point estimate and the corresponding Tukey confidence interval on an exploratory basis.
The INCAT disability score ranges from 0 to 10 and is the sum of arm and leg disability each rated between 0 and 5 (where arm = 0 indicates ‘no upper limb problems’ and arm = 5 indicates ‘inability to use either arm for any purposeful movement’, and leg = 0 indicates ‘walking not affected’, and leg = 5 indicates ‘restricted to wheelchair, unable to stand and walk a few steps with help’). Thus, a higher INCAT disability score indicates greater disability. Negative values for change in INCAT score indicate improvement, with a more negative value indicating greater improvement compared with the value at baseline.</description>

        <title>Change in Medical Research Council Sum Scale (MRC)</title>
        <description>The change in MRC sum score was determined at the completion visit compared to baseline and to the last measurement under the previous IVIG treatment using a non-parametric analysis to calculate the Hodges-Lehmann point estimate and the corresponding Tukey confidence interval on an exploratory basis.
The 80-point MRC sum score is the sum of scores for eight bilateral (left and right side) muscle groups, each rated between 0 (no visible contraction) to 5 (normal movement). A higher MRC sum score indicates greater muscle contraction/limb movement. Positive values for change in MRC sum score indicate improvement, with a more positive value indicating greater muscle contraction/ limb movement compared with the value at baseline.</description>

Moderate: Discomfort enough to cause some interference with daily activities.
Severe: Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity.</description>
