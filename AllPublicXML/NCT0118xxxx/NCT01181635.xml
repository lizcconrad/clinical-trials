      Sickness absence due to psychiatric problems is considered a growing problem in Norway.
      Little research is done to examine if psychotherapy can reduce sickness absence. Since 2007
      there is a government sponsored program in Norway (Raskere tilbake) aimed at reducing
      sickness absence. This study examines if psychotherapy within this program, delivered at an
      out-patient clinic, actually reduces sickness absence. Levels of absenteeism is measured
      before, after and 6 months after treatment. This is a quasi-experimental study, where the
      treatment-group will be compared with a statistical group in the general population, that is
      socio-demographical similar and has similar history of sickness absence but haven't been to
      treatment. Changes in levels of symptoms and quality of life will also be measured. The
      participants will be asked to describe their working environment, and this will be related to
      outcome-measures.
