  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if high-dose 3F8 combined with GM-CSF is better than
      standard dose 3F8 in treating neuroblastoma. Another purpose of the study is to find out what
      effects, good and/or bad, 3F8 has on cancer. The investigators also want to see if the
      antibody works against a very small amount of neuroblastoma (minimal residual disease) that
      is left in the bone marrow.

    <description>This phase II, open-label, single arm trial assesses the anti-NB activity of high-dose 3F8 (80 mg/m2/day), which is used in cycles 1-2, with return to standard 3F8 dosage (20 mg/m2/day) in subsequent cycles. The patients are post-transplant and in 1st complete/very good partial remission (CR/VGPR),89 with no evidence of NB by standard studies, but are at high risk for relapse.</description>

    <description>A cycle consists of treatment with 3F8 for 5 days. GMCSF is started 5 days in advance of each 3F8 cycle. The break between end of a cycle of 3F8/GM-CSF and start of next cycle is 2-to-4-weeks through 4 cycles; subsequent breaks are ~6-8 weeks. 13-cis-retinoic acid is started after cycle 2.</description>
