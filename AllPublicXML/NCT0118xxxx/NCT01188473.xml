  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Status asthmaticus is recognized as a common cause of morbidity in children in the United
      States. In recent years, hospitalization rates have reached an all time high. This study will
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical benefit of adding Noninvasive Positive
      Pressure Ventilation (NPPV)to regular care in children with moderate to moderately severe
      status asthmaticus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Status asthmaticus is defined as severe asthma that fails to respond to inhaled short acting
      Î² agonists (SABA), oral or intravenous steroids, and oxygen, leading to hospital admission
      for further management (1). In 2004, asthma exacerbations led to 3% (198,000) of all
      hospitalizations and 2.5 deaths per 1 million populations in the 0-17 year age group (2).

      This prospective, unblinded, randomized controlled, pilot clinical trial will compare NPPV
      plus standard of care versus standard of care alone in children admitted for status
      asthmaticus. NPPV refers to the delivery of pressurized gas through an external interface
      such as a nasal or oronasal mask, connected to a pressure targeted ventilator. In other
      words, it provides ventilator support without the use of an endotracheal tube.

      This study will investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of early initiation of
      non-invasive NPPV in pediatric patients admitted with status asthmaticus.

    <description>Patients in the NPPV group were fitted with a nasal mask with gel seals (Comfortgel Masks, Respironics) and placed on the BiPAP Machine (Vision Bipap, Respironics). To optimize patient cooperation, the mask was initially applied manually to the patient's face. After a short adaptation period, it was firmly applied on the face by head straps to minimize air leak without causing skin injury. Pressures were initially set low for comfort and acceptance while being placed on the machine. The inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) was gradually increased to 8 cm H2O in order to achieve a tidal volume of 6-9 ml/kg and the end expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) to 5 cm H 2O. These settings remained unchanged throughout the study period.</description>
