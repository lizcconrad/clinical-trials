  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create new tests to identify biomarkers for ovarian cancer so
      that a screening test can be developed. For patients who have a diagnosis of ovarian Cancer,
      researchers will use blood samples before and after treatment to see if disease status can be
      determined by measuring the amount of biomarker.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most lethal female reproductive malignancy, mainly because
      80% of tumors have metastasized beyond the ovary at the time of diagnosis. Screening efforts
      aimed at improved identification of early stage disease have been largely unsuccessful,
      because of ovarian cancer's propensity for early spread. Our hypothesis is that this obstacle
      can be circumvented by identifying biomarkers for the precancerous stage of this disease.
      Since this pre-cancerous stage is currently undetectable, we instead propose to look for
      biomarkers in women at very high risk for developing ovarian cancer due to genetic mutations.
      We hypothesize that identification of markers for genetic predisposition to ovarian cancer
      will also be informative for detection of biological changes that over time lead to sporadic
      cancers. Given their increasingly recognized role in states of normal and abnormal growth and
      differentiation, we hypothesize that short non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) hold significant promise
      as biomarkers of ovarian cancer predisposition. We will test these hypotheses in two aims.
      First, we will identify biomarkers for hereditary ovarian cancer risk by comparing
      serum-derived sncRNAs in women with and without hereditary risk for ovarian cancer. In the
      second aim we will define serum-derived sncRNAs correlates of ovarian cancer disease status.
      We will compare sera from ovarian cancer patients at times of highest and lowest disease
      burden to those of control, cancer-free subjects. Each aim will provide independent, novel,
      and important information for future investigations. The sncRNAs found to be differentially
      expressed in both aims will be prioritized for future validation in women under clinical
      surveillance for hereditary risk of ovarian cancer.

    <description>Serum samples will be collected from patients with known BRCA mutations. As a control, we will recruit age-matched women undergoing gynecologic evaluation for benign disease without any personal or family history of cancer. The normal and BRCA mutation groups will be pooled for deep sequencing. Pooled sample short RNAs will be cloned and subjected to deep sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. Validation of 5-10 differentially expressed sncRNAs is performed by quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blots on individual control and high risk samples.</description>

    <description>In this aim pre- and post-remission samples from twenty women with stage III-IV ovarian cancer will be compared to twenty samples from control cancer-free subjects. Methods used will be essentially identical to those described above however, given the opportunity to use each patient as her own control and thus minimized confounders we believe deep sequencing of samples individually will provide better quality data and more robust statistical comparison.</description>
