  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Several studies have reported limited or no reduction in serum lipid
      concentrations in response to probiotic formulations. More recently, probiotics have shown
      promise in treating metabolic disease, due to improved strain selection and delivery
      technologies.

      Objective: To evaluate the lipid lowering efficacy of a yogurt formulation containing
      microencapsulated Bile Salt Hydrolase (BSH)-active Lactobacillus reuteri cardioviva, taken
      twice per day over 6 weeks, in subjects with hypercholesterolemia.

      Design: This is a double-blinded, multi-centric, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-arm
      study. The study will last a total of 10 weeks including 2-week wash-out, 2-week run-in, and
      6- week treatment period.
