      Historic cohort prolonged by a 12-month follow-up period.

      Prospective: look forward using periodic observations collected predominantly following
      subject enrollment: one year of follow up of patients with CP-CML alive at the time of the
      study.

      Retrospective: look back using observations collected predominantly prior to subject
      selection and enrollment : historical data of patients with CP-CML initiated with a 2G TKIs
      post-imatinib failure (resistance or intolerance) between 1-Jan-2005 and 30-June-2009.

      The inclusion of a historical cohort will allow a rapid enrollment of a large number of
      patients of this rare pathology, while the prospective follow up of this cohort would allow
      long term data to be obtained, including the assessment of the impact on survival and
      appreciate the patient's quality of life (QoL), compliance and satisfaction.

    <description>The purpose of this study is to determine predictive value of Hammersmith score on Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR), as assessed by the following:
Distribution of patients according to Hammersmith score levels
Characterization of association between Hammersmith score and occurrence of CCyR
Assessment of capacity of Hammersmith score to predict CCyR, using diagnostic test assessment methods.
This score is measured at the time of imatinib failure.</description>

      <textblock>
        Patients with Additional Chromosomal Anomalies (ACA) are accepted to be in CP. Patients
        enrolled in open-label clinical trials or other observational trials are also allowed
        (unless explicitly prohibited by the trial).

        This trial does not prohibit participation in other observational trials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with CP-CML. (ACA) are allowed

          -  Age &gt;18 years old

          -  Prior treatment with imatinib monotherapy as first line treatment, to which the
             patient is deemed resistant or intolerant.Patients treated by INF and/or AraC prior
             (but not concomitant) to imatinib are eligible.

          -  Initiated with a 2G TKIs post-imatinib failure (resistance or intolerance) between
             1-Jan-2005 and 30-Jun-2009.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in (or with history of) accelerated or blastic phase CML

          -  Patients treated by allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

          -  Any other CML treatment except for INF and/or AraC,and a short period of Hydroxyurea
             or Anagrelide prior to imatinib.

          -  Patients treated with 2G TKI for reasons other than imatinib failure.

          -  Patients with no historical data (e.g. possibility of Sokal Score calculation)
             available.

          -  Patients participating in clinical or observational trials which explicitly prohibit
             enrollment in non interventional studies.
