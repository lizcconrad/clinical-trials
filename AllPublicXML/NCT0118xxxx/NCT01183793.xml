  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is essential to know intestinal length and anastomotic type in post-operative short bowel
      syndrome patients. These parameters can help predict long-term intestinal failure with
      long-term parenteral nutrition usually needed for smallest lengths. Sometimes these
      parameters are unfortunately missing for lack of intraoperative measurement. Thus, it is
      necessary to develop non-invasive and reproducible techniques to assess small bowel length.
      This is the reason why the investigators will evaluate magnetic resonance (MR)-enterography
      and barium follow-through in this indication. There are at this time only two small studies
      evaluating barium follow-through for intestinal length measurement, and none evaluating
      MR-enterography. However, a major advantage of the latter is the lack of radiation exposure
      and possibility to perform 3D.

      This will be an open labelled single center crossover study. Short bowel syndrome patients of
      the investigators center will be included after consent. The sequence of exams (MR
      enterography followed by barium follow-through or vice-versa) will be randomly assigned.
      Peroperative short bowel length measurement will be available for all patients. There will be
      one month between the two exams.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the performance of MR-enterography in short
      bowel measurement in short bowel syndrome patients, the gold standard being peroperative
      length. Secondary objectives are to assess the performance of barium follow-through in short
      bowel measurement in these patients, and to show that barium follow-through does not perform
      better than MR-enterography. For that purpose the investigators will include 50 patients over
      2 years.
