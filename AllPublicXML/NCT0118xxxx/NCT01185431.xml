    <textblock>
      This trial is being conducted to look for following changes when fig paste is taken by female
      subjects with functional constipation:

      To evaluate the improvement of the bowel

      To assess the quality of life and impact on female reproductive function

      To evaluate the influence on glucose, cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol
