  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for combining lenalidomide with rituximab derives from preclinical observations
      suggesting that lenalidomide may enhance the ADCC (antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity)
      triggered by monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab. Lenalidomide augments NK cytotoxicity
      by increasing CD56dimCD3 subset, in addition to inducing IL-2 in T cells. These results
      provide the cellular and molecular basis for the use of lenalidomide as an adjuvant in
      immunotherapeutic strategies of monoclonal antibodies (mAb)-based therapies. The combination
      lenalidomide-rituximab was tested in lymphoma cell lines but not specifically on CLL cell
      lines. However the observed synergism was attributed to NK cells expansion, thus lending
      support to the notion that this synergism may operate in other B-cell lymphoproliferative
      malignancies.

      The objective was to develop a non-cytotoxic and effective treatment for CLL that would
      fulfill an unmet medical need, as a significant proportion of CLL patients are elderly and
      frail. These patients experience an excess in chemotherapy induced toxicity, often preventing
      the completion of the planned treatment.

    <description>Lenalidomide: Oral use. It will be administered from day 1 to 21 of 28 days cycles in a total of 6 cycles.
Rituximab, intravenous use. The dose will be administered at the standard (375 mg/m2 in the first cycle and 500 mg/m2 in successive cycles).
In the first cycle Rituximab will be administered in two divided doses:100mg/m2 total on day 1 and the rest up to 375mg/m2 on day 2.
If lenalidomide treatment starts on day 1, Rituximab will be administered, in this first cycle, on days -2 (100 mg/m2) and -1 (275 mg/m2).
In the second and subsequent cycles, 500 mg/m2 of Rituximab will be administered on day -1.</description>
