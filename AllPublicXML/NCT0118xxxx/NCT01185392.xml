      The European CRT survey represents a joint initiative between two ESC associations; the Heart
      Failure Association and the European Heart Rhythm Association. The survey will be performed
      in collaboration with The Institute für Herzinfarktforschung in Ludwigshafen which will
      handle the data collection and data analysis.

      This European CRT Survey was initiated by the Heart Failure Association (HFA) and the
      European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) of the ESC in order to describe current European
      practice and routines associated with CRT-P/CRT-D implantations based on sample of patients
      enrolled in 13 countries. The data collected following implantation provides information
      including clinical characteristics, diagnostic criteria, implantation routines and
      techniques, adverse experience, and assessment of adherence to guideline recommendations. The
      single follow-up visit at 1 year (9-15 months) will provide information regarding short-term
      clinical outcomes.

      The primary objective of this Survey is to describe current European practice based on a
      broad sampling in 13 countries. The information collected will enable practice between
      centres and countries to be compared and permit benchmarking with national and international
      practice. The survey provides valuable quality assurance assessment for individual centres,
      permits limited economic analyses and broadly evaluates adherence to guideline
      recommendations.

      The following 13 European countries contributed patients to the survey: Austria, Belgium,
      France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland
      and UK. Two national coordinators, one each from the fields of heart failure and
      electrophysiology, were selected and given the responsibility to facilitate recruitment in
      their respective countries.

      coordinators.

    <measure>To describe current European CRT implantation practice and there is a need to precisely quantify the extent of treatment failures, adverse experience and complications associated with implantation.</measure>
    <time_frame>November 2008-October 2010</time_frame>
    <description>The Survey will capture data from patients receiving CRT-P/CRT-D devises:
Demographics and clinical characteristics
Diagnostic criteria assessed prior to implantation
Pharmacological therapy at baseline and follow-up
Implantation procedure and techniques
Device programming
Short and long-term outcomes
Adverse experience and hospitalisation
Economic analyses
Adherence to guidelines
These data should also provide information contrasting practice between centres and countries and adherence to guideline recommendations.</description>

        All consecutive patients successfully implanted with a new CRT-P, CRT-D or upgrades during
        the inclusion period were eligible. The successful procedure itself identified the patient
        as a survey candidate. Patients screened but not successfully implanted were not entered
        into the survey. Ethics approval and written informed consent were obtained in countries
        where required.
