      The purpose of this study is to compare the traditional bed bath with 'washing without water'
      on

        -  1) effects on skin integrity

        -  2) patient and nurse satisfaction and 3) costs. In a cluster randomized trial we will
           randomize 50 nursing home wards (576 patients) to 'washing without water' or traditional
           bed baths. Bathing regimens are continued for six weeks.

      Whereas effects on skin damage are not likely to be specific for setting, these results can
      be generalized to other patient groups.

      RAPID IMPLEMENTATION of new interventions while cost-effectiveness and acceptability for
      patients and care providers are unclear, is never desirable. 'Washing without water' is such
      an intervention.

      The traditional bed bath is executed by using tap water, towels, washcloths and soap. As an
      alternative, 'WASHING WITHOUT WATER' was recently introduced in the Netherlands. This concept
      consists of disposable washcloths made of a mix of soft synthetic fibers, saturated with a no
      rinse, quickly vaporizing skin cleaning and caring lotion. 'WASHING WITHOUT WATER' can be
      used with all patients who need bathing assistance, especially when taking a shower or
      sitting in a hot tub is not possible.

      However, while several claims are made about the positive effects of 'washing without water'
      as compared to traditional bathing, EVIDENCE IS LACKING. Also, 'washing without water' is
      CONTROVERSIAL. While some are eager to adopt the new concept, others see it as 'efficiency
      gone loose' and denying patients one of the most basic elements of care: a proper bath. This
      study therefore addresses the cost effectiveness of 'washing without water' in bedridden
      patients.
