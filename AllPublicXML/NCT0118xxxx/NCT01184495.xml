        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We included adult patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis for more than
             three months at the Dialysis Unit of the Department of Nephrology, HCPA and the Center
             for Dialysis and Transplant (CDT), characterized as as patients on chronic regular
             dialysis procedure. Patients already in use of EPO for at least three months, only
             those taking the drug by subcutaneous and agreed to participate in the study.

        Patients using different doses of EPO were included, but these were distributed across the
        treatment groups by randomization stratum dose of EPO, to ensure even distribution of
        patients in both groups.

        It was considered that patients with HIV or AIDS who were in treatment for the disease with
        proper clinical management would be eligible for the study (as exemplified by patients with
        HIV or AIDS approved for inclusion on the waiting list for cadaveric kidney
        transplantation) .

        Patients with a history of cancer or already treated in the oncological standpoint, and no
        signs of disease activity could be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who had other causes of anemia defined for maintenance, for example, patients
             with liver cirrhosis, with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, patients with
             chronic Gastro Intestinal, Genital or Urinary bleeding or other sites were excluded.
             Similarly patients with AIDS without treatment, hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia,
             thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, myelodysplasia, multiple myeloma or other cancers or
             inflammatory arthritis. There was also no inclusion of patients with intolerance or
             allergy to iron parenterally, patients without adherence to dialysis or with chronic
             inadequate dialysis blood flow of vascular access persistently below 250 mL / min, kt
             / v, as a measure of efficiency of hemodialysis, persistently &lt;1.2) or frequent
             hospitalizations considered as possible causes of inadequate response to
             erythropoietin.

        We excluded patients with mental illness or condition that prevents the free consent and
        signature of informed consent, as well as previous reports of serious adverse effects to
        the drugs studied.

        Criteria for withdrawal from the clinical trial: a view of the high morbidity of
        hemodialysis patients, expressed by frequent hospital clinics, it was found that patients
        in the study would not be withdrawn from the study due to hospitalization, provided that:
        the hospital did not involve surgery (except vascular access surgery or hospitalization in
        the intensive care unit or equivalent, or that represent otherwise, a loss of patient
        follow-up or co-interventions in the treatment of anemia of these).

        Were withdrawn from the study patients who required blood transfusion because they have
        severe anemia or intervention unrelated to the usual treatment of anemia in hemodialysis
        patients.
