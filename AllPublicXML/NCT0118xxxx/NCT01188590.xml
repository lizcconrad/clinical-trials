    <textblock>
      The purpose for the investigators study is to investigate the severity and incidence of
      respiratory insufficiency using transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcPCO2) monitoring as an
      adjunct to the current standard of care for early detection of inadequate ventilation in
      post-operative surgical in-patients undergoing cardiac surgery after discharge from intensive
      care unit (ICU) or post anesthesia recovery unit (PACU).

      This observational study is to determine the baseline carbon dioxide and severity of
      respiratory distress and acute respiratory failure (ARF)/respiratory arrest in the post
      cardiac surgery patients in the first 24 hours on a monitored telemetry floor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ASA Class 1, 2, 3, or 4 men and women who are having cardiac surgery by one of the
             participating surgeons

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has participated in a trial with any experimental drug or device trial within
             30 days prior to enrollment in the study, or has ever been enrolled in this study;

          2. Subject has a condition that would require an extensive amount of time off of 13
             Roberts during the first 24 hours of admission to the telemetry unit. (e.g.,
             hemodialysis);

          3. Subject has a condition or allergy which would prohibit placing the probe on the
             earlobes;

          4. Subject is unable to undergo any procedure required by the protocol;

          5. Subject has any other condition or factor which, in the Investigator's opinion, might
             increase the risk to the subject; or

          6. If female, subject is non-lactating, and is either:

               -  Not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal for at least 1 year or
                  surgically sterile due to bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or
                  hysterectomy; or

               -  Of childbearing potential but is not pregnant as confirmed by negative serum
                  pregnancy test at time of screening.
