      Objective: To determine the effect of non-closure of the visceral and parietal peritoneum
      during Cesarean section on the formation of adhesions.

      Study design: A prospective randomized trial of 533 women undergoing primary Cesarean
      section; 256 were randomized to non closure and 277 to closure of the peritoneum. At a
      subsequent cesarean,he presence of adhesions and their severity was evaluated at several
      sites: between the layers of the abdominal wall, between the bladder and the abdominal wall,
      between bladder and uterus, between the uterus and the abdominal wall, and between the bowels
      and the pelvic organs. A cumulative adhesion score was calculated.
