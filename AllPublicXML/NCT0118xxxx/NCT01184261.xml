      RATIONALE: Nicotine patches and behavioral therapy may help reduce cigarette smoking and
      binge drinking in young adults. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial studies nicotine
      patches with or without behavioral therapy in reducing cigarette smoking and binge drinking
      in young adults.

      OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the efficacy of Integrated Intervention that targets both
      cigarette smoking and binge drinking on the cigarette smoking behavior of young adult smokers
      at 6-month follow-up. II. To evaluate the efficacy of Integrated Intervention that targets
      both cigarette smoking and binge drinking on binge drinking behavior of young adult smokers.
      III. Examine the effect of Integrated Intervention on several possible mediators of change
      corresponding to mechanisms that have been proposed to account for the relationship between
      cigarette smoking and alcohol use. These mediators include cravings to smoke, perceived
      similarity to the typical smoker, and self-efficacy for smoking abstinence. OUTLINE: Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.All patients receive nicotine patch therapy in weeks
      4-11. ARM I: Patients attend behavioral sessions for smoking and binge drinking cessation
      over 30 minutes once weekly in weeks 1-6. ARM II: Patients attend behavioral sessions for
      smoking cessation over 30 minutes once weekly in weeks 1-6.After completion of study
      treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24.
