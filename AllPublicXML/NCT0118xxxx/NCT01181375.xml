  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experiments outlined in this proposal will compare a number of currently available
      techniques for assessing hypoxia and interstitial fluid pressures in patients with cervix
      cancer. The aim of these experiments is to establish the relationship of the clinically
      relevant outcome measures of tumour control and survival following radiation therapy with
      these biological characteristics of carcinoma of the cervix relevant to tumour hypoxia. These
      characteristics will be assessed in patients undergoing treatment using techniques which have
      reached an appropriate level of development for clinical evaluation and aim to determine the
      best technique for determining these parameters of the tumour microenvironment. A number of
      novel strategies directed at the microenvironment are undergoing or soon will be undergoing
      clinical evaluation and selection of appropriate patients for these trials is of great
      importance.
