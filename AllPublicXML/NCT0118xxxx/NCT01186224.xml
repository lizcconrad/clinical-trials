  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy and toxicity of plerixafor (AMD 3100) together with granulocyte-colony
      stimulating factor (G-CSF) for stem cell mobilisation, in patients with myeloma or lymphoma
      requiring high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue.

    <intervention_name>Plerixafor and G-CSF</intervention_name>
    <description>G-CSF will be given daily from day 1, which will usually be timed to fall toward the end of the working week. Plerixafor will commence on day 4 at as near to 10 PM as practicable, and also on day 5 and subsequent days (maximum of 4 total days) at a similar time of day if insufficient CD34+ cells have been collected. Stem cell harvesting will be carried out on day 5 and if necessary on days 6, 7 and 8, until the target yield of 4 x 106 CD34+ cells /kg recipient weight have been achieved.
The daily dose of G-CSF is 300 ug for patients up to and including 60kg in weight; 480 ug for patients over 60 kg but under 96 kg, and 600 ug for patients weighing 96 kg or more. This equates to a dose of at least 5 ug/kg (maximum 8 mg/kg) for all patients up to 120 kg. The daily dose of plerixafor is 240 ug/kg if the creatinine clearance is equal to or greater than 50mls/minute; if less than this then the dose is 160 ug/kg daily.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All of the following must be satisfied:

        Aged 18 or over

        Able to give informed written consent.

        Diagnosis of EITHER multiple myeloma or related plasma cell dyscrasia, OR any form of
        lymphoma or associated lymphoproliferative disease Autologous stem cell transplantation is
        planned as the next course of treatment.

        The patient has not previously undergone a mobilisation attempt for the current transplant.
        Patients who have received previous autologous transplants at least 2 years previously are
        eligible, as long as stem cell mobilisation has not been attempted for the current
        transplant.

        No serious concomitant illness (e.g. heart disease) that might preclude completion of the
        study.

        Creatinine clearance of at least 30 mls/min. Note that a dose reduction of plerixafor is
        required where the creatinine clearance is between 30-50 mls/min; see section 3.3/5.1/5.3.

        Negative pregnancy test in women of childbearing age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to give informed written consent

        Pregnancy or lactating

        Creatinine clearance of less than 30 mls/min. Patients with clearances lower than this may
        still be able to receive plerixafor at reduced dosage following discussion with the trial
        co-ordinators, but are not eligible for entry into this trial.

        Any previous attempt at mobilisation for the current transplant. Patients with any form of
        leukaemia, INCLUDING PLASMA CELL LEUKAEMIA, are not eligible.
