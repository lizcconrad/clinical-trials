      Eye drops must be proficiently instilled to prevent infections following cataract surgery.
      Proficiency is defined as placing a drop on the ocular surface without touching the
      applicator's tip. Researchers will investigate whether patients can proficiently administer
      eye drops on the first attempt on the first day after surgeries. If successful, researchers
      will determine how proficient they are 29 days later. If not, they will be provided with
      additional educational sessions and tested again 29 days later. Researchers will also
      determine if the proficiency of instillation correlates to whether patients experience
      irritation or pain after surgery.

      Summary Brief Summary Eye drops must be proficiently instilled to prevent infections
      following cataract surgery. Proficiency is defined as placing a drop on the ocular surface
      without touching the applicator's tip. Researchers will investigate whether patients can
      proficiently administer eye drops on the first attempt on the first day after surgeries. If
      successful, researchers will determine how proficient they are 29 days later. If not, they
      will be provided with additional educational sessions and tested again 29 days later.
      Researchers will also determine if the proficiency of instillation correlates to whether
      patients experience irritation or pain after surgery.

      Hypotheses:

      On postoperative day 30, there will be a higher rate of successful eye drop instillation in
      the group of subjects who receive the educational session compared to the baseline group
      subjects (subjects only tested on postoperative day 30 rather than both the first day after
      surgery and postoperative day 30) who will not receive it.

      In comparing the postoperative day 30 proficiency levels of baseline subjects and subjects
      who were able to proficiently instill a single eye drop on postoperative day 1, the subjects
      who were able to proficiently instill a single eye drop on postoperative day 1 will have a
      higher success rate than the baseline group.

      The number of subjects who are unable to correctly instill the medication on postoperative
      day 30 and experienced pain or irritation before or during postoperative day 30 will be
      higher than the number of subjects who are able to correctly instill the medication on
      postoperative day 30 and experienced pain or irritation before or during postoperative day
      30.

      Purpose:

      To determine the number of subjects who can proficiently administer one drop of Dexatrol (the
      steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that Crystal Eye Clinic staff provide to all patients who
      undergo cataract surgery) on their first attempt on postoperative day 1 and compare this to
      the number of subjects who can proficiently administer one drop of Dexatrol into the eye that
      received cataract surgery after using the medication for 30 days.

      Baseline/control subjects who are only tested on postoperative day 30 will be referred to as
      &quot;Group A&quot; subjects. Subjects who will be tested on postoperative day 1 and 30 will be
      referred to as &quot;Group B&quot; subjects. If &quot;Group B&quot; subjects can proficiently administer the
      medication on postoperative day 1, they will remain in &quot;Group B&quot; and researchers will
      determine their rate of success again on postoperative day 30. If subjects cannot
      proficiently administer the medication on postoperative day 1, they will be re-classified as
      &quot;Group C&quot; subjects and researchers will determine whether an educational session regarding
      the correct instillation of eye drops will improve the proficiency of these subjects when
      they are tested again on postoperative day 30. This will allow staff at Crystal Eye Clinic to
      understand the effectiveness of their current educational session and will determine the
      efficacy of an additional educational session. Researchers will also use questionnaires to
      determine if there are factors that affect the ability of subjects to properly instill the
      medication as well as if the proficiency of instillation correlates to whether patients
      experienced irritation or pain before or on postoperative day 30. Dexatrol will not be used
      outside of its approved indication.
