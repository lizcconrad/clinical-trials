  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this proposal is to refine the intervention under investigation (i.e.,
      family-based CBT) and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and
      methods (e.g., recruitment, assessments).

      The secondary aim of this proposal is to compare the relative efficacy of an 8 session
      family-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to Relaxation Training (RT) for reducing
      anxiety and chronic headaches in youth (N = 30) ages 7-17 years. It is hypothesized that CBT
      will result in greater reductions in both anxiety and headache frequency and severity
      compared to RT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic daily headache in children, as well as periodic migraine, is a prevalent, persistent,
      and debilitating pain condition affecting nearly 1 in 10 children. Emerging evidence suggests
      that affected youth also experience excessive and impairing symptoms of anxiety which may
      play a role in the etiology and/or maintenance of headache pain. Current behavioral
      treatments are effective in reducing headache frequency and intensity, however, many youth
      remain symptomatic and the exacerbating role of anxiety has largely been ignored. Moreover,
      current psychosocial treatments fail to incorporate parents in the therapeutic process. The
      current proposal is a pilot study designed to address the shortcomings of current behavioral
      treatments by evaluating the initial efficacy of a family-based cognitive-behavioral therapy
      (CBT) for youth who present with chronic tension headaches and migraines, and excessive
      anxiety. Rigorous scientific methods will be employed, including a randomized design,
      multiple informants and measures to assess key constructs, independent evaluators (IEs) to
      assess outcomes, and intensive training for therapists and IEs to assure a high quality of
      implementation. Using a pre-post experimental design, 30 youth with chronic tension headaches
      and/or migraines and anxiety will be randomly assigned to receive 8 weeks of family-based CBT
      or relaxation training (RT). IEs will complete assessments of child symptoms and functioning
      at pre and post-treatment and at one month follow-up. Youth in the family-based CBT condition
      are expected to evince greater reductions in both headache and anxiety frequency, severity,
      and duration. Results from this study will be used to make empirically informed modifications
      to the CBT treatment manual in order to facilitate replication and dissemination of the
      interventions to clinicians and researchers.

    <description>Youth and parents will complete a daily headache and anxiety diary to track the frequency and severity of headaches and anxiety symptoms. In addition, the diary will assess medication use, missed school/activities, as well as antecedents and consequences.</description>

    <measure>Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) will be completed by an independent evaluator to assess the severity of current (within the past week) anxiety symptoms in youth. The instrument consists of two sections. The first section contains a 50-item anxiety symptoms checklist. The second section assesses the severity and impairment of these symptoms. A total score is computed by summing the severity items. The measure has acceptable internal consistency, reliability, and convergent/divergent validity.</description>

    <measure>Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment (PedMIDAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment (PedMIDAS) is used to assess migraine disability across multiple domains of functioning including school, home, social, and recreational. The measure consists of 6 items measuring the number of days in which activities were missed as a result of headache/migraine. The measure yields a total score by summing items. Total scores correspond to one of four &quot;disability grades:&quot; 0-10 = little to no disability, 11-30 = mild disability, 31-50 = moderate disability, and &gt;50 = severe disability.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To determine eligibility, youth will complete an evaluation consisting of clinical
             interviews, self-, and parent-report measures.

          -  To be included in the study, all children must:

               1. have a current diagnosis of chronic daily headache, tension-type headache, and/or
                  migraine headache

               2. obtain a total score on the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED)
                  in the clinical range (i.e., &gt; 20)

               3. be between 7 and 17 years old

               4. have a parent/guardian who gives consent and agrees to participate

               5. be English speaking

               6. not currently participating in other psychosocial treatments specifically
                  directed at reducing head pain or anxiety.

          -  For youth receiving prophylactic medication, it is preferable that they remain on a
             stable dose and agree to avoid medication changes while enrolled in the study. Thus,
             all participants will be permitted to continue with their prescribed
             medical/neurological treatment, however the use of medications (both prophylactic and
             over-the-counter analgesics) will be closely monitored.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Youth will be excluded from the study if they have a medical or psychiatric condition
             contraindicating study treatment or warranting an alternative intervention (e.g.,
             suicidality, depression).
