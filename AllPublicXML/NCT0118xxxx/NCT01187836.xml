  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, TRV120027 (or a placebo) intravenous infusion will be given to people with
      heart failure to learn about the effects of TRV120027. The results of this study will help
      choose the proper range of TRV120027 doses to use in future research studies involving
      patients with acute decompensated heart failure.

    <measure>Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Multiple time points during 14 hr infusion and during 4 hr period after end of infusion, and follow-up (Day 7, Day 30)</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability will be assessed qualitatively by evaluating adverse events, clinical laboratories, ECGs, cardiac telemetry and vital signs at multiple measurement time points during the 14 hour infusion and for 4 hours after discontinuation of the infusion. Follow-up assessments for adverse events at Day 7 and Day 30 will be conducted.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of congestive heart failure made at least 3 months prior to screening

          -  NYHA Class III or IV heart failure, ejection fraction &lt;/= 35% and , and in the opinion
             of the investigator, right-heart catheterization is clinically indicated.

          -  Baseline mean PCWP &gt;/= 20 mmHg

          -  Systolic blood pressure at screening must be &gt;/= 100 mmHg. Heart rate at screening
             must be &lt;/= 90 bpm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any significant disease or condition that would interfere with the interpretation of
             safety or efficacy in this study as determined by the Investigator based on medical
             history, physical examination or laboratory tests.

          -  Significant valve disease

          -  Current signs or symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia or acute coronary syndrome
             (ACS) or coronary revascularization in the past 3 months.
