  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Male circumcision (MC) reduces, by more than half, the risk of HIV-1 acquisition. WHO and
      UNAIDS recommend that &quot;male circumcision should be recognized as an efficacious intervention
      for HIV prevention especially in countries and regions with heterosexual HIV epidemics and
      low male circumcision prevalence.&quot; As a result, programs have been introduced and scaled up
      for voluntary medical male circumcision. Kenya leads with the largest expansion of services.

      Early resumption of sexual intercourse after MC may have deleterious effects, including
      higher rates of post-operative surgical complications, and higher HIV acquisition among
      females in couples that resume sexual activity before certified wound healing. In the context
      of rapid scale-up of MC, adherence to post-operative clinic appointments allows clinicians to
      assess wound healing and to deliver risk reduction counseling. Abstinence from sexual
      intercourse before complete wound healing would reduce the rate of post-operative adverse
      events and minimize the risk of HIV transmission from HIV-infected men to their uninfected
      female partners.

      To the investigators knowledge, the effect of reminders delivered via text messaging to
      promote adherence to clinic visits and abstinence after MC has not been investigated. The
      investigators propose a randomized controlled trial in which men who will have undergone
      voluntary medical male circumcision at selected sites in Kisumu will be randomized to receive
      either the intervention (context-sensitive text messages after circumcision) or the control
      condition (usual care). This study seeks to determine (a) the effect of regular text messages
      sent to men after circumcision on attendance of the scheduled 7-day post-operative clinic
      visit versus usual care; (b) the proportion of men who resume sexual activity before 42 days
      post-procedure after receiving regular text messages versus usual care within the 42 days
      post-circumcision; and (c) to identify potential predictors of failure to attend the
      scheduled 7-day post-operative visit and early resumption of sexual intercourse.
