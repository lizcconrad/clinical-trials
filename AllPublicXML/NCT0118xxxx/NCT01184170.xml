  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about why some obese persons are resistant to
      developing obesity-related metabolic diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease),
      while others are prone to developing these conditions. We will do this by studying obese
      persons before and after a 5% body weight gain.

      Subjects will be asked to increase their current diet for a period of 8-12 weeks in order to
      increase their current body weight by 5%. Each will then be asked to maintain this weight
      increase for 3 weeks. We will monitor subjects throughout this time period with weekly
      medical evaluations. At the completion of the study, we will provide each subject with a
      6-month weight loss program.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects in this group are metabolically normal. They have low liver fat defined as less than five percent as determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Intervention: Subjects will begin an 8-12 week high-calorie diet intervention. They will eat an additional 1000 kcal/day for two to three months, until a moderate, approximately 5% weight gain is achieved. The recommended dietary energy intake will be 1000 kcal/d more than the subject's baseline resting energy expenditure. An individualized diet plan will be developed for each subject by the study dietitian based on estimated energy requirements, and the subject's food preferences and dietary habits.</description>

    <description>Subjects in this group are metabolically abnormal. They have high liver fat defined as at least ten percent as determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Intervention: Subjects will begin an 8-12 week high-calorie diet intervention. They will eat an additional 1000 kcal/day for two to three months, until a moderate, approximately 5% weight gain is achieved. The recommended dietary energy intake will be 1000 kcal/d more than the subject's baseline resting energy expenditure.
