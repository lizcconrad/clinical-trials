  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being conducted to learn about how health and genetic literacy (i.e.,
      how well a person understands health and genetic information) affects a person's ability to
      understand genetic risk information for Type 2 diabetes and whether that person chooses to
      change their lifestyle and health behaviors to reduce their risk. The investigators also want
      to learn if the manner in which the genetic risk information is communicated affects the
      level of understanding and potential behavior changes. Participants will be tested for
      genetic risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and will received results either via a web-based
      computer program, or in-person from a genetic counselor.
