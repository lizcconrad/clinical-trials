      1. Primary Endpoints

             -  Biomarker data suggestive of regorafenib-mediated inhibition of the RAS-RAF-
                MEK-ERK signal transduction pathway,of various tyrosine kinase receptors and/or of
                angiogenesis.

             -  Evaluation of potential relationships between biomarker data and clinical activity.

             -  Evaluation of a novel biomarker technology (Prometheus COPIA platform)

        2. Secondary Endpoints

             -  Biomarker data suggestive of regorafenib-mediated effects on circulating rare
                cells.

             -  Comparison of tumor genetic profiles obtained using DNA isolated from plasma, tumor
                biopsies and circulating tumor cells.

             -  Patient safety data

             -  Pharmacokinetics of regorafenib

             -  Changes in tumor metabolic activity as measured by PET CT scan (optional)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma that is
             refractory to standard therapy and not amenable to surgery with curative intent.

          -  Tumor characteristics:

               -  At least one lesion that is suitable for a repeated biopsy; eg. subcutaneous
                  nodule, skin lesion, rectal tumor, colonic mass easily reached by colonoscopy,
                  peritoneal masses at least 3cm in maximum diameter that are easily assessable by
                  image guided core biopsy.

               -  For liver lesions, more superficially located lesions at least 3cm in maximum
                  dimension with a rim of normal liver tissue, assessable safely by image guided
                  core biopsy as determined by an experienced interventional radiologist.

             10.4).

          -  Adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count =1,500/mm3; platelet count

          -  Adequate liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory requirements
             conducted within 7 days of starting to study treatment:

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN).

               -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5 x ULN (&lt; 5
                  x ULN for patients with liver involvement of their cancer).

               -  Amylase and lipase &lt; 1.5 x the ULN

               -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x the ULN.

               -  Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) = 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 according to the MDRD
                  (Modified diet in renal disease) abbreviated formula

          -  Prothrombin time, international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time
             less than or equal to 1.2 times the ULN.

          -  Male or female at least 21 years of age.
