  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of a proton pump inhibitor (lansoprazole)
      and a histamine-2 receptor antagonist (famotidine) in preventing recurrent ulcer bleeding in
      patients with a history of H. pylori-negative idiopathic peptic ulcers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peptic ulcer disease used to be caused by a bacterial infection (Helicobacter pylori) in the
      stomach or the use of certain painkillers (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs).
      However, there has been an increasing trend of peptic ulcer disease with unknown cause
      (idiopathic ulcer) worldwide since the last decade. Studies in North America found that
      idiopathic ulcers accounted for 11% and 44% of all peptic ulcers. A meta-analysis of 7 US
      trials found that 20% of patients with H. pylori-associated ulcers had recurrent ulcers
      within 6 months, despite successful cure of H. pylori infection and no reported use of
      NSAIDs. In a pooled analysis of 6 clinical trials with a total of 2900 patients, 27% of
      duodenal ulcers were not associated with NSAID use or H. pylori infection. The emerging
      problem of H. pylori-negative idiopathic peptic ulcers is not only limited to western
      countries. Previously, H. pylori-negative idiopathic peptic ulcers accounted for less than 5%
      of peptic ulcers in Asia. A recent Korean study reported that the proportion of peptic ulcers
      not associated with H. pylori infection or NSAID use was over 20%.

    <description>According to prespecified criteria â€” hematemesis or melena documented by the admitting physician, or a decrease in the hemoglobin level of at least 2 g/dL, with ulcers or bleeding erosions confirmed on endoscopy.
A prespecified interim-analysis is performed on the primary endpoint when all patients have been randomised and have completed the 12 months follow-up. The interim-analysis is performed by an independent statistician, blinded for the treatment allocation. The statistician will report to the independent data and safety monitoring committee (DSMC). The DSMC will have unblinded access to all data and will discuss the results of the interim-analysis with the steering committee in a joint meeting. The steering committee decides on the continuation of the trial and will report to the central ethics committee. The Peto approach is used: the trial will be ended using symmetric stopping boundaries at P &lt; 0.001.</description>
