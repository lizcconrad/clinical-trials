  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this study to learn about the quality of life patients have at
      the end of treatment. Some patients' cancers are related to human papilloma virus or HPV;
      others are not. HPV is a virus that can be sexually transmitted and is known to cause some
      types of cancers. If your throat cancer was related to HPV, your doctor can discuss this with
      you in detail. The investigators want to see if there are differences in quality of life
      between patients whose cancers are caused by HPV and those who cancers are not caused by HPV.
      Throat cancers caused by HPV behave differently than throat cancers not caused by HPV. The
      investigators believe that patients with these two different types of throat cancer will also
      have different experiences after completing therapy. The investigators would like to
      understand what those differences are. The long-term goal of this study is to see what
      symptoms most patients have. The investigators can then try to treat them earlier, and
      hopefully, improve the symptoms. The investigators will also be able to plan more research to
      improve treatment for symptoms following treatment for cancer of the mouth and throat.

    <description>This study has two components. First, we will conduct a cross-sectional survey of 200 oropharynx cancer survivors, diagnosed with HPV+ tumors, who are at least 12 months from their last treatment. Second, in a subset of 20 survivors of HPV+ oropharynx cancer, we will conduct in-depth, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews addressing the psychosocial impact of the HPV diagnosis.</description>

    <description>Survivors will be asked to complete a brief, self-administered, paper-based survey to assess quality of life, mental health and employment status following completion of therapy. Second, in a subset of 20 survivors of HPV+ oropharynx cancer, we will conduct in-depth, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews addressing the psychosocial impact of the HPV diagnosis. A follow up letter will be sent to participants who do not return their completed study questionnaires.</description>

        Potential research subjects will be identified through a Dataline query. While Dataline
        should capture most eligible patients, potential subjects can also be identified by a
        member of the Head and Neck DMT.
