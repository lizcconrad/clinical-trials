    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to determine whether the vaccine (UB 311),
      targeting the N-terminal amino acids (1-14) of the amyloid beta peptide, has long-term
      immunogenicity and efficacy in individuals diagnosed with mild or moderate Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) who previously received UB 311-treatment. Amyloid beta was selected as the
      target antigen based on supporting evidence of the hypothesis that places the accumulation of
      amyloid beta at the initiating step of AD.
