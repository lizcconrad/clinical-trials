  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As reported, about 0.43% patients can not be intubated unevenly because of difficult airway
      and 30% of the total death of anesthesia due to failed intubation. The difficult airway will
      disturb the clinical treatment and even threaten the patients' life. But the present methods
      for tracheal intubation during awake intubation can not provided ideal intubation condition.
      In this study, the investigators will perform topical anesthesia with the nebulized 2%
      lidocaine at 10L/min oxygen flow rate, and the observer's assessment of alert and sedation
      (OAA/S) scale was controlled to 3-4 points by intravenous midazolam,propofol, and
      remifentanil. Tracheal intubation was performed after topical anesthesia. The arterial
      pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) were recorded and blood
      samples were taken to measure stress factor during intubation period.Intubation condition
      score was assessed and the complications like local anesthetic toxicity, mucosa injury,
      respiration depress were also recorded. Patients were asked whether they could recall the
      events during intubation 24 hr after operation. The investigators aim is to evaluate the
      effect of topical anesthesia with lidocaine nebulized by 10L/min oxygen flow rate during
      awake tracheal intubation.

      90 adult patients for elective surgery under general anesthesia, aged 18-60 years old,
      Mallampti Ⅰ-Ⅱ class, , were randomly allocated to receive topical anesthesia with pressure
      nebulized 2% lidocaine for glottis either two times or three times or four times(each group
      n=30). Before topical anesthesia, the observer's assessment of alert and sedation (OAA/S)
      scale was controlled to 3-4 points by intravenous midazolam (0.03mg/kg), propofol (2mg/kg/h)
      and remifentanil (0.05μg/kg/min). Ten minutes after sedation, topical anesthesia was
      performed with the nebulized 2% lidocaine at 10L/min oxygen flow rate, meantime patients were
      told to breathe deeply. Tracheal intubation was performed after topical anesthesia. The
      arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) were recorded and
      blood samples were taken to measure the serum cortisol and insulin concentration during
      intubation period. Intubation condition score was assessed and the complications like local
      anesthetic toxicity, mucosa injury, respiration depress were also recorded. Patients were
      asked whether they could recall the events during intubation 24 hr after operation.
