        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 - 1

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  Subjects with advanced, histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumors,
             refractory to any standard therapy, have no standard therapy available, or subjects
             must have actively refused any treatment which would be regarded standard, and / or if
             in the judgment of the investigator, experimental treatment is clinically and
             ethically acceptable

          -  At least 1 tumor lesion measurable by computer tomography (CT) scan or magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) according to RECIST 1.1

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal functions as assessed by the following
             laboratory requirements to be conducted within 14 days prior to the first dose of
             study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of cardiac disease: congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA Class II, unstable angina
             (anginal symptoms at rest), any episodes of angina or history of myocardial
             infarction, cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy (beta blockers or
             digoxin are permitted), previous venous or arterial thrombotic events, pulmonary
             embolism

          -  Moderate or severe hepatic impairment, i.e. Child-Pugh class B or C(3)

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chronic hepatitis B or C

          -  Active clinically serious infections of CTCAE &gt; Grade 2 (CTCAE v4.02)

          -  Symptomatic metastatic brain or meningeal tumors unless the subject is &gt; 3 months from
             definitive therapy, has no evidence of tumor growth on an imaging study within 4 weeks
             prior to study entry, and is clinically stable with respect to the tumor at the time
             of study entry. Subjects must not be on acute steroid therapy or taper off steroid
             therapy (chronic steroid therapy is acceptable provided that the dose is stable for 4
             weeks prior to study entry and following screening CT / MRI scan). Subjects with
             neurological symptoms should undergo a CT / MRI scan of the brain to exclude new or
             progressive brain metastases. Spinal cord metastasis is acceptable

          -  Seizure disorder requiring therapy (such as steroids or anti-epileptics)

          -  History of organ allograft

          -  Evidence or history of bleeding disorder, i.e. any hemorrhage / bleeding event of
             CTCAE &gt; Grade 2 within 4 weeks prior to prior to the first dose of study drug
