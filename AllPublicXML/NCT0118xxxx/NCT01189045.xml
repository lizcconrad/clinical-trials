    <textblock>
      Little is known about how exercise can affect heart function in stroke survivors.

      This study will look at changes in cardiovascular fitness and function after 6 months of
      exercise. Volunteers will be tested before and after the program and again 2 months later to
      measure the effects on stroke risk factors, fitness level and flexibility of the arteries.
      Blood tests will measure cholesterol levels and other signs of inflammation.

      This study will help us better understand how exercise after stroke can improve heart
      function and heart health, and ultimately help in lowering future stroke risk.

      Purpose

      To determine the effects of aerobic exercise after stroke on cardiorespiratory fitness,
      cardiovascular function, stroke risk factors, walking and health-related quality of life.
      This study will also examine the retention of these effects after the exercise program ends.

      Methods

      A randomized controlled study design will be used. Sixty participants will be randomized to
      participate in one of 2 treatment arms (6 months duration, 3 days / week, 1 hour / session):

        1. BALANCE AND FLEXIBILITY (non-aerobic) PROGRAM will be comprised of individualized upper
           and lower body stretching, or balance activities, yoga- or Tai Chi-style classes.

        2. AEROBIC PROGRAM will be comprised of a structured, progressive aerobic training program.

      Participants will be evaluated at 3 time points - baseline (0 months), post-intervention (6
      months) and follow up (8 months) - for stroke risk factors, cardiorespiratory fitness,
      arterial stiffness, echocardiography measures, inflammatory biomarkers, ambulatory capacity
      and health-related quality of life.
