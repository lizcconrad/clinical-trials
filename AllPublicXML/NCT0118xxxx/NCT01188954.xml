  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A seroma is a collection of fluid other than pus or blood which forms through the division of
      numerous lymphatic channels, which normally drain the interstitial space under the skin.
      These channels become disrupted during surgical procedure and lead to seroma formation. This
      collection of fluid causes pressure in the local area, patient discomfort, and provides
      unfortunately an excellent culture medium for bacteria. Seroma development has been
      previously described in femoral vessel groin cannulation dissections after surgery.
      Conventional therapy is limited to draining the fluid, sometimes more than once, until there
      is full resolution of the seroma. If fluid collection recurs at the surgical site, sclerosant
      therapy with agents such as doxycycline. Doxycycline has been found to be a cost effective
      agent used as a sclerosant, which belongs to tetracycline class of antibiotics. The
      investigators hypothesize that prophylactic use of doxycycline at the site of femoral
      cannulation will prevent or minimize the area of seroma formation as compared to standard
      care of patients. The aim is driven towards limiting patient discomfort and visits to the
      clinic and to improve clinical care.
