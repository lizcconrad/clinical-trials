  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contingency Management (CM) is highly effective in promoting recovery from substance use
      disorders, but benefits tend to attenuate over time when CM is discontinued. Identifying
      modifications of CM delivery that can extend its benefits is an important goal. The goal of
      this study is to evaluate the use of reinforcements to increase physical activity,
      specifically walking. The study provides a standard CM intervention to promote walking for
      three weeks. After three weeks, a progressively increasing variable interval schedule of
      reinforcement will be evaluated for increasing the durability of effects of the initial CM
      intervention. We hypothesize that Variable Interval Prize Contingency Management will result
      in greater adherence to a walking goal of 10,000 steps per day at Week 15 and Week 24
      compared to the Control Condition.

    <description>Participants assigned to the control condition will be told to wear the pedometer daily and select a twice-weekly meeting schedule with research staff for 12 weeks (study weeks 4-15). On days randomly selected as meeting days, participants will be asked to bring in their pedometers. Participants who attend their scheduled meetings will receive a $5 gift card just for attending and bringing the pedometer, so long as it has registered steps walked in at least the past 4 days. They will be congratulated if they walked 10,000 steps or more on the prior 4 days, and encouraged to walk 10,000 steps or more per day on subsequent days.</description>
