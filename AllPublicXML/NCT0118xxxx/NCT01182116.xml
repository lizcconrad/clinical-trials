      The investigators hypothesis is that the patients who receive a side to end anastomosis have
      bowel outcome and quality of life that is equivalent to those who receive a J pouch.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The side to end anastomosis has become popular in recent years as it is technically simple to
      construct. The difference between the Baker type(side to end) of anastomosis and the J pouch,
      is that no formal pouch is constructed in the side to end. It has one staple line and the
      anastomosis.

      The investigators hypothesis is that the patients who receive a side to end anastomosis have
      bowel outcome and quality of life that is equivalent to those who receive a J pouch.
