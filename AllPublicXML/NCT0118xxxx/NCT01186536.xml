  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to determine the effect of 9 months of progressive
      resistance training with daily whey protein supplements on the body composition (changes in
      muscle and fat) in young adults. The investigators hypothesize that those individuals who
      receive whey protein supplements will have larger gains in muscle and larger losses of fat
      tissue in response to resistance training compared to those who receive supplements of soy or
      carbohydrate.

      Healthy men and women will be recruited to participate in 9 months of supervised resistance
      training (3 days/wk) and will be randomized to one of three daily supplement groups: Whey
      protein, soy protein, or carbohydrate control. Body weight, muscular strength and endurance,
      and resting blood pressure will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months. Body composition
      will be assessed at baseline, 3, 5, 7, and 9 months. A sub-sample (N = 17 per group, assessed
      at baseline and 9 months) will be randomly selected for muscle samples of the upper leg to
      determine changes in the size of muscle fibers, and chemical factors associated with muscle
      growth. Blood samples will be obtained from sub-sample participants to assess changes in
      glucose and fat metabolism, as well as other chemicals likely to promote or inhibit muscle
      growth. We will also assess changes in daily energy expenditure and the use of fuel to
      produce energy (carbohydrate, fat, protein) that may result from the intervention. We
      hypothesize that those individuals who receive whey protein supplements will have larger
      gains in muscle and larger losses of fat tissue in response to resistance training compared
      to those who receive supplements of soy or carbohydrate.
