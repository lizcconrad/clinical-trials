      Study is performed as a part of NordICC (Clinical trials NCT 00883792) trial, which is
      intended to investigate the effect of screening colonoscopy on colorectal cancer incidence
      and mortality. NordICC trial is a multicenter, randomized study conducted in Norway, Sweden,
      Netherlands and Poland.

      This study is designed to assess two factors potentially influencing patients attendance.
      These two factors are: identification of particular doctor performing examination and the
      possibility of choosing doctor's gender.
