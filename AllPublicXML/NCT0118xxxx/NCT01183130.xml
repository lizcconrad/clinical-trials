  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to examine whether electronic compliance monitoring in real time
      could offer some advantages compared to normal electronic monitoring in opioid substitution
      treatment. The investigators would also like know whether this method could enable the quick
      detection of possible problems in medication intakes and/or prevent the abuse or diversion of
      substitution medications.

    <description>Electronic compliance monitoring with monitoring device (Pharma DDSi, Stora Enso) is used in control group (n=6) and device with mobile phone in intervention group (n=6). Patients in intervention group send every day the information of their medication intakes with the mobile phone to the clinic. This intervention is tested in pilot study (n=2-3) before the actual study begins.</description>
