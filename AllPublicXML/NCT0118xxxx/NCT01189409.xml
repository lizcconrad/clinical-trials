  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to compare the efficacy and tolerability of two laxatives for treatment of
      opioid-induced constipation in adult outpatients with cancer treated at the British Columbia
      Cancer Pain and Symptom Management/Palliative Care clinics. Each participating patient will
      be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One group will be started on a bowel protocol of escalating doses of sennosides, plus a dummy
      polyethylene glycol (lactose), and the other will receive dummy sennosides capsules (lactose)
      plus polyethylene glycol, with the same dosing protocol. After three weeks of one active
      treatment the patients will switch to the alternate active product and dummy preparation. The
      total duration for the study will be 6 weeks for each patient.

    <intervention_model_description>The primary outcome will be treated as a binomial outcome, expressed as the number of successful trials out of a pre-defined number of trials n = 18. Given this, the primary outcome will be analysed via a generalized mixed effects model. The model will include: (i) fixed effects for treatment, treatment period and their interaction, (ii) fixed effects for the baseline characteristics and (iii) a random patient effect. Including the latter effect in the model will help capture the within-patient correlation among the values of the primary outcome collected in Period I and Period II for the same patient.
All statistical analyses will be conducted using the open-source statistical software package R.</intervention_model_description>
