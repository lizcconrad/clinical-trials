  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nursing team of well baby nursery at Hillel Yaffe medical center in Hadera, Israel have
      noticed that infant of Ethiopian-origin mothers regurgitate more than other infants.
      Probably, these infants are breastfeed much more than other infants.

      Some Ethiopian-origin mothers are used to eat teff-flower porridge during the last weeks of
      pregnancy and after birth, in order to expand milk production.

      Study goal is to find out if infants of Ethiopian-origin mother do regurgitate more than
      others, and if they weight gain is similar to other infants. Another goal is to find out if
      breastfeeding mothers of Ethiopian origin do eat that porridge, and if there is any
      difference between those who do eat that porridge and those who do not.
