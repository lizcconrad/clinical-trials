  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation, safety and tolerability study, which
      will be conducted at one study site. This study will include 3 cohorts. Each cohort will have
      approximately 5 subjects. Subjects will not be randomized into the study. The first cohort
      will receive low dose drug insert, second cohort will receive 2 low dose drug inserts thus
      achieving twice the drug levels compared to cohort I and third cohort will receive high dose
      drug insert.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the tolerability and safety of the biodegradable
      extended release Latanoprost subconjunctival insert for primary open angle glaucoma (POAG)
      and ocular hypertension (OHT) patients. Intraocular pressure lowering ability of
      biodegradable extended release Latanoprost subconjunctival insert in POAG and OHT patients
      will also be evaluated.

      Low dose inserts have an initial release rate of approximately 1 µg/day slowing to 0.2 µg/day
      after approximately 10 days; this release rate is maintained. High dose inserts have an
      initial release of approximately 4 µg/day, which slows to approximately 1 ug/day after 10
      days. Each drop of Xalatan (the commercial form of latanoprost) contains approximately 1 µg
      of latanoprost. The first cohort will receive inserts that initially provide the same dose as
      is administered topically before their release rate slows down to a lower dose. The inserts
      used in this study are composed of a drug core in a (Poly Lactic Glycolic acid) PLGA polymer
      tube. One end of the tube is capped with an impermeable polymer (silicone) and the other end
      with a permeable polymer (Polyvinyl alcohol). Drug release occurs across the permeable end
      and is a function of internal diameter of the tube. Low dose insert and high dose insert are
      exactly the same except that for low dose inserts the internal diameter of the PLGA tubes is
      smaller. Thus different release rates (and drug loading) are obtained with the same
      formulation. Inserts are designed to provide steady state release for 3-6 months.
