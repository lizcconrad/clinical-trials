  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a treatment with Lenalidomide, which is a pill given
      by mouth for 7.5 months (30 weeks total), can delay the growth of lymphoma or shrink the
      lymphoma. Lenalidomide is a pill that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA). It is used to treat some forms of cancer-like illnesses (myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS)and in combination with dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have
      received at least 1 prior therapy. MDS and MM are cancers of the blood). This drug works by
      stimulating the body's immune system and by reducing the blood supply to cancer cells. Cancer
      cells need blood to live and grow. In this study, the drug is considered a new or
      experimental drug because we are learning how it works against your form of lymphoma.

             defined in the WHO classification3) as reviewed by a hematopathologist at Memorial
             Hospital

          -  No prior treatment for lymphoma permitted.
