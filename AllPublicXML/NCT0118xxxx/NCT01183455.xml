    <textblock>
      Aralast NP (alpha-1 antitrypsin, AAT), an alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor (human), was the drug
      to be tested in this clinical trial. Aralast NP is an anti-inflammatory drug that affects the
      cells that are thought to be involved in the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM,
      T1D). This study, known as RETAIN, was planned as a two-part trial to investigate the effect
      of Aralast NP on preserving beta cell function and to determine if the intervention would
      slow the progression of type 1 diabetes.

      Part I of this trial (NCT 01183468) was an open-label, safety and dose level study consisting
      of two groups. After completion of Part I, including a satisfactory safety review, enrollment
      in Part II was to begin. Part II was designed as a two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial, and participants were to be randomly assigned to either the Aralast NP
      treatment or placebo group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      T1D is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system (the part of your body that
      helps fight infections) mistakenly attacks the cells that produce insulin (beta cells in the
      pancreas). As beta cells are destroyed by your immune cells, your ability to produce insulin
      is decreased. Insulin helps keep blood glucose levels normal.

      Individuals with T1D who have the ability to produce some of their own insulin (even though
      they still need to take insulin) may be able to achieve better glucose control than people
      who produce no insulin at all. Better glucose control has been shown to reduce the long-term
      complications of diabetes. Previous research has shown that giving medicines to affect the
      immune system soon after type 1 diabetes is diagnosed may stop, delay or decrease the
      destruction of beta cells, resulting in better glucose control.

      In mouse models of disease, alpha-1 proteinase inhibitors have been shown to reverse
      new-onset diabetes and induce a state of self-tolerance. The RETAIN clinical trial was
      intended to investigate the effect of Aralast NP on preserving beta cell function and slowing
      the progression of T1D.
