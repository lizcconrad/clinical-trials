    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect and safety of AXP107-11 alone, and in
      combination with gemcitabine standard therapy, in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer
      of the pancreas. The safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of AXP107-11 in these patients
      will also be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The annual incidence rate of pancreatic cancer is almost identical to the mortality rate.
      Despite a low incidence rate, pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer
      mortality in both men and women. Today is the only potentially curative option of these
      patients complete surgical resection. However, a majority of the patients (up to 80%) are not
      eligible for surgery for different reasons.

      Today is gemcitabine the accepted first-line treatment for these patients. Recent advances in
      the management of pancreatic cancer suggest that gemcitabine may be improved by combining it
      with other anticancer drugs.

      One attractive therapeutic option is genistein. Genistein appears to sensitize tumors to
      chemotherapy both by targeting the tumor cells and also by targeting components of the tumor
      microenvironment.

      However, the limited bioavailability of genistein in its known crystalline form has led to
      difficulties in attaining adequate plasma concentration, resulting in limited application and
      dissemination in the clinical setting. To overcome this limitation, a novel crystalline form
      of genistein with improved pharmaceutical properties is being used. AXP107-11, a crystalline
      salt of genistein has improved physiochemical properties (solubility, dissolution rate,
      bioavailability) as compared to the known crystalline form of genistein.

      In this study, AXP107-11, will be investigated alone and in combination with gemcitabine in
      patients with pancreatic cancer.

    <description>The drug substance, AXP107-11, is a crystalline form of genistein, a substance shown in literature data to target pancreatic tumor cells and also the tumor microenvironment and thus sensitizes tumors to chemotherapy. AXP107-11 is formulated in a capsule containing 2x100 mg of active substance.
A maximum of four cohorts of three to six patients each will be treated with escalating dose levels of AXP107-11 alone (two weeks) and in combination with gemcitabine (one week).
AXP107-11 capsules will be ingested orally twice daily (morning and evening) each day of the treatment period. In phase Ib, AXP107-11 will be administered once daily on the first treatment day (morning), followed by twice daily administrations continuously throughout the treatment period. When a minimum of six patients have been treated and evaluated on the maintenance dose (phase 1b), additional patients will be included directly into phase IIa.</description>
