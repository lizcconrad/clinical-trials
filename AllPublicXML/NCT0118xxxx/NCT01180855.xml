      The specific aims of the proposed study are to compare the sleep, daytime functioning, and
      circadian phase effects of ROZEREMTM (ramelteon/TAK-375) a selective MT1/MT2 melatonin
      receptor agonist in humans alone and in combination with multi-component behavior therapy
      (MCBT) in patients with chronic insomnia.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical and sleep/wake history. During the screening process, participants will
             receive a physical exam, urine and blood labs, and be interviewed about their medical
             and sleep/wake history and be asked questions about their present and past habitual
             sleep/wake schedule and nap times.

             (b) Medication/drug/alcohol use. Participants must have no history of drug or alcohol
             abuse or dependency, consume no more than 2 alcoholic beverages a day or more than 14
             per week, Participants must agree not to consume more than 2 beverages containing
             caffeine (caffeinated coffee, tea, colas) a day before 2 pm and none after 2 pm.

             (c) Evaluation of Psychiatric/Psychological Suitability. Participants must demonstrate
             a full understanding of the requirements and demands of the study.

        For inclusion/exclusion screening, participants will receive a sleep, medical, physical and
        psychiatric history examination, one-night of dim light melatonin onset evaluation in the
        sleep laboratory, one-night of polysomnography, and two weeks of baseline sleep assessment.
        If during the polysomnography assessment the participant had a respiratory disturbance
        index (RDI) of 15 or more, the participant would be considered to have met the exclusionary
        criterion for obstructive sleep apnea. A letter providing feedback of the all night
        polysomnography assessment will be sent to all participants.

        Individuals with a history of psychiatric illnesses or psychiatric disorders will be
        excluded, such as but not limited to, alcoholism, drug dependency, mood disorders;
        schizophrenic disorders, anxiety disorders; personality disorders. Finally, individuals who
        are unaware of specific psychiatric diagnoses who have a history of having been treated
        with antidepressants, neuroleptic medications or major tranquilizers will be excluded from
        study. However, a personal history of limited prior counseling or psychotherapy (e.g., for
        adjustment reactions) will not be exclusionary. Individuals who have been treated for
        insomnia within the past six months will be excluded.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria include diagnosis or treatment of other sleep disorders such as
             obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, sleep walking, and periodic limb movement
             disorders. Participants with a history of night work in the preceding 6 months or
             transmeridian travel (across &gt;3 time zones) in the last 1 month prior to the study
             will be excluded.

        Use of psychotropic, hypnotic medications known to affect sleep or contraindicated for use
        with ramelteon, or over-the-counter analgesics that contain caffeine, or herbal
        supplements, including products with herbs, melatonin, or St. John's Wort.

        Substance use will be determined by self-report and urine toxicology during the screening
        visit. Women who are pregnant or are planning on becoming pregnant will be excluded from
        the study. Female participants will be given a pregnancy test during the screening process.
