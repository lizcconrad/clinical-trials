      The purpose of this study was to measure the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in
      eyes of Obstructive Sleep Apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) using optical coherence tomography
      (OCT), and assess whether it is decreased. The investigators then compared the results with
      healthy subjects database of RNFL thickness from another retrospective study.

    <textblock>
      An association between glaucoma and OSAHS has been reported in several studies. Glaucoma is a
      progressive optic neuropathy involving loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons at the
      level of the optic nerve head.Computerized technologies have now been successfully used in
      evaluating retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in glaucoma.Given the evidence of a
      possible link between OSAHS and glaucoma, it is reasonable that structural losses in retinal
      nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness would be present in OSAHS.Indeed,decreased retinal nerve
      fiber layers was found in patients with OSAHS, the severity of which correlated with the
      severity of the patients' OSAHS using scanning laser Polarimetry (SLP).Optical coherence
      tomography (OCT) provides quantitative RNFL thickness data by measuring the difference in the
      temporal delay of back-scattered light from the RNFL and a reference mirror.During the past
      decade, OCT has been used widely in clinical practice to discriminate glaucomatous eyes and
      eyes with early perimetric glaucoma from normal eyes. Several studies confirmed the accuracy
      and reproducibility of the RNFL thickness measurements by OCT. The thickness of the
      peripapillary RNFL was measured with the Stratus OCT(Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc, Dublin,CA)using
      the fast scan protocol(3.4).Only good quality images, as judged by the well-focused and
      centered scans,no artifacts showing distorted anatomy, no missing parts and a signal strength
      â‰¥6, were used for further analysis. The considered OCT parameters were overall average RNFL
      thickness and the average RNFL thickness in 4 quadrants (superior, nasal,inferior,and
      temporal)extracted from the standard RNFL thickness analysis report(RNFL Thickness Average
      Analysis Protocol).
