    <textblock>
      Physicians counsel women participants who are candidates for hormonal contraception about
      available combined hormonal contraceptive methods (the combined pill, the contraceptive
      vaginal ring [i.e., the etonogestrel + ethinylestradiol vaginal ring] and the contraceptive
      transdermal patch). Effects of this counseling on women's contraceptive use decisions are to
      be evaluated by 1) recording which method is chosen after information is provided about all
      three available combined hormonal methods, 2) comparing the final chosen contraceptive method
      used by a participant after counseling with the method originally intended to be used by that
      participant before the counseling, and 3) evaluating the criteria used by women participants
      to choose their contraceptive method after the counseling, including evaluation of social and
      demographic predictors of contraceptive choice. The differences among participants in the
      number of contacts made by the participants to physician offices for purposes of obtaining
      information regarding the use of their final chosen hormonal contraceptive (e.g., requests
      for clarification, questions, expressing doubt or reservations for using the method, or
      requests for other help/advisement by the physician) will also be evaluated over four months
      following the physician counseling.

    <description>Before receiving counseling, participants recorded on a questionnaire the method of contraception they thought they would choose. This was to be compared with the method of contraception the same participants thought they would choose after they received physician counseling, which was also recorded on their questionnaire.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy women ≥ 18 years of age and ≤ 40 years of age who consult their physician for
             contraception and would consider a combined hormonal contraceptive method

             and suspended it for at least 1 month

          -  Women on one combined pill who would consider switching to another combined pill
             (Women who attend their physician to stop one of the combined hormonal methods can not
             participate)

          -  Women who request a combined hormonal contraceptive method but for whom the physician
             considers another method more appropriate (e.g. contraindications for combined
             hormonal contraception) will be counseled about these methods but still complete the
             questionnaire

          -  Women who are not interested in becoming pregnant in the next 4 months

          -  Women who agree to complete a questionnaire and that the questionnaire data are
