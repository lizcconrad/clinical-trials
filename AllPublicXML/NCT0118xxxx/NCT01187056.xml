  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General practitioners (GPs) and patients find it difficult to talk about risk of future
      disease, especially when patients have asymptomatic conditions, and treatment options are
      unlikely to cause immediate perceptible improvements in well-being. Further studies in risk
      communication for disease prevention are needed, as are studies about risk communication
      training for GPs. Aim: 1) to systematically develop, describe and evaluate a complex
      intervention comprising a training programme for GPs in risk communication and shared
      decision-making, 2) to evaluate the effect of the training programme on real-life
      consultations between GPs and patients with high cholesterol levels, and 3) to evaluate
      patients' reactions during and after the consultations. Hypothesis: 1) patients have better
      adherence to chosen treatment.

      The effect of the complex intervention, based around a training programme, will be evaluated
      in a cluster-randomised controlled trial with an intervention group and an active control
      group with 40 GPs and 280 patients in each group.

      The GPs receive a questionnaire at baseline and after 6 months about their attitudes towards
      risk communication and cholesterol-reducing medication. After each consultation with a
      participating high cholesterol-patient, the GPs will complete a questionnaire about decision
      satisfaction.

      The patients will receive a questionnaire at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. It includes
      questions about adherence to chosen treatment, self-rated health, patient enablement, and
      risk communication and decision-making effectiveness. Prescriptions, contacts to the health
      services, and cholesterol level will be drawn from the register of the National Health
      Service of Denmark at baseline and at 6 months.

      In both intervention group and active control group, 12 consultations will be observed and
      tape-recorded. The consultations will be divided between 4 GPs with each 3 patients. The
      patients from these 24 consultations will be interviewed immediately after the consultation
      and re-interviewed after 6 months.Eight purposefully selected GPs from the intervention group
      will be interviewed in a focus group 6 months after participation in the training programme.
      The process and context of the RISAP-study will be investigated in detail using an action
      research approach, in order to describe and analyse research choices, adaptation of
      intervention model to the specific context, and GPs' and patients' reactions to trial
      participation.

        - GPs in Region Central and Region North, Denmark, are invited to the study.

        Patients are at least 18 years old, and have high cholesterol corresponding to a
        recommendation for cholesterol-reducing medication according to Danish clinical guideline
        for general practice. The patients are recruited after their high cholesterol has been
        detected and when treatment options are to be discussed.

        - Patients with CVD or DM are excluded from the study, as are patients already receiving
        cholesterol-reducing medication and patients unable to speak and read Danish.
