  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A huge challenge in type 2-diabetes care is how to motivate patients towards health behaviour
      changes. In Denmark, the tendency is that nurses in general practice provide a large part of
      type 2 diabetes care.

      Observational studies support Self-determination Theory by finding autonomous motivation and
      perceived competence associated with improved HbA1c-levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.
      Hence, research is needed to develop and test interventions that are autonomy supportive.

      Aim To develop a training course for practice-nurses in autonomy support in patients with
      type 2 diabetes, and to evaluate the effect on patient outcomes.

      Methods The development of the intervention was based on literature research and expert
      meetings. The intervention is evaluated in a cluster randomised controlled trial with 40
      Danish general practices,

        -  where nurses, before enrolment in the study, provided consultations to patients with
           type 2 diabetes,

        -  and about 2500 patients with type 2 diabetes, identified in a Diabetes Database.

      The patients will be followed 15 months from nurse-participation in the course. Data will be
      obtained from registers and patient-questionnaires. The hypothesis is that patients with type
      2 diabetes regardless of education level, age, and gender will benefit from the intervention.

    <description>An interactive course consisting of 4X4 hours education in autonomy support over a 6 months period. The main-components in the course are 1) communication skills, 2) introduction to patient work-sheets and 3) a quick up-to-date knowledge about treatment recommendations of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the nurses in the intervention-practices receive a half an hour support-visit 4-5 months after the end of the course.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The intervention-study comprises 40 general practices were:

               1. more than 50% of the patients with type 2 diabetes, who had participated in
                  diabetes-consultations during the last year from the invitation-date to the
                  project, were seen by a nurse at least once, stated by the practice. The
                  diabetes-consultation should not only include examinations (blood tests and blood
                  pressure measurement), but should also include communication about living with
                  type 2 diabetes ;

               2. enrollment in the project before registration deadline (three weeks after
                  invitation).

        Patients with diabetes, alive and affiliated the practices by May 2011, were identified in
        a a validated diabetes database based on health registers; The national Patient Registry,
        The national Health Insurance Service registry, the prescription database and the
        laboratory database in the county.
