    <textblock>
      Haloperidol is prescribed in high risk ICU patients concerning delirium (50% or more chance
      to develop delirium detected with the delirium prediction model PRE-DELIRIC, or patients with
      history of dementia or alcohol abuse)since the delirium protocol is changed and haloperidol
      is added as a prevention treatment we are gathering information what the effect is on several
      aspects of delirium

      Measurement the effect of haloperidol as delirium preventive intervention. Determining effect
      on:

      - delirium incidence in the ICU - different subtypes of delirium - delirium free days in 28
      days - days on the ventilator - length of stay on the ICU and In-Hospital - 28-day mortality
      - incidence of unexpected removal of tubes, and effect between different groups of patients.
      Safety of haloperidol concerning QT-time, extrapyramidal symptoms.

      Data are compared with the data of a historical cohort
