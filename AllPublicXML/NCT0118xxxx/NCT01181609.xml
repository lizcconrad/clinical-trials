  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous Avastin in combination with
      chemotherapy regimens as second-line treatment of metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum.
      The anticipated time of study treatment is until disease progression.

    <time_frame>Baseline, after every other cycle to disease progression or death (Maximum of 52.5 months follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>ODC was defined as the percentage of participants with measurable disease at baseline who on assessment achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥) 30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of all target lesions. SD defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since start of treatment. CR and PR were confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were met.</description>

    <description>Percentage of participants achieving CR or PR as defined by RECIST criteria. CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease under baseline of the sum of the LD of all target lesions. CR and PR were confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were met.</description>

    <description>ODC duration was defined as the time in months, from when measurement criteria were first met for CR, PR, or SD (whichever status was recorded first) until the first date when progressive disease or the death from any cause was documented. Data were censored for participants who were lost to follow-up, discontinued prematurely without progression/death, or who reached the end of study without progression.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Overall Disease Control (ODC)</title>
        <description>ODC was defined as the percentage of participants with measurable disease at baseline who on assessment achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥) 30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of all target lesions. SD defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since start of treatment. CR and PR were confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were met.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Overall Disease Control (ODC)</title>
          <description>ODC was defined as the percentage of participants with measurable disease at baseline who on assessment achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥) 30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of all target lesions. SD defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since start of treatment. CR and PR were confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were met.</description>
