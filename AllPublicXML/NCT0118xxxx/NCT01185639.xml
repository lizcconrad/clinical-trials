  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is a single arm phase II multi-center trial evaluating the efficacy of
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in patients with oligometastatic non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) with response or stable disease after 4 cycles of first-line
      chemotherapy. The core hypothesis tested is that SBRT after 4 cycles of first-line
      chemotherapy is feasible, safe, provides durable local control of treated lesions and
      improves time to progression compared to historical controls. Patients are eligible for
      enrollment if they have metastatic NSCLC with ≤5 lesions amenable to SBRT.
