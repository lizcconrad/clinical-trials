      • The objectives of this study are to confirm the medication delivery accuracy of the
      Infusion System, LLC Implantable Drug Delivery System (IDDS) with Patient Controlled
      Analgesia for intrathecal delivery of morphine sulfate for pain control, and to determine the
      safety profile of the system with PCA for intrathecal delivery of morphine sulfate for pain
      control.

          3. Subject must not presently be on intrathecal therapy but must be considered a
             candidate for intrathecal analgesia by his pain specialist; or, a subject already on
             intrathecal therapy must be in need of a replacement intrathecal pump and catheter.

          4. Subject must be capable of giving informed consent.

          5. Subjects who agree to sign a Pain Treatment Agreement (Narcotic Contract) limiting
             narcotic prescriptions to the study physician.

          6. Subjects who agree to periodic drug testing.

          7. Subject must be capable and willing to follow all study-related procedures, including
             returning for monthly refills.

          8. Subject must be cognitively intact and, in the opinion of the Investigator, capable of
             using the Patient Remote.

          9. Subject who is not already successfully treated with intrathecal analgesic therapy
             must be responsive to a trial of intrathecal or epidural morphine.

         10. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree to use a medically acceptable
             and effective double-barrier method of birth control.

         11. Documented failure to respond to less invasive methods of pain control (such as
             physical or behavioral modifications).

         12. Ineffective pain control with single or multiple systemic analgesic treatments (oral,
             rectal, IV or transdermal) or had intolerable side effects.

         13. Cancer pain requiring strong opioids or non-malignant pain with average Visual Analog
             Scale (VAS) score of ≥ 4/10.

         14. Subjects who can receive an MRI.

         15. Subjects must be able to hear and respond to audible alarms or agree to have a support
             person available who is able to hear and respond to audible alarms.

             implantation.

         14. Subject has a urine drug screen result which indicates the use of prescription drugs

         15. Subjects with an ASA Physical Status &gt;IV.

         16. Subjects with a history of spinal instability, or grade II spondylolisthesis or
             greater.

         17. Previously implanted subjects with spinal MRI findings of inflammatory mass prior to
             the implantation procedures.

         18. Subjects who are unable or unwilling to return to all of the required follow-up
             visits.

         19. Subjects who are unwilling to sign the informed consent.

         20. Subjects who are exposed to high-current industrial equipment (i.e. electricians or
             electrical engineers) or regularly exposed to MRI equipment (i.e. MRI technicians, MRI
             engineers and MRI clinicians).
