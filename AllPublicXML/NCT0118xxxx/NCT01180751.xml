      This clinical trial is being conducted to study the use of a radioactive glucose tracer as an
      imaging test [Positron Emission Tomography (PET)scan] in adults who have or are suspected of
      having cancer and in another group of adults to assess for neurologic conditions.

    <measure>To confirm the diagnostic effectiveness of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG) as compared to the gold standard of histopathological diagnosis.</measure>
    <time_frame>Three years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcomes of sensitivity and accuracy of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies will be obtained by comparing results of the PET scan with the gold standard of histopathological diagnosis when those results are available. Comparison to correlative imaging follow-up, and assessment of efficacy based on feedback from referring physicians will be used in the absence of pathologic data.</description>
