  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to carry out a pilot project comparing the effectiveness of
      two therapeutic approaches to temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) in adolescents. Eight female
      individuals diagnosed based on the Research Diagnosis Criteria for TMDs (RDC/TMD-axis 1)were
      randomly divided into two groups: 1) Massage therapy and muscle stretching (n=4); and 2)
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (n=4). Regardless the treatment, ten
      sessions were held for each patient and two measurements (baseline and 10th session) were
      performed for the assessment of symptom evolution using a visual analog scale (VAS), maximum
      opening of the mouth (MOM) and pressure pain threshold (PPT). Statistical analysis wiil be
      carefully selected.

    <description>The subjects was asked to mark the intensity of the pain on a 100mm line, which was numbered from 0 to 10, being &quot;0&quot; = no pain, and 10 = to the worst pain ever felt. The outcome of pain intensity was given as a number marked by the patient.</description>

    <measure>Maximum mouth opening amplitude</measure>
    <time_frame>Two times a week</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to open their mouths as much as they could and the opening amplitude was measured using a digital caliper.</description>
