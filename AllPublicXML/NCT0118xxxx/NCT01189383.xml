      The purpose of the study is to gather data on feasibility as well as immune and clinical
      efficacy of of a dendritic cell vaccine using IL15 in patients with resected stage III or
      stage IV melanoma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IL15 is a T cell growth factor that pre-clinical data overwhelmingly suggests could have a
      very important role in cancer immunotherapy. A desirable property for a dendritic cell
      vaccine directed against cancer is the ability to efficiently prime na√Øve, tumor associated
      antigen specific T cells into potent CTLs. Results of studies in healthy volunteers have
      shown that IL15 DCs are particularly efficient at priming functional melanoma specific CD8+ T
      cells. The use of IL15 in the manufacture of the DC vaccine could result in an improved
      immunotherapy product.

    <description>Approximately 9 x 10^6 DCs will be injected (subcutaneously)total per vaccination visit. Patients will receive four vaccinations at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12.At each scheduled vaccination the patient will receive a total of 3 injections, i.e., 3 mL injections at each of 3 anatomical locations.Injection sites are in upper and lower extremities. Subsequent DC injections will be rotated to different locations on the upper and lower extremities.</description>
