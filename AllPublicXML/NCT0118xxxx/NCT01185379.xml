  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) is inversely associated
      with cognitive decline and dementia (e.g. Kalmijn et al. 2004, Heude et al. 2003, Morris et
      al. 2005, Dullemeijer et al. 2009). Recently, the effects of supplemental docosahexaenoic
      acid (DHA) on behavioural outcomes in older adults has been explored, however two trials
      addressing this issue have published conflicting results regarding the efficacy of DHA
      supplementation, with one reporting a benefit of treatment on cognitive performance
      (Yurko-Mauro et al. 2010), while the other did not (Dangour et al. 2010).

      One area of research that has yet to be explored in this cohort is the effects of n-3 PUFAs
      on brain function in physiological terms. It is also possible that n-3 PUFAs, in combination
      with other compounds, may be more beneficial than treatment with n-3 PUFAs in isolation. The
      current study will explore several separate hypotheses within the same cohort. These are that
      Efalex Active 50+ may have a beneficial effect on:

        -  Cognitive performance

        -  Mental fatigue in response to cognitively demanding tasks

        -  Self-reported mood/well-being

        -  Task-related cerebral blood flow response

      The proposed study therefore has two aims; the primary aim is to evaluate the cognitive and
      mood/well-being effects of Efalex Active 50+, a dietary supplement containing a number of
      potentially cognition enhancing components including DHA, phosphatidylserine, vitamin B12,
      folic acid and Ginkgo biloba, compared with placebo in a sample of older adults aged 50-70
      years (Cognitive Study). The second is to evaluate the cerebral haemodynamic effects of the
      same treatment formulation in a sample drawn from the same population, with the addition of a
      third DHA-only arm (Hemodynamics Study). The intervention period will be 6 months.
