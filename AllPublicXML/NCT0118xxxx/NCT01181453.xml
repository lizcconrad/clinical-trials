      This study randomly assigns patients with diabetic foot ulcers to receive standard therapy
      (surgical debridement, saline-moistened gauze and offloading) alone or standard therapy plus
      Dermagraft(R). Dermagraft is a device containing live human fibroblasts grown on an
      absorbable Vicryl mesh. Patients are seen weekly until they heal or the 12-week treatment
      period is complete.

          -  Ulcer size is &gt;/=1.0 cm2 at Day 0 (day of randomization).

          -  Ulcer extends through the dermis and into subcutaneous tissue but without exposure of
             muscle, tendon, bone, or joint capsule.

          -  Ulcer is free of necrotic debris, exhibits no signs of clinical infection, and appears
             to be made up of healthy vascularized tissue.

          -  Patient's Ankle-Arm Index by Doppler is &gt;/=0.7.

          -  Patient has adequate circulation to the foot as evidenced by a palpable pulse.

          -  Female patients of child bearing potential must not be pregnant and must use accepted
             means of birth control.

             Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent form before treatment.

          -  Patient's study ulcer has been present (open) for at least 6 weeks at the time of the
             Screening visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  There is clinical evidence of gangrene on any part of the affected foot.

          -  The ulcer has tunnels or sinus tracts that cannot be completely debrided.

          -  The ulcer is &gt;20 cm2 (longest dimension cannot be greater than 5 cm).

          -  The ulcer has increased or decreased in size by 50% or more during the screening
             period.

          -  Presence of medical condition(s) that in the Investigator's opinion makes the patient
             an inappropriate candidate for this study.

          -  Presence of a malignant disease not in remission for 5 years or more.

          -  Evidence of severe malnutrition, based on a serum albumin level &lt;2.0.

          -  Elective osseous procedures to the study foot within 30 days prior to the Screening
             visit.

          -  Previous treatment with DermagraftÂ®.

          -  Presence in study ulcer of cellulitis, osteomyelitis or other clinical evidence of
