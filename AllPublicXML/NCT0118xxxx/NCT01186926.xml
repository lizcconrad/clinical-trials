    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and therapy settings of the
      HGNS System for stimulating the hypoglossal nerve to help maintain an open airway in subjects
      with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

    <description>The Apnex Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation (HGNS) System is an implanted medical device that is designed to prevent the tongue from blocking the airway during sleep. It is fully automatic and can be implanted during a simple surgical procedure. After it is implanted, the device is programmed to meet the unique needs of each patient. The device is on when the patient is sleeping, and off when the patient is awake.</description>
