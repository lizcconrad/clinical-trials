  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Earlier diagnoses and improved treatments have contributed to the growing cohort of cancer
      survivors. Nevertheless, these patients remain at risk for adverse long-term or late physical
      or psychosocial effects of cancer and its treatment. There is increasing recognition to
      improve information disclosure and cancer survivorship care. The American Institute of
      Medicine (IOM) and Health Council of the Netherlands both recommend that cancer survivors
      receive a summary of their course of treatment as a formal document, that also includes
      recommendations for subsequent cancer surveillance, management of late effects, and
      strategies for health promotion, the Survivorship Care Plan (SCP). However, no evidence
      exists concerning the positive and negative effects of the implementation of the SCP in daily
      clinical practice. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of SCP care in routine
      clinical practice on cancer survivors' satisfaction with information disclosure and care,
      quality of life, illness perception, and health care use.

    <description>The gynaecological oncologist (GO) provides care as usual. Currently, hospitals provide follow-up following the Dutch guidelines, meaning that they see their patients on given time points based on the number of years after diagnosis. Most hospitals give their patients leaflets regarding the diagnosis and treatment they receive, however none of them provide personalized information. All information is given during the initial treatment phase, but none of the GOs give additional information during follow-up. None of the GOs is actively screening on psychosocial needs. As this might change in time, we will ask the providers and patients about the type of information they provide, respectively, receive.</description>

    <description>After initial treatment, the GO provides the patient with a paper SCP and takes time to discuss all items in the SCP. Each time during follow-up meetings between patient and GO, the patient will receive an updated SCP if applicable. The paper SCP is extracted from the online registration system 'ROGY' (Registrationsystem Oncological GYnaecology) and combines personal patient and disease data with tailored information that is related to the specific situation of this patient. Recurrences, toxicities or additionally involved specialists will be registered in ROGY and automatically updated in the personal SCP.</description>
