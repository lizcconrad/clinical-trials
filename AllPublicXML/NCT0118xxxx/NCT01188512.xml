  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a new live
      attenuated vaccine against whooping-cough. It is a phase1, single centre, dose-escalating,
      placebo-controlled study on a genetically modified B. pertussis strain given as a single
      intranasal dose to healthy adult male volunteers.

      Effective vaccines are needed to protect young infants (from 0 to 6 months, today the most
      vulnerable age group), preferably after a single administration very early in life. The
      successful outcome of this project would constitute an important milestone towards nasal
      vaccination of infants, possibly at birth with a novel, single-dose pertussis vaccine. Our
      ultimate aim is to protect infants in the most vulnerable age group, before the regular
      vaccination schedule using already available vaccines is applied. The ultimate aim is thus
      not to replace current vaccination schedules with available vaccines, but to add a first
      nasal vaccination to protect very early in life.
