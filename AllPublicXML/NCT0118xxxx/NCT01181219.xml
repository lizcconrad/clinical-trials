    <textblock>
      Transepithelial CXL (performed without epithelial removal) seem to have similar clinical
      effect on keratoconic eyes compared to the standard CXL (which includes epithelial removal).
      The current study attempts to prove that hypothesis.

      A prospective, controlled, randomized, contralateral trial, will involve one eye of the
      patient to be treated with transepithelial CXL, while the control eye will be treated with
      the standard CXL. Totally 20 patients (age &gt;18 and &lt;40 years) referred by an ophthalmologist
      to the eye department of the University Hospital North Norway for CXL treatment of bilateral
      progressive keratoconus, will be recruited.

    <textblock>
      CXL appears to hinder the development of keratoconus by strengthening the cross-bindings in
      the corneal stroma with a resultant increase in corneal biomechanical strength of up to 300%.
      The method was introduced in the mid-nineties and has been approved for use in the EU
      countries since 2007. Standard treatment protocol, involving the removal of the corneal
      epithelium before the Riboflavin application, has been used. In order to avoid potential
      complications following removal of the epithelium (infection, delayed healing, scar
      formation, as well as discomfort and pain), a modified procedure where the epithelium is kept
      intact, so called transepithelial CXL, has been suggested. According to the preliminary
      results of the published retrospective studies, no significant difference in the clinical
      effect between the standard CXL with epithelial removal and the transepithelial CXL was
      found.
