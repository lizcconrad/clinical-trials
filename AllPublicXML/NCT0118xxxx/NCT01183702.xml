      The research will utilize LASIK and non-LASIK populations to analyze the biomechanical
      differences between these corneas. Subjects' corneas will be swelled with warmed, humidified
      nitrogen using modified diving goggles to assess structural changes due to a two hour
      swelling period. Subjects will be examined prior to swelling by a registered ophthalmologist
      to ensure that the cornea is healthy enough to undergo the swelling procedure. Pre-swelling
      and post-swelling data will be compared for parameters such as elasticity, density,
      thickness, axial and tangential curvature, hydration, and intraocular pressure in the
      central, paracentral, and peripheral regions. Analysis of pre-swelling and post-swelling data
      will allow for a better understanding of the structural changes created by LASIK. In
      addition, this project will allow for a better understanding of how common fluctuations in
      hydration levels affect normal corneal parameters as given by common devices in both
      populations to allow for corrections for more accurate measurements.
