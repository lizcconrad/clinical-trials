    <description>Part A: Nine patients will receive AT7519M as an intravenous infusion on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a three week cycle. The starting dose of AT7519M will be 21mg/m^2/dose and will be increased to 27mg/m^2/dose during subsequent cycles in the absence of AT7519M-related toxicities.
Part B: Amendment clarified there will be no further exploration of AT7519M as a monotherapy.
Part C: Amendment modified dose escalation to a conventional 3 + 3 design with a maximum total of 14 patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose.</description>
