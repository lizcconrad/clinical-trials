      This prospective, observational study will assess the effect of RoActemra/Actemra
      (tocilizumab) on fatigue in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have an
      inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS) or anti tumor necrosis
      factor (anti-TNF) drugs. Eligible patients receiving RoActemra/Actemra according to the
      standard of care will be followed for 4 months.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Clinically Significant Improvement in Fatigue After 4 Months of Tocilizumab Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue score assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. It is calculated with 13-item questionnaire on 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participants fatigue. For all questions (except for 2 negatively stated), the code is reversed and a new score is calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the participant's health status. Clinically relevant improvement is defined as a &gt;= 4-point change from Baseline.
This was performed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method and for participants who completed a FACIT-Fatigue score at Month 4 (completers).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (D0)</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA. The index includes swollen (range 0-28) and tender (range 0-28) joint counts, acute phase response (ESR in mm/h), and patient's global assessment of disease activity (measured on a 100-mm visual analog scale, where 0 is no disease activity and 100 is maximum disease activity). The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate worsening disease activity. VAS pain score calculated as 0 to 10 cm; where 0 = no pain, and 10 = worst possible pain. HAQ indicates how the disease affected participant's activities of daily life. It consisted of 20 questions in 8 domains (dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip; common daily activities) rated on a 4-point scale, 0=without any difficulty to 3=unable to do. Sum of scores was divided by number of domains with a score for a total possible score of 0 (best/no difficulties to perform activities) to 3 (worst/ unable to perform activities at all).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Clinically Significant Improvement in Fatigue After 4 Months of Tocilizumab Treatment</title>
        <description>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue score assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. It is calculated with 13-item questionnaire on 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The larger the participantâs response to the questions (exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participants fatigue. For all questions (except for 2 negatively stated), the code is reversed and a new score is calculated as 4 minus the participantâs response. The sum of all responses resulted a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the participantâs health status. Clinically relevant improvement is defined as a &gt;= 4-point change from Baseline.
This was performed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method and for participants who completed a FACIT-Fatigue score at Month 4 (completers).</description>

        <description>For tender joint count, a total of 68 joints were assessed. The presence of a tender joint was scored as 1 and absence as 0. Total score is calculated by adding the scores, which is ranging from 0 (best possible score or no tender joint) to 68 (worse possible score or all tender joints). Lower scores indicate no tender joint and higher scores indicate worsening tender joints.
For swollen joint count, a total of 66 joints were assessed. The presence of a tender joint was scored as 1 and absence as 0. Total score is calculated by adding the scores, which is ranging from 0 (best possible score or no swollen joint) to 66 (worse possible score or all swollen joints).

        <title>Baseline Disease Characteristic: DAS28, Patientâs Global Assessment, VAS Pain and HAQ Score as Rheumatoid Arthritis Assessment Parameters</title>
        <description>DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA. The index includes swollen (range 0-28) and tender (range 0-28) joint counts, acute phase response (ESR in mm/h), and patient's global assessment of disease activity (measured on a 100-mm visual analog scale, where 0 is no disease activity and 100 is maximum disease activity). The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate worsening disease activity. VAS pain score calculated as 0 to 10 cm; where 0 = no pain, and 10 = worst possible pain. HAQ indicates how the disease affected participantâs activities of daily life. It consisted of 20 questions in 8 domains (dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip; common daily activities) rated on a 4-point scale, 0=without any difficulty to 3=unable to do. Sum of scores was divided by number of domains with a score for a total possible score of 0 (best/no difficulties to perform activities) to 3 (worst/ unable to perform activities at all).</description>

        <description>High Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) was defined as (1) for participants aged up to 50 years: &gt; 15 mm/h for men and &gt; 20 mm/h for women, and (2) for participants aged over 50 years: &gt; 20 mm/h for men and &gt; 25 mm/h for women. Anemia was defined as plasma hemoglobin level &lt;12 gram per deciliter (g/dL) for women and &lt;13 g/dL for men. The CRP test is evaluated for an acute phase reactant of inflammation. A decrease in the level of CRP indicates reduction in inflammation and therefore improvement. Patient-Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) that is defined as the highest level of symptom beyond which participants consider themselves well. PASS is a 1-question assessment of how rheumatoid arthritis has affected participant in last 48 hours.</description>

        <title>Baseline Disease Characteristic: Mean FACIT-Fatigue Score and VAS Fatigue Score</title>
        <description>FACIT-fatigue score and VAS fatigue score were fatigue assessment parameters. FACIT-Fatigue score assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. It is calculated with 13-item questionnaire on 5-point scale, 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The larger the participantâs response to the questions (exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participants fatigue. For all questions (except for 2 negatively stated), the code is reversed and a new score is calculated as 4 minus the participantâs response. The sum of all responses results a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). VAS fatigue score ranges from 0 (symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) to 100 (worsening in symptoms and arthritis disease activity). Clinically relevant improvement is defined as &gt;/= 4-point change from Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Clinically Significant Improvement in Tender Joints and Swollen Joints as Predictive Factors After 4 Months of Tocilizumab Treatment</title>
        <description>Predictive factors were characteristics of participants that indicated greater or lesser likelihood of responding to a specific treatment regimen.
For tender joint count (TJC), a total of 68 joints were assessed. The presence of a tender joint was scored as 1 and absence as 0. Total score is calculated by adding the scores, which is ranging from 0 (best possible score or no tender joint) to 68 (worse possible score or all tender joints). Lower scores indicate no tender joint and higher scores indicate worsening tender joints.
For swollen joint count (SJC), a total of 66 joints were assessed. The presence of a tender joint was scored as 1 and absence as 0. Total score is calculated by adding the scores, which is ranging from 0 (best possible score or no swollen joint) to 66 (worse possible score or all swollen joints). Lower scores indicate no swollen joint and higher scores indicate worsening swollen joints.</description>

        <title>Correlation Between Relative Changes From Baseline of FACIT-Fatigue Score and VAS Fatigue to 4 Months of Tocilizumab Treatment</title>
        <description>Correlation between FACIT-Fatigue score and VAS fatigue was evaluated for all participants at inclusion and after 4 months of tocilizumab treatment (relative change from baseline) using a linear regression. FACIT-Fatigue score assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. It is calculated with 13-item questionnaire on 5-point scale, 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The larger the participantâs response to the questions (exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participants fatigue. For all questions (except for 2 negatively stated), the code is reversed and a new score is calculated as 4 minus the participantâs response. The sum of all responses results a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). VAS fatigue score ranging from 0 (symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) to 100 (worsening in symptoms and arthritis disease activity)</description>

For tender joint count, a total of 68 joints were assessed. The presence of a tender joint was scored as 1 and absence as 0. Total score is calculated by adding the scores, which is ranging from 0 (best possible score or no tender joint) to 68 (worse possible score or all tender joints). Lower scores indicate no tender joint and higher scores indicate worsening tender joints. For swollen joint count, a total of 66 joints were assessed. The presence of a tender joint was scored as 1 and absence as 0. Total score is calculated by adding the scores, which is ranging from 0 (best possible score or no swollen joint) to 66 (worse possible score or all swollen joints).

        <title>Correlations Between Fatigue and Other Participant Reported Outcomes at Day 0 and Month 4</title>
        <description>Fatigue was assessed by FACIT-Fatigue scale (ranging from 0 [worse score] to 52 [better score]) and VAS fatigue (ranging from 0 [symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms] to 100 [worsening of symptoms and arthritis disease activity]). Other participant reported outcomes (PROs) were VAS for pain and quality of sleep (ranging from 0 [symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms] to 100 [worsening in arthritis disease activity]), SF36 vitality score (ranging from 0 [worst] to 100 [best]) and HAD score (calculated using the 14 items and each item was scored 0, 1, 2 or 3 where a score of 3 corresponds to the most anxious/depressed. 7-item depression and 7-item anxiety subscales were summed; each resulting in a total score of 0-21). Correlation between fatigue as assessed by FACIT-Fatigue score or VAS fatigue was evaluated for all participants using a linear regression and were reported for D0 and M4.</description>
