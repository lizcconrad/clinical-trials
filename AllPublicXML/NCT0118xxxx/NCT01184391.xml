    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to investigate the bioequivalence of Mylan's divalproex
      sodium-delayed-release tablets 500 mg tablets to Abbott's Depakote® 500 mg tablets following
      a single, oral 500 mg (1 x 500 mg) dose administration under fasting conditions.

                       spontaneous amenorrhea for less than one (1) year with serum FSH levels &gt; 40
                       mIU/ml, or

                    -  bilateral oophorectomy with or without a hysterectomy and an absence of

                  (ex. 30.4 rounds down to 30, while 18.5 rounds up to 19)

          4. All subjects should be judged by the principal or sub-investigator physician listed on

          9. Normal or non-clinically significant 12-lead ECG

         10. Negative urine drug screen for all of the following compounds: amphetamines,
             barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoid, cocaine, methadone, opiates, and
             phencyclidine
