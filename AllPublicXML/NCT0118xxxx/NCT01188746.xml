      The purpose of this study is look at how treatments for ascites affect quality of life. Your
      quality of life is the ability for you to enjoy the normal things you do. Ascites (pronounced
      as-Ä«-tees) is the presence of extra fluid in the abdomen. Sometimes ascites is caused by
      cancer, also called malignancy.

      All people who participate in this study have ascites associated with cancer. Ascites can
      cause symptoms that make it difficult for the patient to do simple things. Patients with
      ascites often report:

      Abdominal swelling Difficulty walking. Difficulty breathing. Feeling full when eating.
      Clothes not fitting due to a swollen abdomen. Swelling in the legs. It is hoped that this
      catheter will relieve the symptoms of the ascites. The goal of the investigators study is to
      understand the quality of life before the procedure and after the procedure. Since the
      patient is having this procedure to make their symptoms better, the investigators want to
      hear from the patient of how the procedure has affected their quality of life.
