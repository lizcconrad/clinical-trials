  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newborn stroke is the leading cause of a common type of cerebral palsy (CP) that affects
      thousands of Canadian children and families. Treatments for CP are generally ineffective, and
      have traditionally focused on the weak body rather than the injured brain. Understanding how
      the newborn brain responds to injuries like stroke (plasticity) carries the greatest
      potential for better treatments. We propose to study the ability of two interventions to
      modulate brain plasticity toward better function in children with stroke-induced CP. One is a
      rehabilitation method called constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), the other is a type
      of non-invasive brain stimulation called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is safe
      and comfortable for children and we recently showed it could improve motor function in
      children with stroke.

      We will perform a special study to test both treatments simultaneously. Children 7-18 years
      with stroke-induced CP will be recruited into the study from across Alberta. Each child will
      randomly receive either TMS, CIMT, both, or neither each day for two weeks while attending
      our new HemiKids Power Camp for motor learning. Improvements will be measured by trained
      therapists over 1 year. TMS will also measure brain plasticity, both initially and following
      treatment. Our lead investigator is an expert in both newborn stroke and TMS and has
      assembled an experienced team of accomplished collaborators to ensure the completion of this
      important work. This will be the largest study of children with CP examined in this manner.
      This will be the first clinical trial of non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS) in CP, the
      largest trial of CIMT (and the first exclusive to newborn stroke), and the first study
      allowing the direct comparison of two different therapies. In establishing the first
      dedicated pediatric TMS laboratory in Canada, we will be the first to measure plasticity
      changes in newborn stroke, advancing new treatments of this previously untreatable and
      disabling disease.

      Patient recruitment is currently underway at Alberta Children's Hospital. Application is
      currently underway to expand recruitment to Northern Alberta through the Glenrose
      Rehabilitation Hospital and Stollery Children's Hospital, to enable patients from Northern
      Alberta greater opportunity to participate as subjects in this study.

    <textblock>
      Perinatal stroke is the leading cause of the most common term-born cerebral palsy: hemiplegic
      CP (HCP). With morbidity spanning all aspects of a child's life and lasting for decades,
      global impact is large. Mechanisms are poorly understood and prevention strategies remain
      elusive. Treatments are limited, leading to loss of hope in children and families that merits
      exploration of new interventions. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) may benefit but
      proper clinical trials are required. The investigators clinical-radiographic classifications
      have established perinatal stroke syndromes correlating with neurological outcome. Most
      common are: (1) arterial ischemic stroke of the middle cerebral artery (AIS-MCA) featuring
      cortical and subcortical damage acquired at birth and (2) periventricular venous infarction
      (PVI), a novel subcortical injury acquired in utero. These syndromes differ in the essential
      variables for plastic organization after perinatal injury: location and timing. In addition,
      recent animal and human studies suggest they may share a similar maladaptive plasticity
      whereby motor control of the weak side is &quot;installed&quot; in the non-lesioned hemisphere during
      development. Despite the ideal plasticity model such focal injury in a young brain provides,
      studies have been limited and suffer from small numbers of older patients with heterogeneous
      lesions. The value of studying plastic organization will be realized upon translation into
      meaningful patient benefits.

      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) offers non-invasive measurement of the
      neurophysiological brain properties underlying neuroplasticity. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) may
      modulate such systems with therapeutic effect. the investigators recently demonstrated the
      ability of rTMS to improve motor function in children with chronic stroke. Advances in
      perinatal brain injury and neurodevelopment are, for the first time, affording novel windows
      of opportunity for interventions to direct plastic organization toward better outcomes. Via
      the Alberta Perinatal Stroke Project (APSP), the investigators propose a clinical trial of
      two interventions to improve function in HCP while measuring the fundamental
      neurophysiological properties at play.

      Aim 1. Determine if rTMS and CIMT can improve motor function in HCP. Hypothesis: Two weeks of
      daily rTMS improves motor function at 30 days.

      Aim 2. Define the neurophysiology of motor organization in stroke‚Äêinduced HCP at baseline and
      following rTMS and CIMT.

      Hypothesis: rTMS and CIMT reduce excitability of the non-lesioned motor cortex.

      Population-based studies through the Alberta Perinatal Stroke Project (APSP) are establishing
      the largest perinatal stroke cohort to date. The investigators will complete a factorial 2 x
      2 randomized clinical trial to determine the ability of daily rTMS and CIMT to improve motor
      function in children with HCP. Families will attend a child-centered, custom-designed
      intensive motor learning rehabilitation program (KidsCan Power Camp) for 2 weeks. Outcomes
      include validated measures of motor function and CP quality of life. The investigators will
      simultaneously measure the neurophysiology of plastic organization using TMS including
      cortical excitability, interhemispheric inhibition, and short interval intracortical
      inhibition. Baseline measures will define organization patterns while post-interventional
      measurement will evaluate the neurophysiological effects of rTMS and CIMT. Four groups of 16
      children each (n=64) will be studied over 24 months with interim safety analysis after 10 and
      32 patients.

      Successful completion is assured by principle investigator experience in perinatal stroke and
      TMS and the collaborative support of world leaders in pediatric and adult stroke, TMS, basic
      neuroscience, and physiatry/rehabilitation. Understanding perinatal stroke plasticity and
      discovering methods to modulate it toward better outcomes carries a large impact, greatest
      for children with CP and their families.

    <intervention_name>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)</intervention_name>
    <description>TMS can affect discrete functional ares of motor cortex offering non-invasive, painless mapping and modulation of motor systems. Inhibitory rTMS (1Hz)has been shown to safely lower motor cortex excitability in normal patients as well as adult and pediatric stroke patients. Dose is 20 minutes per day (1200 stimulations) x 10 days administered over the non-lesioned M1.</description>

    <intervention_name>Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT)</intervention_name>
    <description>CIMT uses gentle restraint of the fully functional upper extremity to promote functional gains in the affected upper extremity. CIMT is well established to be safe and is likely effective in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy, many of whom have perinatal stroke as studied here. A custom-fitted, bivalved cast is applied and worn for &gt;90% of waking hours for the 2 weeks of active treatment according to protocol with daily assessments for comfort.</description>
