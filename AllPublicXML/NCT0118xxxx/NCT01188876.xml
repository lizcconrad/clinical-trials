  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pralatrexate is a type of antifolate drug which means is restrains the production of folic
      acid in the body. Folic acids are used by tumors to increase tumor cell growth and division.
      It is believed that reducing folic acid will hinder the rapid division of tumor cells, their
      growth and production. Carboplatin is an FDA approved chemotherapy drug for ovarian,
      fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer. Some antifolate drugs are used with other
      chemotherapy drugs to enhance cancer-fighting characteristics. It is believed that the study
      drug pralatrexate may improve the anti-tumor effect of carboplatin. In this research study we
      are looking for the highest dose of pralatrexate that can be given safely in combination with
      carboplatin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Since we are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered
           safely without severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who participates will
           receive the same dose of the study drug.

        -  Each study cycle will last 28 days. On Day 1, participants will receive carboplatin
           intravenously. On Days 1 and 15 of each cycle they will receive pralatrexate
           intravenously. Participants will also be asked to take folic acid orally on a daily
           basis starting 7 days before the first dose of pralatrexate and continuing until 30 days
           after the last dose of pralatrexate. They will also receive a vitamin B12 injection no
           more than 10 weeks prior to the first dose of pralatrexate and every 8-10 weeks after
           the first dose of pralatrexate.

        -  Participants will come to the clinic on Day 1 and 15 of each cycle and have the
           following tests/procedures performed: Medical history; Vital signs; Blood tests,
           assessment of the tumor (every two cycles) and an EKG (before the start of cycle 2).

        -  In addition, during Cycle 1, participants will come to the clinic weekly for blood
           tests.

        -  Pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples (to monitor how the body absorbs and breaks down the
           study drug) will be done at the following time points during Cycle 1: Day 1-3 and Day
           15-17.

        -  Participants will be asked to take the study drugs for up to 6 cycles. They may continue
           beyond 6 cycles as long as there is evidence that the tumor is not growing and they are
           not experiencing any unacceptable side effects.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose of Pralatrexate in combination with Carboplatin in this patient population. The unit is given in milligrams per square meter of body surface area. MTD was determined using a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation cohort, where 3 participants were enrolled on the starting dose of 30 mg/m2 and if no dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were experienced after a full cycle, 3 additional participants were enrolled at the next highest dose level. Each increase in dose level escalated the dose of Pralatrexate by 15 mg/m2. If during any dose level, 1 patient out of 3 develops a DLT, then 3 additional patients will be added to that dose level. If 2 out of the 3 patients placed on any dose level experience a DLT, the preceding dose is considered MTD. If 1/6 has a DLT, the next higher dose level will commence accrual (unless at level +5 and then accrual to the Phase I portion will stop). If ≥ 2 of 6 patients have a DLT, then the preceding dose will be considered MTD.</description>

        <title>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</title>
        <description>The maximum tolerated dose of Pralatrexate in combination with Carboplatin in this patient population. The unit is given in milligrams per square meter of body surface area. MTD was determined using a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation cohort, where 3 participants were enrolled on the starting dose of 30 mg/m2 and if no dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were experienced after a full cycle, 3 additional participants were enrolled at the next highest dose level. Each increase in dose level escalated the dose of Pralatrexate by 15 mg/m2. If during any dose level, 1 patient out of 3 develops a DLT, then 3 additional patients will be added to that dose level. If 2 out of the 3 patients placed on any dose level experience a DLT, the preceding dose is considered MTD. If 1/6 has a DLT, the next higher dose level will commence accrual (unless at level +5 and then accrual to the Phase I portion will stop). If ≥ 2 of 6 patients have a DLT, then the preceding dose will be considered MTD.</description>

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions

Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions</description>
