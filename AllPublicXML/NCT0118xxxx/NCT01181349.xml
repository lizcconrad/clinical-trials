  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, observational study in adult participants undergoing different types
      of elective surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia. During the first study period,
      there will be a cross-sectional evaluation of neuromuscular blockade level upon participant
      arrival at Post Anesthesia Care Units (PACUs). During the second study period, hospital
      discharge data from the participants will be collected. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the incidence of incomplete postoperative neuromuscular recovery from anesthesia at
      PACUs in Portuguese hospitals. This is a cross-sectional and retrospective study.

    <description>The incidence of incomplete postoperative neuromuscular recovery from general anesthesia was assessed in study participants upon arrival in the PACU, after their respective surgical procedures were completed. Neuromuscular functioning was assessed by applying repetitive TOF electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. The TOF ratio is the ratio of the magnitude of the fourth twitch to that of the first twitch, and a ratio &lt;0.9 indicates residual neuromuscular blockade (incomplete neuromuscular recovery).</description>
