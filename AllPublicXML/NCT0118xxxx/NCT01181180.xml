      Experimental design overview The proposed project is a prospective experimental RCT study
      design. Independent old adults(age 65 years old and older) who do not suffer from balance
      problems willing to participate in the study will be tested before and after water
      consumption to explore whether there are differences in balance control as a result of
      dehydration.

      Experimental design overview The proposed project is a prospective experimental study design.
      independent old adults(age 65 years old and older) who do not suffer from balance problems
      willing to participate in the study will be tested with well-established measuring techniques
      of Balance control before and 2 hours after mineral water consumption (1 liter) in the
      movement and Rehabilitation Laboratory at BGU. An automated algorithm will be used to extract
      standardized stabilogram-diffusion parameters from each of the COP data sets collected during
      quiet standing. These parameters include diffusion coefficients, critical displacement,
      critical time and scaling exponents for both lateral and anterior-posterior sway directions
      (Collins &amp; De Luca, 1993). For each of the conditions (before and 1 hour after the use of
      Ritalin) in three task conditions single task; dual task (concentrating and identifying
      specific music); and just Listening to a relaxing music. Participants will be required to
      stand on the platform 10 times for 30 s. For each trial, they will be instructed to sway as
      little as possible.
