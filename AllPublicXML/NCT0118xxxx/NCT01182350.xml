  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the overall survival of children and young
      adults with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma treated (DIPG) with a molecularly based
      treatment strategy, compared to historical controls.

      Four Biopsies of tumor tissue will be obtained by surgical biopsy prior to treatment
      stratification if tolerated. An MRI-guided frameless or frame-based stereotactic biopsy will
      be performed approaching the pontine termentum through a trans-cerebellar or trans-frontal
      route. The exact biopsy location will be determined by the treating neurosurgeon at the
      designated participating site with the goal of minimizing procedural risk.

      Following biopsy,all patients will receive local radiotherapy to consist of 59.4Gy delivered
      using conventional conformal or other standard treatment planning with adjuvant bevacizumab.
      Radiation planning can begin with the pre-operative images. Based upon molecular parameters
      after biopsy, patients will potentially receive erlotinib and/or temozolomide at the start of
      radiotherapy. Bevacizumab will be given concurrently with radiotherapy beginning at least
      three weeks from the biopsy and at least two weeks after the start of radiation therapy to
      ensure that primary wound healing has occurred. Once irradiation is complete, patients will
      have a four week interim period before beginning the maintenance phase. Adjuvant chemotherapy
      will be continued during the interim period.

      The maintenance phase (approxmiately 40 weeks) will last for 10 cycles(28 days +/- 3 days).
      Based upon molecular parameters as determined at the time of diagnostic biopsy, patients will
      continue to receive erlotinib and/or temozolomide along with bevacizumab during the
      maintenance phase.

      Stratification will be based on O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter
      methylation status and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in tumor biopsy
      samples. If MGMT status and/or EFGR status are not determinable, patients may be treated as
      per cohort #1(bevacizumab and irradiation) but will be analyzed separately.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must not have any significant medical illnesses that in the investigator's
             opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise
             the patient's ability to tolerate this therapy.

          2. Patients receiving any other anticancer or experimental drug therapy.

          3. Patients with disseminated intrinsic diffuse brainstem gliomas in either brain or
             spine (can be based on clinical evaluation).

             Cytochrome 1A2 (CYP1A2) are ineligible. Lists including medications and substances
             known or with the potential to interact with the CYP450 CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 isoenzymes
             are provided in Appendix I.

          5. Use of hematopoietic growth factors within the 2 weeks prior to initiation of therapy.

             surgery.

          7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          8. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bevacizumab, temozolomide and
             erlotinib can have potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there
             is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued.
