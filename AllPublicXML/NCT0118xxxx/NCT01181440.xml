    <textblock>
      This study randomly assigns patients with plantar diabetic foot ulcers to receive
      conventional therapy (debridement, infection control, saline-moistened gauze dressings, and
      standardized off-weighting) alone or conventional therapy plus Dermagraft(R). Dermagraft is a
      device containing live human fibroblasts grown on an absorbable polyglactin (Vicryl) mesh.
      Patients are evaluated weekly until Week 12, then every four weeks until Week 32.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is 18 years old or older.

          -  Patient has a current diagnosis of NIDDM or IDDM.

          -  Patient's ulcer is present for a minimum of two weeks under the current Investigator's
             care

          -  The study ulcer has healed &lt;50% in size during the two weeks leading up to
             randomization

          -  The study ulcer is on the plantar surface of the forefoot

          -  The ulcer is &gt;/= 1.0 cm2 at Day 0 (the day of randomization).

          -  The ulcer extends through the dermis and into subcutaneous tissue but without exposure
             of muscle, tendon, bone, or joint capsule.

          -  The ulcer is free of necrotic debris and clinical infection and is comprised of
             healthy, vascular tissue and is suitable for skin grafting.

          -  The patient's Ankle-Arn Index by Doppler is &gt;0.1

          -  There is adequate circulation to the foot to allow for healing.

          -  The patient's diabetes is under control as determined by the Investigator.

          -  Female patients capable of bearing children must test negative for pregnancy and must
             use an acceptable means of birth control.

          -  Patient and caregiver are willing to participate in the clinical study and can comply
             with the follow-up regimen.

          -  Patient or his/her legal representative has read and signed the Institutional Review
             Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent form.

          -  The ulcer has a nondiabetic etiology.

          -  The ulcer has tunnels or sinus tracts that cannot be completely debrided.

          -  The patient's diabetes is uncontrolled and could interfere with the completion of the
             study.

          -  There is a medical condition(s) that in the Investigator's opinion make the patient an
             inappropriate candidate for this study.

          -  Patient has/had a malignant disease not in remission for 5 years or more.

          -  Patient has acute or chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, has a serum albumin of &lt;2.0 gms/dL,
             or has alkaline phosphatase or LDH at twice the upper limit of the normal range.

          -  Patient is receiving oral or parenteral corticosteroids, immunosuppressive or
             cytotoxic agents, or is anticipated to require such agents during the course of the
             study.

          -  Patient has Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or is infected with Human
             Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

          -  Patient has participated in another study utilizing an investigational drug or device
             within the previous 30 days.

          -  The ulcer has cellulitis, osteomyelitis, or other clinical evidence of infection.

          -  Patient has any condition(s) which seriously compromises their ability to complete
             this study.
