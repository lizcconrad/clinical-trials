  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relapse remains a principle cause of treatment failure for patients with aggressive lymphoma
      after autologous transplantation. Non-myeloablative allogeneic transplantation allows
      patients to receive an infusion of donor cells in an attempt to induce a graft versus
      lymphoma effect. This study will assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the
      combination of autologous stem cell transplantation followed by non-myeloablative
      transplantation for patients with poor-risk aggressive lymphoma.

      This is a phase II clinical trial investigating the feasibility, and efficacy of sequential
      autologous stem cell transplant followed by non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant for
      patients with poor risk lymphoma. Patients will be enrolled onto the trial when eligible and
      undergo standard high-dose chemotherapy with the combination with busulfan, cyclophosphamide,
      and etoposide followed by autologous stem cell transplant. After recovery of counts and
      clinical status, patients will then proceed to non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell
      transplant using a fully matched related or unrelated donor.

    <description>All patients will receive conditioning with busulfan, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide (with mesna) and then will undergo autologous (auto) peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.
Patients will be re-evaluated after autologous transplant prior to proceeding to non-myeloablative allogeneic (allo) transplant. If eligible to proceed, allogenic transplantation will take place no earlier than 40 days and no later than 180 days after autologous stem cell transplantation.
Conditioning for the allogeneic transplant will consist of fludarabine and busulfan. Participants will receive tacrolimus and sirolimus as prophylaxis against graft versus host disease (GVHD).</description>

            <description>All patients will receive conditioning with busulfan, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide (with mesna) and then will undergo autologous (auto) peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.
Patients will be re-evaluated after autologous transplant prior to proceeding to non-myeloablative allogeneic (allo) transplant. If eligible to proceed, allogenic transplantation will take place no earlier than 40 days and no later than 180 days after autologous stem cell transplantation.
Conditioning for the allogeneic transplant will consist of fludarabine and busulfan. Participants will receive tacrolimus and sirolimus as prophylaxis against graft versus host disease (GVHD).</description>
