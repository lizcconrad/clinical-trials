  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's major aim is to investigate the ability of a commercial Electronic Nicotine
      Delivery Device (E-Cigarette) loaded with low dose nicotine to induce long-term smoking
      reduction/abstinence in smokers unwilling to quit. Secondary aims are to investigate changes
      in withdrawal symptoms and cravings and to examine whether concomitant use of the E-Cigarette
      and smoking is safe. The study will monitor smoking reduction/abstinence effects, changes in
      withdrawal symptoms, and adverse events of a currently marketed device in Italy (&quot;Categoria&quot;
      electronic cigarette) using initially for 6 weeks &quot;ORIGINAL&quot; 7.4 mg nicotine cartridges
      followed by a further 6 weeks of &quot;CATEGORIA&quot; 5.2 mg nicotine cartridges. The primary
      hypothesis is that the E-Cigarette used in a structured protocol is a safe device that allows
      smoking reduction or abstinence in smokers possibly by suppressing withdrawal symptoms and
      cravings.

      The electronic cigarette (E-Cigarette) is an electronic nicotine delivery systems designed
      for the purpose of nicotine delivery to the respiratory system where nor tobacco nor
      combustion are necessary for its operation. For these reasons, it is possible that this
      product may be safer than cigarettes. Marketing claims also include that they can be useful
      smoking cessation aids. Although E-Cigarette may produce lung delivery of nicotine similar to
      that of tobacco cigarettes and reproduces the gesture component associated with tobacco
      smoking, very little is known about the effect of E-Cigarette on the smoking habits of
      regular tobacco smokers. Therefore, we designed a prospective observational study consisting
      of 8 office-based visits (a baseline visit and a 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12-weeks and a final
      visit at 24-weeks) to monitor possible modifications in the smoking habits of a group of well
      characterized regular smokers experimenting the e-cigarette focusing on long-term smoking
      reduction/abstinence, changes in withdrawal symptoms/cravings and adverse events.
      Specifically, 100 smokers will be given &quot;Categoria&quot; electronic cigarette initially loaded
      with &quot;ORIGINAL&quot; 7.4 mg nicotine cartridges for 6 weeks followed by &quot;CATEGORIA&quot; 5.2 mg
      nicotine cartridges for a further 6 weeks. A final follow up visit will be carried out at 24
      weeks.
