      The primary objectives of the study are:

        -  To compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of RhuDex administered as two novel oral
           formulations

        -  To identify the lead formulation and optimise the pharmacokinetic profile by modifying
           the quantitative composition of that formulation

        -  Optional: To assess the intravenous pharmacokinetics of RhuDex following administration
           of an IV microtracer of [14C]RhuDex

    <description>All target PK evaluations will be made on the basis that the optimal plasma PK profile will be characterised by a plasma Cmax &lt; 5000 ng/mL, an elimination half-life of &gt; 8h and a C(last) (24h) of around 800-1000 ng/mL. Formulations will explicity not be selected based on determinations of Cmax or AUC(0-inf) alone</description>

    <description>Part 1:
Regimen A: Rhudex Formulation in Labrafac/ Gelucire Regimen B: Rhudex Formulation in Labrafac/ Aerosil single dose
The formulation platform (A or B) that shows the best potential to achieve the target PK profile and shows acceptable safety and tolerability will be progressed into part 2 of the study. The purpose of part 2 is to optimize the selected formulation platform. This will be achieved by administrating up to four different formulation compositions.</description>
