  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the safety of two strategies called &quot;cryoablation&quot; and
      &quot;immune therapy&quot; in women with curable early stage breast cancer. &quot;Cryoablation&quot; is a
      procedure performed by an expert doctor called a radiologist. The radiologist uses (magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) to insert a needle directly into a cancer. Very cold temperatures are
      then applied through the needle to kill the cancer cells. Some of the killed cancer cells
      will be broken into pieces that can be recognized by a person's immune system.

      The &quot;immune therapy&quot; in this study is a drug called ipilimumab. Normally the immune system
      makes &quot;T cells&quot; that can kill cancer cells when turned on. The cancer-killing T cell activity
      is controlled by a molecule called CTLA4. Ipilimumab works by turning off CTLA4. Turning off
      CTLA4 allows the cancer-fighting T cells to remain active Ipilimumab is an antibody drug has
      been made in a laboratory for patient use and was recently approved by the United States Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with a type of skin cancer called
      melanoma. An antibody is a normal protein that the immune system uses to find and kill germs
      like bacteria and viruses. This study is being done because the researchers believe that when
      cryoablation is combined with immune therapy, a person's immune system can be trained to
      recognize that person's cancer. This may prevent that cancer from coming back in the future.
      In other words, it is hoped that by adding cryoablation with ipilimumab before the
      mastectomy, the body will remain cancer free long after the mastectomy is performed. The
      first step in determining whether cryoablation and immune therapy can be used to cure breast
      cancer is to evaluate the safety of each strategy alone and then in combination in a small
      group of patients.

             insufficiency.

          -  Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases within 4

          -  Prior investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to first dose of ipilimumab;
