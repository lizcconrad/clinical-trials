  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) and Crohn's disease (CD) may present identically; the
      consequence of misdiagnosing and mistreating one disease for the other may be grave. CD is on
      the increase worldwide while TB re-emerges in areas of low TB endemicity. Current diagnostic
      guidelines evolve from research in areas with low TB prevalence, thereby being inappropriate
      in TB endemic regions. To date, no simple or non-invasive methods exist to diagnose ITB and
      to differentiate it from CD.

      One aims to devise a method for screening and differentiation of the two diseases. By using
      non-invasive rapid tests one wishes to make diagnostics available to resource poor settings.
      Ideally, referrals to invasive diagnostic procedures would decrease, thus liberating economic
      and staff resources. Furthermore, patients may avoid unnecessary, expensive and often
      inconclusive advanced procedures. Additionally, one aims to detect and survey multidrug
      resistance caused by empiric TB treatment, which in itself obscures ITB diagnosis.

      This case control study matches 50 ITB patients and 50 CD patients with 100 healthy controls
      in India, and 50 CD patients with 100 healthy controls in Norway. Comparative statistical
      analysis will be carried out. Challenges include patient adherence and sample handling.
      Non-TB gastrointestinal infections may confound the results and will be adjusted for.

      Recently published data suggests that the serum/faecal calprotectin ratio may be used to
      discriminate ITB from healthy subjects.
