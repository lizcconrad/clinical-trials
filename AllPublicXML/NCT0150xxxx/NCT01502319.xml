  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Consortium's overall mission can be summarized as follows; each function is developed
      with the goal of clear military relevance:

        1. Produce new scientific knowledge about suicidal behavior in the military that improves
           mental health outcomes for the investigators men and women in uniform.

        2. Use high quality research methods and analyses to address problems in policy and
           practice that have a direct impact on suicide-related and other mental health outcomes
           for military personnel.

        3. Disseminate Consortium knowledge, information, and findings through a variety of methods
           appropriate for decision makers, practitioners, and others who are accountable for
           ensuring the mental health of military personnel. This includes the rapid response
           function so that queries from decision makers and others to the Consortium are answered
           with speed and efficiency. Technical assistance and support for decision makers and
           others is an integral aspect of this Consortium function. This aspect of the Consortium
           will warehouse knowledge about suicidal behavior in general (e.g., from civilian and
           international sources as well as from military sources), so that military issues can be
           informed in a comprehensive manner.

        4. Train future leaders in military suicide research through experience within a
           multi-disciplinary setting for Ph.D. students and postdoctoral scholars interested in
           research questions on military suicide of both a basic and applied nature.

        Given the age range of active duty military, reservists, and veterans, it is expected that
        funded Study Principal Investigators will enroll subjects that are young adults (18 to 21
        years) to Senior Citizens (over 65 years).
