  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research that utilises single sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) have demonstrated functional improvements. However these improvements are usually
      short-lived, lasting less than one hour before the patient's performance returns to baseline.
      In these studies, tDCS is typically applied with the goal of adaptively enhancing functional
      activation of pathologically under-active tissue or suppressing pathologically over-active
      tissue. Interestingly, a small body of evidence is now emerging to indicate that tDCS can
      improve learning/memory functions in healthy controls. The goal of this study is to test if
      the application of tDCS could enhance learning and/or memory for physiotherapy
      rehabilitation, which may in turn lead to correspondingly greater motor improvement. Patients
      at a subacute stage (1 to 6 month post stroke) will attend for 10 consecutive daily sessions
      of tDCS.

      This research has important implications; previous studies suggest that such an approach has
      the potential to facilitate physical rehabilitation post-stroke and establish tDCS as a
      clinically viable rehabilitative tool. Recovery of motor skills may take many months to
      acquire and therefore strategies that have the potential to enhance acquisition of skill are
      of practical and scientific interest.
