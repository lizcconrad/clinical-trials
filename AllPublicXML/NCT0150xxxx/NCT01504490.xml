  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with advanced solid tumors. The purpose of this study is to test
      the safety and effectiveness of a new combination of drugs, CS-7017 and Bexarotene in
      patients with advanced cancer. CS-7017 and Bexarotene both have many effects on cancer cells,
      including stopping cancer cells from growing and dividing, and causing the cancer cells to
      die. CS-7017 and Bexarotene work on cancer cells in a similar manner and both drugs together
      may have an even greater effect against cancer cells, hopefully, increasing the killing of
      cancer cells.

      CS-7017 is an investigational or experimental anti-cancer agent that has not yet been
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in any type of cancer. Bexarotene
      is an anti-cancer agent that has been approved by the FDA for patients with a specific type
      of cancer, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

      This study will help find out what effects the combination of drugs, CS-7017 and Bexarotene,
      has on cancer. This research is being done because it is not known if CS-7017 is safe to be
      given with Bexarotene.
