      The objective of this study was to compare the rate and extent of absorption of Dr. Reddy's
      Laboratories Ltd., India, desloratadine ODT 5 mg and Schering Corporation, U.S.A.(ClarinexÂ® 5
      mg), desloratadine ODT 5 mg under fed conditions. The treatment phases were separated by a
      washout period of 14 days. 38 subjects were dosed and were enrolled in the study; 36 of these
      enrolled subjects completed the study.
