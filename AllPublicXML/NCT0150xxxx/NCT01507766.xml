  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As an important management of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), enteral nutrition (EN),
      especially early enteral nutrition (EEN) increases the blood flow of gut mucosa and
      stimulates the intestinal motility. Moreover, EEN maintains the gut integrity, prevents
      bacterial and endotoxin translocation and thereby theoretically reduces the incidence of
      infections. Therefore, EEN has the ability to reduce the infectious complications, length of
      hospital stay and mortality of patients with SAP.

      However, the role of EEN is considered to be influenced by intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH)
      in patients with SAP. The previous studies showed that gut was the most sensitive splanchnic
      organ to the increase of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). When IAH occurs, it reduces the
      blood flow of gut, and then results in the development of intestinal ischemia and edema. The
      hypoxia and hypoperfusion of intestine leads to the increase of permeability of the
      intestinal mucosal barrier, and then leads to bacterial translocation. Therefore, IAH could
      result in the gastrointestinal dysfunction. Nevertheless, the different impacts of specific
      IAP values on the tolerance of EEN have not been reported.

      Furthermore, the effects of early enteral feeding on the IAP in SAP also remain unknown. Due
      to the severe inflammatory response of SAP, could EEN increase the burden of bowel, cause
      expansion of intestinal cavity, thus increase IAP? However, there were rare literatures up to
      date reporting the association between EEN and IAH in patients with SAP. Therefore, the
      present study aimed to investigate the influence of specific IAP on the tolerance of early
      enteral feeding, as well as the effects of EEN on IAP in SAP patients. Moreover, the impacts
      of EEN on the disease severity and clinical outcome of SAP were also researched.
