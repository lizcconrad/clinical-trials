      The purpose of this study is to determine the absorption and excretion kinetics of
      bardoxolone methyl and to determine and characterize metabolites present in plasma, urine and
      feces in men following a single oral does or 20 mg of [14C]-bardoxolone methyl.

             sponge with spermicide; an intravaginal system (eg, NuvaRing); a diaphragm with
             spermicide;a cervical cap with spermicide; oral, implantable, transdermal, or

          -  Within a BMI range 19 to 31 kg/m2, inclusive;

          -  Willing and able to give written informed consent for study participation and provide
             consent for access to medical data according to appropriate local data protection
             legislation, allowing authorization to access medical records that describe events
             captured in the endpoints;

          -  Willing and able to cooperate with all aspects of the protocol;

          -  at least 1 regular bowel movement per day.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             device) within 30 days prior to study entry, or are currently participating in another
             trial of an investigational drug (or a medical device);

          -  Participated in a [14C]-study within the last 6 months prior to Check-in (Day -1) for
             this study. The total exposure from this and any previous study must be within the
             recommended levels considered safe (per 21 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 361.1
             2010), for example, less than 5,000 mrem/year whole body exposure;

          -  Exposure to significant radiation within 12 months prior to Check-in (Day -1);

          -  Any condition possibly affecting absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of
             drugs that may confound the analyses conducted in this study;

             study outcome;

          -  Evidence of hepatic or biliary dysfunction including elevation of total bilirubin,
             direct bilirubin, AST, ALT, GGT, lactate dehydrogenase, or alkaline phosphatase levels

             position;

          -  A pulse rate at rest in a sitting position of &lt; 45 bpm or &gt; 100 bpm;

             drug (whichever is longer);

          -  A positive history of drug abuse or positive results for screening test for drug(s) of
             abuse, ethanol, amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, benzodiazepines,
             cannabinoids, or urine cotinine (indicating active current smoking) at the Screening
