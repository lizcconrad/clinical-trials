  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, related to an abnormal
      expansion of CAG triplets in the huntingtin gene, characterized by motor, cognitive and
      behavioral abnormalities, without known effective symptomatic treatment and without known
      disease slowing strategy. The most severe neuropathological lesions observed in HD take place
      in the striatum, one brain area important in motor control and rich in cannabinoid receptors
      (CBR). CBR are subdivided in two classes: CB1R are located in neurons and play a role in
      neuronal function; CB2R in brain are located mostly in microglia and modulate
      neuroinflammation.

      CBR disappear early in the course of HD, before there is a massive drop out of cells in the
      striatum. Cannabinoid transmission is also an early event in brains of animal models of HD.
      In R6/2 mice, which carry large CAG expansions and develop an early and severe HD phenotype
      the suppression of the CB1R gene further accelerate the development of a severe clinical
      syndrome and the characteristic brain inclusions and abnormalities of synaptic density. R6/2
      treated mice treated with cannabinoids improve their clinical phenotype, their brain lesions,
      the synaptic density and the levels of BNDF, a neurotrophic factor which enhances survival
      and resistance of striatal neurons.

      Preliminary studies of cannabinoids in patients with HD have shown that these compounds are
      safe in these patients. Those studies, however, did not show efficacy because 1) they were
      underpowered from the statistical point of view, 2) were performed with isolated pure
      cannabinoids, instead of the more physiological stimulation with a mixture of compounds, and
      3) they did use insensitive clinical parameters instead of sensitive end points, such as
      pathogenically important biomarkers.

      The investigators propose a phase II trial with combination of cannabinoids with evaluation
      of safety, by the profile of adverse events, and efficacy, according to changes of important
      biomarkers
