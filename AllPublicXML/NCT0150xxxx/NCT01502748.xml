  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation will address the safety and feasibility of distal, intra-arterial sampling
      through endovascular access, in acute stroke patients. Levels of Magnesium will be measured
      in the region of infarct in patients who had been treated with intravenous Magnesium therapy
      following an acute stroke. This study attempts to address whether the traditional intravenous
      means of neuroprotectant administration achieves adequate concentration of the therapeutic
      agent in the area of diseased tissue.
