    <textblock>

      improving the mental health of abused Mainland Chinese immigrant women in a community in Hong
      Kong.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is one of the most common mental health sequelae of Intimate partner violence. Not
      only does depression have an adverse effect on abused women's health and well-being, it also
      reduces their capacity to cope with the abuse by limiting their ability to perform self-care,
      meet work requirement, maintain independence, establish relationships, and access social
      support. Previously, the ability of abused women to take care of themselves was found to be a
      protective factor for depression. In order to enhance abused women's self-care, advocacy
      interventions have been developed to help them make sense of the abusive situation, identify
      potential solutions, and achieve their goals. Also, immigration status was shown to be
      significantly associated with a higher level of depressive symptoms among the abused women.
      The findings are important as they point to the need for further research to develop and
      evaluate culturally congruent interventions to meet the needs of abused Mainland Chinese
      immigrant women in Hong Kong. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a
      purpose-built intervention to address the unmet needs of Mainland Chinese immigrant women
      survivors of Intimate partner violence and to assess its effect on the mental health of the
      women.
