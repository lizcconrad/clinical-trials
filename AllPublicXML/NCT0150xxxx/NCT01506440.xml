    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies cognitive assessments in patients with cancer undergoing
      chemotherapy. Questionnaires that measure cognitive changes during chemotherapy may help
      identify the side effects of chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of administering a cognitive assessment battery in a medical
      oncology clinic.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the variability of the various cognitive tests and to assess changes in
      cognitive performance based on the results of cognitive assessments obtained prior to
      chemotherapy and at 6 to 8 weeks and 12 to 16 weeks after the initiation of chemotherapy.

      II. To explore the association of cognitive performance with the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
      Group (ECOG) performance status as evaluated by the patient's oncology team.

      III. To assess the association between cognitive performance and the occurrence of a serious
      adverse event during chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete cognitive assessments, comprising Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised
      (HVLT-R), Trail Making Test Parts A &amp; B (TMT-A, TMT-B), Digit Symbol Coding Test (DSC),
      Category Fluency Test (Animals), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Digit Span Test
      (DST). Patients also complete the Beck Depression Inventory. Assessments are administered on
      day 1 of chemotherapy and at 6-8 weeks and 12-16 weeks after day 1 of chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed cancer

          -  Patients are candidates for systemic chemotherapy for their cancer diagnosis

          -  Life expectancy must be greater than 6 months

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had prior systemic chemotherapy in their lifetime

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  Patients may not be participating on any other study investigating cognitive function

          -  Patients who are non-English speaking are ineligible

          -  Patients with hematologic malignancies are ineligible

          -  Patients with primary central nervous system malignancies are ineligible
