  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most of gynecological office procedure such as endometrial sampling procedure,
      hysterosalpingography, hysteroscopy, insertion of contraceptive intrauterine device,
      difficult intrauterine insemination or embryo transfer procedures often require the
      application of a single tooth tenaculum to the cervix for steady the cervix, straighten the
      cervicouterine angle and provide countertraction. However, grasping the cervix with a
      tenaculum can be a painful experience for the patient.A randomized controlled trial was
      conducted to evaluate using of tenaculum on pain perception of the patients and the procedure
      performance of the surgeons in endometrial sampling procedure(ESP) with pipelle.

      One hundred fifteen patients included for assessing pain perception and procedure performance
      during endometrial with pipelle. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups as
      Group 1( with tenaculum) and Group 2 (without tenaculum).
