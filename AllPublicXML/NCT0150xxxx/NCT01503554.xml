  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an effort to improve care coordination and reduce hospital readmissions, Rush University
      Medical Center developed the Combined Social Worker and Pharmacist Program, which targets
      both the psychosocial and clinical risk factors that can lead to rehospitalization. This
      study will evaluate the impact of this program on 30-day same hospital readmission rates and
      total cost of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If a patient is enrolled in the Combined Social Worker and Pharmacist Program their care will
      differ from usual care in a number of different ways. First, while the patient is in the
      hospital, an interdisciplinary group of providers will round on the patient on a regular
      basis. This interdisciplinary team will be composed of an attending physician, clinical
      pharmacist, nurse, case manager, and social worker, who will all evaluate the patient's needs
      from a variety of perspectives to ensure that the patient is prepared for discharge and
      self-manage post-discharge. During the patient's hospital stay, a clinical pharmacist will
      also conduct a detailed medication reconciliation of home medications, assess
      medication-related risks, and provide relevant education to patients participating in the
      program. After the patient is discharged from Rush University Medical Center, a Master's
      prepared social worker will then contact the patient and conduct an assessment from a
      psychosocial perspective to identify any unmet needs. Lastly, a clinical pharmacist will be
      available to patients enrolled in the Combined Social Worker and Pharmacist Program, should
      they have any medication-related questions post-discharge.
