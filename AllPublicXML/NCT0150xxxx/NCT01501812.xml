      Learning includes the ability to generalize to new situations and respond to similar, yet not
      identical stimuli. In previous work, focused on stimulus generalization in healthy
      volunteers, tones that were negatively reinforced induce wider generalization curves than
      tones that were positively reinforced, and these in turn induce wider curves than neutral
      memory (Schechtman et al, 2010).

      The current study aimed to evaluate those patterns in different clinical disorders (including
      Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, MDD, Anxiety disorders (Panic and GAD) and PTSD, and healthy
      subjects that would be used as a control), with consideration whether those patterns are
      unique to any specific disorder or state.

      The generalization patterns evaluation would conduct twice though enable to compare the
      stability of those patterns during the course of the illness (i.e during remission compared
      to acute state).

      The basic paradigm based on conditioning of a tone (sound) with unpleasant noise, and
      extinction of that conditioning afterword. During the 60 minutes of evaluation, the
      capability to discriminate between the original tone and similar but not identical tones, and
      the tendency to categorize similar tones as identical to the original tone. A neutral tone
      without conditioning will be used as reference. The clinical diagnosis will conduct by a
      senior psychiatrist, and the state would be evaluated using standard questionnaires

    <description>During evaluation a conditioning of a tone (conditioning stimulus) and aversive sound (&quot;metal scratch&quot;) will conduct (another tone which will be un-conditioning stimulus for control). Generalization patterns will be evaluated, by measuring the differentiation capability between different tones (&quot;neutral&quot; and &quot;aversive&quot;) before and after the conditioning, and after extinction phase. The generalization will also be measured by the &quot;generalization curve&quot; that plotted from displaying tones, different from the original tones, and asked the subject whether the current tone is original or new</description>
