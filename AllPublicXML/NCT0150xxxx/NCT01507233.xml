  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the standard of care against EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome
      extended-release injectable suspension) to determine if total opioid consumption is reduced
      when using EXPAREL, therefore possibly reducing total hospitalization costs.

      This is a phase 4, prospective, sequential, open-label study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety, and health economic benefits of intraoperative local wound infiltration
      with EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome extended-release injectable suspension), compared with
      postsurgical administration of standardized intravenous (IV) morphine sulfate, for
      postsurgical analgesia in adult patients undergoing open colectomy with general anesthesia.
