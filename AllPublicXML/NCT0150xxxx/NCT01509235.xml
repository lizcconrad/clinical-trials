  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current study, we designed a cross-over, open label, randomized controlled clinical
      trial that aim to investigate the superiority of physical exercise coupled with self drainage
      to a chest physiotherapy in stable cystic fibrosis children. We hypothesized that CF children
      undergoing physical exercise coupled to self drainage will increase the amount of expectorate
      secretions compared to conventional CP course, while being more satisfied and without
      worsening their pulmonary function status.
