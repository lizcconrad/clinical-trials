      Study Hypothesis:

      This study is designed as an integral part of the development of new or improved features or
      components of the Bravo® pH Monitoring System and may serve verification and validation
      purposes The study population will include a group of healthy volunteers (Group A) and a
      group of symptomatic patients with known or suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease (Group
      B).

      Group A: Healthy volunteers will not undergo invasive procedure. These volunteers may be
      asked to carry the capsule and\or Bravo Recorder. These procedures will serve to evaluate
      different technical matters such as human interface, ergonomic aspects and communication
      performances of the system Group B: Symptomatic patients will undergo invasive procedure,
      including Bravo capsule delivery, positioning and attachment. Confirmation of capsule
      attachment may be done by endoscopically.

      These procedures will serve to evaluate overall system performance in actual clinical setup,
      for instance: Bravo Recorder performance including communication quality, human interface and
      similar, ergonomics of delivery device, pH Capsule performance, etc.

      Subjects from both study groups as well as physician may be asked to provide feedback on the
      procedure and/or document their activities during the procedure.

      Up to a total of 220 subjects will participate in this study. The study will include two
      separate population groups. Group A of up to 170 healthy volunteers and Group B of up to 50
      symptomatic patients with known or suspected gastro esophageal reflux disease.
