      The objective of this study was to determine if foot orthoses are effective in improving
      balance, pain and disability in elderly women with osteoporosis.

    <textblock>
      Aging has been associated with balance impairment. The use of foot orthoses has been shown to
      be a feasible strategy for improving postural control.The objective of this study was to
      determine if foot orthoses (with metatarsal pad and medial arch support) are effective as an
      adjuvant treatment to improve balance, foot pain and disability in elderly women with
      osteoporosis. Another purpose was to verify if social demographic and clinical factors such
      as age, race, education, marital status, age of menopause, use of drugs related to balance
      dysfunction, visual or hearing complaints, body mass index, previous fractures and number of
      falls may influence the results.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BBS is a balance assessment test that rates the ability of a subject to maintain balance while performing each of 14 movements required in everyday activities (transferring, standing unsupported, rising from a sitting to a standing position, tandem standing, turning 360° and single-leg standing). Scoring is based on an ordinal 5-point scale from 0 to 4. Total scores ranges from 0 to 56. The smaller value, the worse balance: from 0-20: a whell chair is needed: 20-41: needing walk assistence; 41-56 - independent walking.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed up and Go Test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG test is used to assess the dynamic balance of an individual. It measures the amount of time (recorded in seconds) it takes for the individual to rise from a standard arm chair, walk a distance of 3 meters and return to the initial position resting against the back of the chair.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to rate the pain in their feet on a scale from 0 to 10 (0: no pain, 10: extremely severe pain)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Manchester Foot and Pain Disability Index(MFPDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MFPDI is a test used to assess disability related to foot pain in elderly. It consists of 19 statements prefaced by the phrase &quot;Because of pain in my feet…&quot;, organized under three constructs: functional limitation (10 items), pain intensity (five items), and personal appearance (two items). For each statement, there are three possible answers: &quot;none of the time&quot; (score = 0), &quot;some days&quot; (score = 1), and &quot;most days/every day&quot; (score = 2). The final score is the sum of all the items and ranges from 0 to 38. The higher score, the greater disability.</description>

    <description>Forty-seven women in treatment in the outpatient clinic of the Rheumatology Division of State University of Campinas(UNICAMP) who met the inclusion criteria for this study (being female with osteoporosis and aged 60 or above) were assigned, at random, to wear ethyl-vinyl-acetate insoles with medial arch supports and metatarsal pads over a four-week period. Balance, using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) indexes; pain, using a numeric pain scale (NPS); and disability of the feet, using the Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Index (MFPDI), were assessed at baseline and after four weeks.</description>

        <description>The BBS is a balance assessment test that rates the ability of a subject to maintain balance while performing each of 14 movements required in everyday activities (transferring, standing unsupported, rising from a sitting to a standing position, tandem standing, turning 360° and single-leg standing). Scoring is based on an ordinal 5-point scale from 0 to 4. Total scores ranges from 0 to 56. The smaller value, the worse balance: from 0-20: a whell chair is needed: 20-41: needing walk assistence; 41-56 - independent walking.</description>

It consists of 19 statements prefaced by the phrase &quot;Because of pain in my feet…&quot;, organized under three constructs: functional limitation (10 items), pain intensity (five items), and personal appearance (two items). For each statement, there are three possible answers: &quot;none of the time&quot; (score = 0), &quot;some days&quot; (score = 1), and &quot;most days/every day&quot; (score = 2). The final score is the sum of all the items and ranges from 0 to 38. The higher score, the greater disability.</description>
