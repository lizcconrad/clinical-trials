  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioids are frequently prescribed for chronic low back pain (CLBP). Psychiatric illness, such
      as high levels of depression and anxiety symptoms, is a common co-occurrence in chronic pain
      patients (and is termed comorbid negative affect [NA]). The purpose of the study is to
      determine whether CLBP patients with either a high vs. a low or moderate degree of NA have
      different pain relief responses to oral opioids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The level of high, moderate or low NA was determined based on the participant's score on the
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS is a self-reported questionnaire that
      has 14 questions related to 2 domains: Anxiety subscale (7 questions) and Depression subscale
      (7 questions). Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0 (least amount of
      anxiety/depression) to 3 (greatest amount of anxiety/depression), with total score between 0
      and 21 for either anxiety or depression. Participants were assigned to high, moderate or low
      NA groups using the following HADS score criteria:

        -  High NA = HADS score ≥9 on each subscale

        -  Moderate NA = HADS score ≥6 to ≤8 on each subscale

        -  Low NA = HADS score ≤5 on each subscale

    <masking_description>During the first 2 weeks of treatment participants took short-acting morphine or oxycodone for 1 week and placebo for 1 week in random order. Participants and investigators were blinded during this period. The remainder of the study was conducted in an open-label design.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change in Average Daily Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated their average lower back pain over the past 24 hours using an 11-point scale (0=no pain to 10=worst possible pain) and recorded it in an electronic diary. The percent change in pain score from baseline is calculated using weekly averages for up to 20 weeks. Linear mixed modeling (LMM) analysis was used to allow for inclusion in the analysis of the majority of participants with any missing data. For the LMM model, group, group × week, average baseline pain, and opioid use at baseline (yes/no) were entered as fixed effects using an autoregressive covariance structure. Participant, intercept, and week were entered as random effects, using a compound symmetry covariance structure. A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Average Daily Pain Score</title>
        <description>Participants rated their average lower back pain over the past 24 hours using an 11-point scale (0=no pain to 10=worst possible pain) and recorded it in an electronic diary. The percent change in pain score from baseline is calculated using weekly averages for up to 20 weeks. Linear mixed modeling (LMM) analysis was used to allow for inclusion in the analysis of the majority of participants with any missing data. For the LMM model, group, group × week, average baseline pain, and opioid use at baseline (yes/no) were entered as fixed effects using an autoregressive covariance structure. Participant, intercept, and week were entered as random effects, using a compound symmetry covariance structure. A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>
