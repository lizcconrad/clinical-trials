    <description>The primary objective is to evaluate the technical feasibility and acute device deployment characteristics of the SJM PMVr Device.
Technical feasibility and deployment characteristics will be defined as:
The ability of the delivery system to access the mitral valve
The ability of the device to capture mitral valve (MV) leaflet tissue
Ability to plicate MV leaflet tissue
The clip is able to be deployed in MV leaflet tissue
The delivery system is able to be removed.</description>

    <measure>Quantification of SAEs reported that are unique to the investigational procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 6 weeks post-implantation</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective is to evaluate safety of the SJM PMVr device by summarizing SAEs unique to accessing the valve, placing the clip, and removing the delivery system.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has symptomatic or asymptomatic moderate (2+) or severe (3-4+) mitral
             regurgitation.

          -  Subject has an ejection fraction (EF) ≥ 30%.

          -  Subject is of legal age (≥18 years old).

          -  Subject is planned to undergo surgical repair or replacement of the mitral valve for
             symptomatic or asymptomatic posterior leaflet mitral prolapse.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject requires a complex mitral valve repair or has isolated anterior prolapse.

          -  Subject has mitral valve stenosis in which the annulus opening is &lt;10mm. Subject has
             valve disease other than mitral which requires surgical intervention.

          -  Subject requires a concomitant procedure.

          -  Subject has a pre-existing prosthetic valve in any position.

          -  Subject had stenting or PCI within 6 months before the planned procedure, or is
             anticipated to require stenting or PCI within 6 months post-procedure.

          -  Subject has calcification of the mitral leaflets or annulus which in the medical
             opinion of the surgical investigator would limit repair and /or implantation of the
             investigational device.

          -  Subject has renal insufficiency or is on chronic dialysis.

          -  Subject has had a cerebral vascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
             within the past 6 months.

          -  Subject has a history of endocarditis or has active endocarditis.

          -  Subject has a history of autoimmune disease.

          -  Subject has significant known carotid artery disease.

          -  Subject has an aorto-mitral angle of &lt;110 degrees.

          -  Subject has hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM's Disease).
