  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Depression Medication Choice decision
      aid is effective in involving patients with depression in making deliberate choices when
      considering medication treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the ability of decision aids to effectively translate a depression comparative
      effectiveness research (CER) review into practice, the investigators have developed a
      literacy-sensitive depression treatment decision aid, DEPRESSION MEDICATION CHOICE, which
      adapts the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)'s Effective Healthcare
      comparative effectiveness review and associated patient guide about antidepressant medicines
      to satisfy the needs of clinicians, patients, and other major stakeholders. The investigators
      will conduct a randomized study to estimate the effect of the decision aid on patient
      knowledge, patient involvement in decision making and decision-making quality, and on three
      and six-month measures of medication adherence and mental health, when compared with usual
      care.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Decision Making</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following each patient's index visit and before they leave the clinic on that day, typically within 10 minutes of completing the clinical encounter.</time_frame>
    <description>A modified Decisional Conflict Scale will be used to ascertain decisional quality and satisfaction with decision making. The OPTION scale will be used to assess patient involvement in decision-making by reviewing video recordings of primary care visits with inter-rater reliability. Satisfaction with decision making will be assessed also by using two specific questions that require patients to assess the extent to which they would want for themselves and recommend to others similar decision support like what they received during the visit.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge Transfer</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following each patient's index visit and before they leave the clinic on that day, typically within 10 minutes of completing the clinical encounter.</time_frame>
    <description>Questions have been crafted to assess knowledge about depression treatment contained in the decision aid. These questions use a response format &quot;true/false/unsure,&quot; and are to be answered with full access to the decision aids since they are not a test of recall, but of 'use of information.'</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reach and Fidelity of Use of Decision Aids</measure>
    <time_frame>At end of study (approximately 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Reach will be estimated by the proportion of the eligible patients who received the intervention of the entire eligible population allocated to its use. Fidelity will be determined using a checklist for each encounter to determine the proportion of visits in which more than &gt;80% of decision aid items were delivered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Adherence to Antidepressants</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months post-prescription</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will obtain pharmacy records to determine anti-depressant use, adherence, and persistence based on prescription refills.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Control</measure>
    <time_frame>At six months post index visit</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will assess patients at baseline, 3 and 6 months using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) to measure the extent to which their depressed symptoms changed over time.</description>

    <measure>Clinician Satisfaction with Decision Aids</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following each patient's index visit and before they leave the clinic on that day, typically within 10 minutes of completing the clinical encounter.</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will survey clinicians at the end of each index visit with a standardized clinician satisfaction questionnaire.</description>
