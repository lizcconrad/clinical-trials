  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical research study is made up of 2 groups and 2 phases. The goal of Phase 1 of this
      study is to learn the highest tolerated dose of the combination of cabazitaxel, carboplatin,
      and prednisone that can be given to patients with metastatic CRPC.

      The goal of Phase 2 of this study is to learn if adding cabazitaxel to the combination of
      carboplatin and prednisone affects how the disease is controlled in patients with metastatic
      CRPC.

      In both of these phases, the drug combinations will be compared to cabazitaxel alone. The
      safety of the drug combinations will be studied in both phases and groups.

      This is an investigational study. Cabazitaxel, carboplatin, and prednisone are FDA approved
      and commercially available. The use of these drugs in combination for the treatment of
      prostate cancer is investigational.

      Up to 178 patients will be enrolled in this study. Up to 178 will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment groups (depending on when you enroll).

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive cabazitaxel plus prednisone.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive cabazitaxel in combination with carboplatin plus
           prednisone.

      The first 9-18 participants will be assigned to Group 2 and enrolled in the Phase I portion
      of the study. If you are enrolled in the Phase I portion, the combination dose of carboplatin
      and cabazitaxel you receive will depend on when you joined this study. The first group of
      participants will receive the lowest combination dose level. Each new group will receive a
      higher combination dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.
      This will continue until the highest tolerable combination dose of carboplatin and
      cabazitaxel is found.

      Once the highest tolerable combination dose is found, all patients enrolled after that will
      be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to a study group in Phase 2. You will have an
      equal chance of being assigned to each group.

      Your study doctor will tell you which phase and group you are in, and the dose level of the
      drugs you will receive.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of prednisone.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will receive cabazitaxel by vein over about 60 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day study
      cycle. If you receive carboplatin, you will also receive it by vein, after your cabazitaxel
      dose, over about 60 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle. You will take prednisone tablets by mouth
      twice a day (morning and evening), on Day 1 of each cycle.

      About 30 minutes before you receive the study drug(s), you will be given drugs (for example,
      the drug filgrastim) to help prevent side effects. Your doctor will describe these drugs to
      you in more detail, including how they are given and any side effects you may expect.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of each cycle:

        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your weight and vital signs will be recorded.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have experienced and about any drugs
           you may be taking.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. These tests can
           be done up to 7 days before this visit.

      On 1 day between Days 7 and 10 of Cycle 1, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for
      routine tests. If the doctor thinks it is needed during any other cycle, this blood draw will
      be repeated.

      After every 2 cycles, you will have a bone scan and either a CT scan or MRI scan of your
      abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the disease. If the study doctor thinks it is
      needed, you will also have a chest CT scan. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will
      also have blood drawn (about 3 teaspoons) for routine testing.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive the study drug(s) for up to 10 total cycles. You will be taken off study if
      intolerable side effects occur, if you are unable to follow study directions, or if the
      disease gets worse.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-dosing and
      follow-up visits.

      End-of-Dosing Visit:

      After you are no longer receiving the study drug(s), you will have an end-of-dosing visit.
      The following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your weight and vital signs will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have experienced and about any drugs
           you may be taking.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have either a CT or MRI scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the
           status of the disease.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone scan to check the status of the
           disease.

      Long-term Follow-up:

      After the end-of-dosing visit, the study staff will call you or review your medical record.
      If contacted by phone, you will be asked about how you are feeling and any side effects you
      may have had. Each follow-up call will take about 5 minutes. Follow-up will take place every
      6 months after you stop taking the study drugs.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologic evidence of prostate adenocarcinoma.

          2. In addition to patients with adenocarcinoma, patients with &quot;anaplastic&quot; features are
             also eligible as defined by at least one of the following: a)Histologic evidence of
             small cell prostate cancer (patients with small cell carcinoma on histology are not
             required to demonstrate castration-resistant progression); b) Any of the following
             metastatic presentations: (i) exclusive visceral metastases; (ii) radiographically
             predominant lytic bone metastases identified by plain X-ray or CT scan; (iii) bulky
             (&gt;/=5 cm in longest dimension) lymphadenopathy (iv) Bulky (&gt;/=5cm) tumor mass in the
             prostate/pelvis (v) Low PSA (&lt;/= 10 ng/ml) at initial presentation (prior to androgen
             ablation or at symptomatic progression in the castrate-setting) plus high volume
             (&gt;/=20) bone metastases; (vi) Elevated serum LDH (&gt;/= 2 x ULN) or elevated serum CEA
             (&gt;/= 2 x ULN) in the absence of other etiologies; (vii) Short interval (&lt;/= 180 days)
             to castrate-resistant progression following initiation of hormonal therapy

          3. Castration-resistant prostate cancer. Patients must have surgical or ongoing chemical
             castration (with LHRH agonists or LHRH antagonists), with a baseline testosterone
             level &lt;50ng/dL

          4. Metastatic disease. Patients must have evidence for metastatic prostate cancer by bone
             scan and/or CT/MRI (i.e., soft tissue, visceral, lymph node). If lymph node, visceral
             and/or soft-tissue metastases are the only evidence of metastasis, at least one lesion
             must be &gt;/= 1.5 cm in diameter.

          5. Patients may have received prior treatment with androgen ablative therapies (such as
             bicalutamide, ketoconazole, DES, abiraterone, Xtandi, ARN-509) and/or &quot;targeted&quot;
             therapies (such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors). Androgen ablative therapies must be
             discontinued &gt;/=3 days prior to initiation of study treatment with the exception of
             abiraterone and/or enzalutamide, which may be continued during study treatment per the
             practice preference of the treating physician. Patients who are predicted to benefit
             from an antiandrogen withdrawal response should be tested for this possibility before
             being considered for eligibility to this study. Targeted therapies must be
             discontinued &gt;/= 2 weeks before initiation of study treatment.

          6. Both chemotherapy-naïve and patients previously treated with chemotherapy are
             eligible. Chemotherapy pretreated patients may have received a maximum of two prior
             systemic cytotoxic chemotherapies completed at least 3 weeks prior to initiation of
             study treatment.

          7. Patients must have documented evidence of progressive disease as defined by any of the
             following: a) PSA progression: minimum of 2 rising values (3 measurements) obtained a
             minimum of 7 days apart with the last result being at least &gt;/= 2.0 ng/mL; b) New or
             increasing non-bone disease (RECIST); c) Positive bone scan with 2 or more new lesions
             (PCWG2).

          8. For purposes of stratification, patients will be categorized as &quot;responders&quot; or
             &quot;non-responders&quot; based on their response to prior docetaxel-based therapy. a)
             Responders will have demonstrated objective responses to first-line docetaxel as
             determined by any of the following: 1.Decrease in PSA level &gt;/= 50% from baseline,
             maintained for &gt;/= 6 weeks 2. Partial or complete response in lymph nodes and soft
             tissue metastases by RECIST; Responders must have received &gt;/= 225mg/m^2 (~ 3 cycles)
             of docetaxel.

          9. #8 Continued) b) Patients not meeting response criteria above will be considered as
             non-responders. We anticipate 2 general categories of non-responders based on the
             following disease phenotypes: 1. Progressive disease on therapy without any objective
             evidence of response (&quot;primary-resistant disease&quot;) 2.Progressive disease on therapy
             with prior objective evidence of response, but response duration is &lt;/= 6 weeks
             (&quot;docetaxel refractory disease&quot;).; Non-responders are eligible even if they have
             received &lt;225mg/m^2 of docetaxel

         10. If present, peripheral neuropathy must be &lt;/= grade 2

         11. The following pretreatment laboratory data within 14 days before registration: a)
             Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;/= 1,500/ml (unless due to bone marrow infiltration
             by tumor in which case ANC &gt;/=500/ml are allowed) ; b) Platelets &gt;/= 100,000/ml
             (unless due to bone marrow infiltration by tumor in which case &gt;/=50,000/ml are
             allowed); c) Total bilirubin &lt;/= Upper Limit of Normal with the exception of isolated
             hyperbilirubinemia due to Gilbert's syndrome or if the patient has liver metastases
