  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Levetiracetam (LEV) used as
      monotherapy, with efficacy measured as 6-month seizure freedom at the last evaluated dose in
      the LEV 1000 mg/day to 2000 mg/day group, in newly or recently diagnosed epilepsy subjects.

    <description>Subjects in the LEV 1000 mg/day to 2000 mg/day group receive the initial dose of LEV 1000 mg/day for the 1- week Stabilization Period and enter the Evaluation Period. Unless a seizure occurs during the Evaluation Period, the subjects will continue LEV 1000 mg/day for 26 weeks. If a seizure occurs during the Evaluation Period, the dose will be increased to 2000 mg/day and a restart of stabilization on LEV 2000 mg/day for 1 week is required prior to restarting the 26-weeks Evaluation Period on LEV 2000 mg/day.
The LEV dose could be decreased as a fallback option at the investigator's discretion, if the subject did not tolerate the LEV dosage, as evidenced by the development of an AE. The fallback option was permitted to be performed once for subjects on LEV 2000 mg/day at any time during the restarted Stabilization Period (SP), restarted Evaluation Period (EP), or Maintenance Period (MP), as well as for subjects on LEV 3000 mg/day at any time during the SP, EP, or MP.</description>

They receive 1000 mg/day for 2 weeks and 2000 mg/day for 2 weeks during the Up-Titration Period and LEV 3000 mg/day for 1 week during the Stabilization Period.
The LEV dose could be decreased as a fallback option at the investigator's discretion, if the subject did not tolerate the LEV dosage, as evidenced by the development of an AE.

          -  Subject has a history or presence of known Pseudo-Seizures

          -  Subject has been treated for Epilepsy with any Antiepileptic Drug (AED) within the 6
             months prior to Visit 1. However, acute and sub-acute seizure treatments are accepted
             for a maximum use of 2 weeks, if the treatments are stopped for the week prior to
             Visit 1

          -  Subject has a known clinically significant acute or chronic illness, such as but not
             restricted to: cardiac, renal, hepatic dysfunction, endocrinological, or psychiatric
