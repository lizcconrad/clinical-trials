      <recruitment_details>Enrollment was conducted at 10 clinical sites in 8 countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, Chile, Colombia).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>30 unique participants enrolled for 41 surgical procedures, of which 1 participant discontinued before treatment with BAX326 but re-enrolled later for another surgical procedure.

          <title>Treatment With BAX326</title>
          <description>Recombinant Factor IX (FIX): Following a loading dose with BAX326, participants received BAX326 as a bolus infusion. The treatment regimen was determined by the intensity and duration of the hemostatic challenge and the institution's standard of care. The dose was tailored to raise FIX concentration to at least 80%-100% of normal for major surgeries and to at least 30%-60% of normal for minor surgeries. Note: Treatment with BAX326 refers to unique participants treated with BAX326 which is less than the number of participants treated with BAX326 as unique participants could undergo more than one surgical procedure in this study. 30 unique participants were treated with BAX326 for 40 planned surgical procedures; of these, 2 unique participants were treated with BAX326 but did not undergo 2 surgical procedures (1 surgery per unique participant), therefore 28 unique participants underwent 38 surgical procedures.</description>

        <description>AUC0-72h (area under the plasma concentration/time curve from time 0 to 72 hours) was computed using the linear trapezoidal method. The concentration at 72 hours was interpolated from the two nearest sampling time points or extrapolated using the last quantifiable concentration and the terminal rate constant λz. λz was estimated from the slope of natural log-linear fitting to latter quantifiable concentrations, with largest adjusted R2.</description>
