  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypotension is a recognized frequent complication of induction of anesthesia. The intent of
      this research is to determine the incidence of hypotension in patients receiving anesthetic
      induction with propofol. This investigation seeks to examine how normal clinical practice or
      a &quot;real world&quot; understanding of the usual response to propofol affects hemodynamics without
      isolating or standardizing other variables. The current research concerns hypotension in
      normal clinical practice where variability exists. This project aims to gather information
      and data in an attempt to form a foundation upon which each of the other variables affecting
      blood pressure may be subsequently assessed.

Blood pressure readings of Mean Arterial Pressure less than 65mmHg, Systolic Blood Pressure less than 80mmHg, or Diastolic Blood Pressure less than 40mmHg will be considered as hypotension.</description>
