  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substantial progress has been made in the treatment of cancer through the use of targeted
      therapies, but what works for one patient might not work for another patient. Certain drugs
      are now being developed that target specific molecules in the body that are believed to be
      part of the disease.

      Biomarkers are specific characteristics of the cancer that may help provide prognostic
      information (i.e. how well patients will be regardless of the treatments given) or help
      predict sensitivity or resistance to a specific treatment.

      The study will collect archival tumor samples (previously collected biopsy or surgical tumor
      samples) to provide biomarker data about a patient's cancer, in order to help their
      physicians to identify which clinical trials of molecularly targeted therapies may be most
      appropriate for the patient in the future.

      The increasing appreciation and identification of specific somatic mutations and other
      genetic aberrations that drive cancers leave us on the threshold of a new era of
      &quot;personalized cancer medicine&quot;, in which specific biomarkers will be used to direct targeted
      agents only to those patients deemed most likely to respond. The potential medical,
      scientific and economic benefits of such a personalized approach to cancer therapy are
      immense and self-evident. Yet despite some important advances, only a limited number of
      approved targeted agents have had their approvals predicated on specific biomarkers of
      sensitivity or resistance.

      The premises behind personalized cancer medicine include: i) genetic aberrations exist in
      human malignancies; ii) a subset of these aberrations, often present across multiple cancer
      types, have functional relevance as &quot;hallmarks&quot; or &quot;drivers&quot; for oncogenesis and tumor
      progression; iii) such genetic aberrations are potentially &quot;druggable&quot; targets; and iv) there
      are tolerable medicinal compounds that can effectively modulate such targets. A key
      requirement of this new, personalized approach to anti-cancer therapy is that specific
      patients must be matched to a particular drug or combination of drugs. Molecular profiling of
      tumors to identify somatic mutations and/or other genetic aberrations are examples of
      enrichment strategies to assist in matching patients to drugs or treatments that have gained
      increasing interest in the oncology community.

      The present protocol seeks to provide molecular profiling data to the treating physician for
      patients with advanced breast, non-small cell lung, colorectal, genitourinary,
      pancreatobiliary gastrointestinal, upper aerodigestive tract, gynecological, melanoma,
      unknown primary, and rare carcinomas, as well as patients who are phase I trial candidates,
      in order to help identify which standard regimens or clinical trials of molecularly targeted
      therapies may be most appropriate for the individual patient.
