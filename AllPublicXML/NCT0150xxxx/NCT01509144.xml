    <description>•Safety - Grade 3 or above adverse event. Any grade of adverse event that results in a clinical decision to discontinue further immunisations - Any grade of adverse event that occurs in a volunteer that has received at least one immunisation • Immunogenicity: Proportion of individuals mounting a serum IgG response to EN41-FPA2 at any time point up to 28 days after the final immunisation with 3 fold increase from pre-immunisation baseline sample taken at visit 2, week 0, priming #1. If no serum sample is available at this time point, serum taken at visit 1, screening may be substituted.&quot;</description>
