  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a personalized nutrition
      intervention on the dietary pattern of apparently healthy adults with one or more children
      aged 4 to 12 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Giving personalized nutrition advice is perceived to be more effective in changing dietary
      patterns than giving general information about healthy eating.

    <description>Dietary pattern will be measured by scoring several aspects of the diet. There are 10 aspets included in the score; fruit consumption, vegetable consumption, fiber intake, fatty acids intake, trans fatty acids intake, physical activity, consumption occasions, alcohol intake, fish consumption and sodium intake.
The range of the score is from 0 to 100. The score will be based on the information of a Food Frequency Questionnaire and two 24 hour dietary recalls.</description>

    <description>Blood values of carotenoids and fish fatty acids will be used to assess whether measured changes in dietary pattern are also found in the blood.
Urinary potassium and sodium ratios will also be used to assess changes in dietary pattern.</description>
