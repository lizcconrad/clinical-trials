    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of catumaxomab by determination of the
      rate of macroscopic complete remissions of peritoneal carcinomatosis after treatment with one
      cycle (four doses) of catumaxomab followed by six cycles of routine neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
