  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erlotinib is an orally available, reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR). Association of chemoresistance with the activity of certain tyrosine
      kinases (e.g. ErbB-1 and Src) has been described for pancreatic cancer and makes a strong
      case for combining gemcitabine with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In a phase III trial, the
      addition of erlotinib to gemcitabine improved survival compared with gemcitabine alone in
      advanced pancreatic cancer (MJ Moor et al). Also, gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin
      is superior to gemcitabine alone in terms of progression free survival and response rate in
      one phase III trial (Louvet et al). Taken together, combining erlotinib with gemcitabine and
      oxaliplatin may further improve the overall survival and clinical benefit of advanced
      pancreatic cancer.

      Open, uncontrolled, multicenter, phase II study

      This study will enroll previous chemo-naïve patients with locally advanced unresectable or
      metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Study regimen:

        -  Erlotinib 100 mg po qd daily AND

        -  Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m² with 150mL of normal saline intravenously infusion over 100min on
           Day 1

        -  Oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 with 500mL of 5DW intravenously a 2-hour infusion on D2 Every 2
           weeks

      Each two weeks is a cycle. If at end of 12 cycles response continues, will administer
      Gemcitabine and erlotinib until progression.
