  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of subretinal injections of
      UshStat in patients with Usher syndrome type 1B.

      To evaluate for possible biological activity of UshStat.

      Following screening procedures the gene transfer agent will be injected once only under one
      retina by an opthalmic surgeon under anesthesia. Patients will then have regular follow up
      visits where general health examinations, blood tests and ophthalmic examinations including
      best corrected visual acuity, slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure, fundoscopy,
      autofluorescence, Optical Coherence Tomography, perimetry and Electroretinogram will be
      undertaken.

      At the end of the study, the patient will be invited to enter in an open-label safety study
      and long-term follow-up visits (at least once every six months) including ophthalmological
      examinations and recording of adverse events will continue for 5 years; then the Investigator
      will follow the patient for a subsequent 10 years at a minimum interval of once a year to
      monitor delayed adverse events.
