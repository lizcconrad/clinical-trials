  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for patients with extreme obesity.
      Psychological interventions are not routinely offered in Bariatric Surgery Programs.
      Preliminary evidence suggests that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) might be effective in
      reducing binge eating and improving surgical outcomes. The current study will examine whether
      the addition of telephone-based CBT (Tele-CBT) to the usual standard of care is more
      effective than the usual standard of care alone, and whether it is more effective when
      delivered prior to or following bariatric surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary research suggests that CBT might be effective in reducing eating pathology and
      improving surgical outcomes.

      However, previous studies have examined group-based CBT delivered in person, and most
      patients cannot feasibly attend weekly therapy appointments at the hospital. Telephone-based
      CBT offers greater convenience because the service can be delivered during the evening and
      weekends, and eliminates the need to leave work and travel to hospital appointments. No
      published studies have examined the effectiveness or feasibility of telephone-based CBT for
      bariatric surgery patients. This study will examine the effectiveness of Tele-CBT as an
      adjunctive treatment to the usual standard of care in bariatric surgery patients.

The EES is a 25-item self-report measure that assesses the tendency to cope with negative affect by eating.</description>
