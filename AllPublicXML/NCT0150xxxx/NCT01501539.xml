  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the incidence of postoperative
      hypergranulation tissue formation after gastrostomy tube placement among children randomized
      to one of three treatments, in addition to measuring tube dislodgements and rates of resource
      utilization for complications.

    <textblock>
      Hypergranulation tissue is one of the major immediate complications of gastronomy tube
      placement. This study aims to determine if using a foam dressing upon placement will prevent
      its formation, as it has been demonstrated as an effective treatment in healing
      hypergranulation tissue formation post-operatively. Study participants will be randomized
      into one of three treatments after gastronomy tube placement (1) standard care, (2) plain
      foam treatment or (3) silver foam dressing. These treatments will be applied for 30 days
      post-operatively in addition to standard care of cleaning the gastronomy site daily with soap
      and water, if assigned to foam intervention. All study materials are free for duration of 30
      day intervention and participation will not interfere with routine post-operative care of
      gastronomy tube site. The total duration of trial will be 6 months and will not require
      additional study visits outside of routine care. The rate of G-tube dislodgements and
      associated outcomes will also be measured during the trial.

    <description>At the completion of the operative procedure for gastrostomy tube placement, the surgical incisions will be covered with dermabond, steristrips, and/or tegaderm dressings, according to the surgeons preference. The gastrostomy tube will have a thin layer of hydrocolloid dressing (HD) placed around the gastrostomy tube. The HD will be changed once every other day fo the first 30 days after gastrostomy tube placement. After 30 days, care will revert to standard care.</description>
