  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biogen Idec has developed a novel process to manufacture Interferon beta-1a (INFB), the
      active ingredient of Avonex®, that does not include fetal bovine serum (FBS). This
      bioequivalence study is being conducted to confirm the pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) comparability of Interferon beta-1a produced by the currently approved
      serum-containing process and Interferon beta-1a produced by the new serum-free manufacturing
      process.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide signed and dated

             accordance with national and local subject privacy regulations.

          2. Must be healthy males or females 18 to 45 years old, inclusive, at the time of
             informed consent.

          3. Must have a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 30.0 kg/ m2, inclusive, and a minimum
             body weight of 50.0 kg at Screening and Day-1 Baseline.

          4. Subjects of childbearing potential must practice effective contraception during the
             study and be willing and able to continue contraception for 30 days after their last
             dose of study treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          2. Positive test result at Screening for hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab) or current
             hepatitis B infection (defined as positive for hepatitis surface antigen [HBcAb] at
             Screening). Subjects with immunity to hepatitis B from either active vaccination
             (defined as negative HBsAg, positive hepatitis B surface anitbody [HBsAg], and
