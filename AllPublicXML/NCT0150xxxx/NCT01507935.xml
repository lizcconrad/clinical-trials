    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy term infants (gestational age 37 to 42 weeks) aged 2-2.5 months at inclusion

          -  Fully formula fed for at least one week (not applicable for the breastfeeding
             reference group since these infants must be exclusively breastfed before and
             throughout the study)

          -  Parents' or guardian's written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Being weaned before inclusion (introduction of any other foods other than formula or
             breast milk.)

          -  Moderate or severe acute malnutrition, defined as weight-for-age and sex below -2
             z-scores of the median WHO growth standards

          -  Disorders requiring a special diet (such as food intolerance or food allergy or
             complaints such as reflux, constipation and cramps)

          -  Significant congenital abnormality that could affect the study results

          -  Use of systemic antibiotics or anti-mycotic drugs in the 4 weeks preceding the study

          -  Investigator's uncertainty about the willingness or ability of the parents to comply
             with the protocol requirements

          -  Participation in any other studies involving investigational or marketed products
             concomitantly or within two weeks prior to entry into the study

          -  Gastroenteritis in the last two weeks before inclusion
