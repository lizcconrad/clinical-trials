  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if regular soft drinks (with sugar) have the same
      effect on thirst as diet soft drinks(with sweeteners).

      Participants should be in the laboratory at 8.00 in order to collect the values of weight,
      height, total body water, intracellular water and extracellular water in a Segmental Multi
      Frequency Body Composition Monitor (TANITA MC 180 MA®). Then, a blood sample will be
      collected for analysis of blood glucose and osmolality. They will sit at individual tables
      for the duration of the session and were allowed to read, listen to music with earphones, or
      use their portable computers with the exception of internet access to minimize visual cues
      (e.g., unwanted publicity for beverages or visiting Web sites showing pictures of food and
      drinks), which may have effect on thirst. Breakfast will be served at 9.30 on every occasion
      and preload stimuli will be offered exactly 60 minutes after breakfast (at 10.30). Lunch will
      be provided at 13.00. Motivational ratings will be first obtained at the end of collection of
      blood sample (baseline or time 0) and every 30 minutes thereafter until the lunch time (times
      1 through 7). After lunch (time 8), participants will complete the last set of ratings and
      will bring a food diary to record all food and fluid intake until 00.00 that day.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate their hunger, thirst, nausea, mouth dryness, desire to eat, desire to drink using nine point category scales. The unipolar adjective scales were anchored at each end with labels: 1 = not at all and 9 = extremely. Participants also rated their liking for the beverage along nine point hedonic preference scales where 1 = dislike extremely and 9 = like extremely</description>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>After lunch, participants will bring a food diary to record all food and fluid intake until 00.00 that day. Then, we will analyse total calories ingested, total fluid ingested and the volume of sugar and sugary beverages ingested.</description>

    <description>The participants will drink Water (control group), Decarbonized Pineapple Soda (11% sugar)and Decarbonized Pineapple Diet Soda (1% Sugar and Sucralose). The beverages will be presented chilled but without ice in 500 ml portions in opaque plastic containers and participants will be asked to consume the entire amount within 15 min. The beverages will be tested previously in laboratory in order to obtain their pH and osmolality.</description>
