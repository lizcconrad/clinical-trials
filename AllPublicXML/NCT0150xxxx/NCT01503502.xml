      It is an open-label, randomized, multi-center study. The efficacy and safety of two
      flumatinib doses, 400 mg once daily and 600 mg once daily, will be compared with imatinib 400
      mg once daily in newly diagnosed (within 6 months) patients with Philadelphia
      chromosome-positive (Ph+) Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in the chronic phase (CML-CP).

      It is an open-label, randomized, multi-center study in comparison of Gleevec and flumatinib
      in newly diagnosed (within 6 months) CML patients who are Philadelphia chromosome-positive.
      One hundred and fifty adult patients will be randomized in 1:1:1 ratio. The planned doses are
      as follows: 400 mg QD (50 patients) of flumatinib, 600 mg QD (50 patients) of flumatinib, and
      400 mg QD (50 patients) of imatinib. Flumatinib will be dosed, based on the food effect
      results, in fasting condition. Imatinib will be dosed with food per the package insert. The
      study consists of 2 phases: 6 months of core phase and 6 months of extension phase.
