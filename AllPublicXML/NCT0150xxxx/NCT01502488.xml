      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions:

        1. Is the proposed treatment safe

        2. Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with Autism.

      This will be an open-label, non-randomized multi-center patient sponsored study of ASC
      implantation after liposuction using an IV delivery system. ASCs will be derived from the
      patient's adipose-derived tissue. Liposuction using local anesthesia and syringe collection
      will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen for subsequent processing to isolate
      the stem cells. The cells will be delivered intravenously.

          -  Total score of CARS ≥ 30.

          -  Parents or legal guardian willing to sign the ICF.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of prior or current DSM-IV psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar
             disorder, other psychosis), Pervasive Developmental Disorder not otherwise specified
             (PDD NOS), Asperger's, or Rett's.

          -  History of Epileptic seizure activity in the past 6 months.

          -  Autism caused by seizure disorders (active), cerebrovascular disease or brain trauma.

          -  The global autism ratings are assessed as being absent, minimal or mild.

          -  Existing moderate or severe extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) or history of tardive
             dyskinesia.

          -  Active infectious disease and/or known to have tested positive for HIV, HTLV, HBV,
             HCV, CMV (IgM &gt; IgG) and/or syphilis will have expert consultation to determine
             eligibility based on the patient's infectious status

          -  Enrollment in other trials in the last 3 months without agreement to discontinue them.

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 6 months due to concomitant illnesses.

          -  Any illness which, in the Investigator's judgment, will interfere with the patient's
             ability to comply with the protocol, compromise patient safety, or interfere with the
             interpretation of the study results

          -  Patients on chronic immunosuppressive transplant therapy

          -  Active clinical infection within one week of enrollment.

          -  Known drug or alcohol dependence or any other factors which will interfere with the
             study conduct or interpretation of the results or who in the opinion of the
             investigator are not suitable to participate.

          -  History of cancer

          -  Parental unwillingness and/or not able to give written informed consent.
