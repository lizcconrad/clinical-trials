      SURVEY OF THE FIELD Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valve disease and increasing due
      to a growing elderly population. The therapy is aortic valve replacement (AVR). Studies on
      postoperative rehabilitation of AS pts are scarce. In the few studies available, a mix of
      valve diseases is presented without considering the differences in pathophysiology and the
      training regimes are not clearly described.

      PURPOSE, AIMS &amp; HYPOTHESIS The investigators purpose is to evaluate whether a supervised
      cardiac rehabilitation program improves the objective physical capacity and quality of life
      (QoL) of patients after AVR due to AS, and compare this to patients training by their own.
      The investigators hypothesize that supervised exercise training may be a more efficient way
      of rehabilitating these patients.

      DESIGN This is a controlled randomized clinical trial comparing 12 weeks of supervised
      exercise training 3 times per week to home-based training based upon public health
      recommendations of minimum level of physical activity.

      SIGNIFICANCE &amp; IMPLEMENTATION Positive results would support that an organized program of
      exercise training improves physical capacity and QoL in AS patients following AVR with
      potential benefit for both patients and society.
