      The study will test whether the Proteus Sustained Behavior Change (SBC) System will help Type
      2 diabetics feel more able to perform self-care activities, feel less distressed about
      diabetes, and reduce mean fasting blood glucose levels. The SBC system uses ingestible and
      wearable sensing devices and mobile phones to reinforce positive behaviors around medication
      usage, exercise and rest.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Self-reported diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus within the past 2-12 months

          -  Hemoglobin A1c ≥7.5 and ≤11, obtained with the point-of-care HbA1c diagnostic device
             during the enrollment visit

          -  Self-reported current use of metformin for Type 2 diabetes

          -  Male or female ≥ 18

          -  Outpatient

          -  Self-reported capacity to perform &quot;moderate&quot; exercise, as specified by in the 2010
             joint American College of Sports Medicine/American Diabetes Association guidelines

          -  Designation of one caregiver to be involved in the study for its entire duration. A
             caregiver can be a relative, friend, or trained or untrained hired individual.

          -  Self-reported mobile phone reception at home and/or at work

          -  Willingness to adhere to study procedures, including troubleshooting of the Raisin
             System by a third-party if needed. The third party will be blinded to any personal
             subject identifiers.

          -  Capacity to read and speak English proficiently, as judged by the investigator during
             the screening interview

          -  Capacity to understand the instructions for the study, as judged by the investigator
             during the screening interview

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Self-reported treatment with metformin for less than 2 months at the time of screening

          -  Self-reported adverse reaction to metformin (e.g., ongoing nausea, vomiting, bloating,
             diarrhea) or to other concomitant medications being administered at the time of
             screening

          -  Self-reported use of injectable hypoglycemic agents, such as insulin, exenatide,
             liraglutide or pramlintide

          -  Physical or medical condition that could prevent safe participation in moderate levels
             of physical activity, as surveyed by the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire
             (PAR-Q) and interpreted by the investigator

          -  Inability to use a mobile phone (e.g., to find icons or to open and to read a SMS), or
             inability to operate the approved glucometer that will be provided for use in the
             study

          -  Self-reported current (i.e., in the last 12 months) alcohol or drug abuse (including,
             but not limited, to use of marijuana)

          -  Positive urine pregnancy test for women

          -  Women of child bearing potential who are not using a medically accepted means of
             contraception. Accepted means of contraception include oral contraceptive or implant,
             condom, diaphragm, spermicide, intrauterine device, tubal ligation, or partner with
             vasectomy

          -  Self-reported history of myocardial infarction within past 60 days

          -  Self-reported history of cerebral vascular accident within past 60 days

          -  Self-reported history of skin sensitivity to adhesive medical tape or metals

          -  Self-reported history of acute or chronic dermatitis, excluding atopic dermatitis

          -  Self-reported allergies that could preclude safe participation in the study

          -  Current participation in another clinical study, or participation in a clinical study
             in the past 30 days during which an investigational device or drug was used

          -  Any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, would preclude the subject's being
             able to meet all of the protocol requirements, or would compromise the subject's
             safety during participation in the study

          -  Presence of cognitive impairment, as judged by the investigator during the screening
             interview

          -  Inability to provide informed consent for any reason
