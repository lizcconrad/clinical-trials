  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) affects around 17 % of female population. However, the
      etiology of OAB was complicated and unclear in many aspects. In particular, the research
      about psychiatric aspect of etiology in OAB was paucity. Besides, research about prognostic
      factors and impact of cardiovascular system of OAB treatment was also paucity. Therefore the
      aims of the investigators study were (1) to analyze the etiology of OAB in psychiatric
      aspects; (2) to analyze the prognostic factors associated with tolterodine treatment; (3) to
      analyze the differences of cardiac conduction and heart rate variability before and after
      tolterodine treatment; (4) to analyze the differences of arterial stiffness between non-OAB
      and OAB female patients, and before and after tolterodine treatment.
