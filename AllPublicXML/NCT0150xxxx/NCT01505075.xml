    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of a short course of
      radiotherapy (40Gy/5 fractions/29 days) for the treatment of high risk prostate cancer
      currently being managed with primary androgen deprivation therapy (PADT).

      Primary Endpoints:

        -  Acute gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) Common Terminology Criteria for
           Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 toxicities

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  Late GI and GU Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) toxicities

        -  Biochemical disease-free survival

        -  Biopsy positive rate at 3 years

        -  Quality of life using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire

        -  Develop a biobank of DNA and serum extracted from blood and urine to analyze and develop
           new biomarkers for prostate cancer progression or susceptibility to severe toxicity

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  informed consent obtained

          -  men &gt; 18 years

          -  histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma (centrally reviewed)

          -  high risk prostate cancer, defined as at least one of: clinical stage T3, or gleason
             score 8-10, or PSA &gt; 20ng/mL

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  prior pelvic radiotherapy

          -  anticoagulation medication (if unsafe to discontinue for gold seed insertion)

          -  diagnosis of bleeding diathesis

          -  pelvic girth &gt; 40cm (to ensure visibility of gold seeds on electronic portal imaging)

          -  large prostate (&gt; 90cm3) on imaging

          -  severe lower urinary tract symptoms (International Prostate Symptom Score &gt;19 or
             nocturia &gt; 3)

          -  No evidence of castrate resistance (defined as PSA &lt; 3ng/mL while testosterone is &lt;
             0.7nmol/L). Patients could have been on combined androgen blockade but are excluded if
             this was started due to PSA progression
