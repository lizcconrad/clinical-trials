  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemoradiation (ChRT) is a standard care for unresectable stage III non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with good performance status, and cisplatin/etoposide (EP)
      regimen is one of the most commonly used regimens. However, the prognosis of these patients
      is still rather poor. It has been demonstrated that Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 plays an important
      role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Selective (COX)-2 inhibitors can promote
      chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity of tumor cells in preclinical trials.

      This is a single-institution, open-label, randomized phase II trial of celecoxib administered
      concurrently with cisplatin, etoposide, and radiation therapy in patients with locally
      advanced NSCLC, to determine the feasibility, activity, and toxicity of this combination on
      unresectable NSCLC, and further to examine biomarkers to predict response to the treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Celecoxib is a non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDS) Recent studies have shown that
      celecoxib has antitumor activity, and may increase the tumor sensitivity to radiation.
      Furthermore, evidence has shown the safety and efficiency of celecoxib in some phase I/II
      studies. The purposes of this study are to examine the effects of a new combination of
      celecoxib (Celebrex®) and cisplatin/etoposide (EP regimen), with concurrent thoracic
      radiotherapy on unresectable stage III NSCLC patients; and to examine biomarkers to predict
      response to the treatment. Because of poor survival of patients with unresected locally
      advanced NSCLC, the efficiency of celecoxib plus concurrent EP chemoradiotherapy need to be
      further investigated.
