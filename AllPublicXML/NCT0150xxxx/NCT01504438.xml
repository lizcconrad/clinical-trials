    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study to prospectively compare and evaluate the functional outcome and
      patient satisfaction of total ankle replacements for tibio-talar osteoarthritis using either
      the STAR or Salto-Talaris prothesis.

    <measure>To measure a change in one's pain following a Total Ankle Replacement using the Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS)across multiple time points.</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively, 6months, 1yr, 2yr, 3yr, 4 yr, and 5 yr</time_frame>
    <description>To assess changes in pain across time following total ankle replacement. A visual analog scale of pain is an instrument used to measure the amount of pain a patient feels.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To measure a change in one's functional health following a Total Ankle Replacement using Short Form Health Survey at multiple time points.</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively, 6months, 1yr, 2yr, 3yr, 4 yr, and 5 yr</time_frame>
    <description>To assess functional health and well being across time following total ankle replacement and to determine if there is a significant difference between the STAR and Salto-Talaris</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To measure a change in one's physical limitations following a Total Ankle Replacement using the short musculoskeletal function assessment (SMFA)questionnaire at multiple time points.</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively, 6months, 1yr, 2yr, 3yr, 4 yr, and 5 yr</time_frame>
    <description>SMFA is an outcome measure to provide a standardized measure of the actual physical limitations of the patient.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To measure a change in one's pain and function following a Total Ankle Replacement using the AOFAS Hindfoot Scale questionnaires at multiple time points.</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively, 6months, 1yr, 2yr, 3yr, 4 yr, and 5 yr</time_frame>
    <description>The AOFAS combines subjective scores of pain and function provided by the patient with objective scores based on the surgeon's physical examination of the patient.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To measure a change in one's daily activity following a Total Ankle Replacement using the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) at multiple time points.</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively, 6months, 1yr, 2yr, 3yr, 4 yr, and 5 yr</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported function outcomes during activities of daily living.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Three dimensional kinematic and kinetic assessment during level walking across time following total ankle replacement.</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively, 6months, 1yr, 2yr, 3yr, 4 yr, and 5 yr</time_frame>
    <description>In order to understand the effect of the ankle replacement on lower extremity kinematics and kinetics, each subject will be asked to complete a series of functional tasks and level walking trials at each of the study timepoints.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (age &gt; 18 years) who will benefit from a total ankle replacement, as
             determined by Drs. Nunley, DeOrio, or Easley, with the aid of the physical exam and
             routine radiography treated at Duke University Medical Center and who have no medical
             conditions that would represent contraindications to surgery or anesthesia will be
             asked to participate in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The only excluded patients will be those who do not choose to participate in this
             study, have a weight greater than 250lbs, or do not meet the minimum age of 18 years.
