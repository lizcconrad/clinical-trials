  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multi-center, observational study will assess the safety and efficacy of
      Avastin (bevacizumab) in daily practice in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who
      have received no previous treatment for advanced disease and are receiving Avastin in
      combination with a standard of care first-line chemotherapy regimen. Data will be collected
      for 1.5 years or until death.

    <time_frame>1.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires new in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment or requires intervention to prevent one or other of these outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Grade 3-5 Avastin Related Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>1.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution. Adverse events were graded according to NCI-CTCAE, v4.0 (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0).</description>

Based on population surveys, an algorithm was used to combine the responses to each of these 5 measures into 1 single EQ-5D weighted index score ranging from -0.59 (extreme problems) to +1 (no problems) where a negative value indicated a worsening of perceived quality of life and a positive value indicated an improvement of perceived quality of life.</description>
