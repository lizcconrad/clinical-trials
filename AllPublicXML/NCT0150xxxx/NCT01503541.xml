      RATIONALE: Studying samples of bone marrow and blood from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in samples from patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia treated with standard chemotherapy with or without gemtuzumab ozogamicin.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine whether measuring biomarkers in less-differentiated acute myeloid leukemia
           (AML) blasts significantly improves their predictive accuracy to predict clinical
           outcomes for patients receiving induction/consolidation chemotherapy with and without
           gemtuzumab ozogamicin.

        -  To develop and validate novel predictive biomarker models for predicting clinical
           outcomes for AML patients receiving induction/consolidation chemotherapy with and
           without gemtuzumab ozogamicin.

      OUTLINE: DNA and RNA extracted from archived bone marrow and peripheral blood samples are
      analyzed for genomic mutations (CEBPA, FLT3, IDH1/2, KIT, NPM1, RUNX1, TP53, and WT1) and
      transcriptional biomarkers (BAALC, CCNA1, CD34, CEBPA, ERG, EVI1, FLT3, IL3RA, MCL1 [two
      splice variants], MN1, RUNX1, and WT1) by PCR and real-time PCR. Data are then analyzed by
      the Gene Scan software.
