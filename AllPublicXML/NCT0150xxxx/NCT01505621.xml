    <textblock>
      Accumulation of damaged proteins is thought to underlie many degenerative conditions,
      including aging, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cataracts, and others. Over time, proteins
      can be irreversibly damaged by a variety of factors, such as reactive oxygen species, and
      without timely degradation they can accumulate and aggregate. We believe this can contribute
      to the development of chronic degenerative disorders.

      The purpose of this study is to develop a novel methodology for measuring protein
      accumulation and test it in two groups of people: young (18-30 years) and old (≥65 years).
      This methodology will require that people drink a solution of essential amino acids that
      includes isotopically labeled L[ring-13C6]phenylalanine. We will then collect blood and
      muscle samples, to isolate plasma and skeletal muscle proteins. Participants will return to
      the study center four more times on a weekly interval.

      We hypothesize that older proteins, which persisted in circulation and accumulated over time,
      will have a higher degree of post-translational oxidative damage than newly synthesized
      proteins.

    <description>Administration of an oral amino acid mixture containing isotopically-labeled [13C6]-phenylalanine (13C-Phe) will result in 13C-Phe incorporation into newly synthesized proteins. Measuring isotopic enrichment (IE) of 13C-Phe immediately after administration and weekly for 3 consecutive weeks will allow for estimation of protein accumulation.</description>

        Two groups of otherwise healthy participants will be recruited: young (18-30 years) and old
        (≥65 years). We anticipate screening up to 30 individuals for each group (up to 60 total
        for study) in order to enroll 12 individuals for each group (24 total for study). A high
        ratio of screened to enrolled participants is necessary due to exclusion criteria and
        concern about finding healthy older participants and relatively inactive younger
        participants. An equal number of participants will be enrolled in each group. We will
        attempt to have an equal number of men and women.
