    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to determine whether an intervention to increase sleep in school-age
      children is associated with positive changes in eating, activity behaviors and zBMI. One
      hundred four children 8-11 years old who sleep 9 ½ hours or less per night will be randomly
      assigned to 1 of 2 conditions: 1) optimize sleep (increase TIB by 1 ½ hours/night to produce
      a change in sleep duration of approximately 40 minutes/night), or 2) control (no change in
      sleep). Families of children in the optimize sleep group will be taught effective behavioral
      strategies that have been shown to improve sleep duration. At baseline, 2-week and 2-month
      follow-up, the following will be gathered: sleep duration (measured by actigraphy), food
      intake (measured by 3 days of 24-hour recall), activity level (measured by accelerometry),
      the relative reinforcing value (RRV) of food (measured using a validated experimental
      paradigm), and measured child height and weight.
