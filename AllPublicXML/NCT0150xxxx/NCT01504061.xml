  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 10-week research study designed to compare the effect of two gels on the appearance
      of post surgical scarring of the chest and/or back. The subject will be asked to identify two
      symmetrical skin growths that they would like to have removed: one on the left chest and/or
      back and one on the right chest and/or back. Additionally, the subject will identify a third
      skin growth that they would like removed which is a reasonable distance from the two
      symmetrical skin growths and will be located either on the back or the chest.

      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Healthy male and non pregnant female subjects ≥18 years of age

        -  have seborrheic keratoses on the right and left chest and/or back

      Exclusion Criteria:

      -Subjects with known allergies or sensitivities to ingredients contained in the test product
      including onion extract and Lidocaine.
