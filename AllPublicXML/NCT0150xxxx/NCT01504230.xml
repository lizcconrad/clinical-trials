  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a prevalent health concern among older adults and is associated with an
      increased risk of falls that can cause fracture, injury and even mortality. Identifying the
      factors related to falls occur within this population is essential for the development of
      effective regimes for fall prevention. The long-term objectives of this work are to ascertain
      the mechanisms for effectively controlling balance in seniors with osteoporosis and to
      provide a basis for developing fall prevention programs. The entire body's center of mass
      (CoM) is a critical indicator for balance control and the coordination among joints and
      muscles to control the CoM is still unclear. The aim1 of this study is to develop
      biomechanical models that control the entire body's center of mass (CoM) during upright quiet
      stance in seniors with osteoporosis. The aim2 of this study is to identify the mechanism to
      control the entire body's CoM after receiving a balance perturbation in seniors with
      osteoporosis. The findings of this research can provide needed information regarding the
      processes of balance control in this vulnerable osteoporosis population, and has the
      potential to be applied to individuals with other neuromuscular and orthopedic deficits.
