  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedation is required in infants and children to successfully complete MRI while maintaining
      respiratory and hemodynamic stability. Limited access to the patient may pose a safety risk
      during MRI examination. Therefore, appropriate drugs need to be selected, administered, and
      titrated to achieve these objectives. Propofol is commonly used for sedation in children in
      the MRI setting because of its predictability, rapid onset, and offset of action.
      Dexmedetomidine has sedative and analgesic properties without affecting cardiovascular and
      respiratory stability. The rationale of this research is to assess the effect of these drugs
      on the upper airway and validate their use in children with upper airway disorders.

      Objectives The objective of this study is to compare the changes in upper airway
      configuration at the level of soft palate, base of tongue and tip of the epiglottis in
      children sedated with dexmedetomidine and propofol in children undergoing MRI.

      We hypothesize that the upper airway caliber will be smaller in children receiving propofol
      than with dexmedetomidine.

      Primary Outcome To measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the upper airway at the level of
      soft palate, base of the tongue and epiglottis in both groups of children at high doses of
      propofol and dexmedetomidine and thus compare the decrease in CSA with increasing doses of
      both drugs.

      Secondary Outcomes To measure the

        -  anteroposterior (AP) diameter

        -  transverse (Tr) diameter of the upper airway at the three levels in both groups of
           children at both low and high doses of propofol and dexmedetomidine and compare the
           decrease in AP and Tr diameter at increasing doses of dexmedetomidine.
