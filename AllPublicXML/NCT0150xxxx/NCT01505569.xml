      This is a standard of care treatment guideline for high risk or relapsed solid tumors or CNS
      tumors consisting of a busulfan, melphalan, thiotepa conditioning (for solid tumors) or
      carboplatin and thiotepa conditioning (for CNS tumors) followed by an autologous peripheral
      blood stem cell transplant. For solid tumors, if appropriate, disease specific radiation
      therapy at day +60. For CNS tumors, the conditioning regimen and autologous peripheral blood
      stem cell transplant will be given for 3 cycles.
