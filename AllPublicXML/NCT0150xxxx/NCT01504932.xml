      This pilot clinical trial studies freeze-dried black raspberries in preventing oral cancer
      recurrence in high-risk Appalachian patients previously treated with surgery for oral cancer.
      Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. Giving freeze-dried
      black raspberries may prevent oral cancer from forming

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct an initial clinical study utilizing a high risk and underserved Appalachian
      population who are former oral cancer patients to determine the practicability of long-term
      daily lyophilized black raspberry (LBR) (LBR lozenge) administration and to gain insights
      into the potential prevention of recurrent oral cancer by LBR.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate numerous parameters (recruitment, tolerability, adherence to study guidelines,
      collection of biological samples, and demographics) that will be helpful in designing a
      future definitive, randomized, Phase II or III clinical trial structured to assess the
      potential effects of long-term LBR administration.

      II. Evaluate the temporal modulation of LBR-responsive gene expression that favor oral cancer
      chemoprevention in &quot;at risk&quot; normal tissues before, during and after LBR administration.

      III. Assess the temporal modulation of LBR-responsive gene expression and biological levels
      of fruit components in post-surgical oral cancer patients not exposed to LBR.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive lyophilized black raspberry lozenges orally (PO) 4 times daily (QID)
      for 6 months.

      ARM II: Patients do not receive lyophilized black raspberries lozenges.

      After completion of study treatment, patients in Arm I are followed up for 5 years and
      patients in Arm II are followed up for up to 1 year.
