  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a unique Remote &amp; Safety diabetes management system (MDRS)
      that offers real-time remote monitoring and control of glucose levels. The system allows the
      supervising personal to alarm the patient and intervene in cases such as pending
      hypoglycemia, long standing hyperglycemia or technical faults.The aim of this feasibility
      study is to evaluate the efficacy of the MDRS system in preventing nocturnal hypoglycemia in
      children and young adults with type 1 diabetes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Type 1 diabetes diagnosed at least 1 year prior to study entry

             investigator would be a contraindication for participation in the study.

          -  Inability to understand/complete the hypoglycemia fear survey

          -  Female subject who is pregnant or planning to become pregnant within the planned study
