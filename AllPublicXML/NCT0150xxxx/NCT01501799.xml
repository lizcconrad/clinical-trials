             provided IEC/IRB approved written assent; this written assent must be accompanied by
             an IEC/IRB approved written informed consent from the patient's legally acceptable
             representative (i.e., parent or guardian). In addition, all patients or their legally
             acceptable representatives (i.e., parent or guardian) must sign a HIPAA authorization,
             if applicable.

          3. Patients must have a definite clinical diagnosis of mild to severe acne vulgaris
             (Grade 2, Grade 3 or Grade 4 on the IGE).

          4. Patients must have a minimum of 20 inflammatory lesions and a maximum of 100 and a

             comedones) and no more than 2 nodulocystic lesions (i.e., nodules and cysts) at
             baseline. For the purposes of study treatment and evaluation, these lesions should be
             limited to the facial treatment area. Lesions involving the eyes, angles of the nose
             (i.e., the lines around your nostrils and under the nostrils) and scalp should be
             excluded from the count. Patients may have acne lesions on other areas of the body

             partners, from the day of the first dose administration to 30 days after the last
             administration of study drug. Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control. Any
             of the following methods of birth control are acceptable: oral contraceptives,
             contraceptive patches/implants (e.g., Norplant®), Depo-Provera®, double barrier
             methods (e.g., condom and spermicide) or IUD.

             measurable systemic absorption for treatment of acne of the back, shoulders and chest
             (e.g., benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid).
