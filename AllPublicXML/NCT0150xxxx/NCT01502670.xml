  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at how the [18]FACBC goes into the lung nodules. This will hopefully
      lead to the development of better imaging techniques to look at lung nodules. [18]FACBC is
      not approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). This study will help to determine if
      it should be approved by the FDA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study that will test a compound (chemical substance) that has a small amount of
      radioactivity attached to it. This substance has a natural tendency to go to tumor cells, as
      has been shown in the detection and staging of prostate cancer and for brain tumors. In this
      study we are going to test this new substance in patients with lung nodules. Lung nodules are
      a common finding. It is very important to non-invasively determine whether the nodule is
      cancer or not, as early cancer detection and treatment may cure the disease. The substance is
      called [18]FACBC and it is given in the form of an injection into a vein. After the substance
      reaches the lung nodules, scans called PET or Positron Emission Tomography, are done. This is
      similar to having CAT scans or x-rays. Usually a compound called [18]FDG is used for PET
      scans but this substance often goes to inflammatory tissues as well. This new substance does
      not significantly go to inflammatory tissues, and may allow tumors in the lungs to be better
      identified.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

          2. Patients with a history of cancer who have a solitary pulmonary nodule between 1-3 cm
             in short axis with clinical and CT characteristics warranting surgical removal (see
             below).

          3. Clinical, laboratory, or diagnostic imaging findings on CT or 18F-FDG PET-CT do not
             suggest the possibility of the SPN being part of a metastatic process.

          4. Ability to lie still for PET scanning

          5. Patients must be able to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age less than 18.

          2. Active carcinoma with known metastatic disease.

          3. Size of primary lesion less than 1 cm or greater than 3 cm

          4. Not a candidate for surgical resection or biopsy based upon clinical condition or
             discovery of metastatic disease which would preclude surgical therapy.

          5. Inability to lie still for PET scanning

          6. Cannot provide written informed consent
