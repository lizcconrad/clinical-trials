  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examined changes in bone metabolism (markers of bone turnover, calcium metabolism)
      with a bout of acute treadmill running preceded by either a single, mixed meal or an
      overnight fast.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten physically active males aged 28 ± 4 y (mean ± 1SD) completed two, counterbalanced, 8 d
      trials. After 3 d on a standardised diet, participants performed 60 min of treadmill running
      at 65% VO2max on Day 4 following an overnight fast (FAST) or a standardised breakfast (FED).
      Blood samples were collected at baseline, before exercise, during exercise, for 3h after
      exercise and on four consecutive follow-up days (FU1-FU4). Plasma/serum were analysed for β
      CTX, P1NP, OC, bone ALP, PTH, ACa, PO4, OPG, cortisol, leptin and ghrelin.

    <measure>Change in C-terminal telopeptide region of collagen type 1 (B-CTX) concentration from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>At 08:00 h (Baseline), 09:00 h, 09:30 h, and 10:15 h (Pre-exercise), after 30 and 60 min of exercise, after 1, 2, and 3 h of recovery and at 1, 2, 3 and 4 day post-exercise</time_frame>
    <description>B-CTX is a specific marker of bone resorption. It's circulating concentration is altered by both exercise and feeding</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>At 08:00 h (Baseline), 09:00 h, 09:30 h, and 10:15 h (Pre-exercise), after 30 and 60 min of exercise, after 1, 2, and 3 h of recovery and at 1, 2, 3 and 4 day post-exercise</time_frame>
    <description>PTH is reported to induce both bone resorption and bone formation. It's circulating concentration is altered by both exercise and feeding.</description>
