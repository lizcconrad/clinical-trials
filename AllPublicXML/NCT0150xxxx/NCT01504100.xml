  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patellar subluxation is a common disorder that may cause patellofemoral pain syndrome. The
      efficiency of patellar taping in the treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome has been
      reported good outcomes in most patients. However, some studies reported less effective in
      patients with higher body mass index, larger lateral patellofemoral angle, and smaller Q
      angle. The investigators hypothesized that femoral internal rotation is a negative factor to
      the patellar taping. The investigators enroll consecutive 100 patients with anterior knee
      pain and radiographic evidence of patellar subluxation. The investigators determine femoral
      rotation via physical examination. The visual analogue scale was evaluate to compare the
      result between the those with and without femoral internal rotation.

      Consecutive 100 patients with anterior knee pain and compatible with inclusion criteria.
      Before treatment, an independent physiotherapist evaluates whether femoral internal rotation
      or not via physical therapy, and another studying nurse records the visual analog scale and
      measures Q angle. After evaluation, McConnell taping is applied to these patients. Two weeks
      later, outcomes are recorded including visual analog scale, satisfactory, and complication.
      The outcomes are compared between those with and without femoral internal rotation.
