  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether eating Kellogg's Nutri-Grain cereal bars
      will increase calcium intake in healthy adult women.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The average intake of calcium in women in the United States from the diet (about 800 mg/day)
      is below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (1000 mg/day for ages 18 to 50 years, 1200 mg/day
      for age above 50 years), which increases their risk of developing osteoporosis. Consumption
      of two calcium-fortified cereal bars per day may be a feasible way to increase the dietary
      intake of calcium. This study will use Kellogg's Nutri-Grain® cereal bars, which provide 200
      mg of calcium per bar, or a total of 400 mg/day.
