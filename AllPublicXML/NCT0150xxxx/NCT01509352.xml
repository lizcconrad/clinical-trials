  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective trial of the utility of esophageal stitches during fundoplication.

      The hypothesis is that recurrence rate may be different with or without the esophageal
      stitches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, prospective randomized clinical trial involving patients who
      require an operation for gastroesophageal reflux disease. This is intended to be a definitive
      study. All patients will receive the standard operation for reflux: laparoscopic
      fundoplication. The dissection will be performed by leaving the phrenoesophageal membrane
      intact in all patients.

      One group will undergo laparoscopic fundoplication with 4 esophageal-crural sutures while the
      other group will not have these placed. The operation, post-operative care, and follow-up
      plan will otherwise not differ between groups.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients less than 7 years of age requiring fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux
        disease who are considered good laparoscopic candidates by the staff surgeon will be
        considered candidates.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hiatal hernia demonstrated on preoperative contrast study, computed tomography,
             endoscopy, or intraoperative findings.

          2. Prior esophageal operation (e.g. esophageal atresia repair, esophageal myotomy)

          3. Prior operation for congenital diaphragmatic hernia

          4. Patients not considered laparoscopic candidates by the staff surgeon or
             anesthesiologist (e.g. carbon dioxide retaining lung disease, congenital heart
             disease, or complex previous abdominal operations)
