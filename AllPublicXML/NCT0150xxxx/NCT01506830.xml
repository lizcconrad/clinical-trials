  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During restorative procedures, different isolation methods of the operative field can be used
      to promote moisture control and retraction of the gingival tissues. The aim of the present
      clinical trial is to evaluate the effects of two isolation techniques on the clinical
      performance of Class V restorations, as well on the periodontal conditions of restored sites.
      Patients presenting at least two noncarious cervical lesions (NCLs) will be enrolled in this
      study. The NCLs will be randomized into the following groups: (1) isolation performed with
      rubber dam and gingival retraction clamp and (2) isolation provided with cotton rolls and
      gingival retraction cord. Both techniques will be used with a saliva suction device. All
      restorative procedures were performed using a self-etching adhesive system and a nanofilled
      composite resin according to the manufacturer's instructions. The clinical performance of
      restorations will be recorded in terms of fracture and retention of restoration, marginal
      adaptation, marginal staining, postoperative hypersensitivity, and preservation of tooth
      vitality at 1 week, 6 months, 12, 24 and 72 months after placement. The periodontal condition
      of restored sites will be evaluated based on the presence of supragingival plaque, gingival
      marginal bleeding, probing depth, and relative gingival recession.
