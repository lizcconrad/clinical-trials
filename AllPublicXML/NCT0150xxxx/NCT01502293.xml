  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of intratumoral plasmid interleukin-12
      DNA injection (pIL-12) with electroporation (EP) in malignant melanoma. Intratumoral pIL-12
      EP is a gene therapy approach to directly induce a pro-inflammatory response within a tumor
      to initiate and/or enhance anti-tumor immunity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plasmid IL-12 (pIL-12) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL will be injected intratumorally at a
      dose volume of ¼ of the calculated lesion volume and a dose volume per lesion of 0.1 mL for
      lesions of volume &lt; 0.4 cm3. Six pulses at field strengths of (E+) of 1500 V/cm and pulse
      width of 100 μs at 1-second intervals will be administered using the OMS to each previously
      injected tumor.

      Two treatment regimens will be explored:

      Regimen A: Treatment on Days 1, 8 and 15 every 6 weeks Regimen B: Treatment on Days 1, 5 and
      8 every 6 weeks. Lesions will be treated on either Regimen A or Regimen B. Subsequent cycles
      may be given at 6-week intervals, for up to 9 treatment cycles in total.
