  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the safety, clinical tolerability, immunogenicity and
      efficacy of gpASIT+TM (grass pollen peptides) alone and combined with an immunoregulating
      adjuvant, in a short course administration (5 injections over 4 weeks).
