  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a disease characterized by small airways
      inflammation and obstruction. The small airways disease produces hyperinflation (air
      trapping), which increases with exercise. Continuous positive airways pressure may reduce
      small airways obstruction and therefore air trapping. Pulmonary function tests including lung
      volumes at rest and and after exercise will be measured. In addition, exercise endurance time
      before treatment and after treatment will be measured.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continuous positive airways pressure which prevent small air ways collapse and may also clear
      secretions. At first stage the optimal pressure for reducing air trapping will be determined.
      In addition, all patients will undergo a maximal exercise test. A baseline complete pulmonary
      function test is performed followed by continuous positive air way pressure at the
      pre-determined pressure. This will be followed by exercise at 60% of maximal obtained
      previously.
