  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to investigate the effects of the investigational drug vibegron
      (MK-4618) compared to placebo on maximum urinary bladder capacity in women with overactive
      bladder. The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple oral doses of
      vibegron in women with overactive bladder. Overactive bladder is best described as urgency
      and frequency of urination, with or without involuntary urination and/or the need to awaken
      during the night to urinate.

      The primary efficacy hypothesis is that vibegron is superior to placebo with respect to
      change from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity at 2 hours postdose on Day 7 (i.e.,
      steady state) in participants with overactive bladder. A true mean increase
      (vibegron/placebo) of 25% in bladder volume is expected.

      The primary safety hypothesis is that administration of multiple oral doses of vibegron is
      sufficiently well-tolerated in participants with overactive bladder, based on assessment of
      clinical and laboratory adverse experiences, to permit continued clinical investigation.

      Participants will be randomized in each of 2 treatment periods to 1 of 4 possible treatments,
      which will be administered in double-dummy fashion, and participants will undergo urodynamic
      procedures prior to dosing on Day 1 and after 7 days of treatment.
