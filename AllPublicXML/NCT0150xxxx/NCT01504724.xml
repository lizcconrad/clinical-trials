    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate the effect of adjunctive intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) before
      panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) compared with only PRP on central macular thickness and
      retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in patients with severe diabetic retinopathy without
      macular edema.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized study included 30 patients (60 eyes) with severe nonproliferative
      diabetic retinopathy or non-high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy. They had weekly PRP
      treatments in 3 sessions and they were randomly assigned to IVB group who had adjunctive IVB
      within 1 week before first PRP and control group who had only PRP. CMT, RNFL, and
      best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were measured
