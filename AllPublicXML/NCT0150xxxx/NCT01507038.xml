      The objective of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic of YH14617
      after once weekly or biweekly injection in patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus to
      investigate the optimal recommended dosage. Study period is 20 weeks including 12 weeks of
      treatment period and 8weeks of follow-up period without treatment.
