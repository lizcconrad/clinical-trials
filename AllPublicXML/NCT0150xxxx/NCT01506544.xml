  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hydroxyurea (HU) is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat
      adults with sickle cell anemia. Hydroxyurea has also been tested and used with children with
      sickle cell anemia. However, there are not many studies describing the disposition of drug in
      children less than 5 years old. The FDA has requested this study to better understand how
      children ages 2 to 17 years with sickle anemia absorb and eliminate the drug (this is called
      pharmacokinetics). The investigators will measure how much Hydroxyurea (HU) gets into the
      bloodstream at different time points after taking this medication.

        Pediatric Patients with Sickle Cell

          -  The study participant will be a pediatric (male or female) participant with sickle
             cell anemia with laboratory (i.e. electrophoretic, chromatographic or DNA)
             confirmation of the diagnosis of Hemoglobin SS or Sβ0thalassemia.

          -  Weight ≥ 10 kg.

          -  Participants may or may not be currently receiving hydroxyurea. If participants are
             taking hydroxyurea, the last dose must be no less than 24 hours prior to the start of
             the study.

             episode).

          -  The participants and/or participant's parents are able to understand and comply with
             protocol requirements, instructions, and protocol-stated restrictions such that the
             participant is likely to complete the study as planned.

          -  Based on the opinion of the physicians providing patient care and those conducting the
             study, there are no apparent contraindications for inclusion as a participant in a
             pharmacokinetic study.

          -  For the Pharmacokinetic Study (Arm 1):

          -  Participant is ≥ 2 years and ≤ 5 years of age.

          -  The participant is able to consume a minimum of 30 ml of water following ingestion of

          -  For the Relative Bioavailability Study:

          -  Participant is &gt; 5 years and &lt; 17 years of age.

          -  All females of child-bearing potential must be found to have a negative serum
             pregnancy test prior to initial dosing and be willing to practice appropriate
             contraceptive measures, including abstinence, from the time of the initial pregnancy
             testing through the remainder of the study (30 days after last administration of
             investigational agents).

          -  The participant is able to ingest both capsule and liquid study articles and consume a
             minimum of 30 ml of water following ingestion of medication.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

             criteria apply:

          -  Chronic transfusion therapy, or transfused within 3 months of study participation.

          -  Known renal impairment (creatinine greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal
             for age in the screening laboratory).

          -  Known hepatic impairment or elevated transaminases (greater than 3 times normal).

          -  The participant is unwilling and/or unable to abstain from use of tobacco- or
             nicotine-containing products for 24 hours prior to screening and for 24 hours prior to
             dosing until collection of the final PK sample during each treatment period.

          -  Diagnoses other than sickle cell anemia or sickle beta-zero thalassemia (i.e., other

             guidelines.

          -  Any other condition or chronic illness, which in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator makes participation unadvised or unsafe.
