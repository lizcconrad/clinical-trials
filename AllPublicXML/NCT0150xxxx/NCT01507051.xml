  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to investigate the pharmacodynamics (effects of a drug product) when
      switching the treatment from warfarin to rivaroxaban.

      84 young, healthy subjects will participate; they will be treated following a randomized,
      parallel-group (Treatments A, B, and C), placebo-controlled (Treatment B), and single-blind
      (Treatments A and B) design.

      The first two groups (A, B) will receive warfarin for approximately one week to adjust their
      blood coagulation values to a specific level, i.e. to maintain an INR (international
      normalized ratio) of 2.0 - 3.0. This range is commonly used for long-term anticoagulant
      treatment.

      The first group (A) will receive rivaroxaban for four days, the second group (B) will take
      placebo. On the last day, all subjects in groups A and B will receive vitamin K to neutralize
      the effects of warfarin. The third group (C) will not undergo prior treatment with warfarin
      but will receive rivaroxaban for four days.

        <title>Emax (Maximum Effect) on Prothrombin Time (PT) (Coagulation Test)</title>
        <description>Prothrombin time (PT) is a global clotting test assessing the extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade. The test is sensitive for deficiencies of Factors II, V, VII, and X, with sensitivity being best for Factors V, VII, and X and less pronounced for Factor II. The initial read-out is in seconds. Higher values than the baseline indicate anticoagulant effects. Emax on PT was measured as the ratio of maximum PT (measured in seconds) divided by PT (measured in seconds) at baseline.</description>

The test is sensitive for deficiencies of Factors II, V, VII, and X, with sensitivity being best for Factors V, VII, and X and less pronounced for Factor II. The initial read-out is in seconds. Higher values than the baseline indicate anticoagulant effects. AUCBA(0-tn) of PT was the area under the measurement (PT [measured in seconds] at different time-points minus PT [measured in seconds] at baseline) versus time curve from time 0 to the last data point.</description>

        <title>AUC(0-tn) (Area Under the Measurement Versus Time Curve From Time 0 to the Last Data Point) of Anti-Factor Xa Activity</title>
        <description>This is a method for measuring the inhibition of Factor Xa activity determined by an ex vivo using a photometric method. Higher Values than the baseline indicate a more pronounced inhibition. AUC(0-tn) of anti-Factor Xa activity was the area under the measurement (anti-Factor Xa activity [measured in U/L] at different time-points divided by anti-Factor Xa activity [measured in U/L] at baseline) versus time curve from time 0 to the last data point.</description>

        <description>ETP lag time assesses the overall function of the clotting cascade. The lag time assesses the time required until thrombin is generated. Increasing values compared to baseline indicate an anticoagulant effect. AUC(0-tn) of ETP lag time was the area under the measurement (ETP lag time [in minutes as measure for the start of coagulation] at different time-points divided by ETP lag time [in minutes as measure for the start of coagulation] at baseline) versus time curve from time 0 to the last data point.</description>

Emax on Factor VIIa activity was measured as the ratio of Factor VIIa activity (measured as percent of actual Factor VIIa activity compared to Factor VIIa activity in reference plasma) at baseline divided by minimum Factor VIIa activity (measured as percent of actual Factor VIIa activity compared to Factor VIIa activity in reference plasma).</description>
