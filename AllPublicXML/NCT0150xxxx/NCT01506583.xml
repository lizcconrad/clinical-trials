  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently effective antivials for influenza treatment are two influenza viral neuraminidase
      inhibitors, oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). Resistance to these drugs is
      reflected by reduced susceptibility of viral neuraminidase to these drugs. The hypothesis is
      that the signal ratio of two reagents (with or without a single concentration of the drug)
      correlates the IC50 value, an accurate measurement of drug resistance but impractical for
      clinical use.

      The study design is to collect samples from participants. A portion of the sample is used for
      drug resistance detection using the test (QFlu Combo Test) under investigation. The remaining
      portion of the sample is used for culture. The culture positive samples are used for
      determination of IC50 values, which is used as a gold standard for defining whether a virus
      isolate is resistant to a drug or not. The sensitivity and specificity of the QFlu test will
      be calculated by comparing to the gold standard test.
