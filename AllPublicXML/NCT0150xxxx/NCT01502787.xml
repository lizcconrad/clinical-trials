  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Nebivolol a) attenuates the angiotensin II (Ang
      II)-induced increase in oxidative stress, thereby attenuating Ang II-induced
      vasoconstriction; and b) attenuates sympathetic mediated vasoconstriction during exercise,
      thereby reducing functional skeletal muscle ischemia in hypertensive patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 40 untreated, stage I hypertensive subjects, Investigators will measure sympathetic nerve
      activity (microneurography); total forearm blood flow (high-resolution ultrasonography);
      skeletal muscle oxygenation (Near Infrared spectroscopy); plasma F2-isoprostanes; cardiac
      output (non-invasive impedance plethysmography); and blood pressure at baseline and after a)
      rhythmic handgrip exercise at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction alone for 3 minutes, b)
      rhythmic handgrip at the same intensity of exercise plus lower body negative pressure (LBNP)
      to activate sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) for 2 minutes, and c) during intravenous
      infusion of Angiotensin II at the dose of 1, 2, and 3 ng/kg/min for 15 minutes at each dose.

      Each subject will then be randomized to receive 12 weeks of Nebivolol (Bystolic, 5-20 mg/day)
      or Metoprolol Succinate (Toprol XL, 100-300 mg/day), using a randomized crossover design.
      There will be a 2-week washout period between the two treatment periods. During drug
      treatment, blood pressure will be monitored every 4 weeks and the doses of Nebivolol and
      Metoprolol will be titrated to keep BP &lt;140/90 mmHg. SNA, total forearm blood flow, skeletal
      muscle blood flow, muscle oxygenation, cardiac output, and blood pressure responses to
      Nebivolol will be compared to responses during Metoprolol in the same subjects.

    <intervention_name>Microneurography</intervention_name>
    <description>Investigators will measure sympathetic nerve activity from the peroneal nerve by inserting a tiny needle directly into the nerve in the leg. Investigators will localize the nerve by electrical stimulation over the skin using a blunt probe. With this stimulation, subject will notice either involuntary twitching or a tingling sensation, which may be annoying but not painful. Investigators will then introduce a tiny, sterile wire needle (an electrode) through the skin at the same location. When the tip of the needle enters the nerve, subjects may again notice involuntary muscle twitches or tingling in the leg. Investigators will then turn the electrical stimulator off and make minor adjustments in the position of the needle until investigators begin to record the nerve signals. The recording needle will remain in position throughout the study.</description>

Following the 12-week treatment period, the procedures listed below will be performed. After completion of the study procedures, the medication will be discontinued. There will be a 2-week washout period. Following washout, the subject will be started on metoprolol succinate (Toprol XL) 100-300mg daily, which he or she will continue for a period of 12 weeks. Following the 12-week treatment period, the procedures listed below will be performed. After completion of the study procedures, the medication will be discontinued.</description>
