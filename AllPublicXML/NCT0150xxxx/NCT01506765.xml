  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The results of the study &quot;schizophrenia, related disorders and glutathione&quot; conducted at the
      Laboratory of Psychiatric Neuroscience (LUNEP) DUPA of Lausanne, reinforce the hypothesis
      proposed that a deficit intracerebral glutathione is a vulnerability factor for Schizophrenia
      at least for a subgroup of patients. While pursuing the baseline study, it is appropriate now
      to try to restore a higher level of glutathione in patients to see if this increase is
      accompanied by an improvement in symptoms, particularly negative symptoms and disorders
      cognitive, particularly resistant to current therapy. N-acetyl-cystein (NAC) is a precursor
      of glutathione which is used clinically for various indications, well tolerated even at high
      doses. The investigators propose a double-blind cross-over with the aim to study if the
      N-acetyl-cystein (at a dose of oral 2g/day) leads on the one hand a rising glutathione brain
      (measured in resonance magnetic spectroscopic) and also improved patients' conditions
      (determined by clinical assessments, psychopathological, neuropsychological, biochemical and
      physiological), while recording any side effects. As a first step, this study should include
      at least thirty patients and last for two to three years. It is important to note that this
      is not a study of medication suggested by a pharmaceutical industry, but a medical search.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients (male or female, aged 18 to 65 years, QI&gt;70) meeting the DSM-IV criteria
             (established by a senior psychiatrist) for schizophrenia and have the capacity to
             consent to the study. The study population include both inpatients and outpatients who
             are currently taking at least one of the following:Olanzapine, Clozapine, Haloperidol,
             Risperidone, Flupenthixol, or Fluphenazine. The following guidelines have been
             established for potential medication changes that patients may undergo during the
             course of the trial.

          -  dose changes to existing medication (either increases or decreases in dose) will be
             accepted and participants will be allowed to continue with the trial.

          -  A change in primary antipsychotics from one medication to another will require
             participants to withdrawn from the study.

          -  An addiction of another antipsychotic, secondary to the existing antipsychotic
             treatment (primary antipsychotic) will be acceptable providing that there isn't a
             complete change from one antipsychotic to another.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  pregnancy

          -  acute psychotic state, preventing the patient cooperation

          -  co-morbidity with drug dependency

          -  organic cerebral disease, major somatic diseases

          -  abnormal renal, hepatic, thyroid or hematological findings

          -  treatment with a regulator of mood(lithium, valproate, topiramate, lamotrigine et
             carbamazepine)

          -  allergy to NAC

          -  treatment with antioxidants
