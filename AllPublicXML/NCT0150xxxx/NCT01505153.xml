  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I safety trial of bifunctional shRNA-STMN1 (pbi-shRNA™STMN1) BIV (bilamellar
      invaginated vesicle) lipoplex (LP), pbi-shRNA™ STMN1 LP administered by a single intratumoral
      (IT) injection. Patients with superficially accessible advanced cancer following prior
      therapies will be entered into the study following a modified dose escalation design based on
      the demonstrated safety of our previous clinical experience (BB-IND 13744) with the same
      liposome and vector DNA backbone expressing a different transgene (of which doses up to 7 mg
      DNA IV/single dose have been administered). Patients will accrue in 4-patient escalation
      cohorts using a modified Fibronacci escalation schema (100%-50%-33%-33%) at a starting
      intratumoral dose of 0.010 mg/kg of DNA through a dose of 0.053 mg/kg DNA intratumoral /
      single dose. Should a single, but not more than two (2), ≥ Grade 3 Dose Limiting Toxicity
      (DLT) occur in any cohort, following mandated review (see below) an additional two (2)
      patients will be accrued at that dose (total of six). If more than one ≥ Grade 3 toxicity
      occurs in any cohort, the preceding dose cohort will be expanded to six (from four) and if &lt;
      2/6 patients experience ≥ Grade 3 toxicity, that dose will be the Phase II recommended dose.
      Should no ≥ Grade 3 toxicity occur in any cohort (other than Grade 3 local injection site
      reaction), an additional two (2) patients will be treated at 0.053 mg/kg DNA intratumoral /
      single dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed advanced and/or metastatic cancer, and, if limited to a
             single lesion, not considered a candidate for curative surgery or radiation therapy).

          2. Biopsy accessible lesion.

          3. Per cohort dose/volume, the volume of the lesion to be injected must be 3x volume of

             the current standard of care for their respective diseases.

          5. Recovered from all toxicities (≤ Grade 1) related to prior therapies except for
             alopecia.
