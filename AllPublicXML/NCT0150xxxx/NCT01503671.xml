      Background

      Heart failure is the final consequence of various heart disease and is also the leading cause
      of mortality worldwide. Diastolic dysfunction refers to an abnormality of diastolic
      distensibility, filling, or relaxation of the left ventricle. Patients with hypertensive left
      ventricular hypertrophy and an echocardiogram showing a normal ejection fraction and abnormal
      left ventricular filling can be said to have diastolic dysfunction. If pulmonary edema or
      effort dyspnea developed in such a patient. The term diastolic heart failure would be
      appropriate.

      Pathology leading to diastolic heart failure include: impaired relaxation, increased passive
      stiffness, endocardial and pericardial disorders, microvascular flow and neurohormonal
      regulation. Among them, the association of pro-inflammatory system and diastolic dysfunction
      are already established. The investigators therefore hypothesized that the change of serum
      inflammatory markers might be associated with the change of left ventricular diastolic
      function and the investigators thus conducted a randomized case-control trial with this
      regard.

      Method and materials

      This is a case-control randomized study. The definition of left ventricular diastolic
      function is according to Guideline from the ACC and AHA. The investigators will evaluate left
      ventricular diastolic function noninvasively by echocardiography before and after the
      intervention. Exclusion criteria include coronary artery disease, significant valvular heart
      disease, cardiomyopathy, pericardial disease and renal insufficiency. The investigators would
      like to enroll 50 cases and the same numbers of the controls. The inclusion criteria are
      subjects who underwent peritoneal dialysis at the investigators hospital for more than 6
      months with higher pro-inflammation serum cytokine levels (C-reactive protein &gt; 0.2mg/dL).
      Atorvastatin (40mg/day) would be given to those who were allocated to the intervention group.
      The investigators will than follow up cardiac diastolic function by echocardiography and also
      the change of serum markers. The investigators would also genotype the
      inflammation-associated genes and their promoter region and find the association between
      genetic polymorphisms and the treatment effects of statins.

      We will evaluate left ventricular diastolic function noninvasively by echocardiography before
      and after the intervention. Exclusion criteria include coronary artery disease, significant
      valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, pericardial disease and renal insufficiency. We would
      like to enroll 50 cases and the same numbers of the controls. The inclusion criteria are
      subjects who underwent peritoneal dialysis at our hospital for more than 6 months with higher
      pro-inflammation serum cytokine levels (C-reactive protein &gt; 0.2mg/dL). Atorvastatin
      (40mg/day) would be given to those who were allocated to the intervention group. We will than
      follow up cardiac diastolic function by echocardiography and also the change of serum
      markers. We would also genotype the inflammation-associated genes and their promoter region
      and find the association between genetic polymorphisms and the treatment effects of statins.

      Patients population and Monitoring The study population will consist of patients with CAPD
      and DHF (NYHA Class II-IV), aged 18 years or older without reduced systolic function, defined
      as left ventricular EF ≤ 45%, Patients fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria will
      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the study from the single medical centers.

           symptoms that may require IV therapy).

        3. Acute coronary syndrome, stroke, transient ischemic attack, cardiac, carotid or major

           ventricular assistance device (LVAD device).

        9. Symptomatic bradycardia or second or third degree heart block without a pacemaker.

       10. Implantation of a CRT (cardiac resynchronization therapy) device within the prior 3
           months from visit 1 or intent to implant a CRT device.

           mitral regurgitation secondary to left ventricular dilatation.
