    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D [25-hydroxyvitamin D; 25(OH)D] may play a role in
      the etiology of type 2 diabetes. Vitamin D levels are lower in those with type 2 diabetes and
      impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) compared with those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). In
      addition, a few prospective studies have shown a significant inverse association of baseline
      serum 25(OH)D with incident diabetes. To date, however, the exact mechanisms through which
      vitamin D affects diabetes risk are not yet fully known, particularly whether vitamin D plays
      a role in insulin resistance (IR) and/or b-cell dysfunction, the main pathophysiological
      disorders underlying type 2 diabetes. So, the investigators plan to examine the prospective
      associations of baseline vitamin D [25-hydroxyvitamin D; 25(OH)D] with insulin resistance
      (IR), b-cell function, and glucose homeostasis in subjects at risk for type 2 diabetes.

        Study participants, aged over 30 years, are recruited from Korea, between January 2006 and
        December 2011. Participants are at high risk for type 2 diabetes, as they are recruited on
        the basis of the presence of one or more risk factors for diabetes, including obesity,
        hypertension, dislipidemia, and a family history of diabetes. Participants are contacted
        every 6 month after the baseline visit to update contact information and collect data on
        major health events. Participants are invited to return to the clinic examination centers
        after 3 years for follow-up assessments.
