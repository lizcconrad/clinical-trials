  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of proteinuria (&gt;300 mg/d) represents an important factor in the diagnosis and
      evaluation of the pregnant patient with an hypertensive disorder. The 24 hour collection of
      urine for proteinuria is the gold standard for the diagnosis of the condition and allows the
      physician to determine if an hypertensive disorder is related directly or not to the
      gestation.

      The problem is the time it takes and the technical difficulties related to the sample
      collection. An alternative is the quantification of protein and creatinine in a random sample
      of urine. We seek to evaluate if this method is as affective as the gold standard in the
      diagnosis of proteinuria (&gt;300 mg/d).

    <description>The number of patients with a 24 hour urine collection with a proteinuria &gt; 300mg will be compared with the number of patients with a Spot Test (protein/creatinine ratio in a random urine sample) &gt; 0.2 (equivalent to the 24 hour test &gt; 300 mg).
