    <textblock>
      TL-118 is an anti-angiogenic drug combination designed for the treatment of cancer. The
      investigational product Tl-118 comprises of four well-known active components. The therapy is
      administrated at a unique dosing regimen that was found to be effective and advantageous in
      terms of safety. The product is formulated as an oral suspension, conveniently administrated
      by the patients at home and not requiring medical staff assistance. This Phase II clinical
      trial aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of TL-118 in Gemcitabine treated
      Pancreatic Cancer patients
