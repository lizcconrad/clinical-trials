      Exposure to alcohol related cues, such as the sight of alcoholic drinks, may induce craving
      for alcohol in drinkers. In this study, the effects of exposure to (1) the pictures of
      alcoholic drinks and (2) the imagining of a scene related to drinking on activity in the
      frontal region of the brain in heavy social drinkers will be determined. This study is being
      conducted to develop the methods needed to allow for the detection of cue-induced changes in
      drinkers using the EEG. The objective of this pilot study is to establish procedures for
      detecting alcohol-related cue-elicited changes in EEG activity in heavy drinkers.

    <measure>FFT power of five frequency bands</measure>
    <description>This study will look at FFT power of five frequency bands. Relative power will be determined by finding absolute power for the range of frequencies (0,1 to 100Hz). Relative power will then be found for each electrode. The Investigator's will examine change over time for relative power for each electrode in the different cue condition and compare change of power using repeated measures analysis with time and condition as within subject factors. Craving values obtained under the different cue conditions will be analyzed using condition as the within-subject factor.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, aged 21 to 70.

          2. History of heavy drinking: Defined as at least 8 occasions in the past month that
             individual had at least 5 drinks (males) or 4 drinks (females) in one sitting.

          3. The subject must currently not be in treatment for any alcohol use disorder

          4. Subject must be able to comprehend and perform study related information and tasks in
             English and have a willingness to complete study procedures.

          5. Subject must be able to provide written informed consent, at time of consent BAC has
             to be 0.00%.

          6. The subject must have the ability to read/speak English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe impairment of sight, smell, or hearing that would result in a significant
             alteration in the response to alcohol related cues.

          2. Currently on a medication used to treat alcoholism or is known to alter EEG activity
             or responsiveness to cue presentation including acamprosate, anticonvulsants,
             anticholinergics, antipsychotics, benzodiazepine receptor agonists, beta adrenergic
             receptor antagonists, and naltrexone.

          3. History of any neurological or psychiatric disorder that would result in abnormal EEG
             activity such as severe brain trauma, seizure disorders, stroke or that would severly
             alter response to the cue presentation such as schizophrenia or any other psychotic or
             severe mood disorder.

          4. CIWA-AR score of 8 or higher or any history indicating that the subject is at risk for
             experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms if her or his drinking is discontinued
             for any period of time.

          5. The subject must not be pregnant. -
