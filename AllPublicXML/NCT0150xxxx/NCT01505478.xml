      The investigators will conduct a prospective cohort study to compare an automated sepsis
      severity score to a conventional clinical prediction rule to risk stratify patients admitted
      from the emergency department (ED) with suspected infection for 28 day in-hospital mortality.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>28 day in-hospital mortality</measure>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the AUC of a model to predict 28 day all cause in-hospital mortality. Patients discharged or transferred to another hospital before 28 days will be assumed to be alive at 28 days.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ICU Admission</measure>
    <description>The secondary endpoint is ICU admission from the ED or within 24 hours from the floor.</description>
