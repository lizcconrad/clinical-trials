  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center observational study designed to address patient-reported
      nasal outcomes in adults undergoing endoscopic and microscopic surgical removal of pituitary
      tumors. The primary objective of this study is to determine the difference in nasal outcomes
      by using the Anterior Skull Base (ASK) Nasal survey between patients treated with endoscopic
      surgical technique and those treated with microscopic surgical technique. Patients will be
      given the ASK Nasal survey to assess their nasal functioning and overall health before their
      surgery, and at post-operative visits 1-2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.

    <textblock>
      The technical and patient factors that influence rhinological (nasal) outcomes following
      endonasal anterior skull base surgery and pituitary surgery are not well understood. Several
      timely and controversial topics, such as the influence of endoscopic techniques and the
      impact of underlying disease on nasal outcomes are in need of further study.

      The Anterior Skull Base (ASK) Nasal survey is a 24-item questionnaire designed to assess for
      common postoperative nasal complaints, such as crusting, nasal congestion, pain, sinusitis,
      sense of smell, and overall functioning. The survey is a brief and simple assessment that
      asks patients to score symptom severity on a five-point scale.
