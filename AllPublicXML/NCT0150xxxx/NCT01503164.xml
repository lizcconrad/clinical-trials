  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea affects approximately 2-4% of middle-aged adults in the general
      population and is associated with several medical conditions including hypertension and
      coronary artery. Research over the last decade has shown that obstructive sleep apnea may
      also increase the propensity for insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is the first line therapy for the treatment of
      obstructive sleep apnea. While PAP therapy has several favorable effects such as improvements
      in daytime sleepiness and quality of life, it is not clear whether using PAP therapy can
      alter metabolic risk. The overall objective of this study is to examine whether treatment of
      obstructive sleep apnea with positive airway pressure therapy improves glucose tolerance and
      insulin sensitivity. The primary hypothesis of this study is that PAP therapy of obstructive
      sleep apnea will improve in insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent medical conditions, affecting a
      staggering 246 million people worldwide. Obstructive sleep apnea is a relatively common and
      often undiagnosed condition in the general population. Cross-sectional studies of clinic and
      population-based samples suggest that up to 40% of patients with obstructive sleep apnea have
      type 2 diabetes and up to 75% of patients with type 2 diabetes have obstructive sleep apnea.
      There is increasing evidence that the pathophysiological features of intermittent hypoxia and
      sleep fragmentation may be responsible for altering glucose homeostasis and worsening insulin
      sensitivity. The mechanisms through which obstructive sleep apnea impairs glucose metabolism
      are largely unknown. While intermittent hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation are likely to play
      an essential role, the relative contribution of each in the causal pathway remains to be
      determined. Moreover, whether the adverse effects of intermittent hypoxia and sleep
      fragmentation are mediated through an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity,
      alterations in corticotropic function, and/or systemic inflammation is not known.
      Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether positive pressure therapy for obstructive
      sleep apnea has salutary effects on glucose metabolism. Many of the available studies
      examining the effects of PAP on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity are plagued by
      small sample sizes, lack of a control group, and limited data on compliance with positive
      pressure therapy. The current study will assess, using a community-based sample, whether
      treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with positive pressure therapy will improve insulin
      sensitivity, as assessed by the frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test (primary
      outcome measure).

    <description>Insulin sensitivity will be determined with the insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) before and 2-months after study intervention. This test requires administration of a weight-adjusted dose of D50W as an IV bolus at time &quot;zero&quot;. After the glucose bolus, blood samples are drawn at the scheduled times for 3-hours. At the 20-minute mark, a weight-adjusted dose of regular insulin is administered. The resulting serum is analyzed for glucose and insulin and the &quot;minimal model&quot; (MINMOD) will be used to derive insulin sensitivity. A low SI signifies low insulin sensitivity and high SI represents high insulin sensitivity.</description>

        <title>Insulin Sensitivity (SI)</title>
        <description>Insulin sensitivity will be determined with the insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) before and 2-months after study intervention. This test requires administration of a weight-adjusted dose of D50W as an IV bolus at time &quot;zero&quot;. After the glucose bolus, blood samples are drawn at the scheduled times for 3-hours. At the 20-minute mark, a weight-adjusted dose of regular insulin is administered. The resulting serum is analyzed for glucose and insulin and the &quot;minimal model&quot; (MINMOD) will be used to derive insulin sensitivity. A low SI signifies low insulin sensitivity and high SI represents high insulin sensitivity.</description>
