  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cataract surgery is known to cause loss of corneal endothelial cells. In adults, it is
      reported that anywhere between 2 to 15% loss of corneal endothelial cell density occurs
      following cataract surgery. However, no data is available regarding endothelial changes after
      cataract surgery with IOL implantation in pediatric eyes.

      The aim of this study is to prospectively observe changes in endothelial cell density,
      coefficient of variation and hexagonality following cataract surgery with IOL implantation in
      pediatric eyes.
