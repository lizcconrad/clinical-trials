  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Physical Activation on Prescription can
      help patients with TIA to become more physically active.

      One group will receives Physical Activation on Prescription (PaP)and the other group will
      receives usual care.

      And to identify if persons with TIA presents with cognitive impairments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by
      ischemia, i.e. loss of blood flow. The symptoms of a TIA typically resolve within 24 hours.
      Attacks lasting more than 30 minutes are unusual. TIAs and strokes present with the same
      symptoms such as sudden weakness, numbness, sudden dimming or loss of vision, aphasia,
      slurred speech, facial palsy and mental impairments. Subtle problems with cognitive functions
      and fatigue may not always be addressed before discharge. However, even subtle mental
      impairments are important to identify, given the problems they might pose.

    <description>In order to determine whether hospitalization in itself is associated with transient impaired cognition, a comparison group will be included. The comparison group will consist of patients with angina pectoris consecutively admitted to the Norrt채lje Hospital. The patients with angina pectoris will be age and sex matched with the patients with TIA and assessed for cognitive function when their angina symptoms have subsided.</description>

    <description>The advice on physical activity is patient oriented and based on FYSS (FYSS is a information bank that summarizes the up-to-date scientific knowledge on how to prevent and treat various diseases and conditions using physical activity). An individual prescription on physical activity is issued. The prescription form reminds of an ordinary drug prescription and provides specified types of physical activities including intensity, frequency and duration of the respective activities. The prescribed physical activity could be either self-monitored or organized by public physical activity organizations.</description>
