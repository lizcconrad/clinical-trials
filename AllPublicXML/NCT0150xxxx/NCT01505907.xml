  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this dose escalation study is to examine the safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetic properties of single-doses of CXB909, compared to placebo, in healthy
      male volunteers. This study may evaluate five (5) dose levels of CXB909; however, the number
      of dose levels, as well as the dosages, may be adjusted after evaluation of in-study analysis
      of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data. This study will attempt to identify
      the maximum tolerated single dose of CXB909.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male, 18 to 50 years of age.

          2. Able to read, understand, and provide written/dated informed consent before screening
             in the study, and must be willing to comply with all study procedures.

          3. In good general health as ascertained by thorough medical history, physical
             examination (PE)including measurement of supine and standing vital signs, clinical
             laboratory studies, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG).

          4. Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 21 and &lt; 30.

          5. Willing and able to be confined to the clinical research unit as required by the
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of a significant acute or chronic medical disorder that might complicate
             evaluation of the study drug such as:

               -  Any cardiovascular or cardiac condition.

               -  Supine SBP≥145 mmHg and/or DBP ≥90 mmHg at Screening.

               -  Diabetes mellitus.

               -  Malignancy and/or chemotherapy within two years of screening, other than basal
                  cell carcinoma. Malignancies more than two years prior may not preclude
                  participation; however, must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the CeNeRx
                  BioPharma, Inc., medical monitor.

             pomelos).

          8. Abnormal screening medical/physical examination, unless the abnormality is considered
             unlikely to be affected by study participation, or confound interpretation of safety
             data.

          9. A clinically significant clinical laboratory or EKG abnormality at screening; includes
             any of the following: aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), or
             alkaline phosphate (ALP) &gt;2.0 x the upper limit of normal (ULN); total bilirubin &gt;1.5

             and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and/or free thyroxine (T4) outside of the normal
             limits.

         10. Test positive for: Urine cannabinoids, cocaine, amphetamines, barbiturates, opiates or
             benzodiazepines, serum alcohol, hepatitis B or C, or nicotine use.

         12. Participation in a clinical investigation within the last 45 days of screening.

         13. Any other condition which, in the investigator's opinion, may place the subject at
             greater than normal risk of developing complications.

         14. Donation of any blood product (one pint or greater) within the previous eight weeks of
             screening.

         15. Planning to donate any blood product within eight weeks of end of study.
