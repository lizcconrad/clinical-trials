  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing colon or rectal surgery will usually have a urinary catheter (silicone
      tube) placed in the bladder at the time of operating to monitor kidney function during
      surgery and in the post-surgery period. Such patients will also have an infusion into the
      spine, known as an epidural, after surgery to provide them with continuous pain relief.
      Urinary catheters should be removed as early as possible once they are no longer required to
      facilitate patients becoming mobile after surgery and to reduce the risk of patients
      developing a urinary tract infection.

      Traditionally these catheters are not removed until the patients epidural infusion is
      withdrawn, as in theory to do so would predispose the patient to developing acute retention
      of urine due to lack of sensation when the bladder is full. The investigators hypothesis is
      that urinary catheters placed via the urethra can be withdrawn 48 hours after colon/rectal
      surgery in patients receiving epidural pain relief without a significant increase in rates of
      urinary retention.

      Patients undergoing colon or rectal surgery will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:
      Patients in study group 1 (SG1) will have their urinary catheters removed at 48 hours
      post-operatively; Patients in study group 2 (SG2) will have their urinary catheters removed
      only after the epidural has been withdrawn in the post-operative period. We will be primarily
      examining rates of urinary retention in both groups. We will also be examining rates of
      urinary tract infection, chest infection (frequently a result of poor mobility after
      surgery), and wound infection and other complications after surgery.

    <description>All participants are to have a urethral catheter placed following successful placement of an epidural catheter for analgesia prior to undergoing colorectal resection. Following urethral catheter placement participants will be randomly assigned to either the experimental arm or the control arm. Participants assigned to the experimental arm will have their urethral catheters removed at 48 hours following surgery. Participants assigned to the control group will have their urethral catheters removed within 12 hours of withdrawal of the epidural infusion, as is standard practice in our institution.</description>
