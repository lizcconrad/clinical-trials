      Introduction: The prevalence of childhood obesity is increasing rapidly in developing
      countries. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of exercise training and
      family-based behavioral treatment (FBBT), either in individual or in group setting,in
      pre-pubertal children and their mother.

      Methods: This is a 6-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) including 75 pre-pubertal obese
      children (age 8-11 years) randomly assigned to an Intervention (I, n=50) or a Control group
      (C, n=25). The intervention consists of a family-based behavioural therapy in group (1
      session/week with a dietician and a psychologist) or in individual setting (paediatrician or
      dietician 1x/month). The intervention includes exercise training sessions twice a week (60
      minutes each).

      Measures include: body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumferences; whole body and
      abdominal fat mass by DXA; resting and ambulatory blood pressure; arterial intima-media
      thickness and vascular reactivity (flow-mediated dilation)using high resolution ultrasound;
      arterial stiffness by tonometry of applanation; cardiorespiratory fitness by a treadmill
      test; physical activity; fasting lipids, glucose, insulin, and C-reactive protein levels;
      health-related quality of life and psychological health using standardized questionnaires and
      a semi-structured interview. Measures are completed in children and their mother at baseline
      and 6 months post-randomization.
