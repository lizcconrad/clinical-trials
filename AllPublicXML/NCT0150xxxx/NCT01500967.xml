  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain and related problems occur frequently in modern societies and have a considerable
      impact on individuals and the society. Cervical radiculopathy (CR) generally presents with
      pain, numbness, or weakness in a dermatomal distribution. CR results from impingement on a
      nerve root by either spondylotic narrowing of the neural foramen or a lateral intervertebral
      disc herniation. Various studies have shown that nonoperative management for CR is effective,
      such as medications, physical therapy, Spinal manipulation, traction, acupuncture, collar
      immobilization and epidural steroid injections. Spinal manipulation is one of the manual
      techniques for treating mechanical neck pain. No high-quality evidence has proved the
      effectiveness of manipulative therapy in the treatment of cervical radiculopathy. However,
      limited evidence suggests that manipulation may provide short-term benefit in the treatment
      of neck pain, cervicogenic headaches and radicular symptoms. Few complications, such as
      worsening radiculopathy, myelopathy, and spinal cord injury, may occur. Spinal massage
      manipulation is used for centuries in China. Many patients with cervical disc disease are
      increasingly turning to manipulations to alleviate their symptoms and reduce the side effects
      of medications. The goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of a spinal manipulation,
      three steps and nine manipulations, on treating with the cervical radiculopathy.

      Radiculopathy generally presents with pain, numbness, or weakness in a dermatomal
      distribution. Causative factors include an acute nucleus pulposus herniation, spondylitic
      changes around the foramen causing nerve compression, or a combination of these.

      Cervical radiculopathy results from impingement on a nerve root by either spondylotic
      narrowing of the neural foramen or a lateral intervertebral disc herniation. Frequent
      complaints include painful neck movements, radicular pain, paraspinal muscle spasm, muscle
      weakness, and diminished deep tendon reflexes (Radhakrishnan K, 1994). Radiculopathy tends to
      produce substantial limitation of movement of the head and neck.

      The goals of any treatment plan should be well defined. Specifically, it should be the goal
      of the treating physician to relieve pain, improve function, and prevent recurrence. Although
      some symptomatic patients meet surgical criteria, most patients are clearly candidates for
      nonoperative treatment. Treatment modalities for radiculopathy include rest, medications,
      physical therapy, manipulation, injections, and patient education.

      Various studies have shown that nonoperative management of cervical radiculopathy leaves a
      substantial minority of patients with persistently troublesome symptoms (Lees F, 1963,41,
      42). Lees and Turner found that in two thirds of patients, symptoms tend to persist in the
      absence of surgical treatment (Lees F, 1963). DePalma and Subin found that of 255 patients
      treated nonoperatively, only 29% experienced complete symptom relief (Radhakrishnan K,
      1994,41). Better outcomes with nonoperative management, however, have been observed in
      studies that were based in physiotherapy centers than those from surgical series
      (Radhakrishnan K, 1994).

      Spinal balance is the way Professor Shi Qi &quot; Arthralgia theory&quot; and &quot; The theory of muscle
      imbalance &quot; theory under the guidance of mix martial arts, Wang Shi expertise and
      Traumatology, combined with clinical experience and experimental research. Rub, take, roll,
      put, loose, pull, friction, shaking, pinching, so called &quot;nine manipulations.&quot; It can adjust
      qi and blood, phlegm stasis, Dredge meridians, spasm pain, support organs, alleviate, correct
      cervical dynamic and static imbalance. Three steps and nine manipulations is the common
      method of treatment of Professor Shi Qi for cervical disease .
