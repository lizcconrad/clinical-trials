      ï»¿The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of hemofiltration in patients
      resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest is the loss of mechanical activity of the
      heart including the loss of detectable pulse, or spontaneous breathing. When heart function
      is restored, the cells of the body release molecules into the blood that cause inflammation,
      unstable blood pressure, organ dysfunction and death. Hemofiltration is a technique of
      washing the blood to remove fluid and molecules from it. Hemofiltration is a proven therapy
      for renal failure, but is considered investigational for treatment after resuscitation from
      cardiac arrest. Some experts believe that hemofiltration after heart function is restored can
      remove inflammation from the blood, maintain blood pressure and organ function. Others
      believe that intravenous fluid and medications are sufficient to maintain blood pressure and
      organ function. Since the inflammation that occurs after restoration of heart function lasts,
      the investigators continue hemofiltration for up to 48 hours. Whether hemofiltration or
      intravenous fluids and medications is better is not known. The investigators are checking if
      they can wash the blood of patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest before the investigators
      can begin a large randomized trial to test whether hemofiltration improves their outcome.

      The investigators are testing this by randomly allocating patients resuscitated from cardiac
      arrest to receive low volume hemofiltration, high volume hemofiltration, or intravenous
      fluids and medications alone. The null hypotheses are that less than 80% of eligible patients
      will be enrolled, and that less than 80% of enrolled patients will undergo low-volume or
      high-volume hemofiltration (HF) for at least 80% of 48 hours.

      between 32C and 34C if unconscious. Fluids, inotropes, vasopressors, vasodilators to maintain
      hemodynamics.

          <description>Control group: Initiate standard post-resuscitative care including triple lumen catheter to monitor central venous pressure, core temperature maintenance between 32C and 34C if unconscious via standard external cooling techniques. Fluids, 500-mL bolus of intravenous crystalloid every 30 minutes to achieve a central venous pressure of 8 to 12 mm Hg; inotropes, vasopressors if mean arterial pressure is less than 65 mm Hg; vasodilators, if mean arterial pressure is 90 mm Hg or above to maintain hemodynamics.
Percutaneous coronary intervention performed as soon as feasible in patients with ST elevation or left bundle branch block on initial ECG.
Serum biochemistry (including sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, glucose, calcium, phosphate, magnesium and lactate) monitored every 6 hours.</description>

Fluids, 500-mL bolus of intravenous crystalloid every 30 minutes to achieve a central venous pressure of 8 to 12 mmHg; inotropes, vasopressors if mean arterial pressure is less than 65 mmHg; vasodilators, if mean arterial pressure is 90 mmHg or above to maintain hemodynamics.

            <description>Control group: Initiate standard post-resuscitative care including triple lumen catheter to monitor central venous pressure, core temperature maintenance between 32C and 34C if unconscious via standard external cooling techniques. Fluids, 500-mL bolus of intravenous crystalloid every 30 minutes to achieve a central venous pressure of 8 to 12 mmHg; inotropes, vasopressors if mean arterial pressure is less than 65 mmHg; vasodilators, if mean arterial pressure is 90 mmHg or above to maintain hemodynamics.
Percutaneous coronary intervention performed as soon as feasible in patients with ST elevation or left bundle branch block on initial ECG.
Serum biochemistry (including sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, glucose, calcium, phosphate, magnesium and lactate) monitored every 6 hours.</description>

            <description>Low Volume Hemofiltration: Initiate standard post-resuscitative care as in control group. Hemofiltration x 48 hours via 11.5F double lumen venous catheter, blood flow 250 mL/h, ultrafiltration 45 mL/kg/h.
Low Volume Hemofiltration: Patients will receive isovolemic HF. Initial replacement solution will be Prismasol BGK 4/2.5. 3.1mg/dL phosphate (1.0 mmol/L) added to each bag. Replacement fluid adjusted as required based on chemistry values for sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, glucose, calcium, phosphate, magnesium and lactate.
Vascular access for HF will be via an 11.5-F, double-lumen venous catheter in a central vein. The hemofiltrate will be replaced by fluid infused before (i.e. predilution) and after (i.e. postdilution) the filter. A fixed ratio of 80:20 predilution:postdilution used. HF 1400 (i.e. polysulfone-based membrane) filters used throughout study. Hemofilter changed every 6h after initiation of HF, and as required.</description>
