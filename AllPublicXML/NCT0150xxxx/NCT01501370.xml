    <textblock>
      Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors represent a potential new class of antitumor agents.
      Vorinostat (suberoylanilide Hydroxamic acid, SAHA) inhibits the activity of all 11 known
      human class I and II HDACs. HDACs have many protein targets whose structure and function are
      altered by acetylation, including histones and non-histones proteins component of
      transcription factors controlling gene expression and proteins that regulate cell
      proliferation, migration and death (1). Vorinostat has undergone initial evaluation in
      several phase I and II clinical trials in both solid and hematologic malignancies. It has
      shown activity in hematologic malignancies including Hodgkin's disease and non Hodgkin's
      lymphomas (2-5); it has been approved for treatment of cutaneous manifestation in patients
      with primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma who have progressive, persistent or recurrent disease
      on or following two systemic therapies (6). HDAC function is critical for Multiple Myeloma
      (MM) cells by actively maintaining a transcriptional program indispensable for their
      uncontrolled proliferation and/or inappropriate resistance to pro-apoptotic stimuli. The
      pleiotropic anti-MM effects of Vorinostat and its ability to sensitize MM cellsto multiple
      conventional or novel agents (7) provide the framework for clinical trials of Vorinostat in
      MM. A phase I trial of oral Vorinostat alone in advanced MM shows modest activity, but
      treatment was generally well tolerated (common drug related adverse events (AEs) included
      fatigue, anorexia, dehydration, diarrhea and nausea and were mostly grade &lt; 2) (8). A phase I
      clinical trial of Vorinostat in association with Bortezomib in relapsed MM patients report a
      partial response (PR) rate of 42%, with responses occurring also in patients refractory to a
      previous Bortezomib based regimen. Treatment was generally well tolerated (main adverse
      events were myelosuppression, fatigue and diarrhea) (9). Lenalidomide is an active agent
      against MM, that as shown activity in both the relapse and newly diagnosed settings, in
      combination with chemotherapy or steroids only. The dose of Lenalidomide commonly used in the
      relapse setting, in association with steroids, is 25 mg/day on days 1-21 every 28 days (10,
      11). A recent phase I study evaluated the safety and tolerability of Vorinostat in
      combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in relapsed patients:no dose limiting
      toxicities prohibited dose escalation, the maximum tolerated dose has not been reached and
      the maximum administered dose was Lenalidomide 25 mg/day on days 1-21, Dexamethasone 40
      mg/day on days 1,8,15,22, Vorinostat 400 mg/day on days 1-7 and 15-21; each cycle was
      repeated every 28 days. Rate of at least PR was 51%, and activity was seen also in patients
      who received prior Lenalidomide therapy (clinical benefit reported in 69% of patients,
      including minimal response or better in 33% of Lenalidomide refractory patients). The most
      common drug related grade &gt; 3 AEs were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, anemia and
      fatigue (12). Since Vorinostat has shown efficacy also in patients previously treated with
      Lenalidomide, and in patients refractory to Lenalidomide, the investigators hypothesis is
      that the addition of Vorinostat and low-dose dexamethasone to Lenalidomide (ZLd), in patients
      experiencing a biochemical relapse during a Lenalidomide maintenance ongoing therapy, can
      overcome Lenalidomide-drug resistance and result in a significant response rate, that can
      translate into a significant improvement in survival of MM patients. The second hypothesis is
      that, since the dose of Lenalidomide commonly administered in maintenance therapy, is 10 mg
      days 1-21 every 28 days, the increase in Lenalidomide dose to the standard dose used for
      relapsing patients, plus low-dose Dexamethasone (Ld), in patients experiencing a biochemical
      relapse during a Lenalidomide ongoing maintenance, can as well overcome Lenalidomide-drug
      resistance and determine a significant response rate, that can translate into a significant
      improvement in survival of MM patients.

      This is a multicenter non comparative, randomized, open label, phase II study. Patients, who
      are receiving Lenalidomide maintenance treatment with or without prednisone, will be
      randomized to receive:

      Cohort 1: ZLd association:

      Lenalidomide orally at the dose of 25 mg/day for 21 days every 28 days Vorinostat orally at
      the dose of 400 mg/day on days 1-7 and 15- 21 on a 28-day cycle.

      Dexamethasone orally at the dose of 40 mg day 1,8, 15, 22 every 28 days.

      Cohort 2: Ld association:

      Lenalidomide orally at the dose of 25 mg/day for 21 days every 28 days Dexamethasone orally
      at the dose of 40 mg day 1,8, 15, 22 every 28 days.

      Patients must have a -confirmed diagnosis of relapsed multiple myeloma. In this Phase II
      study, a total of up to 35 patients in the ZLd cohort and 48 in the Ld cohort will be
      enrolled. It is anticipated that full accrual to this study will take approximately 36
      months.
