      The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of Kinesio Taping on gastrocnemius muscle
      activation during gait and on Range of ankle motion in postmenopausal females with Chronic
      Venous Insufficiency in initial stages in comparison to a placebo control group.

    <textblock>
      Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) is a very common disease. Patients with this pathology
      present peripheral muscle pump impairment and restricted range of ankle motion. Few data are
      available on the use in chronic venous insufficiency patients of Kinesio Taping, a physical
      therapist's elastic dressing that permits action on muscle activity and joint range.

    <measure>Change on surface electromyography in gastrocnemius muscles</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle activity data during gait is sampled at 1600 Hz by surface electromyography, applying electrodes at medial gastrocnemius and lateral gastrocnemius level in both legs. We follow Surface ElectroMyoGraphy for the Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles (SENIAM) guidelines for electrode placement and signal processing methods. The patient is instructed on the gait speed. After setting the speed-metronome, the electromyography image and activity is recorded for a total of seven seconds and expressed in microvolts units</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on range of ankle motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This variable is measured by using a digital goniometer(SG 110, Penny and Giles Biometrics Ltd;UK) during maximum dorsal and plantar flexion.A sensor is placed at 10 cm from the internal malleolus and another on the inner side of the foot, parallel to the axial axis and perpendicular to the tibial axis.The machine records the degrees of plantar and dorsal flexion from the neutral position of the ankle.</description>
