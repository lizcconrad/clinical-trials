  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether telemonitoring of patients with chronic
      heart failure produces a reduction in the combined end point of all cause mortality and
      number of hospitalisations, and whether it improves health related quality of life. In
      addition, the trials evaluate the economic and organisational impact of the telemonitoring
      service and examine its acceptability by patients and health professionals.

      The purpose of this study is to the evaluate the use of a mobile and PSTN phone-based
      telehealth platform will be able to produce a reduction in the combined end point of all
      cause mortality, will have positive or negative impact in their generic and disease specific
      quality of life , or their specific activity compared with usual care. Following this; it is
      also hypothesized that this will also lead to a change in overall risk for CHF complications.
      In addition the patients' satisfaction using the telemedicine service will be studied. A
      Cost-Effective Analysis and Cost Utility Analysis will evaluate the tele-health service
      compared with the usual care from the health and social perspective.

    <intervention_name>Home telemonitoring of patients with CHF</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients in the intervention group receive a personal 1-lead or 12-lead ECG recorder, a blood pressure monitor, a digital weight scale and appropriate education regarding the use of these devices. ThA trained nurse visits the patients weekly during the first month, and monthly thereafter, to confirm the appropriate use of the devices and services, to monitor symptoms, adherence to pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment, and to complete the case record forms when necessary.
If there is deterioration in the monitored vital signs, or if symptoms are reported, the allocated cardiologist is informed via the telehealth platform and has to decide whether the patient has to visit the hospital as in- or outpatient and whether the therapy has to be modified.</description>
