      The dose and the mode of administration of sublingual therapy remain open questions to
      determine the efficacy and safety of this desensitization therapy, the main purpose of this
      study is to evaluate if different routes of administration (oral-vestibular vs. sublingual)
      and a maximum dose of allergen administered are able to determine a different effect or a
      different incidence of side effects of the therapy in a group of patients with
      rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma due to ragweed

      Version 1 16/02/2011 The allergen-specific immunotherapy represents an important therapeutic
      option for the treatment of allergic respiratory diseases. Its clinical efficacy is well
      demonstrated, although the mechanism of action is still under study.

      The main purpose of immunotherapy is to induce an allergen-specific tolerance so that the
      natural exposure to the allergen does not cause clinical symptoms.

      The clinical efficacy of standard subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is known. A meta-analysis
      Cochrane on the clinical efficacy of SCIT in allergic rhinitis 51 double-blind studies with a
      total 2871 patients) demonstrated a reduction in symptoms in 73% of patients and a reduction
      in the use of drugs in 57%.

      Other studies also show that SCIT was effective in the long term (at least 3-5 years of
      suspension) reduces sensitization to new allergens, prevents progression of allergic rhinitis
      in asthma and significantly improves the symptoms of asthma, hyper- bronchial reactivity and
      the use of asthma medications.

      Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) represents an effective alternative route of administration
      of vaccine therapy with an allergic profile security than the SCIT.
