  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the current pilot study is to analyze MRI contrast-enhancement
      patterns in the hands of patients with fibromyalgia as compared to the findings in healthy
      controls. Further, to compare enhancement patterns obtained in fibromyalgia patients with
      those described in inflammatory joint disorders, i.e. rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic
      arthritis.

      Hypothesis:

      Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) of the hands in patients with fibromyalgia reveals
      pathological imaging patterns indicative of diffuse non-arthrogenic inflammation of e.g.
      superficial soft tissues and /or muscle with patterns distinct from those of inflammatory
      joint disorders e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systematic, diagnostic studies applying DCE-MRI have never been performed in patients with
      fibromyalgia. However, characteristic contrast-enhancement patterns different from those seen
      in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis have been observed in a small
      sample of fibromyalgia patients referred for DCE-MRI of the hands for differential diagnostic
      purposes at department of radiology, Frederiksberg Hospital. In these patients enhancement
      parameters indicative of vasodilatation and diffuse hyperperfusion involving subcutaneous
      tissues and muscles of the hands and fingers were found, whereas no synovial inflammation in
      joints or tendons could be demonstrated in the majority of these patients. Whether these
      observations are part of a &quot;normal&quot; physiological perfusion in healthy individual or a
      potential novel marker of disease activity remains to be studied.

      If a pathological imaging pattern indicative of superficial soft tissue or muscle
      inflammation/hyper perfusion can be demonstrated it will have far-reaching implications for
      future research related to this patient population. Not only may this line of research
      contribute to a better neurobiological understanding of fibromyalgia and the neurobiological
      link between inflammation and pain modulation, but also to the development of more objective
      examination methods, which will make diagnosing more reliable and less subjective. Further, a
      better understanding of the neurobiology and phenomenological manifestations of fibromyalgia
      may have critical treatment implications

        Patients with fibromyalgia recruited from Department of Rheumatology, Frederiksberg
        Hospital. Inclusion in the study will be based on clinical assessment by a specialist in
        rheumatology and member of the research team. Patients fulfilling the 1990-ACR criteria for
        fibromyalgia and with pain in the hands as a prominent clinical feature will be referred
        for DCE-MRI as part of the diagnostic workup.

        Healthy controls will be recruited by advertisement at www.forsøgsperson.dk or in the daily
        press and included in the project based on written, informed consent.
