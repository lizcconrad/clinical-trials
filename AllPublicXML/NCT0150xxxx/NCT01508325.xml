  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, randomized, open-label parallel trial to demonstrate the superiority
      and/or non-inferiority of bisoprolol on metoprolol succinate sustained-release (SR) tablet in
      subjects with mild to moderate primary hypertension.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objectives:

      To demonstrate that bisoprolol is superior in mean ambulatory heart rate and/or non-inferior
      in mean ambulatory DBP as compared with metoprolol SR in the last 4 hours after 12-week
      active treatment in subjects with mild to moderate essential hypertension (EH).

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To compare the efficacy of the 2 study drugs by 24h ambulatory monitoring by several
           parameters at different times (Example: blood pressure, heart rate, their variability,
           etc...) after 12-week treatment from baseline among subjects with mild to moderate EH

        2. To evaluate safety of the two drugs

        3. To evaluate the treatment compliance of the two drugs

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Ambulatory Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) in the Last 4 Hours After 12-week Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) determined blood pressure 3 times hourly in the daytime and once hourly in the nighttime. Only monitoring data with valid data greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 80 percent (%) was used for analysis. Each ABPM lasted for at least 24 hours. The first dynamic blood pressure monitoring was used as baseline. The difference between the mean ambulatory DBP observed in the last 4 hours after 12-week treatment and baseline was calculated to find out the change of mean ambulatory DBP at the end of the treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Ambulatory Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) in the Last 4 Hours After 12-week Treatment</title>
        <description>Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) determined blood pressure 3 times hourly in the daytime and once hourly in the nighttime. Only monitoring data with valid data greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 80 percent (%) was used for analysis. Each ABPM lasted for at least 24 hours. The first dynamic blood pressure monitoring was used as baseline. The difference between the mean ambulatory DBP observed in the last 4 hours after 12-week treatment and baseline was calculated to find out the change of mean ambulatory DBP at the end of the treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Ambulatory Daytime Blood Pressure at Week 12</title>
        <description>The ABPM determined blood pressure 3 times hourly in the daytime. Only monitoring data with valid data &gt;=80% was used for analysis. Each ABPM lasted for at least 24 hours. The first dynamic daytime blood pressure monitoring was used as baseline. The difference between the mean ambulatory daytime blood pressure observed at Week 12 and baseline was calculated to find out the change of mean ambulatory daytime blood pressure at the end of the treatment. Daytime in this study was defined as time between 06:00 am to 10:00 pm.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Ambulatory Night-time Heart Rate at Week 12</title>
          <description>Pulse rate was measured by palpation on radial artery for 1 minute. Two measurements were made at least 1 to 2 minutes apart. Finally mean heart rate was recorded. The first measured heart rate was used as baseline heart rate. The difference between the nighttime heart rate at Week 12 treatment and of the baseline heart rate was calculated to measure the change of mean ambulatory nighttime heart rate at the end of the treatment. Nighttime was defined as 10:00 pm to 06:00 am.</description>
