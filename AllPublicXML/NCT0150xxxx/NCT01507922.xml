  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized double-blind parallel phase IV study to compare Fenoverine and Trimebutine
      maleate in the efficacy and safety.

      Study Hypothesis: Fenoverine is non-inferior to Trimebutine maleate in its efficacy and
      safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For subjects with IBS, Fenoverine and Trimebutine will be administered orally for 8 weeks;
      Fenoverine 100mg capsule three times a day and Trimebutine 150mg tablet three times a day.
      Because one is capsule and the other is tablet, double dummy design will be used. Efficacy is
      evaluated at the end of 8 weeks and safety will be followed for 4 more weeks after the end of
      the scheduled medication.
