  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to determine whether one injection with plasma into the origin of
      the plantar fascia is an effective treatment of plantar fasciitis.

      90 patients will be randomized into three groups. 30 patients will be treated with one plasma
      injection, 30 patients will be treated with one injection with saline and 30 patients will do
      physiotherapy and use heel cups. The two groups who receive injections will do the same
      physiotherapy and use heel cups, as the conservatively treated group.

      Both groups randomized to receive an injection will have a 10 ml blood sample taken from
      their cubital vein. The sample is centrifuged for 5 minutes at 5000 rpm. No additives are
      added. 3 ml of plasma i obtained, and the syringe i blinded. Is the patient randomized to
      receive an injection with saline, a similar syringe is blinded with 3 ml of saline. The
      injection into to the origin of the plantar fascia i done 10 minutes after the sample of
      blood is obtained. The content of the syringe i blinded to both the investigator and the
      patient.

      The injection i performed from the medial aspect of the heel under guidance of ultrasound. No
      local/systemic analgetic is used. The content of the syringe is spread using peppering
      technique into the origin of the plantar fascia.

      Patients will do questionnaires at inclusion and after 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months. The
      questionaires will be Foot Function Index and SF-36 as well as questions about their use of
      analgetics, use of heel cups and intensity of their physiotherapy
