  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is determine if 2 cycles of SGN-35 can be used instead of ICE prior
      to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for relapsed and refractory HL. There are 2 steps
      to treating patients with relapsed or refractory HL. The first step is to shrink the lymphoma
      with chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen commonly used is called ICE. ICE is a combination
      of chemotherapy drugs: ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. The second step of treatment
      is to give high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy followed by infusion of stem
      cells. This is called an ASCT. This study will focus on the first step of treatment for
      relapsed and refractory HL.

      ICE chemotherapy can cause many side effects. We believe that there are patients who can
      receive less toxic treatments and still do well. We have learned from past studies that
      [18F]FDG-PET scans (which we will call &quot;PET scans&quot;) can be used to predict who will do well
      after ASCT. PET scans are tests used to measure the metabolic activity of the disease.
      Patients without abnormal activity on their PET scan (negative PET scan) before ASCT are much
      more likely to be cured than those with activity on their PET scan (positive PET scan).

      In this study, instead of beginning with ICE chemotherapy, the patient will receive a new
      drug called Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35). SGN-35 is a type of drug called an antibody drug
      conjugate. SGN-35 has 2 parts; a part that targets cancer cells (the antibody) and a cell
      killing part (the chemotherapy). The antibody part of SGN-35 sticks to a target called CD30.
      CD30 is an important molecule on some cancer cells (including Hodgkin lymphoma) and some
      normal cells of the immune system. The cell killing part of SGN-35 is a chemotherapy called
      monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE).

      It can kill cells that the antibody part of SGN-35 sticks to.

      Compared to ICE chemotherapy, SGN-has fewer side effects and does not require inpatient
      admission for treatment. We aim to determine whether patients can avoid treatment with ICE
      prior to ASCT. We will use the results of the PET scan to determine whether the patient needs
      additional chemotherapy before ASCT. If the PET scan is negative, the patient will be
      referred to ASCT and not receive ICE chemotherapy. If the PET scan is positive, the physician
      will discuss further treatment options with the patient.

Following augmented ICE, patients with negative FDG-PET/CT will proceed to ASCT.

    <description>Patients will receive 2 cycles of weekly brentuximab vedotin, 1.2mg/kg on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 day cycle. Patients with pre-treatment positive bone marrow biopsies will have repeat bone marrow biopsies if the PET scan is negative. FDG-PET/CT will be repeated after 2 cycles of treatment within 1 week of the last dose of cycle 2. Patients with persistent abnormalities on FDG-PET/CT following 2 cycles of brentuximab vedotin will receive 2 cycles of augmented ICE. The first cycle of augmented ICE will be initiated 7-14 days after the last dose of SGN-35. FDG-PET/CT will be repeated within 7-14 days following the second cycle of augmented ICE. Stem cell mobilization can be performed following the first or second cycle of augmented ICE.</description>
