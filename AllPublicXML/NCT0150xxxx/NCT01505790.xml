  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndromes are related to the development of a platelet derived thrombus on a
      ruptured coronary atheroma. Use of dual antiplatelet therapy aspirin-thienopyridine a
      significantly reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However despite these therapeutic innovations, the
      rate of MACE in patients treated using PCI and particularly in those suffering of an acute
      coronary syndrome is around 5% in randomized trials. Within the factors associated with MACE,
      high on treatment platelet reactivity following clopidogrel loading dose has been identified
      as a key factor. In fact it is widely recognized that there is a large inter individual
      variability in clopidogrel responsiveness. In addition several authors have demonstrated a
      strong link between high on treatment platelet reactivity following clopidogrel loading dose
      and the occurrence of post PCI MACE. Vasodilator Phosphoprotein index measurement (VASP
      index) enables a reproducible, standardized and specific assessment of clopidogrel
      responsiveness.

      The investigators previous works have demonstrated that a VASP index ≥ 50% had a high
      negative predictive value for post PCI MACE in patients undergoing PCI and that tailored
      clopidogrel loading dose in order to obtain a VASP index &lt; 50% before PCI resulted in a
      reduction in the rate of post PCI MACE.

      Prasugrel is a new generation thienopyridine with a faster and more powerful anti platelet
      effect compared to clopidogrel. It was shown to be superior to clopidogrel to reduce post PCI
      MACE in acute coronary syndromes. However in this randomized trial prasugrel achieved an
      excessive blockade of platelet reactivity responsible for a significant increase in bleeding
      events in some patients and an insufficient blockade in up to 325% of the remaining patients.

      Therefore the investigators hypothesized that a strategy of individually tailored loading and
      maintenance dose of clopidogrel may be superior to prasugrel standard therapy in achieving an
      optimal platelet reactivity inhibition in acute coronary syndrome patients undergoing PCI.

    <description>600 mg clopidogrel will be administered during the first 6 to 12 hours then a measure of platelets reactivity will be done. An additional administration of clopidogrel (600 mg) could be done every 6 hours until to obtain a VASP &lt;50%. No more than 3 * 600mg of clopidogrel will be authorized in this protocol.
Then for patient which have received more than one dose of clopidogrel 600mg , 150 mg per day of clopidogrel will be administrated, for which who have received only one dose of 600mg of clopidogrel , 75 mg per day will be administrated during one month at least.</description>
