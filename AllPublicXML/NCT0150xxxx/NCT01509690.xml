  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end-stage renal disease are most vulnerable in the early months following
      hemodialysis (HD) initiation. Data from the United States Renal Data System and Singapore
      Renal Registry showed high mortality rates in the first 3-12 months of dialysis.
      Comprehensive multidisciplinary intervention programs implemented in the initial 3-4 months
      of dialysis showed reduction in mortality and morbidity in incident dialysis patients in the
      United States.

      Based on these models, the Hemodialysis Initiation and Transition (HIT) Clinic involving a
      renal physician, clinical pharmacist and coordinator was set up. The main aim of the clinic
      is to provide multidisciplinary, intensive and consistent care to patients in the first 3 to
      4 months after HD initiation to focus on and streamline the management of dialysis issues and
      complications. These interventions would help patients achieve goal therapeutic targets, as
      well as reduce hospitalization rates and mortality, thereby improving their clinical outcomes
      and self-reported quality of life, and could result in economic and cost savings for the
      patients and healthcare system. The purpose of this study is to determine if the
      multidisciplinary, intensive and collaborative management of our multiethnic Asian patients
      newly-initiated on HD improves laboratory, clinical, economic and patient-reported outcomes.

      Adult incident HD patients from NUH will be randomized to the HIT clinic or to conventional
      management. Information on demographics, medical/medication histories, laboratory data
      (dialysis adequacy, iron-deficiency anemia, mineral/bone disorder, malnutrition and
      diabetes), hospitalizations, deaths and medical costs will be obtained and compared between
      the 2 groups. Patient-reported outcomes will be measured using the Kidney Disease Quality of
      Life-Short Form, EuroQol 5 Dimensions, Family Functioning Measure, Oslo-3 Social Support
      Scale and Health Services Utilization questionnaires. Data collection will take place at
      baseline, 3 to 4 months and 12 months after the first visit, with a total study duration and
      follow-up period of 1 year.

Subjects will be seen in a multidisciplinary, intensive management clinic involving a renal physician, a clinical pharmacist trained in renal pharmacotherapy and a renal coordinator. The main aim of this clinic is to provide multidisciplinary, intensive and consistent care in the first 3 to 4 months after HD initiation to streamline the management of the patients. Specific objectives of this clinic include providing patients with educational materials and information to enable a better understanding of their disease process, providing uniform anemia and renal bone disease management, increasing permanent HD access [arteriovenous (AV) fistula or graft] placement, increasing transplant referrals, providing suitable vaccinations to all patients, as well as reducing hospitalizations for fluid overload, uncontrolled hypertension and anemia-related complications.</description>
