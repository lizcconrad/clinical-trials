    <textblock>
      Ceftazidime is a broad spectrum cephalosporin with high activity against a variety of
      Gram-negative pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An open-label study of intravenous
      ceftazidime pharmacokinetics will be performed in patients undergoing intermittent
      hemodialysis at Northwestern Memorial Hospital to determine the clearance of ceftazidime in
      high flux hemodialysis.

    <description>Serial blood draws will be performed at the following times in hours (time 0 = end of infusion): the time immediately before hemodialysis, 0.5, 4, and immediately before the next dose of ceftazidime. Any extra blood from samples drawn by the primary provider per routine care during the study period will also be considered for capture if it would routinely be discarded. The blood draws for this study will occur over a period of 72 hours (i.e. until the day of the following hemodialysis session).</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients are male or female adults ≥18 years of age with an expected hospital
             stay of at least 48 hours, who have end-stage renal disease and been receiving
             intermittent hemodialysis for at least 90 days.

          -  Eligible patients will additionally have either central or peripheral intravenous
             access, and will already be prescribed ceftazidime per their primary providers.

          -  Written informed consent in a form approved by Northwestern Memorial Hospital,
             Northwestern University Institutional Review Board, and Midwestern University
             Institutional Review Board will be completed by the patient prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that only receive one dose of ceftazidime in total

          -  Patients with potentially altered pharmacokinetic parameters (pregnant patients, burn
             patients, and those that are morbidly obese (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2).
