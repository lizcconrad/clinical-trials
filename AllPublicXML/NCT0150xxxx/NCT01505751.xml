  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      G9a protein was approved to be highly associated with recurrence of breast cancer, gastric
      cancer, hepatocellular cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer. Therefore, the aim of this
      study was to clarify the association and G9a protein and cervical cancer by analyzing the
      immunohistochemical staining of G9a protein to the histopathologic specimen of cervical
      cancer and clinical data.
