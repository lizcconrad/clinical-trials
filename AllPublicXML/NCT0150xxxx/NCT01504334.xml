  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive form of lung disease
      characterized by fibrosis of the supporting framework (interstitium) of the lungs. By
      definition, the term is used only when the cause of the pulmonary fibrosis is unknown
      (&quot;idiopathic&quot;). Microscopically, lung tissue from patients shows a characteristic set of
      histologic/pathologic features known as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). UIP is therefore
      the pathologic counterpart of IPF.Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by
      radiographically evident interstitial infiltrates predominantly affecting the lung bases and
      by progressive dyspnea and worsening of pulmonary function. No therapy has been clearly shown
      to prolong survival. The current strict definition of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis provides
      a new focus for basic and clinical research that will improve insight into the pathogenesis
      of this disorder and stimulate the development of novel therapies.

      Pirfenidone has proven antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in various in vitro
      systems and animal models of pulmonary fibrosis, although its precise mechanism of action
      remains unclear. It attenuates fibroblast proliferation, production of fibrosis-associated
      proteins and cytokines, and the increased biosynthesis and accumulation of extracellular
      matrix in response to cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β. It is also shown to
      slow tumor cell proliferation by inhibiting fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor
      and platelet-derived growth factor.

      Pirfenidone has not been widely approved for clinical use in China, in this study, safety and
      efficacy were evaluated to see if pirfenidone has a significant advantage over placebo in
      terms of improving lung function and life quality etc. (see primary and secondary criteria)
      or slows down the deterioration of lung function in Chinese subjects diagnosed with IPF.

    <description>Method: The walking test is conducted in a corridor 33 meters long. The patient is instructed to &quot;walk from end to end, covering as much ground as they can in the allotted time&quot;. The total distance ambulated in meters during the 6-minute walk test and the number of rest stops is recorded. 6MWD, weight, heart rate, BP, SpO2, and a self-reported rating of perceived exertion [modified Borg RPE scale rating (0 to 10 scale)] is recorded after the walk.</description>
