  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the anatomical and visual recovery of eyes with
      traumatic macular hole (TMH) following either early vitrectomy or 6-month observation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who received vitrectomy immediately after the injury were compared with patients who
      were observed for six months for spontaneously closure.The closure rate, foveal
      microstructure, and final visual acuity were analyzed.
