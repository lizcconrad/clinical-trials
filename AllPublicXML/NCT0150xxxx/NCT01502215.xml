  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood transfusion during perioperative period in patients undergoing to major surgery has
      been associated to several postoperative complications. Particularly in oncologic surgery,
      red blood cell transfusion has been investigated as a factor of worse outcome and cancer
      recurrence due to postoperative impairment of cellular immunity. Although red blood cell
      transfusion has decreased in worldwide clinical practice, this issue still remains a matter
      of controversy in oncologic surgery. There are no prospective studies comparing outcomes
      between restrictive or liberal of blood transfusion strategy in oncologic surgery. This study
      is a prospective and randomized study comparing clinical outcomes between two strategies of
      transfusion in oncologic surgery - liberal or restrictive
