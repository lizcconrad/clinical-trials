    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to determine if a Fitbit, a kind of accelerometer, provides feedback
      to subjects combined with an activity counseling program will result in an increase in
      physical activity of at least 20%.

    <description>The accelerometer, Fitbit, will be worn continuously. Fitbit can provide feedback to subjects about their physical activity. Subjects will wear the Fitbit for two weeks (without feedback) to obtain baseline activity data. The experimental group will then be instructed on use of the fitbit. Subjects will meet with the exercise counselor who will use accelerometer data to provide feedback and counseling to help the user increase their activity by at least 20% each day. In subjects who achieve an increase of 20%, the counseling will focus either on maintaining activity levels or increasing activity further depending on the desire of the subject. Counseling will be provided once weekly by phone and in person at least once a month. Following the 26th week the experimental subjects will continue to wear the Fitbit and receive feedback about their activity levels for an additional 24 weeks, but they will no longer receive counseling.</description>

               2. Do you feel pain in your chest when you do physical activity?

               3. In the past month, have you had chest pain when you were not doing physical
                  activity?
