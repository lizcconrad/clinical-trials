    <textblock>
      Probiotics are suggested to have beneficial effects in atopic dermatitis (AD) treatment and
      prevention but their precise role is not yet clear.

      The aim of this randomized double blinded active treatment vs placebo study was to evaluate
      clinical efficacy of intake of a combination of two probiotics (Lactobacillus salivarius LS01
      and Bifidobacterium breve BR03) for the treatment of adult AD patients.

      The rationale for the use of probiotics in the treatment of atopic dermatitis would be due to
      some experimental hypotheses:

        1. The use of these microbial agents at an early age seems to play an important role in
           inducing immunity T type 1 (Th1) and inhibit the development of a Th2 response IgE
           mediated

        2. the normal intestinal flora (including probiotics) would play an important role in
           inducing immunological tolerance

        3. the hygiene hypothesis that the reduced bacterial environment would favour a type 2
           response T and the development of allergic diseases
