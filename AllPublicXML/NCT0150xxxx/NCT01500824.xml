  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label multi-center Phase 2 efficacy and safety study of crizotinib in East
      Asian patients with advanced Non-Squamous NSCLC harboring a translocation or inversion event
      involving the ALK gene locus who have received only one prior chemotherapy regimen for
      advanced NSCLC and this regimen must have been platinum-based. Primary objective of this
      study is to assess the anti-tumor activity and safety profile of crizotinib. Secondary
      objectives are to evaluate clinical efficacy including median progression-free survival (PFS)
      and 1-year PFS rate, overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR) at 6 and 12 weeks,
      time to response (TTR), and duration of response (DR).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Proven diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous cell carcinoma of the
             lung

          -  Positive for translocation or inversion events involving the ALK gene locus

          -  Patients must have had progressive disease after only one prior chemotherapy regimen.
             This regimen must have been platinum-based and may have included maintenance therapy.

          -  Evidence of personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the
             patient (or legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all the pertinent
             aspects of the trial prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current treatment on another therapeutic clinical trial.

          -  Prior therapy directly targeting ALK.

          -  Any of the following within the 3 months prior to starting study treatment: myocardial
             infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft,
             congestive heart failure, or cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic
             attack.

          -  Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE Grade &gt;=2, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation
             of any grade, or QTc interval &gt;470 msec.

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding.

          -  Use of drugs or foods that are known potent CYP3A inducers/inhibitors/substrates with
             narrow therapeutic indices.

          -  Known HIV infection

          -  Known interstitial lung disease or interstitial fibrosis

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions (including severe gastrointestinal
             conditions such as diarrhea or ulcer) or psychiatric conditions, or laboratory
             abnormalities that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator and/or sponsor,
             excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, and
             which would, therefore, make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
