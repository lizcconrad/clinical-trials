    <textblock>
      This study looks at the potential benefits of combining cognitive training (mental exercises)
      together with transcranial magnetic stimulation (also known as TMS) to see if this can make a
      difference in the condition of people with Alzheimer's disease by improving their disease and
      the cognitive decline that goes along with it.

      This study takes place in Boston, Massachusetts and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The
      treatment portion of the study requires patients to visit the BIDMC daily, Monday through
      Friday, for 6 weeks. All participants will receive real cognitive training, but half of our
      participants will receive active TMS treatment and half will receive a placebo TMS treatment.
      However, those receiving the placebo treatment will be offered the real treatment upon the
      completion of the study. This study goes up to approximately 4.5 months.

      TMS is a noninvasive way of stimulating the brain, which is not painful and does not involve
      any needles or any form of surgery. It acts by delivering a magnetic stimulation to a
      particular region of your brain and that, coupled with the cognitive training, is what is
      being looked at in this study. The investigators are examining if this combination of TMS and
      cognitive training will improve your memory function and other mental functions such as
      language, orientation, and thinking or judgment.

    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre treatment; 1 month post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment to measure the severity of all of the most important symptoms of Alzheimer's disease: loss of memory, language, praxis, and attention. The total scoring range is 0-70, with 0 representing the least impairment and 70 the most severe impairment. The results posted below represent a change in score from baseline. A positive change represents an improvement on the ADAS-Cog (change = 1 month score - baseline score).</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, 1 month post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI is a three-item scale used to assess treatment response in psychiatric patients. The CGI-C subset measures the global improvement or change from baseline. Scores range from 0 to 7, with 0 indicating marked improvement and 7 indicating marked worsening. The scores below represent the percent change of the scores from baseline.</description>

    <description>23 item scale to assess activities of daily living. Scores range from 0 to 78 with a higher score indicating less functional impairment. The scores reported below are the means of the actual scores from the assessments representing the percent change from baseline.</description>
