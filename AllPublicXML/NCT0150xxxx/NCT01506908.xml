    <description>Participants completed a nicotine craving assessment consisting of following five items: I have a desire for a cigarette right now, if it were possible I would smoke right now, All I want right now is a cigarette, I have an urge for a cigarette, I crave a cigarette right now. All participants indicated their craving intensity on a pre-drawn 100 mm scale ranging from 0 (disagree) to 100 (agree). At the end of the craving assessment period, mean VAS score was measured.</description>

    <description>AE was defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment/s. Treatment related AE was defined as any AE considered to be possibly, probably or highly probably related to study medication. SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death; is life threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization results in disability/ incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect.</description>
