  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip osteoarthritis is degeneration of hip cartilage and inflammation of subchondral bone and
      soft tissue linings. Patients have pain, stiffness, swelling, and difficulty walking. There
      are treatments available to help manage these symptoms like weight loss, and analgesics.
      Surgery is the appropriate treatment in patients who have failed these conservative
      treatments. The aim of this clinical study is to assess safety of autologous cultured
      chondrocyte intra-articular injection and obtain its clinical results in patients with severe
      hip osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this phase I clinical study 6 patients with severe hip osteoarthritis will be recruited.
      All patients will have a cartilage biopsy taken from the knee cartilage non-weight bearing
      zone. Chodrocytes will be extracted and cultured for 4 weeks. Patients then will receive
      chondrocyte injection under the guide of fluoroscopy. Patients will be evaluated post
      injection for 6 months at time intervals. Parameters considered being evaluated are, adverse
      effects, pain intensity and joint physical function and cartilage repair. These effects are
      measured by Visual Analogue Scale, WOMAC, Harris Hip Score questionnaire and MRI.
