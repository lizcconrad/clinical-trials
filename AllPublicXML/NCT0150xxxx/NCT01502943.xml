      The purpose of the trial is to take stable angina pectoris of coronary heart disease (CHD) as
      examples to build a standard evaluation system for efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine
      (TCM).

        1. Studies of evaluating reliability, validity and reactivates of Patients Report Outcomes
           of CHD and self-administrated scale of Stable Angina Pectoris

        2. research on all indicators of CHD, and analyze their characteristics, target and
           function

        3. theory of Invigorating Spleen to Remove Phlegm or replenish Qi, and activating blood and
           dissolving stasis as an example for clinical efficacy evaluation.

      Clinical efficacy is the basis of traditional Chinese medicine development, and scientific
      evaluation of TCM clinical efficacy and its effectiveness is the way to push TCM modernized
      and international. TCM theories of Overall concept and Differentiation for life science and
      diseases are hard to be generally accepted. Besides, no unified and standard methods fit to
      evaluate the TCM clinical efficacy. Thus, there is a need to do a deeper research of
      methodology, evaluative index, and evaluative criteria in order to guide the evaluation of
      TCM clinical efficacy.

      Based on the situation above, the study aims to choose the best and characteristic evaluative
      index of clinical efficacy, compare the demand among practitioners, patients and care givers.
      After data collected, a new cluster of index among Biochemical, patients report outcomes,
      endpoint indicators, and TCM soft indicators could be constituted and analyzed to use in
      respective way according to their characteristics, target and function.
