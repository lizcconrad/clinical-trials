  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal Ketalar (ketamine
      hydrochloride) in the treatment of primary symptom manifestations of pediatric bipolar
      disorder; Fear of Harm (FOH) phenotype. This phenotype represents those children who are most
      resistant to traditional treatments and suffer repeated hospitalizations. Primary symptoms
      include fearfulness, aggression secondary to threat, mood and/or arousal instability, and
      psychosis. In addition to evaluation of efficacy and safety, the investigators will also
      analyze whether therapeutic response depends upon the degree to which the subject fits the
      FOH phenotype.

    <description>Separate dosing regimens will be applied depending on the weight of the child. Group A with minimum-maximum weight of 20 kg-40 kg will receive a fixed initial dose of 10 mg ketamine(0.25-0.5mg/kg)and will not exceed a maximum dose of 40 mg ketamine. Group B with minimum - maximum weight of 40.01kg-100kg will get a fixed initial dose of 20 mg ketamine(0.20-0.5mg/kg) and will not exceed a maximum dose of 120mg. ketamine. There will be 4 administrations of the drug at three day intervals. Titration upward will depend upon degree of side effects, improvement from baseline on primary measures, subjective opinion. Doses will be held constant as long as a therapuetic response, as measure of 80% improvement on YBOCS and YMRS, is reached.</description>
