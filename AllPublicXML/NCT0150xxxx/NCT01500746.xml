      This study evaluates the effectiveness of pulse lavage therapy in decreasing bacterial counts
      in chronic wounds.

    <textblock>
      Pulse lavage irrigation is an effective method of cleaning both acute and chronic wounds. The
      major drawback to pulse irrigation is that it is extremely messy and can easily contaminate
      the patient's surroundings, putting other patients and the person operating the device at
      risk. In order to obtain the benefits of pulse lavage, we have created a device that will
      contain the water spray from the lavage and protect both the patient and their surroundings.
      Due to the fact that frequent (multiple times daily) pulse lavage therapy has not been
      possible previously, it is unknown how effectively serial pulse lavage irrigation reduces
      bacterial counts. This study evaluates the effectiveness of serial pulse lavage therapy in
      decreasing bacterial counts in chronic wounds.

    <description>A punch biopsy of the wound will be taken once the subject is enrolled in the study. A repeat biopsy will be taken after the 8th lavage treatment or the 8th dressing change. These will be sent for bacterial count analysis and the difference in bacterial counts will be evaluated. The lavage fluid from baseline measurements will be filtered and sent for bacterial counts and will be compared to the filtered fluid from the last lavage treatment. In addition, surface swabs will be taken at the beginning and end of the study and will be sent for bacterial counts as well. Bacterial counts from these lavage, biopsy specimen, and swabs will be averaged and analyzed.</description>

        <description>A punch biopsy of the wound will be taken once the subject is enrolled in the study. A repeat biopsy will be taken after the 8th lavage treatment or the 8th dressing change. These will be sent for bacterial count analysis and the difference in bacterial counts will be evaluated. The lavage fluid from baseline measurements will be filtered and sent for bacterial counts and will be compared to the filtered fluid from the last lavage treatment. In addition, surface swabs will be taken at the beginning and end of the study and will be sent for bacterial counts as well. Bacterial counts from these lavage, biopsy specimen, and swabs will be averaged and analyzed.</description>

Bacterial counts and gene expression analysis will be performed prior to the first dressing change and after the last dressing change.</description>

          <title>Change in Bacterial Counts</title>
          <description>A punch biopsy of the wound will be taken once the subject is enrolled in the study. A repeat biopsy will be taken after the 8th lavage treatment or the 8th dressing change. These will be sent for bacterial count analysis and the difference in bacterial counts will be evaluated. The lavage fluid from baseline measurements will be filtered and sent for bacterial counts and will be compared to the filtered fluid from the last lavage treatment. In addition, surface swabs will be taken at the beginning and end of the study and will be sent for bacterial counts as well. Bacterial counts from these lavage, biopsy specimen, and swabs will be averaged and analyzed.</description>

          <description>This group will serve as the experimental arm. They will undergo twice daily pulse lavage of their wounds for 4 days. In between the lavage treatments, their wounds will be dressed with moist gauze.
Pulse lavage treatment: A pulse lavage machine will be used to irrigate the wound with a total of 4 liters of water, twice daily, for a total of 4 days (8 treatments).</description>
