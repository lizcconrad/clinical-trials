  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the functional effects of a citicoline, creatine,
      and omega-3 fatty acids combination when administered for a duration of four weeks (28 days)
      to non-psychiatric adult female participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard clinical measures for mood and neuropsychological measures of attention, cognitive
      inhibition and memory will be applied before, during, and after a course of a daily
      supplementation of citicoline, creatine and omega-3 for 28 days to non-psychiatric adult
      female participants. We hypothesis that the combination of supplements will improve memory
      and attention in healthy adult women.
