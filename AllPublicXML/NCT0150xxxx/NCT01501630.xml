      Compare PET/CT and MRI for the early detection of bone metastases of prostate cancer:
      diagnostic performance and impact on the patient management.Determine the lowest cost
      strategy according to the precise clinical circumstances.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with high risk prostate cancer and high PSA levels, PET/CT with fluoride (18F)
      and FLUOROCHOLINE (18F) and whole-body MRI will be performed within one month.

      Data of a 6 month follow-up after those examination will be made available to a panel of
      independent experts. They will determine the standard of truth (SOT) concerning the invasion
      of the skeleton and also of soft tissue by prostate cancer tissue, the impact of each imaging
      modality on patient management and the adequacy of the decisions. In some cases (anti-hormone
      treatment without histology), it will not be possible to determine the SOT.

      By comparison of the results of blind readings for each imaging modality with the standard of
      truth, the diagnostic performance will be determined.

      By simulation, several strategies will be constructed concerning the best examinations to be
      performed and the sequence according to the precise clinical circumstances. Their cost and
      effectiveness will be evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18

          -  Histologically proven prostate cancer.

          -  Abnormal plasmatic level of prostate specific antigen dating less than 3 months,
             initial Gleason score available

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other active cancer or bone infection.

          -  Chemotherapy or change in hormone therapy since the last PSA assay

          -  Contraindication to MRI without contrast agent (claustrophobia, pace maker, metallic
