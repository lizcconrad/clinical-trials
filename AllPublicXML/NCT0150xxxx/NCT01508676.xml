  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the drug Pennsaid (Diclofenac) can help reduce pain
      felt by people with chronic nerve pain. The drug will be used 2-4 times each day for 2 weeks.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Pennsaid to treat osteoarthritis
      (bone pain), but the FDA has not approved Pennsaid to treat neuropathic (nerve) pain.

      The research study will compare Pennsaid to placebo.

      The research study will compare Pennsaid to placebo. The placebo looks like Pennsaid, but it
      doesn't contain any Pennsaid. The investigators use placebos in research to see if the
      results are due to the study drug or to other reasons. At some time during the study the
      investigators will give the patient Pennsaid. At another time, the investigators will give
      the patient placebo. The investigators are using Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST), which is
      temperature testing before and after using the study drug to see if Pennsaid is helpful in
      reducing people's nerve pain.

      In this test, a small metal plate, about the size of a matchbox, is put on the area where the
      patient has pain. The plate is connected to a computer that can warm or cool the plate. The
      patient will use a computer mouse button to tell us when the plate feels warm. The QST
      machine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is often used by nerve
      doctors to see if a person has neuropathy (pain caused by damage to a nerve).

    <description>Subjects rated their pain using the Visual Analog Scale after a 2 week phase of using pennsaid lotion and after a 2 week phase of using placebo lotion.
The Visual Analog Scale is subject reported on a scale of 0-10 with 0 being no pain, and 10 being the worst pain they can imagine. Results reported are an average of reported VAS scores for the 28 subjects who completed both phase I and phase II of the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject will be between 18 and 80 years of age.

          2. Subject has not been on Pennsaid or other topical non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
             for at least one month.

          3. Subject agrees to make no change in his/her current pain medications during the entire
             study period. This requirement will ensure that valid comparisons of primary and
             secondary measures can be made before and after the study.

          4. Subject has a VAS pain score of 4 or above at the beginning of the study.

          5. Subject has had a neuropathic pain condition such as those listed above for at least
             three months. This requirement is to avoid clinical uncertainty from an unstable pain
             condition and to minimize the study variation.

          6. Female subjects of childbearing age must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the
             initial visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has documented severe liver or renal disease that will affect the elimination
             of Pennsaid or is subject to the adverse effect of Pennsaid on these organs. (Renal
             dysfunction is defined as eGFR &lt; 60. Hepatic dysfunction is defined as LFTs â‰¥ 3X ULN.)

          2. Subject has pending litigation related to the neuropathic pain condition.

          3. Subject has active skin lesion or open wound at the site of Pennsaid application
             (e.g., active shingles with skin lesions).

          4. Subject is pregnant or lactating.

          5. Subject has scar tissue or sensory deficit at the site of QST.

          6. Subject is allergic to diclofenac or has cross-sensitivity to other non-steroid
             anti-inflammatory drugs.

          7. Subject has a positive urine (illicit) drug test.

          8. Subjects who experience asthma, urticaria or an allergic type reaction when taking
             aspirin or NSAIDs.

          9. Subjects undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery.

         10. Subject with a known history of cardiovascular disease, ulcer, gastrointestinal bleed
             or impaired renal function.

         11. Subjects currently using NSAIDS.
