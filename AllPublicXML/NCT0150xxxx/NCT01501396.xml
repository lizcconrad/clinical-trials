    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the safety and efficacy of megestrol acetate given
      with or without mirtazapine in treating cancer patients with weight loss and loss of
      appetite. To date, no pharmacologic interventions have been approved by FDA to treat cancer
      anorexia-cachexia syndrome (CACS). Megestrol acetate has been shown to increase appetite in
      cancer patients. Adding mirtazapine may provide a much more effective treatment and help
      improve quality of life.

          -  Mirtazapine can cause non-teratogenic adverse effects on the developing human fetus at

             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study participation;

             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; women of childbearing
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to study entry
