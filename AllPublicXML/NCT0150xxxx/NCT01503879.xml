  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation is a therapeutic method used in order to keep gas exchange adequate to
      cell metabolism in patients with acute respiratory failure. It is currently proved that,
      although on one hand the use of this method keeps gas exchange, on the other hand it promotes
      and supports pulmonary inflammatory processes (VILI). A recent study about the effect of
      positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on DLCO (diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon
      monoxide) in patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation has proved that patients
      without any evident pulmonary disease (negative medical history, negative chest clinical
      examination, normal chest X-ray radiography and normal arterial oxygen tension [PaO2]) after
      24 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation show a significant worsening of pulmonary gas
      exchange properties. The authors have supposed that this worsening may be caused by an early
      alteration of alveolar-capillary membrane caused by mechanical ventilation itself. This
      hypothesis finds support in some studies carried out on animal models which founds that
      mechanical ventilation, even when low tidal volumes (Vt) are set for a few hours, is able to
      induce lung injury (as shown by histologic findings). The most sensitive and specific tools
      the investigators can currently rely on for the study of alveolar-capillary membrane are the
      measurement of diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and the evaluation
      of plasmatic levels of pulmonary surfactant protein B (SPB). DLCO is a standard, widely
      diffused technique for the evaluation of functional alterations of alveolar-capillary
      membrane and it is currently available also for patients undergoing invasive mechanical
      ventilation. SBP is produced by type II pneumocytes in the alveoli. An increase of its
      plasmatic levels is correlated to a decay of pulmonary gas exchange; SPB thus can be
      considered an alveolar-capillary membrane anatomical damage marker.

      The primary end-point of this study is to evaluate the changes of anatomical (SPB) and
      functional (DLCO) features of alveolar-capillary membrane between the spontaneous breathing
      and mechanical ventilation as well as the progressive changes affecting DLCO and SPB over
      time during general anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation in patients with otherwise healthy
      lung undergoing elective surgery. This in order to check the timing of the observed worsening
      of alveolar-capillary membrane function, and to find out if the process is progressive in
      time.

      The secondary end point is to check if the alterations of functional features of alveolar
      membrane (DLCO) are proportionate to the increase of alveolar injury marker (SPB), in order
      to understand if the worsening of alveolar-capillary membrane function is to be attributable
      to an anatomical damage or to a physiologic change of the ventilation-perfusion matching.
