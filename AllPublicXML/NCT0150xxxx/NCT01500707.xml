        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 35

          -  Diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) characterized by at least two of the
             following: resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity (must have either resting tremor or
             bradykinesia); participants must have either moderate severity PD or moderate to
             severe PD with motor fluctuations

          -  For participants with moderate PD, Hoehn and Yahr stage must be ≥1.5 and ≤4 in the
             &quot;off&quot; state at Screening; for participants with moderate to severe PD with motor
             fluctuations, Hoehn and Yahr stage must be ≥2 and ≤4 in the &quot;on&quot; state at Screening

          -  On stable anti-parkinson treatment regimen that includes L-DOPA/carbidopa for at least
             3 weeks prior to screening and clinically stable at the time of randomization
             (predose), and first morning dose of L-DOPA must be 100 mg or greater

          -  L-DOPA therapy for ≥ 6 months prior to screening

          -  If taking adjunct PD medications (amantadine, anticholinergics, DOPA decarboxylase
             inhibitor, dopamine agonist, entacapone, rasagiline or selegiline) must be on stable
             dose for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization on this study

          -  Females, if fertile, willing to use a medically acceptable method of contraception for
             3 months prior to screening through 2 months after stopping study drug

          -  Non-vasectomized males must agree to use a condom with spermicide (when

        marketed in the country) or abstain from sexual intercourse during the trial and for 3
        months after stopping the study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or intending to become pregnant within 3 months of ending study therapy

          -  Breastfeeding

          -  Systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥150 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg at Screening and at
             a BP recheck prior to randomization. If antihypertensive medications are used to
             control BP, dose of antihypertensive medications must be stable for at least 2 weeks
             prior to randomization

          -  History of clinically significant cardiovascular disease or procedure prior to
             randomization, including, but not limited to, myocardial infarction, prolonged QT
             interval corrected for heart rate, other clinically important ECG abnormality,
             angioplasty, stable or unstable angina, or heart failure

          -  History of clinically significant or uncontrolled neurologic (other then Parkinson's
             disease) endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematological, hepatic, immunological, renal,
             respiratory, or genitourinary abnormalities or diseases

          -  Surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of any drug including history or presence of
             inflammatory bowel disease, ulcers, gastrointestinal or rectal bleeding; history of
             major gastrointestinal tract surgery such as gastrectomy, gastroenterostomy, or bowel

             urinary albumin, or clinically significant urinary cellular constituents ; or history
             of urinary obstruction or difficulty in voiding

          -  Infectious disease within 4 weeks prior to drug administration

          -  Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibodies or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          -  Clinically significant complications of Parkinson's disease or Parkinson's disease
             treatments, including severe, disabling motor fluctuations that do not allow the
             subject to maintain a stable L-DOPA/carbidopa dose; disabling dyskinesias;
             hallucinations; or dementia

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse in the past 2 years
