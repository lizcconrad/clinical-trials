    <textblock>
      Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN) is a devastating and rare childhood disease. Children with GAN
      develop increasing muscle weakness, impaired sensation, and at times mental retardation. GAN
      starts in infancy, leads to significant disability, and typically leads to death within the
      first 30 years of life. GAN is caused by a defect in the &quot;gigaxonin&quot; (GAN) gene, resulting in
      pathologically enlarged and dysfunctional nerves. Currently, there is no effective therapy.
      To find out what medications can help patients with GAN, the investigators have to conduct
      clinical trials. In this study, the investigators propose to prepare for future clinical
      trials and will invite GAN patients to join our research effort.

      The investigators will examine them regularly to better understand their disease. The visits
      will include questions, a physical exam, blood drawing, a lumbar puncture, and a skin biopsy.
      The visits will also include tests that assess the electrical conductivity of the patients'
      nerves as well as a test to measure the patients' brain wave activity. In addition, the
      investigators will be performing tests to evaluate the patients' motor function, their
      vision, and thinking ability. Identifying an effective GAN treatment is very important
      because there is currently none. Clinical trials are the only way to decide whether a new
      treatment works in GAN patients or not.

      With the future objective of conducting clinical trials in GAN, the proposed project has
      three specific aims. The first is to plan for clinical trials by developing reliable outcome
      measures, and establishing the infrastructure needed to carry out efficient clinical trials.
      The second is to further characterize the patient population from a clinical and molecular
      point of view, and the third aim is to utilize the information gathered in this study to
      further pre-clinical GAN drug development to select candidate drugs.

    <textblock>
      Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder that
      appears during childhood and affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems. This
      disorder is generally characterized by motor and sensory involvement including progressive
      and predominant distal clumsiness, muscle weakness, and pronounced gait disturbances. GAN is
      caused by various mutations in the GAN gene that encodes the protein gigaxonin. This leads to
      giant axonal swelling and degeneration due to substantial accumulation of neurofilaments in
      the axon. Currently, there is no effective therapy, with onset occurring before the age of
      seven, and death usually occurring between the first and third decade of life.
