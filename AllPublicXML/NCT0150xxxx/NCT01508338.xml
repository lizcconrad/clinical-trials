  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to

        -  determine the effects of 12 weeks of HMB free acid gel, ATP, and HMB free acid gel plus
           ATP supplementation in trained individuals during a periodized training program on
           skeletal muscle hypertrophy, body composition, strength, force, velocity, and peak power
           during loaded and unloaded vertical jumps.

      Additionally, the study will determine if either supplementation protocol prevents the
      typical decay seen in performance following an overreaching cycle performed in the 9th and
      10th weeks of the study.

      Finally, the study will elucidate the mechanisms of action of supplementation on protein
      breakdown by analyzing serum indices of muscle damage (CK, LDH) and anabolic status
      (Testosterone:Cortisol ratio) as well as a urinary indicator of protein breakdown
      (3-methylhistidine).

      We hypothesize that under these conditions that the supplementation protocols will augment
      skeletal muscle hypertrophy, strength, and power and that HMB will blunt increases in serum
      indices of muscle damage, and urinary indices of protein breakdown.

    <textblock>
      In a randomized and double blind study the subjects will consume either placebo supplements,
      HMB supplement, ATP supplement, or HMB plus ATP supplements for 12 weeks. While consuming the
      supplements the subjects will undergo an extensive resistance training program designed to
      train all major muscle groups. An additional overreaching training cycle during weeks 9 and
      10 which will involve a high-volume, hypertrophy style training program.

      Subject testing will consist of the following:

        -  Strength and power at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, and 12

        -  Range of motion and muscle soreness at weeks 0, 1, 8, 9, and 10

        -  Body composition and muscle assessments at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, and 12

        -  Body fat assessments at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12

        -  Blood biochemical measurements at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, and 12

        -  Urinary analysis for protein breakdown (3-methylhistidine) at 0, 1, 8, 9, and 10 weeks
