  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate whether or not an EEG (a type of brain scan) is useful in
      diagnosing youth with either ADHD, BPD, ASD. Youth with ADHD, BPD, ASD, and healthy controls
      (without ADHD, BPD, and ASD) will undergo an EEG, and the results will be analyzed using
      brain activity flow pattern analysis (BAFPA). Twenty subjects with each disorder and twenty
      without any of the disorders under study (controls) will be evaluated. All subjects will be
      comprehensively assessed with structured diagnostic interviews and neuropsychological
      testing. All EEG analyses will be conducted under blind conditions. Conditional probability
      and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses will examine the diagnostic utility of
      the EEG scan, using the clinical diagnosis of ASD as the gold standard.
