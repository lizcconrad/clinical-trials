  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although anticholinesterase reversal agents have been used in combination with
      anticholinergic drugs for over half a century, it has been suggested that they should be used
      with caution in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. As sugammadex has no
      endogenous targets, it is unlikely to cause any adverse cardiovascular effects. This
      selective relaxant binding agent is specifically designed to encapsulate rocuronium, which
      can, therefore, promptly restore neuromuscular function regardless of any levels of NMB as
      the dose is increased.

      Some reports, however, suggest that sugammadex may have increased time to effect in some
      patient populations like the elderly, patients in intensive care and renal failure patients.
      A less dynamic circulation and increased transfer time to the effector site in these subjects
      are likely explanations for this effect. The present trial was designed to assess the safety
      and efficacy of sugammadex 2.0 mg kg-1 for the reversal of rocuronium-induced NMB in patients
      with heart failure.

    <description>After the induction of anaesthesia, monitoring neuromuscular function is initiated and performed continuously using the TOF-Watch SX (Organon Ireland Ltd, Ireland) at the thumb. Repetitive train-of four (TOF) stimulation is applied every 15 s at the ulnar nerve until the end of anaesthesia, at least until recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 after administration of sugammadex. Each patient receives a single IV bolus dose of rocuronium 0.6 mg kg-1, after which tracheal intubation is performed. Maintenance doses of rocuronium 0.1 mg kg-1, are permitted as required and administered at the reappearance of the second twitch in the TOF. On reappearance of the second twitch at the end of surgery, patients receive a single IV bolus dose of sugammadex, 2.0 mg kg-1, for reversal.</description>
