  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an autologous stem cell infusion through
      catheterism is safe and effective in the treatment of pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy.

      Process:

        1. Primary Evaluation

             -  Clinical History

             -  Echocardiogram to evaluate ejection fraction and other parameters

        2. Signing of Informed Consent and clearing doubts

        3. Bone Marrow stimulation for 3 consecutive days with G-CSF (Granulocyte Colony
           Stimulating Factor) applied subcutaneously

        4. On the 4th day, in operation room and under sedation: Bone Marrow Harvest performed by
           hematologists through posterior iliac crests(amount calculated at 8cc/kg, without
           exceeding 150ml).

        5. Recovery room with family members while the cells are being processed in the Hematology
           Laboratory.

        6. Approximately 3 hours after the 1st procedure, the patient re-enters the operation room,
           which is equipped for cardiac catheterization, so that cardiologists infuse the stem
           cells through the femoral artery into the coronary arteries which irrigate the heart´s
           muscle fibers.

        7. Patient goes back to the recovery area until the anesthesia effect is gone and can
           tolerate oral liquids.

        8. Clinical and echocardiographic follow-ups at 6 weeks and 6 months after the procedure.

      -  The Patient will receive standard surgical care, accompanied by a nurse at all times.

        -  Premedication includes: Omeprazole (gastric protector), Ketorolac (anti-pain and
           swelling), ondansetron (antivomiting).
