  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with neuropathic diseases are experiencing increasing muscle weakness, loss of
      muscle strength and functional abilities during their illness. In healthy people, regular
      exercise is the best way to maintain or improve muscle strength, endurance and general health
      status and thereby maintain functioning abilities. Previously, patients with neuromuscular
      diseases were advised to avoid any kind of physical exercise. However, lately a number of
      studies have evaluated the effect of training in patients with neuromuscular diseases, and
      positive effects on the functional abilities have been found. Based on these findings we want
      to investigate the mechanisms leading to development of muscle atrophy and loss of functional
      abilities, and to explore the opportunities of reducing muscle wasting and thereby improve
      the course of the disease development through strength training.

      The main objective is to investigate the effects of strength training on slowing disease
      progression and reduce the decline in muscle strength and function in patients with
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In addition, the aim is to carry out detailed studies of
      biological processes in muscle tissue in order to unveil mechanisms leading to muscle
      atrophy, and to examine effects of a strength training program. The goal is to be able to
      incorporate strength training in the treatment program of these patients in order to maintain
      muscle strength and function in the individual for as long as possible.

      Minimum 10 patients with the disease are included in the study. Through a 12 week period the
      patients will participate in strength training 2-3 times per week. Muscles biopsies will be
      taken (i) 12 weeks before commencement of strength training program, (ii) at the beginning of
      training and (iii) after 12 weeks of strength training. Patients will function as their own
      controls. Blood samples will be collected simultaneously in order to follow the development
      of the strength training. Furthermore, participants will be assessed through at number of
      functional tests and questionnaires evaluating their strength, balance and social/
      psychological status.

      Subjects are recruited through their association with Odense University Hospital. In the
      present study, the participants become part of a social network, while participating in
      organized training sessions, and thus have a possibility to make contact with other ALS
      patients in the same situation as themselves.
