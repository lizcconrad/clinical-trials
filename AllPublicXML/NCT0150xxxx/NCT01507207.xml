  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type I laryngeal cleft evaluation and treatment in the pediatric population is an emerging
      science. The largest published series of pediatric patients with type I laryngeal clefts
      shows conflicting evidence in terms of outcomes, resolution of dysphagia and method of
      treatment. A comparison of quality of life outcomes before and after injection laryngoplasty
      has not been carried out. The investigators hypothesize that injection laryngoplasty
      significantly improves symptoms and quality of life related to dysphagia in a pediatric
      population with laryngeal clefts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysphagia with aspiration is a common disorder in the pediatric population. Aspiration with
      feeds is diagnosed on modified barium swallow studies and patients are referred to the
      pediatric otolaryngologist to assess the airway for a possible laryngeal cleft. Type I
      laryngeal cleft can lead to dysphagia and aspiration in young children. However, diagnosis of
      type I laryngeal cleft can be difficult and subjective at microlaryngoscopy in the operating
      room. Type I laryngeal cleft evaluation and treatment in the pediatric population is an
      emerging science. The largest published series of pediatric patients with type I laryngeal
      clefts shows conflicting evidence in terms of outcomes, resolution of dysphagia and method of
      treatment. It is generally recommended to do an injection laryngoplasty at the time of airway
      evaluation as a diagnostic and therapeutic measure. Improvement in symptoms supports the
      diagnosis and can serve as either definitive treatment with repeated injections or as a
      preemptive treatment in preparation for surgical repair. A comparison of quality of life
      outcomes before and after injection laryngoplasty has not been carried out. Thus, the aim of
      this study is to determine if injection laryngoplasty improves symptoms and quality of life
      related to dysphagia in a pediatric population with laryngeal clefts.

    <description>Patients will undergo a direct microlaryngoscopy in the operating room for diagnostic purposes. In patients in whom laryngeal cleft is diagnosed, injection laryngoplasty will be carried out using sodium carboxymethylcellulose aqueous gel (commercial name Radiesse) injection material.</description>
