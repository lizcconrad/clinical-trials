      Background:

      - The costs of medical care have a major effect on patients during illness and treatment.
      Surveys with patients and doctors show that both are interested in discussing the costs of
      treatment. But they rarely talk about these issues. Both worry about whether it is
      appropriate to discuss financial matters in the clinical setting. They are also concerned
      about whether this topic will be an awkward one. Researchers are interested in studying how
      people want their doctors to talk to them about the costs of illness and medical care.

      Objectives:

      - To explore and better understand patients views on whether and how doctors should talk
      about the costs of illness and medical care.

      Eligibility:

      - English- or Spanish-speaking adults (at least 18 years of age) who are covered by health
      insurance.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be asked to take part in a 2 1/2-hour focus group. Ten to 12 people
           will come together to discuss their thoughts and opinions.

        -  A member of the research team will lead the group discussion. The leader will ask a list
           of questions about health care payment issues. Those in the focus group will discuss
           these issues.

        -  Participants will receive a small cash payment and a light snack.

      BACKGROUND:

      The cost of illness and medical care has profound implications for society as a whole and for
      individual patients as they experience being sick and seeking treatment. It is both
      appropriate and imperative that these costs be discussed in the doctor-patient encounter.
      Surveys with patients and doctors show that both parties have the desire to discuss costs,
      yet they rarely have these conversations because of worries about the appropriateness and
      potential awkwardness of discussing financial matters in the clinical encounter.

      In the existing literature we find that patients express a preference for more care, newer
      care, and expensive care (as they believe cost indicates better care), and they react
      negatively to conversations they perceive as encouraging rationing. Yet rationing - the use
      of allocation criteria to distribute resources - is inevitable when resources are limited,
      and acceptable when done fairly. Recognizing the need for bedside rationing and endeavoring
      to promote bedside rationing are not antithetical to patient-centered care, however. Open and
      honest conversations about rationing, when carried out appropriately, can be consistent with
      patient-centered care and the view of patients as moral agents.

      Patients resistance to discussions of rationing, coupled with the financial burden of illness
      and the reality of rising health care costs, all point to the pressing need to explore
      strategies for how physicians can address costs in ways that are understanding, empathic, and
      palatable to patients. In the literature we find scant empirical evidence about how patients
      would react to doctors talking about (and considering) costs. This study seeks the patient
      perspective on how these honest conversations about costs can be carried out in a sensitive
      and appropriate manner.

      OBJECTIVE:

      This project aims to explore and better understand patients perspectives about whether and
      how doctors should talk about and address the costs of illness and medical care. Ultimately
      we hope to promote the ability of doctors to discuss and address financial issues in their
      encounters with patients in a way that maintains trust, advocacy and integrity.

        -  Participants will be more receptive to discussing personal costs than societal (pooled)
           costs with their physicians.

        -  Willingness to discuss personal cost in the clinical encounter will vary with
           participant socio-demographic characteristics.

        -  Following group discussions about addressing cost of care in the clinical encounter,
           participants will be more receptive to discussion of costs in the clinical encounter.

        -  Following group discussion, participants will be more inclined to choose less expensive
           care.

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

          -  RAND Corp Survey Research Group will be in charge of recruiting participants. They
             will work with an experienced focus group recruitment vendor to identify, screen and
             schedule eligible participants from the LA/Santa Monica area and the Washington DC
             area. Candidates for the focus groups must be individuals who are 18 years old or
             older, able to provide informed consent, and who speak English or Spanish well enough
             to participate in one of the focus groups. In addition, participants must have health
             insurance coverage at the time of recruitment. The focus groups will include a mix of
             participants in terms of gender, age, race/ethnicity, educational level, SES, and
             health insurance coverage type. While we will not be excluding HHS or other federal
             employees from participating (as we see no compelling reason to do so), we will not be
             recruiting predominantly HHS or other federal employees because we seek a
             generalizable sample.

          -  Participants will be either English or Spanish speaking adults. Focus groups will
             include participants with the following varied characteristics:

          -  age (working adults with and without dependents and retirees); ethnic/racial groups
             (African American, Latino, Non-Hispanic whites);

          -  varied economic status (incomes below 300% of the Federal poverty threshold, and
             above).

          -  Specifically, participants will be recruited to ensure sufficient socio-demographic
             representation and adequate numbers to test our study hypotheses. Because we will
             recruit subjects with the intention of producing generalizable results, we will not
             recruit disproportionate numbers of HHS or other federal employees (although these
             individuals will not be excluded from participation).

          -  After the two pilot groups, twenty focus groups each including 8-12 participants will
             be conducted for a maximum total of 264 participants. Of the twenty focus groups,
             sixteen will be conducted in English and 4 will be conducted in Spanish.

          -  Half of participants will have incomes under 300% of the federal poverty threshold in
             order to guarantee ascertainment of perspectives of participants of varied
             socio-economic status.
