  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the bioequivalence of improved and current orally
      disintegrating E2020 10 mg tablets as a single dose in Japanese healthy adult males for each
      of two administration methods (with/without water).

          1. Any significant medical illness that required intervention within 8 weeks before
             treatment, or any medical history of clinically significant infectious diseases within
             4 weeks before treatment.

          3. Subjects who have any medical history of GI, hepatic, or renal surgery (e.g. excision
             of liver, kidney or GI tract) that may have an impact on pharmacokinetics of the drug.

             positive urine screen for drugs of abuse or exhalation alcohol test at screening or
             baseline.

             study drug administration.

         11. Exposure to any supplements or herbs (including Chinese medicine), or beverages (e.g.
             alcohol or grapefruit-containing beverages, within 2 weeks of study drug
             administration.

         12. Exposure to St. John's wort containing medications within 4 weeks of study drug
             administration.

         13. Use of any prescription drugs within 4 week before study drug administration.

             drug within 16 weeks of study enrollment.

         16. Subjects who received blood infusion within 12 weeks, those who had blood drawn 400 mL
             or more within 12 weeks, 400 mL, or 200 mL or more within 4 weeks, or sampling of a
             component of the blood within 2 week of study drug administration.

         17. Subjects who performed extreme exercises or exhausting labors (more than 1 hr/day or 5
             day/week) within 2 weeks before hospitalization.
