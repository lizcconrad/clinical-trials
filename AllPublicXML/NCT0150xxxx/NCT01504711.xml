      This clinical trial studies fosaprepitant dimeglumine in preventing nausea and vomiting in
      patients with gastrointestinal cancer receiving combination chemotherapy. Antiemetic drugs,
      such as fosaprepitant dimeglumine, may help lessen or prevent nausea and vomiting in patients
      treated with chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate efficacy of the addition of fosaprepitant (fosaprepitant dimeglumine) in
      controlling acute and delayed vomiting with the standard prophylactic anti-emetic combination
      of 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone for gastrointestinal cancer patients receiving
      FOLFIRINOX (5-FU [fluorouracil], oxaliplatin and irinotecan [irinotecan hydrochloride])
      chemotherapy.

      II. To determine the rate of complete response (no emetic episode and no rescue medication)
      in the combined acute and delayed phase from 0-120 hours after chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the incidence of nausea and vomiting in both acute (&lt; 24 hours) and delayed
      (24- 120 hours) setting in patients receiving FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Follow overall survival in patients receiving FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fosaprepitant dimeglumine intravenously (IV) 30 minutes prior to FOLFIRINOX
      chemotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 months.
