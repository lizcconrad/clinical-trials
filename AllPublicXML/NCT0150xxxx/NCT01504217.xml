    <textblock>
      Falling among older adults is a major public health concern. In fact, falls are the leading
      cause of accidental death in older adults both in Taiwan and in the United States. In order
      to provide effective preventative strategies, the investigators must understand the
      mechanisms that cause older adults to fall. Thus, the investigators research aim for three
      objectives: (1) using biomechanical model to identify the deficits in neuromuscular control
      for older adults (2) to apply research findings to the development of new clinical methods
      for assessing and recovering balance control in older adults, and (3) to predict fall risks
      in 1-2 year for older adults from the research findings.
