    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of EV71
      Vaccines in preventing Hand, Foot and Mouth disease caused by EV71 in a total 10,000 healthy
      infants volunteers aged from 6 to 35months old.

    <textblock>
      The phase II study of inactivated vaccine (vero cell) against EV71 has completed on Dec 2011
      in China. The data from the phase I and II study suggested that the inactivated EV71 vaccine
      had a clinically acceptable safety and good immunogenicity for healthy Chinese infants. In
      order to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine against Hand, Foot and Mouth disease caused by
      EV71, and to further explore the safety profile of this vaccine in expending infant
      population, a phase III clinical trial is planed to conduct.
