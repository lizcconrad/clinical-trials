      Aims: The investigators' primary objective is to assess both perceived and actual disease
      knowledge in local pre-dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients. The investigators
      hypothesize that actual disease knowledge is poorer than perceived. As the secondary
      objectives, the investigators will also assess the HRQoL and examine the association between
      level of knowledge and HRQoL in pre-dialysis CKD patients. The investigators hypothesize that
      HRQoL of pre-dialysis CKD patients is poorer than that of the general population while
      pre-dialysis CKD patients with greater disease knowledge have a better HRQoL than those with
      poorer knowledge.

      Methodology: A survey was developed to assess both perceived and actual knowledge on five
      aspects - general knowledge, nephrotoxic medications, diet restrictions, symptoms of CKD and
      its complications and renal replacement therapy (RRT) options. For the assessment of HRQoL,
      the following questionnaires will be used - Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form
      (KDQOL-SF) version 1.3, EuroQoL 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), Family Functioning Measure (FFM), and
      Oslo-3 Social Support Scale (OSS-3). All study questionnaires will be provided in 3 main
      languages - English, Chinese and Malay. A standardized data collection form was developed to
      retrospectively collect demographic and clinical information from the patients' electronic
      medical records and patient charts. Descriptive statistics will be used to report all
      results.
