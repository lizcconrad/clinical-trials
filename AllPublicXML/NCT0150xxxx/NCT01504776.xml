      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and clinical efficacy of the combination
      of panobinostat plus bortezomib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I single arm, open label, multi-center (3 participating sites) dose
      escalation study of oral panobinostat administered Monday-Wednesday-Friday (MWF) weekly x 4
      weeks, utilizing 3+3 dosing scheme (15, 20, 25 mg) in combination with a fixed dose of
      bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 administered as a short intravenous (IV) infusion of 3-5 seconds every
      week x 4 weeks, representing one cycle. Each week, bortezomib will be administered IV prior
      to the oral dose of panobinostat. There will be sub-investigators participating in this study
      who will enroll at sub-sites.

    <description>Pre-treatment primary MCL cells derived from the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood of patients enrolled in this clinical trial will be isolated and treated ex vivo with panobinostat and/or bortezomib. IC50 values for each agent, as well as the combination indices values for the two agents will be determined and correlated with clinical response.
Pre-treatment and 24 hour post-treatment primary MCL cells from patients who have circulating MCL cells in the peripheral blood will be isolated, as above.</description>

             study and any related procedures being performed

          -  Patients must have adequate hematology/chemistry lab values

          -  Echocardiogram (ECHO) must demonstrate Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) ≥
             50%.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤ 2

          -  Patients with previously diagnosed MCL based on standard criteria and with at least
             one and a maximum of 4 lines of therapy and currently requiring further treatment

          -  Prior therapy with autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplant is permissible.
             Patients who have undergone an allogeneic transplant should have no evidence of
             graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and should not be on any immunosuppressive therapy.
             Autologous and allogeneic transplant will be counted as one prior therapy.
