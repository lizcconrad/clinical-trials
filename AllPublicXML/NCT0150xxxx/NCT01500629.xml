  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a new nasal spray can reduce the signs and symptoms of
      allergic rhinitis (hayfever). Subjects' participation in the study will last approximately 4
      to 6 weeks, and each of three study visits during that time will last a few hours. Subjects
      will be required to have several tests done including allergy and breathing tests. They will
      be exposed to the item they are allergic to and will have small paper discs put in their
      noses. Subjects will also have the inside of their noses examined and will be asked questions
      about the level of their allergy symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way cross over trial.
      Approximately 25 subjects with a history of seasonal grass and/or ragweed allergy symptoms
      will be enrolled in the study to ensure 20 complete the study.

      Subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment sequences of experimental product
      (investigational nasal spray) and placebo (sham nasal spray). Subjects will be asymptomatic
      of nasal symptoms (i.e., sneezing, itchy nose, runny nose, and nasal congestion) for at least
      2 weeks prior to screening, and at least 1 week after the latest use of concomitant
      medication for symptom control in order to be eligible to participate in this study. Any
      subject with a history of mild asthma will be required to undergo a Forced Expiratory Volume
      in 1 second (FEV1) test prior to each nasal challenge (diluent and allergen) throughout the
      study. Assessments will be completed pre- and post-diluent challenge and post-allergen
      challenge. The baseline assessment for symptom scores is defined as the assessment obtained
      after the diluent challenge but prior (-15 minutes prior to randomization) to the
      administration of the experimental product/sham control.

      Using a 14-day wash out period (± 2days), subjects who continue to meet inclusion criteria
      will receive treatments according to their randomized sequence. Eligible allergic subjects
      will undergo nasal challenges with either grass or ragweed allergen outside their allergy
      season.

      Severity of symptoms will be assessed by the subject on a scale of 0=no symptoms to 3=severe.
      Adverse events will be collected during each visit, as well as the day following each visit
      via telephone.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) at 15 Minutes After the First Allergan Challenge</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes (±5 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in TNSS of sneezing, itchy nose, runny nose, and nasal congestion at 15 minutes after the first allergen challenge. TNSS was the sum of the severity of sneezing and the average score (left and right nostrils) for each of the following: itchy nose, runny nose, and nasal congestion. Severity of sneezing, itchy nose, runny nose, and nasal congestion were evaluated using a 4-point categorical scale where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. For the change from baseline in TNSS, the total possible minimum value is 0 (best) and the total possible maximum value is 12 (worst).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of grass and/or ragweed allergic rhinitis for at least 2 years prior to
             screening

          -  Positive skin test to grass and/or ragweed antigen within 12 months prior to screening

          -  Being asymptomatic of nasal symptoms (i.e., sneezing, itchy nose, runny nose, and
             nasal congestion) for at least 2 weeks prior to screening.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must be using a medically-acceptable method of birth
             control for at least one month prior to screening and agree to continue using it
             during participation in the study (abstinence is not an approved method).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in another investigational therapy 30 days prior to screening

          -  Not willing to give informed consent

          -  Inability to understand the nature and requirements of the study, or to comply with
             the study procedures

          -  Use of antihistamines within 1 week prior to screening (or during study visits)

          -  History of respiratory disease other than allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis
             and mild asthma.

          -  Current smoker or recent ex-smoker defined as history of smoking or use of nicotine
             containing substances within 2 months prior to screening as determined by medical
             history or subjects verbal report.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition that may increase the
             risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or
             may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             Investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.

        <description>The change from baseline in TNSS of sneezing, itchy nose, runny nose, and nasal congestion at 15 minutes after the first allergen challenge. TNSS was the sum of the severity of sneezing and the average score (left and right nostrils) for each of the following: itchy nose, runny nose, and nasal congestion. Severity of sneezing, itchy nose, runny nose, and nasal congestion were evaluated using a 4-point categorical scale where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. For the change from baseline in TNSS, the total possible minimum value is 0 (best) and the total possible maximum value is 12 (worst).</description>

          <description>The change from baseline in TNSS of sneezing, itchy nose, runny nose, and nasal congestion at 15 minutes after the first allergen challenge. TNSS was the sum of the severity of sneezing and the average score (left and right nostrils) for each of the following: itchy nose, runny nose, and nasal congestion. Severity of sneezing, itchy nose, runny nose, and nasal congestion were evaluated using a 4-point categorical scale where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. For the change from baseline in TNSS, the total possible minimum value is 0 (best) and the total possible maximum value is 12 (worst).</description>

        <description>Subjects evaluated the individual nasal symptom of sneezing using a scale of 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The change from baseline of the individual NSS for sneezing was then calculated by taking the score at the post baseline time point minus its baseline score. For the change from baseline in the individual NSS for sneezing, the total possible minimum value is 0 (best) and the total possible maximum value is 3 (worst).</description>

          <description>Subjects evaluated the individual nasal symptom of itchy nose using a scale of 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The change from baseline of the individual NSS for itchy nose was then calculated by taking the average score of the left and right nostrils for each score from each post baseline time point minus its baseline score. For the change from baseline in the individual NSS for itchy nose, the total possible minimum value is 0 (best) and the total possible maximum value is 3 (worst).</description>

        <description>Subjects evaluated non nasal symptoms of itchy throat, ear, and palate using a scale of 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The change from baseline of NNSS was calculated by taking the difference of the NNSS score for each post baseline time point minus its baseline. For the NNSS, the total possible minimum value is 0 (best) and the total possible maximum value is 3 (worst).</description>
