      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ocular iontophoresis with
      dexamethasone phosphate ophthalmic solution EGP-437 using the EyeGateÂ® II Drug Delivery
      System (EGDS) compared to prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension (1%) in patients with
      non-infectious anterior segment uveitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anterior uveitis is a disorder of the eye associated with intraocular inflammation of the
      anterior portion of the uvea, particularly the iris and/or ciliary body. It is distinct from
      other iterations of uveitis such as posterior, diffuse and intermediate uveitis although it
      is the most common form of uveitis and accounts for approximately 75% of cases.

      In a Phase 1/2 study (EGP-437-001), the delivery of EGP-437 (40 mg/mL dexamethasone phosphate
      solution) at four different iontophoresis dose levels was studied in 40 subjects with
      non-infectious anterior segment uveitis. The study demonstrated that a single EGP-437
      treatment: lowered anterior chamber cell (ACC) scores in the majority of patients without
      requiring additional treatment; produced low short-term systemic exposure to dexamethasone
      and dexamethasone phosphate; and produced the most beneficial effects in the 1.6 and 4.8
      mA-min dose groups; and caused mainly minor AEs and no non-ocular systemic corticosteroid
      mediated effects were observed.

      The Phase 3 study is intended to confirm and extend the results from the Phase 2 study. The
      study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy Ocular Iontophoresis with EGP-437 4.0
      mA-min at 1.5 mA and accompanying placebo eyedrops in comparison to Ocular Iontophoresis with
      sodium citrate buffer solution 4.0 mA-min at 1.5 mA and accompanying prednisolone acetate
      (1%) eyedrops for the treatment of non-infectious anterior segment uveitis.
