      Objectives:

      Our goal is trying to identify an ideal BDR cutoff point for Chinese controller-naïve
      asthmatic children. In order to achieve this, several steps need to taken.

        1. To observe BDR distribution curve for Chinese non-asthmatic children from 4-12 years

        2. To observe BDR distribution curve for Chinese controller-naïve asthmatic children from
           4-12 years

        3. To compare BDR values between non-asthmatic group and controller-naïve asthmatic group,
           and analyze appropriate cut-off point value

      Hypothesis:

        1. Publications and our clinical experience indicate BDR value is affected by ethnicity,
           and children are less responded to bronchodilator compared with adult patients. From
           this aspect, data from Chinese children may be different from data included in the
           guidelines which mostly determined by studies in adults

        2. Reversible bronchospasm is a characteristic in asthma patients. Between asthmatics and
           non-asthmatics, different response to BDR test would be observed, and there would be a
           cutoff point with good sensitivity and specificity to differentiate asthmatics from
           non-asthmatics

      Background and rationale:

      According to the guideline of global initiative for asthma, global strategy for asthma
      management and prevention (GINA) and guideline of United States National Asthma Education and
      Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines spirometry, including baseline forced expiratory volume
      in 1 second (FEV1) and the bronchodilator response (BDR) to short acting beta agonists
      (SABA), should be used in children as objective measures to establish the diagnosis and
      severity of bronchial asthma. Spirometry is necessary because not every child came to the
      clinic with typical symptoms and the objective measurement can improve diagnosis confidence.
      Baseline FEV1, the so called &quot;gold standard&quot; for evaluating airway obstruction in adults, is
      usually in the normal range (greater than 80% predicted) in children, regardless of asthma
      severity. This substantially limits its value for diagnosis and assessment of response to
      treatment. Because of this, several other objective measures have been suggested for
      diagnosis and treatment in children, including the response to a bronchodilator, which
      reflects not only airway reversibility, but also a marker of airway inflammation.

      The current definition for a positive BDR is &gt;12% reversibility and &gt;200 ml increase from
      initial FEV1 after short acting beta-agonist (SABA) has been used. However, recent reports
      and our clinical observation revealed that, in a significant part of Chinese asthmatic
      children, their BDR value cannot achieve 12% in the evaluation.

      It has been suggested that the cutoff point of 12% is too conservative for pediatric
      patients. In the study carried out by Galant et al among 51 non-asthmatic children and 346
      controller naïve asthmatic children between 4-17 years, the BDR value could achieve 12% in
      only 30.6% asthmatic children, across all severity. Meanwhile, when observing BDR value in
      the above study, results were 2.2% (95% CI, 0.2-4.3) in the non-asthmatic group compared with
      8.6% (95% CI, 7.5-9.8) in the asthmatic group. The range seen was 7.6% (95% CI, 5.8-9.5) for
      mild asthma to 10.1% (95% CI, 7.6-12.6) in the severe persistent group. Also, in a study
      among 142 children between 5-10 years in UK, 9% increase in FEV1 after bronchodilator use was
      suggested as the cutoff point with good sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, in a study
      carried out among 3052 children in rural area between 8-15 years in Anhui Province in China,
      results showed BDR was 3 +/- 5% in non-asthmatic children, and 7 +/- 9% in asthmatic
      children.

      Difference between the proposed study to be carried out in our hospital and the one in Anhui
      Province is that subjects in this proposed study are from 4-12 years old, which is the
      largest patient segment in our clinic including preschool and school students. And most
      importantly, the main purpose of study in Anhui is to observe the BDR range of the
      non-asthmatic children and asthmatic children, while in our study, besides this objective,our
      will tentatively calculate a BDR cutoff point by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC
      curve). And the cutoff point can be used as a reference indicator in asthma diagnosis and
      long-term management.

      The current BDR cutoff point of 12% that is not ideal for children can also be reflected in
      the clinical management. It has been shown that a persistent BDR value, even less than 12%,
      in asthmatic children suggests poor clinical outcome. In a 4 years study among 1041 asthmatic
      children in America carried out by Sharma et al, it showed that compared with individuals who
      had a BDR of 12% and 200ml, individuals who had a BDR of 10% had similar poor clinical
      outcomes (e.g. more hospital visits, more prednisone bursts, increased nocturnal awakenings,
      and missing more days of school). Same results were also obtained in Galant et al study among
      679 asthmatic children among 5-18 years.

        2. Asthmatic group: 4-12 years old asthmatic children will be recruited from the asthma
           clinic of the Capital Institute of Pediatrics

           Inclusion criteria:

             1. Diagnose asthma by specialist of asthma (based on symptoms): criteria for the
                diagnosis of asthma made by the asthma specialist included a history of recurrent
                coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath at rest or with exercise, symptomatic
                improvement after bronchodilator use, and exclusion of other diagnoses

             2. Asymptomatic or mild symptomatic with no physical signs of wheeze at the time of
                testing

             3. Not receiving controller medication 6 weeks prior to the initial evaluation

             4. Willing to attend this investigation

           Exclusion criteria:

           1) Using short β2 agonists within 6 hours 2) Using long acting β2 agonists within 24
           hours 3) Can not finish the test that met American Thoracic Society criteria for
           preschool children in a maximum of 6 attempts and are unable to successfully complete
           post-bronchodilator spirometry.

           2. Preparation before tests

           1) Sign the consent form. 2) Fill the asthma severity form according to NEAPP guideline
           (asthmatic group).

           3) Chest physical test, record on the form of test. 4) Standing height and weight will
           be measured. 5) Calculation of age: The date of test subtracts the date of birth.

           3. Pulmonary function tests

           Standardized pulmonary function tests will be conducted.

           Contents of tests:

           Pre and post flow volume: forced volume vital capacity (FVC), FEV0.5, FEV1, FEV1/FVC
           ratio, PEF, forced expiratory flow 25 (FEF25), FEF50, FEF75, FEF25-75, forced expiratory
           time (FET), back-extrapolated volume (VBE), VBE/FVC.

           The BDR is based on pulmonary function measurements before and after administration of
           2.5 mg albuterol by nebulizer. BDR is calculated as [(postbronchodilator FEV1- baseline
           FEV1)/baseline FEV1] x 100%.

           Study Procedures:

           1. Spirometry preparation The spirometry was purchased from VIASYS Healthcare, Hochberg
           Germany (MasterScope).

             1. Check: Before switch on, check the conjunction between flow sensor and the hand
                knob, ensure that the black compact is tightness.

             2. Calibration: Before calibration, the room temperature, pressure, humidity should be
                tested and recorded and all of the parameter should be reconciled to BTPS
                condition.

           Using 2 liters scalar to calibrate flow. Every day do the even flow calibration. Every
           week do the flow linear calibration, include high, media and low flow these three
           different flow calibration. The variety should be less than 3%.

           The record of calibration should be printed, and the technician should be signed on it
           and save it.

           2. Test method The training process is the same as Eigen H. et al (ref 8). The entire
           instruction and testing session for each child is strictly limited to 15 min, during
           which time children are instructed in the techniques of spirometry and performed at
           least three forced vital capacity maneuvers. A highly experienced children's pulmonary
           function technologist does the instruction for each child. At the time of testing, each
           child is given an explanation of the testing procedure individually and then tested
           using coaching techniques used in our pulmonary function laboratory in evaluating
           younger children.

           3. Criteria for accepting Data (ATS/ERS 2005) The principles of spirometry quality
           control in preschool children are the same as for adults.

             1. It is necessary to visually inspect the flow-volume and volume-time traces, and
                exclude maneuvers that are visibly inadequate. Maneuvers should be excluded if the
                flow-volume curve does not demonstrate a rapid rise to peak flow, or a smooth
                descending limb, with no evidence of cough or glottis closure.

             2. The start of test should be quantified by calculating the VBE. Some investigators
                reported that more than 80% of the studied preschool population achieved a VBE of
                less than or equal to 80 ml or less than 12.5% of the FVC. Alternative criteria are
                presented, but these should be viewed as a guide to assist visual inspection,
                rather than as exclusion criteria.

             3. The end of test should be quantified by reporting the point of cessation of flow.
                It is known that many preschool children cannot sustain forced expiration for 1
                second, let alone the 6 seconds previously stipulated for adults (ref 9) , and the
                forced expired time should be reported but should not be used to exclude maneuvers.
                This pattern should not be misinterpreted as early termination (ref 10).
