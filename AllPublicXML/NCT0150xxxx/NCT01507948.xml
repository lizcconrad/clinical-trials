  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are seeking people who have been exposed to a traumatic event in the past
      and have symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) currently. A person with PTSD may
      feel significant distress when reminded of a traumatic event or feel depressed, anxious or
      jumpy.

      As a part of this study, participants will receive brain MRIs and office assessments before
      and after psychotherapy. The investigators provide the gold-standard psychotherapy for PTSD,
      &quot;Prolonged Exposure&quot;, free of charge; additionally participants are compensated for their
      time during assessment procedures. This study is exploring the brain circuitry involved in
      improvement in response to psychotherapy.

    <description>The CAPS is a 30-item structured interview that corresponds to the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. In addition to assessing the 17 PTSD symptoms, questions target the impact of symptoms on social and occupational functioning, improvement in symptoms since a previous CAPS administration, overall response validity, overall PTSD severity, and frequency and intensity of five associated symptoms (guilt over acts, survivor guilt, gaps in awareness, depersonalization, and derealization). For each item, standardized questions and probes are provided.</description>

    <description>Intake procedures include clinician-administered diagnostic battery, cognitive testing, self-report measures of symptoms, and functional imaging scan. Participants in this arm will complete a concurrent TMS/fMRI scan before beginning Prolonged Exposure (PE). PE will be delivered in 9-12 90-minute sessions. Therapy will be delivered by PhD-level therapists at Stanford and Palo Alto VA.</description>

    <description>Intake procedures include clinician-administered diagnostic battery, cognitive testing, self-report measures of symptoms, and functional imaging scan. NOTE: Participants in this arm receive treatment following a waitlist period of 12 weeks. After waitlist, will have a TMS/fMRI scan and then immediately begin Prolonged Exposure treatment.

    <description>PE will be delivered in 9-12 90-minute sessions. Therapy will be delivered by PhD-level therapists at Stanford and Palo Alto VA. PE consists of four components: psychoeducation about PTSD symptoms and the behavioral or cognitive factors maintaining it, a brief breathing retraining that can be used as a stress management tool, prolonged imaginal exposure to the trauma memory both within-session and repeated as homework, and prolonged in vivo exposure to avoided scenarios in patients' day-to-day lives.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. age between 18 and 60 years;

          2. fMRI scanning eligibility, including no evidence of any form of metal embedded in the
             body (e.g., metal wires, nuts, bolts, screws, plates, sutures), as these produce
             artifacts when brain imaging;

          3. not currently involved in an exposure-based psychotherapy, in order to be able to
             measure and interpret the effects of PE on PTSD;

          4. must comprehend English well and show non-impaired intellectual abilities to ensure
             adequate comprehension of the fMRI task instructions and PE treatment;

          5. no history of neurological or cardiovascular disorders, brain surgery,
             electroconvulsive or radiation treatment, brain hemorrhage or tumor, stroke, seizures
             or epilepsy, diabetes, hypo- or hyperthyroidism, head trauma with loss of
             consciousness greater than thirty minutes;

          6. no regular use of benzodiazepine, opiate, thyroid, anticonvulsant or antipsychotic
             medications. Patients on stable doses of antidepressant medications will be allowed.
             Patients for whom antidepressant dosing is being actively titrated will be required to
             be on a stable dose for 1 month prior to inclusion in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any contraindication to being scanned in the 3T or 1.5T scanners at the Lucas Center
             or CNI such as having a pacemaker or implanted device that has not been cleared for
             scanning at the Lucas Center or CNI.

          -  Participants will be excluded from the study if there is any lifetime evidence of
             psychosis, mania, hypomania, or bipolar disorders. Other axis I comorbidities will not
             be a cause for exclusion.

        In addition, subjects will be excluded if they have a significant CNS neurological
        condition such as stroke, seizure, tumor, hemorrhage, multiple sclerosis, etc.

        Patients who have current substance dependence will be excluded from the study. A recent
        diagnosis of substance abuse is allowable, however, as long as subjects have been abstinent
        for greater than three months.

          -  Subjects will be excluded if they are currently in an exposure-based psychotherapy for
             PTSD.
