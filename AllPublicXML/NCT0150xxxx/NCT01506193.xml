The cut-off values for serocoversion were 150 mIU/mL, 231 U/mL, 4 IU/mL and 25 mIU/mL for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, respectively.</description>

    <description>Rash/exanthem was defined as: 1) measles/ rubella rashes (macular or maculo-papular rashes): presence of macules, discolored small patches or spots of the skin, neither elevated nor depressed below the skin's surface. 2) varicella rash (maculo-papulo-vesicular): simultaneous presence of macules, papules and vesicles raised above the skin's surface or other types of rash (heat rash, diaper rash etc.). Any rash = no lesions and grade 3 = &gt; 150 lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Any Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 43 days (Days 0-42) after each vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study. Any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout study period (from Day 0 to approximately Month 4)</time_frame>
    <description>SAEs assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life-threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or result in disability/incapacity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Antibody Titers Against Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella Viruses</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 42 after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Antibody titers were summarized by geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the following cut-offs: ≥ 150 mIU/mL, ≥ 231 U/mL, ≥ 4 IU/mL and ≥ 25 mIU/mL for anti-measles, anti-mumps, anti-rubella and anti-varicella, respectively.</description>

        <description>Antibody titers were summarized by geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the following cut-offs: ≥ 150 mIU/mL, ≥ 231 U/mL, ≥ 4 IU/mL and ≥ 25 mIU/mL for anti-measles, anti-mumps, anti-rubella and anti-varicella, respectively.</description>
