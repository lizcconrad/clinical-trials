  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to survey patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) to assess if they have traveled or not internationally after transplant.
      This information will help to improve the understanding of the needs for travel health
      strategies and interventions to provide healthy and safe travel to HSCT patients. The
      findings of this survey will also be used to develop travel health related interventions for
      patients living with cancer as well.

    <description>The intervention is a self-administered questionnaire that is voluntarily completed by the subject. This questionnaire has been previously validated and demonstrated to be reproducible in English speaking travelers. The final version of the survey questionnaire consists of 49 questions.Patients who never traveled after HSCT will answer only eighteen questions related to their medical and HSCT history in addition to their demographics.</description>
