  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, prospective, study of an optical imaging device on approximately twenty
      (20) subjects undergoing lumpectomies at one study site. In vivo and ex vivo imaging will be
      performed on study subjects with results being compared to final pathology.

      This study is a single-center, prospective, two-part open label study of an optical imaging
      device on approximately twenty (20) subjects at one (1) study site. Patients scheduled to
      undergo a lumpectomy will be recruited by the clinical investigators at the investigational
      site in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study period per subject is
      the time it takes to assess the in vivo and ex vivo breast tissue samples using the study
      device during their lumpectomy.

      All specimens will be marked with India ink and undergo standard post-operative histology,
      and digital histology images corresponding to the inked locations will be obtained. The
      images and the matched digitized post-operative histology images will then be randomized and
      read by a blinded, independent pathologist. Sensitivity and specificity will be calculated.
