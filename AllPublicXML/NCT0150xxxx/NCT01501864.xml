      This study examines the impact of school support as a structural intervention, tested among
      adolescent orphans in Siaya District, Nyanza Province, Kenya.

      Aims for the proposed study are: 1) To experimentally test whether providing comprehensive
      school support to Kenyan orphaned boys and girls will reduce school dropout, reduce sexual
      risk behaviors, and prevent HIV/HSV-2 infection; 2) To conduct a process evaluation of the
      implementation of the program; and 3) To conduct comparative cost effectiveness analyses,
      specifying the intervention's cost and return on investment as evidenced by cost per unit
      improvement in the primary outcomes of school enrollment, delay of sexual debut and
      prevention of risk behaviors and HIV/HSV-2 infection, as well as by gains in health-related
      quality of life.
