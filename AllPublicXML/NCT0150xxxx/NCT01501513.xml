      The objective of this study is to compare the safety, tolerance and efficacy of BLI800
      (approved and investigational regimens) to an approved control preparation as bowel
      preparations prior to colonoscopy in adult patients, particularly including the elderly and
      those with renal and/or hepatic impairment.
