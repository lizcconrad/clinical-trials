  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is a major and rapidly increasing health problem worldwide. Keeping the blood
      glucose (sugar) from going too high helps prevent complications. Recently a number of new
      treatments (collectively called 'incretin based' treatments) to lower blood glucose have
      become available but response is very variable and it is difficult to predict which will work
      for an individual. The investigators want to see if we can identify whether the new
      treatments are likely to be effective for an individual patient. Identifying the right
      treatment would improve control and minimise the side-effects and costs from ineffective
      treatments. We will collect blood (for measures of blood glucose, insulin secretion and
      genetics information), urine (for a simple measurement of insulin secretion) and other
      clinical information (such as weight,age, duration of diabetes and medication) in people who
      are about to start these new 'incretin based' treatments and assess their response over the
      first 6 months of treatment. We will analyse this information to see if we can predict
      treatment response.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The investigators hypothesise that those who have low insulin secretion, as measured by post
      meal urine C-peptide Creatinine Ratio or blood C-peptide, will have poor blood glucose
      response to incretin based treatments.

    <description>Change in HbA1c over 6 months treatment (as a continuous variable and/or defined as binary response/non response). Our Primary analysis will be the relationship between insulin secretion (as measured by blood C-peptide or UCPCR) and glycaemic response. Secondary analysis will include examination of relationship between baseline weight, HbA1c, age, duration of diabetes, HOMA B, HOMA IR, autoantibody (GAD, IA2) status and glycaemic response. We will also examine the relationship between glycaemic response and polymorphisms in GLP-1R, TCF7L2, WFS1 and FOX01 genes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus where the patient's clinician has
             determined the need for a DPP-IV inhibitor or GLP-1 analogue as a result of inadequate
             glycaemic control

          -  HbA1c &gt;= 58mmol/mol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with DPP-IV inhibitors or GLP-1 analogues prior to study initiation (within
             the previous 3 months)

          -  Renal failure as shown by a eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) less than 30
