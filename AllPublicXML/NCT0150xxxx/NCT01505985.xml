    <textblock>
      Senior hip fracture patients are the most vulnerable to malnutrition and protein deficiency.
      Low protein intake, like vitamin D deficiency, contribute to an increased risk for hip
      fracture. Notably, several clinical trials with protein supplementation in senior hip
      fracture patients resulted in fewer deaths, shorter hospital stay, and a higher likelihood of
      return to independent living. The proposal is to test the effect of an oral nutritional
      supplement (ONS) which has been designed to meet the specific nutrient needs of senior bone
      and muscle health. The hypothesis is that this ONS will improve functional recovery after hip
      fracture (as measured by Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)), improve quality of life,
      improve muscle mass, and- decrease falls and hospital re-admission after hip fracture.
