      Section 1:

      The purpose of the study is to obtain safety and immunogenicity data of different dose levels
      of a multivalent recombinant OspA Lyme Borreliosis (mv rOspA LB) Vaccine with and without
      adjuvant in seronegative healthy adults aged 18 to 70 years. The outcome shall provide the
      basis for dose/formulation selection for Section 2 of the study.

      Section 2:

      An additional purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the
      optimal dose(s)/formulation of the mv rOspA LB Vaccine in a larger population of seronegative
      and seropositive healthy subjects aged 18 to 70 years.
