      The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between attempted and/or completed
      suicide and reported experience of chronic pain among an adult veteran population. Specific
      aims include a) examining the experience of chronic pain between patients who have either
      attempted and/or completed suicide, non-suicide attempt mental health patients, and
      non-mental health chronic pain patients and b) determining possible differences in reported
      experiences of chronic pain based on mental and physical diagnoses, age, gender, ethnicity,
      occupation, and patient's recorded perceptions of depression and/or quality of life. As
      articulated in the Amendment approved on June 13, 2008, additional areas of interest include
      histories of neurological disease (e.g. traumatic brain injury) and/or mental health
      diagnoses. History of both neurologic disease and mental health diagnoses will also be
      identified by chart review (per approval obtained June 13, 2008). As such this study will
      also compare differences (e.g., mental health, neurological disease) between veterans who
      have history of a suicide attempt, completion, or a lifetime history of suicidality and
      matched control veterans without a history of suicide attempts, completions, or lifetime
      history of suicide. The relationship between suicidal behavior, attempted/completed suicide,
      and reported Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms among an adult veteran population
      is also of interest. Additionally, this data set will be used to complete a validation study
      regarding the Self-Directed Violence Classification System (SDVCS). Specifically, relevant
      information in subject chart notes regarding self-directed violence (SDV) will be used to
      categorize thoughts and behaviors according to the SDVCS.
