  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this research is to understand the neuronal mechanisms that mediate the
      development of spasticity and motor dysfunction after spinal cord injury. The investigators
      examine how neurons and neuronal circuits in an injured nervous system adapt to produce the
      uncontrolled and unwanted muscle contractions that affect the majority (80%) of patients with
      spinal cord injury. One of the neurons that the investigators study is the motoneuron that
      excites the muscles of the limbs to produce movement. Previously, the investigators have
      shown that after spinal cord injury, the excessive and uncontrolled activity of motoneurons
      during muscle spasms is mediated, in large part, by the activation of calcium currents in the
      human motoneuron. In human patients the investigators have used recordings from single muscle
      fibres to estimate the contribution of these calcium currents in activating the motoneuron
      during muscle spasms. In this proposal, the investigators study why motoneurons recover these
      calcium currents and self-sustained activity after chronic spinal cord injury. Because the
      calcium currents require the presence of the monoamine serotonin (5HT) to activate, and this
      monoamine is greatly reduced after injury, the investigators examine if the calcium currents
      recover because the 5HT receptors become spontaneously active without the need for 5HT to
      bind to the receptor, which the investigators hypothesize to be one of the causes of
      spasticity after spinal cord injury. This research will pave the way to develop new
      pharmacological and rehabilitative therapies to both control spasticity after spinal cord
      injury and augment residual motor movements.
