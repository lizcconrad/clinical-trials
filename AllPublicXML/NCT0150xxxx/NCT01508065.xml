    <textblock>
      Adequate glycemic control in patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a desired therapeutic
      goal that is difficult to achieve with current blood glucose monitoring technology. Home
      blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) technology, which requires finger pricking, is a source of
      severe inconvenience and hence, a lack of compliance.Thus, the need for non-invasive and easy
      to operate glucose monitoring in DM patients for strict glycemic control cannot be
      overemphasized.

      The Glucometer GM-205 blood glucose readings are accurate and measure blood glucose with an
      acceptable mean relative error when compared to acceptable invasive blood glucose
      measurements.

      The primary objectives of the trial are to determine:

        1. The safety of the Glucometer GM-205 in evaluating blood glucose levels

        2. The accuracy of the Glucometer GM-205 in evaluating blood glucose levels

    <description>To assess the accuracy of the Glucometer GM-205 blood glucose readings as evaluated by:
Mean relative error when compared to venous blood glucose measured by a laboratory device and SBGM (home use glucometer)
Correlation with values measured by glucose hexokinase based assay
Clark error grid with measurements of venous blood as the comparing value</description>

    <description>Safety will be evaluated in a descriptive manner by recording all adverse events in the patient population by number and severity.
The study will evaluate safety by assessing:
Device related adverse events: local and systemic effects of the Glucometer GM-205 including: redness, burns, pain , or other complications.
General adverse events: Adverse events not directly related to the Glucometer GM-205 device but are related to the study procedure (i.e clamping), such as: local infection, blood clot, bleeding, hypoglycemia.</description>

    <description>The study procedure consists of two days trial. Each day consists of 4-6 hours, during which, hyper and hypoglycaemic clamp will be done. The first day will be used to calibrate the non-invasive Glucometer GM-205 for the specific patient.. The calibration will be done using the hexokinase assay (YSI 2300 STAT Plus) from the venous. During the second day, hyper and hypo glycemic clamp will be done and the results of blood glucose level reading from the non-invasive</description>
