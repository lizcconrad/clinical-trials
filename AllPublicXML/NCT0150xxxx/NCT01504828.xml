  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Normal aging is characterized by altered cardiovascular function. Our preliminary data with
      MR imaging and spectroscopy in normal subjects without cardiovascular disease or hypertension
      show that age-related cardiac dysfunction is characterized initially by impaired relaxation
      of the heart (40 - 60 years), and then at &gt; 60 years altered contraction and impaired
      myocardial energetics. For the first time, the investigators will test whether the functional
      and energetic effects of normal aging can be reversed by acutely reducing stiffness of
      peripheral blood vessels using an ACE inhibitor. This will potentially have important
      insights into how normal aging affects the heart, and how potential treatments could be used
      to attenuate this process.

      Normal aging is characterized by altered cardiovascular function. Our preliminary data with
      MR imaging and spectroscopy in normal subjects without cardiovascular disease or hypertension
      show that age-related cardiac dysfunction is characterized initially by diastolic dysfunction
      (40 - 60 years), and then at &gt; 60 years altered systolic strains and impaired myocardial
      energetics. The investigators propose to study the mechanism of these findings in subjects
      with normal aging without any cardiovascular disease, hypothesizing that increased vascular
      stiffening contributes to impaired energetics and left ventricular function. For the first
      time, the investigators will test whether the functional and energetic effects of normal
      aging can be reversed by acutely reducing afterload using an ACE inhibitor. This will be
      tested at 2 ages (40-60 and &gt; 60 years), so that the intervention tests the hypothesis soon
      after the abnormalities develop (40-60 years - diastolic dysfunction; &gt; 60 years energetics
      and altered strains). This will potentially have important insights into how normal aging
      affects the heart, and how potential treatments could be used to attenuate this process.

    <description>There are 3 principal measures of vascular stiffness, and these are central pulse pressure, central systolic pressure, and the augmentation index. These are correlated against the 3 principal measures of left ventricular function and energetics that are known to change with age: torsion to shortening ratio, early to late diastolic filling ratio, and the ratio of phosphocreatine to adenosine triphosphate (listed as separate Primary Outcome Measures).</description>

    <time_frame>6 hours - Acute study, no follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A single dose of ACE inhibitor is given to reduce vascular stiffness, and we then measure the effects of this on the measures of left ventricular function and energetics which are the torsion to shortening ratio, diastolic early to late filling ratio, and the phosphocreatine to adenosine triphosphate ratio.</description>
