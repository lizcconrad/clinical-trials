  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomised clinical trial (RCT) is to compare, in terms of
      disability and pain, an intervention targeting the opening of intervertebral foramens to a
      conventional physiotherapy intervention, in patients presenting acute or subacute cervical
      radiculopathies. Based on biomechanical principles, the investigators hypothesis is that the
      intervention targeting the opening of intervertebral foramens will be significantly more
      effective in reducing pain and disability than the conventional physiotherapy intervention.

      This study is double-blind RCT that will allow the comparison of patients with a cervical
      radiculopathy randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group will receive a 4-week
      rehabilitation program targeting the opening of intervertebral foramen, and the second group
      will receive a 4-week conventional rehabilitation program. Thirty-six subjects will be
      recruited from participating medical and physiotherapy clinics in the Quebec City area
      (Canada) and will be evaluated at baseline, at the end of the program and four weeks
      following the end of the program. The primary outcome measure will be the validated Neck
      Disability Index (NDI) questionnaire and other secondary measures will include the QuickDASH
      questionnaire, a numerical pain rating scale, cervicothoracic mobility and patients'
      perceived global rating of change.

    <textblock>
      Cervical radiculopathy is a common form of neck pain and has been shown to lead to severe
      disability. Clinical rehabilitation approaches for cervical radiculopathies commonly include
      exercise and manual therapy interventions targeting the opening of intervertebral foramen but
      evidence regarding their effectiveness is scarce.

      This double-blind randomised clinical trial will allow the comparison, in terms of pain and
      disability, of patients presenting a cervical radiculopathy which will have been randomly
      assigned to one of the two intervention groups: the first group (n = 18) will receive a
      4-week rehabilitation program targeting the opening of intervertebral foramen, the second
      group (n = 18) will receive a 4-week conventional rehabilitation program. Participants will
      be evaluated on three separate occasions: at baseline (week 0), at the end of the 4-week
      program (week 4), and four weeks following the end of the program (week 8).

    <description>The conventional program consists in cervicothoracic mobilizations and stabilization exercises. This program is based on the intervention used in clinical practice, and on programs proposed in two RCTs evaluating individuals with neck and arm pain that do not include any specific mobilization or exercise leading to the opening of the intervertebral foramen. Four mobilisation techniques will be executed at each treatment session. However, the therapists will not be allowed to use techniques that specifically open the intervertebral foramen of the affected segment, two segments above and two segments below.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The same interventions as for the conventional rehabilitation program will be applied, except:
Of the four mobilisation techniques, there will be two mandatory techniques targeting the opening of the intervertebral foramen on the same side and at the same level as the radiculopathy: global contralateral rotation mobilisation and ipsilateral lateral shearing in a flexion position. The therapist, according to the biomechanical evaluation results, will choose the two other mobilisation techniques.</description>
