      The purpose of the study is comparatively analyze the advantages and disadvantages of banded
      versus unbanded laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).

      The outcome variables of the general study included morbidity, maximal weight loss, and late
      weight regain.

      Obesity is a public health problem that has grown exponentially worldwide. Bariatric surgery
      has been recognized as the most effective treatment for morbid obesity. However, the debate
      about the best surgical procedure is still considerable.

      Among a wide range of operations that have been used for morbid obesity, Roux-en-Y gastric
      bypass (RYGB) has shown an appropriate risk/benefit balance and has achieved a high degree of
      acceptance in America.

      The weight loss pattern in RYGB is characteristic and includes significant eight loss during
      the first 2 years after surgery, followed by some weight regain after the second or third
      postoperative year. To prevent this some authors suggest the placement of a premeasured band
      or ring around the gastric reservoir, adjacent to the gastroenterostomy. This procedure has
      been called banded RYGB.

    <description>A 6.5-cm polypropylene Marlex mesh was placed immediately cephalad to the gastrojejunostomy. The gastrojejunostomy was hand-sewn in 2 layers using 3-0 Polyglactin for the internal and 3-0 silk for the external layer.
The length of alimentary and biliopancreatic limbs was approximately 150 cm and 50 cm, respectively.</description>
