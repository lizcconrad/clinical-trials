  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many human and animal studies over the past 40 years have revealed that ovaries and Fallopian
      tubes have a lower temperature than core body temperature, especially around the time of
      ovulation and early embryo development. Whether average core body temperature, 37 degrees
      Celsius, is ideal temperature for culture has not been prospectively evaluated. The purpose
      of this study is to determine whether lowering the incubator temperature by 1 degree Celsius
      will result in meaningful improvements in embryo development and pregnancy rates.

      Patients participating in this study will undergo routine in vitro fertilization (IVF)
      stimulation. Following egg retrieval, patients with at least 8 mature eggs will have those
      eggs divided randomly into two groups. Both groups will then under ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic
      sperm injection) to fertilize the eggs. The groups will randomly be assigned to control or
      study condition. The control condition group will be cultured at 37 degrees Celsius, the
      current standard of care. The study group will be cultured at 36 degrees Celsius. All other
      culture conditions will be kept identical and embryos will be assessed on day 3 and day 5 of
      development.

      On day 5, all well-developed blastocysts will undergo biopsy for Comprehensive Chromosomal
      Screening (CCS), which will evaluate the chromosomal normalcy of the embryo . Patients will
      undergo transfer on the morning of day 6 and the highest quality, chromosomally normal embryo
      from each group (the 36 degree cultured embryos and the 37 degree cultured embryos) will be
      transferred. If only 1 embryo is available for transfer, the patient will have a single
      embryo transfer.

      All embryos available for cryopreservation will undergo biopsy for CCS before being frozen.
      Some arrested embryos from each temperature group will also undergo genetic analysis to
      evaluate chromosomal normalcy or mosaicism.

      The female patient will undergo a blood draw at 9 weeks gestation and buccal swabs will be
      obtained from the infant(s) after birth.
