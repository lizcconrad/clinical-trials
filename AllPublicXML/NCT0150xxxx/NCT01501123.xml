      PREHOSPITAL AGITATION AND SEDATION TRIAL (PHAST)

        -  The goal of the PHAST is to demine whether haloperidol is superior to midazolam for the
           sedation of agitated patients in the prehospital environment

        -  The primary outcome is the time to a Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) ≤1

           o The RASS is a well validated standardized score to measure a patient's agitation

        -  The secondary outcomes are

             -  Time until RASS returns to 0 or 1 if RASS &lt;0

             -  Need for additional sedation

             -  Adverse effects (need for intubation, arrhythmia)

        -  Mercy EMS will be the only EMS agency in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania carrying
           haloperidol

        -  Identification of potential study patients will be per state protocols

        -  Exclusion Criteria for the study

        -  Age &lt;18

        -  Pregnant

        -  Allergic to study medication

        -  Transport to hospital other than Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital

        -  Unable to reach medical command prior to giving medication

        -  When a paramedic identifies a possible study candidate, the paramedic will consult
           medical command to see if the patient is appropriate for the study

        -  If the medical command agrees the patient is appropriate for the study, patients will be
           randomized to

        -  Odd days: Haloperidol 5mg IM (age &lt;65) or haloperidol 2.5 mg IM (age ≥65)

        -  Even days: Midazolam 0.05 mg IM to maximum of 5mg IM (age &lt;65) or maximum of 2.5mg (age
           ≥65)

        -  The RASS will be documented by the prehospital providers every 5 minutes until arrival
           at the hospital

        -  Once the patient arrives at the ED, the RASS will be documented in PICIS® by the
           emergency department nurse at the time of triage and at a minimum of hourly until the
           RASS =0 or 1 for 2 consecutive hours

        -  Questions may be directed to Dr. Isenberg at disenberg@mercyhealth.org or at (267)

      Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale

      RASS RASS Description

        -  4 Combative, violent, danger to staff

        -  3 Pulls or removes tube(s) or catheters; aggressive

        -  2 Frequent non-purposeful movement

        -  1 Anxious, apprehensive, but not aggressive 0 Alert and calm

             -  1 Awakens to voice (eye opening/contact) &gt;10 sec

             -  2 Light sedation, briefly awakens to voice (eye opening/contact) &lt;10 sec

             -  3 Moderate sedation, movement or eye opening. No eye contact

             -  4 Deep sedation, no response to voice, but movement or eye opening to physical
                stimulation

             -  5 Unarousable, no response to voice or physical stimulation
