  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment of unexplained anemia in older
      adults and elevated inflammatory markers with oral salsalate can improve hemoglobin levels
      and improve physical activity and quality of life.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is well-defined morbidity and mortality associated with anemia in the elderly and the
      increasing proportion of elderly adults underscores the population's attributable risk of
      anemia. As a potentially modifiable factor, an urgent need exists to delineate the impact of
      anemia correction in the elderly. The Partnership for Anemia: Clinical and Translational
      Trials in the Elderly (PACTTE) consortium has been created to focus on treatment strategies
      for anemia in elderly patients. The data presented in this protocol provides a compelling
      rationale to evaluate the impact of an anti-inflammatory (Salsalate) in older anemic adults
      with elevated serum iL-6 levels.

      Subjects will be 65 years or older adults with unexplained anemia and a elevated serum iL-6 ≥
      1.0 pg/mL.

      Subjects will receive 750mg of salsalate or matching placebo (one pill) twice a day (am and
      pm) for one month. After one month the dose will be increased to 1500mg (2 pills) twice a day
      (am and pm) if the 750mg dose was tolerated for a further 5 months (for a total of 6 months)

      The primary endpoint is to assess whether salsalate improves hemoglobin levels from baseline
      to 6 month visit.

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Outcome Measures as Determined by Speed of Processing</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To quantify the impact of anemia treatment by salsalate on cognitive outcomes based on speed of processing was derived using the z-scores of the following three tests: (1) TMT Part A seconds per completed circle, (2) simple reaction time from the CogState Detection Task, and (3) choice reaction time from the CogState Identification Task. The composite score for a subject at each time point was defined as the mean of the Z-scores for the three tests at the time point. For each subject, the Z-score for each test at time point was derived by subtracting the subject's score at the time point from the overall baseline mean of the test and then dividing by the overall baseline standard deviation of the test. Positive z-scores indicate a better performance compared to the baseline average.The change in the Z-score from baseline to month 6.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline; 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To quantify the impact of anemia treatment by salsalate on change in the frailty as measured by change in self-reported activity level. Frailty for activity level is classified by subjects responses to 6physical activity questions on the short version of the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity Questionnaire , were related to walking for exercise, moderately strenuous outdoor chores, dancing, bowling, and regular exercise. The Women's Health And Aging Study (WHAS) scoring algorithm was used to define frailty for self-reported activity level. The answers to these questions were used to calculate kilocalories (Kcals) per week, using the WHAS algorithm, which is further satisfied by by gender. For men, Kcals &lt; 128 per week is frail. For women, Kcals &lt; 90 per week is frail. This is a categorical measurement of yes or no.

        <title>Change in Cognitive Outcome Measures as Determined by Speed of Processing</title>
        <description>To quantify the impact of anemia treatment by salsalate on cognitive outcomes based on speed of processing was derived using the z-scores of the following three tests: (1) TMT Part A seconds per completed circle, (2) simple reaction time from the CogState Detection Task, and (3) choice reaction time from the CogState Identification Task. The composite score for a subject at each time point was defined as the mean of the Z-scores for the three tests at the time point. For each subject, the Z-score for each test at time point was derived by subtracting the subject's score at the time point from the overall baseline mean of the test and then dividing by the overall baseline standard deviation of the test. Positive z-scores indicate a better performance compared to the baseline average.The change in the Z-score from baseline to month 6.</description>

        <title>Change in Cognitive Outcome Measures as Determined by Composite Complex Attention/Executive Processing</title>
        <description>To quantify the impact of anemia treatment by salsalate on cognitive outcomes based on Complex attention/executive processing was derived using the z-scores of the following three tests: (1) TMT Part B seconds per completed circle, (2) time score from the CogState One Back Task, and (3) accuracy score from the CogState One Back Task. The composite score for a subject at each time point was defined as the mean of the Z-scores for the three tests at the time point. For each subject, the Z-score for each test at time point was derived by subtracting the overall baseline mean of the test from the subject's score at the time point (accuracy score) or by subtracting the subject's score at the time point from the overall baseline mean of the test (TMT and time score) and then dividing by the overall baseline standard deviation of the test. Positive z-scores indicate a better performance compared to the baseline average. The change in the Z-score from baseline to month 6.</description>

        <description>To quantify the impact of anemia treatment by salsalate on self-reported outcomes measures by change in SF36 physical component score. The SF-36 form identifies self-report physical function and global measure of quality of life and is a multi-purpose, short-form health survey consisting of 36 questions. The Physical Component Summary (PCS) is a subscale of the SF-36 that correlates with physical health domains of the SF-36 ( Physical Function, Role-Physical, and Bodily Pain). The change is calculated and compared from baseline to 6 months. The SF-36 PCS score is a norm based sore with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 where results above and below 50 are above and below the average, respectively, in the 2009 general US population.</description>

        <description>To quantify the impact of anemia treatment by salsalate on change in the frailty as measured by change in self-reported activity level. Frailty for activity level is classified by subjects responses to 6physical activity questions on the short version of the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity Questionnaire , were related to walking for exercise, moderately strenuous outdoor chores, dancing, bowling, and regular exercise. The Women's Health And Aging Study (WHAS) scoring algorithm was used to define frailty for self-reported activity level. The answers to these questions were used to calculate kilocalories (Kcals) per week, using the WHAS algorithm, which is further satisfied by by gender. For men, Kcals &lt; 128 per week is frail. For women, Kcals &lt; 90 per week is frail. This is a categorical measurement of yes or no. The outcome is the number of participants who were classified as “frail” at baseline and changed to “not frail” at 6 months.</description>

          <title>Change in the Frailty Component as Determined by Self-reported Activity Level</title>
          <description>To quantify the impact of anemia treatment by salsalate on change in the frailty as measured by change in self-reported activity level. Frailty for activity level is classified by subjects responses to 6physical activity questions on the short version of the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity Questionnaire , were related to walking for exercise, moderately strenuous outdoor chores, dancing, bowling, and regular exercise. The Women's Health And Aging Study (WHAS) scoring algorithm was used to define frailty for self-reported activity level. The answers to these questions were used to calculate kilocalories (Kcals) per week, using the WHAS algorithm, which is further satisfied by by gender. For men, Kcals &lt; 128 per week is frail. For women, Kcals &lt; 90 per week is frail. This is a categorical measurement of yes or no. The outcome is the number of participants who were classified as “frail” at baseline and changed to “not frail” at 6 months.</description>

        <title>Change in Frailty Component as Determined by Grip Strength</title>
        <description>To quantify the impact of anemia treatment by salsalate on change in the frailty as measured by change in grip strength. Subjects squeeze the grip strength machine 3 times with each hand. For the frailty outcome the maximum grip strength from the dominant hand is used. (change from frail at baseline to not frail at 6 months). Grip strength is stratified by gender and BMI. For men with (BMI &lt;= 24 and a grip strength (GS) &lt;= 29) or (BMI 24.1-28 and grip strength &lt;= 30) or (BMI &gt;28 and a grip strength &lt;= 32) were classified as &quot;frail&quot;. For women with (BMI &lt;= 23 and a grip strength of &lt;= 17) or (BMI 23.1-26 and a GS &lt;= 17.3) or (BMI 26.1-29 and a GS &lt;= 18) or (BMI &gt; 29 and a GS &lt;= 21) were classified as &quot;frail&quot;.The outcome is the number of participants who were classified as “frail” at baseline and changed to “not frail” at 6 months.</description>
