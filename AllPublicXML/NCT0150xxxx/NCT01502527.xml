    <textblock>
      Based on previous data published on the SERM properties of Femarelle, the investigators
      hypothesized that Femarelle could be a potential treatment for Vulvo-vaginal atrophy(VVA)
      symptoms. The current study was a pilot study to examine the effect of Femarelle® on VVA
      symptoms in symptomatic post-menopausal women.

      Post-menopausal women aged 54-77, with vaginal atrophy (&lt; 5% superficial cells on cervical
      cytology) with at least one moderate-to-severe VVA symptom (dryness, irritation, soreness,
      dysuria, dyspareunia, or bleeding with coitus), will be recruited for a 12-week open-label
      pilot study. The study protocol was approved by Schulman Associates IRB.Femarelle will be
      given twice daily and subjective symptoms as well as objective measures like inspection and
      vaginal pH will be measured.
