    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether PCI added to OMT could be superior
      over OMT alone in the prevention of late adverse cardiac and cerebro-vascular events in
      elderly patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) during the additional 12 months.

      Study Design

        -  Prospective, randomized, multi-center study of each 1600 subjects enrolled.

        -  Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to a) PCI added to OMT (n=800) vs. b) OMT
           alone(n=800).

      Subsequently, subjects in PCI added to OMT group will be randomly assigned to everolimus
      eluting stent(n=400) vs. zotarolimus eluting sten(n=400). All subjects will be followed for 1
      year after randomization. Additional long-term follow-up (2- or 3-year) will be preceded in
      the next plan after 1-year study period.

        -  Subjects with CAD who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included

        -  Clinical and laboratory follow-up should be performed.
