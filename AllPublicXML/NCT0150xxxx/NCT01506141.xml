  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elaprase, a large molecular protein, is not expected to cross the blood brain barrier when
      administered intravenously. A revised formulation of idursulfase, idursulfase-IT, that
      differs from that of the intravenous (IV) formulation, Elaprase, has been developed to be
      suitable for delivery into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via intrathecal administration.

      This extension study of HGT-HIT-045 is designed to collect long-term safety data in pediatric
      patients with Hunter syndrome and cognitive impairment who are receiving intrathecal
      idursulfase-IT and intravenous Elaprase enzyme replacement therapy.

    <description>Safety of intrathecal administration of idursulfase-IT will be measured by type and severity of adverse events (AEs), changes in clinical laboratory testing (serum chemistry including liver function tests, hematology, urinalysis), 12-lead ECG, CSF chemistries, and anti-idursulfase antibodies (in CSF and serum by isotype: immunoglobulin (Ig) IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE and antibodies having enzyme neutralizing activity.</description>

    <description>Single and multiple-dose PK profiles for idursulfase following IT and IV infusions will be established by analyzing standard PK parameters including: area under the curve (AUC), maximum serum concentration (Cmax), time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax), serum clearance normalized for body weight (CL), apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss), Vss normalized for body weight (Vss %BW), mean residence time (MRT) and elimination half life (t1/2).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have completed all study requirements and end of study assessments for
             study HGT-HIT-045 prior to enrolling in Study HGT-HIT-046 and must have no safety or
             medical issues that contraindicate participation.

          -  The patient's parent(s) or legally authorized guardian(s) must have voluntarily signed
             an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee(IEC)-approved
             informed consent form after all relevant aspects of the study have been explained and
             discussed. Consent of the patient's parent(s) or legally authorized guardian(s) and
             the patient's assent, as relevant, must be obtained.

          -  That patient has received and tolerated a minimum of 12 months of treatment with
             weekly IV infusions of Elaprase and has received 80% of the total planned infusions
             within the last 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has received treatment with any investigational drug (other than
             idursulfase-IT) or device within 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Patient is unable to comply with the protocol (eg, is unable to return for safety
             evaluations, or is otherwise unlikely to complete the study) as determined by the
             investigator.

          -  Patient has experienced an adverse reaction to study drug in Study HGT-HIT-045 that
             contraindicates further treatment with intrathecal idursulfase-IT.

          -  Patient has a known hypersensitivity to any of the components of idursulfase-IT.

          -  For patients who were previously untreated with intrathecal idursulfase-IT in Study
             HGT-HIT-045, the patient has an opening CSF pressure upon lumbar puncture that exceeds
             30.0 cm H2O
