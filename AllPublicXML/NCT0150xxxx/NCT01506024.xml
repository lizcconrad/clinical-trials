  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to explore the most efficient surgical approach in total hip
      replacement in short and long term when concerning strength, functionality and postoperative
      complications.

      The objective is to register muscular strength, hip joint functionality/mobilisation and
      complications after total hip arthroplasty (THA) performed by the direct lateral approach
      (DLA), the posterior approach (PA) and the anterior approach (AA). The latter is a modified
      Smith-Petersen approach which follows the principles of minimally invasive surgery (MIS).

      The primary working hypothesis is that due to a minimal dissection and reduced trauma in the
      muscles, patients will tolerate early hospital discharge better after the AA than the PA and
      the DLA. Patients in the AA group are also thought to be more active and maintain muscular
      strength and hip joint functionality/mobilisation better than patients in the lateral group.

      With total hip replacement surgery, the orthopaedic surgeon's aim is not only pain relief for
      the patient, but also restoration of hip joint biomechanics resulting in a minimal functional
      deficit and maximal longevity of the implant. It is not exceptional that these patients still
      experience mild to moderate long-term impairments postoperatively. These impairments include
      pain, muscle weakness of the hip abductors, contracture of the hip, gait disorders, as well
      as weakness of hip extensors and flexors. These problems may in turn lead to complications
      such as joint instability and loosening of the implant.

      MIS is defined as a surgical approach performed through a short skin and muscle incision to
      avoid injury to muscles and tendons. Following minimally invasive approach reduced muscle
      trauma has been found. Moreover clinical outcome improved, as the gluteus medius muscle can
      be spared more successfully. However, it is debated whether or not the overall results of MIS
      are superior, or even as good as the traditional hip replacement surgery in terms of
      component placing and time to revision of the prosthesis.
