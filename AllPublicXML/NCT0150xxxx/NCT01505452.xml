  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to clinically demonstrate a phenomenon of measurement error that
      can occur during placement of a specific type of total knee replacement prosthesis (single
      radius femoral component) using a certain type of surgical technique (flexion/extension gap
      balancing).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in varus/vagus laxity of the knee joint measured with the knee positioned at a 90 degree angle with posteriorly stabilized vs. cruciate retaining trails in place.</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of the surgical procedure</time_frame>
    <description>During the surgical procedure each participant will undergo measurement of varus/valgus laxity (in degrees) at 90 degrees knee flexion using both types of trial implants in sequence. We will evaluate whether the difference of varus/valgus laxity between the two surgical conditions is correlated to change in anterior/posterior relative position of the tibia (relative to femur) measured between the two conditions. A positive correlation between these two variables (change of position to change of laxity) would demonstrate a potential for measurement error that could occur during surgical procedures if position change of the tibia is not accounted for. All outcomes for this study are measured during the surgical procedure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Scheduled to undergo primary total knee arthroplasty performed by the principal
             investigator

          -  Use of a single radius posterior-stabilized TKA prosthesis is planned

          -  Spinal anesthetic is planned

          -  Diagnosis of osteoarthritis

          -  Has normal knee ligaments with no history of previous injury or surgery to ligaments,
             or other pathologic condition

          -  Has at least 100 degrees knee flexion preoperatively (measured by long goniometer)

          -  Gives valid informed consent

          -  Age 18 years or older

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient receives general anesthetic

          -  Diagnosis other than osteoarthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, avascular necrosis,
             post-traumatic arthritis)

          -  History of any prior knee ligament injury, or any surgery to ligaments

          -  Any connective tissue disease affecting integrity of the ligaments (must have normal
             ligaments)

          -  History of long bone fracture in the affected leg

          -  Flexion contracture that would interfere with ability to establish extension gap
             reliably (judgment of investigator)

          -  Maximum pre-operative knee flexion is less than 100 degrees.

          -  Patient is non-ambulatory

          -  Any preclusion or inability to use navigation

          -  Treatment with single radius posterior stabilized TKA prosthesis is not indicated

          -  Participation is not in best interest of patient for any reason

          -  Cannot or does not give valid informed consent

          -  Female patient who is currently pregnant

          -  Age less than 18 years

          -  Body mass index greater than 40 kg/(m*m)

          -  Incarcerated
