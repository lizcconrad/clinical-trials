  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to determine whether treatment with the Philips
      Sonalleve Magnetic Resonance-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU) system is
      effective in the treatment symptomatic uterine leiomyomas (uterine fibroids).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uterine Fibroids are the most common benign tumors in pre- and peri-menopausal women.
      Fibroids occur in 20-50% of women over 30 years of age, and with increasing size can produce
      pain, menorrhagia, pressure, bloating and urinary and bowel compression symptoms. Fibroids
      may also cause infertility. Symptomatic fibroids impact health and well-being of the female
      including lost work hours and reduced quality of life.

      Current medical treatments include invasive removal of the fibroid (hysterectomy,
      myomectomy), drug therapy, or treatments causing necrosis of the fibroid tissue such as
      ablation (freezing or heating) or embolization. It has been estimated that 600,000
      hysterectomies are performed per year in the United States and more than half of the
      conducted hysterectomies are due to fibroids. For the relief of symptoms, women wishing to
      preserve the uterus may choose between invasive procedures of myomectomy, Uterine Artery
      Embolization (UAE), ablation or cryotherapy. The surgically invasive procedures require
      anesthesia, hospital stays, and long recovery periods. However, High Intensity Focused
      Ultrasound (HIFU) shows promising results in relieving fibroid symptoms.

      This study will confirm the safety and clinical effectiveness of Philips Sonalleve MR-HIFU
      Fibroid Therapy system for ablating symptomatic fibroids.

0 = Failure. Failure occurs if an AIT for fibroid related symptoms is administered within 12 months of study treatment.
1 = Success. Success occurs if no AIT is administered for fibroid related symptoms within 12 months of study treatment.
An AIT is defined as being one of the following: hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, endometrial ablation and resection, or another MR-HIFU treatment (with the exception of a 're-treatment' as defined in the protocol, e.g. because of temporarily inaccessible fibroids).</description>
