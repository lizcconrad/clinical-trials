      This study is conducted in Europe. The aim of this study is to evaluate ease of injection of
      growth hormone in patients using Norditropin NordiFlex® with NordiFlex PenMate™. Convenience
      and tolerability of NordiFlex PenMate™ - an automatic injection and a needle hiding device -
      is also evaluated.

        Subjects from secondary care physicians who prescribe growth hormone will be included in
        the study. Children who are available for Norditropin® treatment in accordance with the
        labelling will be included in the study: Newly-diagnosed subjects who have never received
        growth hormone therapy before and subjects in whom physician identifies a need for switch
        to another growth hormone preparation

             hormone therapy in accordance with the locally approved labelling, any subject is
             eligible for the study, including newly diagnosed subjects who have never received
             growth hormone therapy before and subjects who were treated with the other growth
             hormone products (with exclusion of patients who received previously Norditropin
             Nordiflex®) and need to be switched to a new product. The selection of the subjects
             will be at the discretion of the individual physician
