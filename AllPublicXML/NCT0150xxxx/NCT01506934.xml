      A pharmacokinetic study to compare 2 clinical formulations of linifanib and the effect of
      food on the pharmacokinetics of linifanib.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the bioavailability of linifanib from two formulations and
      the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the linifanib formulation intended for
      commercialization. Subjects may enroll in a separate extension study to continue receiving
      linifanib after completion of this study.
