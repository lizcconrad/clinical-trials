    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed to investigate the efficacy profile of the SENSIMED
      Triggerfish® during 24-hour IOP monitoring in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension,
      done three times at monthly intervals under different therapeutic regimen. This trial will
      also evaluate the efficacy of SENSIMED Triggerfish® to detect changes in intraocular pressure
      (IOP) after the water drinking test (WDT) will be investigated.
