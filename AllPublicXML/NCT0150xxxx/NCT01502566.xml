      Objective:

      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an oral health educative intervention
      in preventing early childhood caries (ECC).

      Methods:

      The trial targets 0- to 12-month-old children and their mothers in Pelotas, Brazil.
      Twenty-four public health centres (clusters) were randomly selected and assigned to
      intervention or control group (12 clusters per intervention group). In each center, up to 30
      children/mothers were selected and invited to participate in the trial. Each mother was
      interviewed in order to collect socio-economic and demographic variables. The intervention
      group received by means of a pamphlet the oral health instructions, which were emphasized
      with verbal instructions. Dental examination will be carried out after 1 year for all teeth
      surfaces to determine caries status.
