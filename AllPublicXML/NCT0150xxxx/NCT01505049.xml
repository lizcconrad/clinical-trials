  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccines for human papillomavirus (HPV) have been available in the United States since 2006.
      Early studies have shown a high rate of effectiveness of these vaccines, however it is not
      known how long this protection will last. The IMAP study will look at various parts of the
      immune system and potential markers for long lived immune responses to this vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three groups of patients will be recruited for this study. One group will be women who have
      completed all three vaccinations. The second group will be women who are overdue for their
      final vaccination. We also recruit women who have not been vaccinated previously.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female ages 18-26 inclusive (18-30 for women who have been previously vaccinated

          2. If sexually active and enrolled in unvaccinated group, must use a reliable form of
             birth control for the first seven months of the study. For the purposes of this
             protocol a reliable form will be hormonal or barrier contraception. Intrauterine
             devices and a history of sterilization will also be considered reliable forms of birth
             control. Abstaining from sex is also a reliable form of contraception.

          3. Able to give informed consent

          4. Negative urine pregnancy test at enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently pregnant, breast feeding or planning a pregnancy

          2. Underlying immunological disease, such as previously diagnosed HIV infection or
             history of transplantation, history of splenectomy

          3. Use of medications with potential immunological effects such as systemic
             corticosteroids or chemotherapy

          4. Prior therapy for cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer such as loop excision, laser
             ablation, cryotherapy or hysterectomy

          5. Unable to comply with protocol

          6. Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous vaccine dose or to a
             vaccine component

          7. An acute illness, including an oral temperature of 100.4 degrees F within three days
             of visit

        other more specific exclusions may apply to one of the three cohorts
