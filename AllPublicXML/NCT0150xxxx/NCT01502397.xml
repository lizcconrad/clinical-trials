      The purpose of this study is to determine whether preemptive nucleoside analogue therapy or
      regular virologic monitoring is the preferred method in management patients with prior
      exposure to hepatitis B vius (HBV) and undergoing rituximab-containing chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been documented in patients undergoing
      rituximab-containing chemotherapy who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative but
      with serologic evidence of prior exposure to HBV. However detailed prospective studies
      documenting the incidence of reactivation and the virologic and serologic kinetics of
      reactivation are lacking. The investigators prospective study proposes to follow-up 70 such
      patients with all serologic and virologic parameters monitored every 4 weeks. Patients with
      detectable HBV DNA will be started on nucleoside analogue therapy. The optimal method and
      duration of monitoring will also be determined from our study.
