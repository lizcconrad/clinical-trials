  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alirocumab (SAR236553/REGN727) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds PCSK9
      (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9).

      Primary Objective of the study:

      To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of alirocumab in high cardiovascular risk
      participants with hypercholesterolemia not adequately controlled with their current lipid
      modifying therapy (LMT).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the effect of alirocumab on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)
           levels after 24 weeks of treatment in comparison with placebo.

        -  To evaluate the effect of alirocumab in comparison with placebo on LDL-C at other time
           points.

        -  To evaluate the effects of alirocumab on other lipid parameters.

      The maximum study duration was to be 89 weeks per participant, including a 3-week screening
      period, a 78-week randomized treatment period and 8-week follow-up period.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 320 centers in 27 countries. Overall, 5144 participants were screened between January 2012 and March 2013, 2801 of whom were screen failures. Screen failures were mainly due to exclusion criteria met. In addition 2 participants received study drug but did not undergo randomization. They were excluded from analysis.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization was stratified as per diagnosis of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH), prior history of myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemic stroke, intensity of statin treatment and geographic region. Assignment to treatment arms was done centrally using an Interactive Voice/Web Response System in a 1:2 ratio (placebo:alirocumab).</pre_assignment_details>
