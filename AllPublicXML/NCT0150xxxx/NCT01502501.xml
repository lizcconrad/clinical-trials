  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions:

        1. Is the proposed treatment safe

        2. Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with Heart Disease
           as assessed by a series of measurements indicating improvement, stability, or
           degradation of a patient's cardiovascular function and exercise capacity?

      This will be an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center patient-sponsored study designed to
      assess the safety and cardiovascular effects of Adipose-derived Stem Cell (ASC) implantation
      using a catheter delivery system in patients who have nonischemic congestive heart failure. A
      percutaneous transluminal endomyocardial injection catheter will be used for delivery of
      ASCs. The therapy is composed of cells isolated from a patient's own adipose tissue.
      Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen for subsequent
      processing to isolate the stem cells.
