      This study plans to learn more about the immune system's response to breast cancer in young
      women.

      The investigators will be looking at the level of immune suppression in different types of
      breast cancer. The investigators will use blood, urine, and tissue samples from patients with
      Pregnancy Associated Breast Cancer (PABC) versus non-PABC, as well as comparing different
      types of breast cancer. If tissue sampling permits, the investigators may use some of the
      breast cancer tissue to develop models for human cancer for drug targeting. Understanding the
      immune response and suppression in different types of cancer will help us understand
      mechanisms involved in breast cancer better and help the investigators in developing new
      treatment in the future.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females 50 or younger

          -  Histological or cytological confirmation of breast cancer

          -  Any clinical stage is allowed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any known autoimmune condition, chronic steroid use, underlying immune disease (other
             than breast cancer), use of immunomodulatory prescription drugs for any medical
             condition.

          -  The presence of other comorbid conditions known to impact immune function, (such as:
             type I diabetes, uncontrolled adult onset diabetes, severe chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease (COPD), uncontrolled infection or known HIV infection.)

          -  Underlying psychiatric condition which would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             preclude compliance with study requirements

          -  Diagnosed with another type of cancer within 5 years except for breast cancer,
             cervical or non-melanomatous skin cancer.
