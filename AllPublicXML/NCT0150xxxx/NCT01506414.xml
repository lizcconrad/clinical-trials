      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Recombinant Human Thrombopoietin (rh-TPO)
      in combination with Rituximab are effective and safe in the management of
      Steroid-Resistant/Relapsed Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rituximab was given intravenously at a dose of 100 mg weekly for 4 consecutive weeks (Day 1,
      8, 15, 22). Rh-TPO (TPIAOTM, a product of Sunshine Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, China, approved by
      China State Food and Drug Administration) was given subcutaneously at a dose of 1.0
      μg/kg（300u/kg）for 14 days (Day 1-14). Platelet count (PC) was monitored every three or four
      days until day 22, followed by tests every week. Platelet transfusion was administered to
      patients with active bleeding symptoms or to those whose PC&lt;10×10^9/L. Patients were followed
      for 3 months, and any adverse effects were recorded during the period of treatment and during
      the follow-up.
