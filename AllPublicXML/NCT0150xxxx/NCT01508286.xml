  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this early access program is to provide telaprevir to patients with a specific
      type of hepatitis C viral infection (termed 'genotype 1') who are expected to benefit from
      telaprevir-based therapy but who reside in countries in which telaprevir is not yet
      commercially available and who are not eligible for enrollment into a clinical study of
      telaprevir. The study also aims to collect information on the safety and adverse events with
      telaprevir treatment in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, which is typically
      used to treat patients with hepatitis C. In addition to hepatitis C viral infection, patients
      in this study will also have a diagnosis of liver fibrosis and compensated liver disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, multinational, open-label, non-comparative early access program
      designed to provide telaprevir to patients infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1, who
      have a documented diagnosis of liver fibrosis and compensated liver disease (Child Pugh Grade
      A), and are expected to benefit from telaprevir-based therapy. Patients will be excluded if
      they are eligible for enrollment into an ongoing clinical study of telaprevir. Enrollment of
      patients into this study will continue until telaprevir becomes available for reimbursement
      in the country in which a patient resides or until September 2013, whichever occurs first,
      unless otherwise indicated per local regulations. During the first 12 weeks of the study, all
      patients will receive telaprevir administered orally with food every 8 hours in combination
      with peginterferon-alfa/ribavirin [PEG-IFN-alfa/RBV]). Patients will then be treated with
      Peg-IFN-alfa/RBV alone for an additional 12 or 36 weeks, based on how they respond to
      treatment (assessed by levels of hepatitis C viral RNA in the plasma, which reflects the
      number of virus particles in the bloodstream) and/or by type of patient (patients with severe
      fibrosis who had not received prior treatment or had previously relapsed during treatment,
      patients with prior partial or null response [who had only partially or had not responded to
      previous treatment], patients who had viral breakthrough [recurrence of viral copies during
      antiviral treatment], or patients with cirrhosis). For all patients, rules will be applied to
      ensure that telaprevir or Peg-IFN-alfa/RBV are stopped if subjects have viral breakthrough or
      treatment failure. All patients should have a follow up visit (including measurement of
      hepatitis C viral RNA levels in the bloodstream) 24 weeks after the last administered dose of
      any treatment. Dose modifications of telaprevir are prohibited and once telaprevir treatment
      is discontinued it may not be reinitiated in this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  have evidence of hepatitis C virus infection genotype 1 (by molecular assay); - have
             quantifiable plasma hepatitis C viral RNA levels; - have documented liver fibrosis as
             assessed by liver biopsy or a non-invasive test showing severe fibrosis or cirrhosis
             (for subjects with severe fibrosis, the diagnostic test should have been performed
             within the past 18 months); - have compensated liver disease (Child-Pugh Grade A
             clinical classification); - have access to hepatitis C treatment
             (peginterferon-alfa/ribavarin)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  eligible for enrollment into an ongoing clinical study of telaprevir; - infected or
             co-infected with hepatitis C virus of a genotype other than genotype 1 and/or
             co-infected with HIV; - contraindication to the administration of peginterferon-alfa
             or ribavarin, or medical history or laboratory values that preclude treatment with
             peginterferon-alfa or ribavarin according to the respective local prescribing
             information; - history of having previously received an investigational treatment with
             hepatitis C viral protease or polymerase inhibitors (a class of drugs like
             telaprevir); - signs or symptoms of hepatocellular carcinoma (tests for serum
             alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasonography should have been done a maximum of 4 months
             before screening to screen for hepetocellular carcinoma)
