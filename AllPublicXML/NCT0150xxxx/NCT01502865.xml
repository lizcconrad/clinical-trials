  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to conduct a feasibility study using data proved by
      Department of Defense National Center for Telehealth and Technology (T2) toward the ultimate
      goal of establishing a mechanism by which VA clinicians could access data on Veterans
      regarding suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors that occurred when they were on active duty, as
      documented in the Department of Defense Suicide Event Report (DoDSER).

      As a first step toward the overall goal of this project, the investigators will use data from
      T2 to conduct the first stage of a feasibility study. Specifically, the investigators will
      attempt to match Social Security numbers (SSNs) of Soldiers who have had suicidal thoughts
      and/or behaviors in the DoDSER against SSNs of Veterans seeking mental health services at any
      VA in the United States. Once this first step has been accomplished, the investigators also
      aim to describe the group of Veterans with DoDSERs who are accessing VA services (i.e.,
      demographic information, military service variables, and health care utilization variables)
      in an attempt to better understand this group. It is anticipated that if this study is
      successful, a next step would be to explore the possibility of DoDSER data sharing with VA
      partners toward attainment of the following long-term goals: 1. Sharing information on
      history of active duty suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors among discharged individuals
      seeking mental health services in VA systems; 2. Facilitating identification of these
      Veterans; 3. Reducing VA clinician burden though effective access to existing data that may
      help in assessment and treatment planning; 4. Lowering health care costs through effective
      early management; 5. Improving quality of care for Veterans seeking services through VA
      outpatient mental health clinics.

        As of December 2009, there were 6,901 non-fatal Department of Defense Suicide Event
        Reports(DoDSERs) available for comparison to the VA system. The investigators propose to
        analyze up to 8,500 that may be available for analysis by the time the protocol is
        approved.
