          <description>Mayo score assesses stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopic findings, and physician's global assessment. It is assessed according to the following parameters:
Stool frequency (subscore 0-3) 0: Normal number of stools for patient
1 to 2 stools per day more than normal
3 to 4 stools more than normal
&gt; or = to 5 stools more than normal
Rectal bleeding (subscore 0-3) 0: No blood seen
Streaks of blood with stool less than half the time
Obvious blood with stool most of the time
Blood alone passes
Endoscopic findings (subscore 0-3) 0: Normal or inactive disease
1 Mild Disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability) 2: Moderate Disease (marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability erosions) 3: Severe Disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration)
Physician's Global Assessment (subscore 0-3) 0: Normal
Mild disease
Moderate disease
Severe disease</description>
