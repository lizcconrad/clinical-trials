  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to improve patient-physician communication and clinical decisions
      in the context of serious illness that may affect important clinical outcomes. The
      investigators will examine how variations in communication patterns and clinical decisions
      are affected by patient demographics (e.g age, sex), patient interactional style (e.g.
      communication behaviors) and physician characteristics (e.g. attitudes, background,
      training).

      This will be a randomized field experiment. Physicians will receive two unannounced covert
      standardized patient (SP) visits during the 12-24 months after enrollment. SPs are trained
      actors who will pose as patients to assess physician behavior and communication. Each SP will
      present just like a real patient, and will have a standardized fabricated scenario and
      identity. The SP visit will be unannounced; the physician will not be informed at the time of
      the visit that they are seeing an SP. The visits will be covertly audio-recorded. This is
      being conducted at 3 sites: University of Rochester, Rochester, NY; Purdue, IN; and
      University of Michigan.
