  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), safety,
      and effectiveness of multiple subcutaneous doses of Beloranib (ZGN-440).

    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to test the safety and efficacy of a drug called Beloranib
      (ZGN-440). It is to be tested for its ability to reduce weight in obese female subjects who
      are of non-childbearing potential. The study will provide information on how much ZGN-440
      gets into the blood, how long it stays in the body, and how it affects other biological
      markers.
