  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of adding 125
      mg or 250 mg doses of MK-7655 to imipenem/cilastatin in adults 18 years or older with
      complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI). The primary hypothesis is that the MK-7655 +
      imipenem/cilastatin treatment regimen is non-inferior to imipenem/cilastatin with respect to
      the proportion of participants with a favorable microbiological response at completion of
      intravenous (IV) study therapy.
