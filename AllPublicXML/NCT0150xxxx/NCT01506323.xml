  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of a portable, meditation-based
      intervention called the Mantram Repetition Program (MRP) for Veterans with military-related
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study compared the individual delivery of the MRP
      to individual delivery of Present-Centered Therapy (PCT) at two sites in San Diego,
      California, and Bedford, Massachusetts.

    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a prospective, parallel group, two-site, randomized clinical
      trial on the therapeutic treatment efficacy of the Mantram Repetition Program (MRP) by
      offering it as a stand-alone intervention, compared to an attention control condition of
      Present Centered Therapy (PCT) in a diverse sample of Veterans with post-traumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD). Primary outcomes included clinician-assessed and self-reported PTSD symptom
      severity. Secondary outcomes included insomnia, depression, anger, spiritual well-being, and
      mindfulness. Veterans were were recruited from a variety of clinics, including primary care,
      women's health, and specialty clinics in two geographical locations within the Department of
      Veterans Affairs healthcare system.

    <measure>Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th ed., Text Revision (DSM-IV)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-treatment (week 8); Baseline to 2 months post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD symptom severity is measured by CAPS to determine PTSD diagnosis. The scale rates 17 items representing the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) criteria B (re-experiencing), C (avoidance/numbing) and D (hyper-arousal). CAPS has demonstrated high levels of internal consistency, good inter-rater reliability, &amp; excellent convergent validity. The F1/I2 rule will be applied to establish the diagnosis of PTSD aligned with DSM-IV (e.g. one symptom of Criterion B, three of Criterion C, and two of Criterion D. The CAPS also includes an item to assess duration of PTSD symptoms. CAPS total score ranges from 0-136 with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Re-experiencing Subscale (Criterion B) on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-treatment (week 8); Baseline to 2 months post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>This subscale measures the frequency and intensity of (1) recurrent or intrusive recollections of trauma, (2) recurrent, distressing dreams of the trauma, (3) acting as if the traumatic event were recurring like a flashback, (4) intense psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that resemble the trauma; and/or (5) physiological reactivity on exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the trauma. Duration of these symptoms is greater than one month and symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of of functioning. Scores can range from 0 to 40 and higher scores mean greater severity of re-experiencing.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Avoidance Subscale (Criterion C) on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-treatment (week 8); Baseline to 2 months post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>This subscale measures the frequency and intensity of persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and numbing of general responsiveness as indicated by 3 or more of the following: (1) efforts to avoid thoughts, feelings, or conversations associated with the trauma, (2) efforts to avoid activities, places or people that arouse recollections of the trauma, (3) inability to recall an important aspect of the trauma, (4) markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities, (5) feelings of detachment or estrangement from others, (6) restricted range of affect, and/or (7) sense of a foreshortened future. Duration of these symptoms is greater than one month and causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of of functioning. Scores range from 0 to 56 with higher scores indicating greater severity of avoidance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hyperarousal (Criterion D) on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-treatment (week 8); baseline to 2 months post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>This subscale measures the frequency and intensity of increased arousal as indicated by two or more of the following: (1) difficulty falling or staying asleep, (2) irritability or outbursts of anger, (3) difficulty concentrating, (4) hypervigilance, and/or (5) exaggerated startle response. Duration of these symptoms is greater than one month and causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of of functioning. Scores range from 0 to 40. Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>PTSD Checklist-Military Version [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV-TR Version]</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-treatment (week 8); Baseline to 2-months post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>PCL-M: PTSD Checklist-Military version (PCL-M) is a 17-item self-report screening instrument for PTSD symptoms related to military trauma. Items are scored on a 1 (not at all bothersome) to 5 (extremely bothersome) Likert scale. Total scores range from 17 to 85. Higher scores indicate greater symptom bothersomeness. A score of &gt; 50 can suggest PTSD Test-retest reliability is high (r = 0.96) and validity is adequate, with a Kappa of 0.64 agreement for PTSD diagnosis compared to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-treatment (week 8); baseline to 2 months post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>ISI is a widely used measure of insomnia with well-established reliability and validity. It consists of seven items, three of which assess severity of insomnia (i.e., degree of difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, and waking too early). The remaining questions tap satisfaction with sleep pattern, effect of sleep on daytime and social functioning, and concern about current sleep difficulties. Both categorical and continuous measures of sleep difficulties can be assessed. Items are rated on a 0-4 Likert scale with higher scores meaning greater insomnia. Total scores range from 0-28. Original results were interpreted as 0-7 = no clinically significant insomnia, 8-14 = sub-threshold insomnia, 15-21 = moderately severe clinical insomnia and 21-28 = severe clinical insomnia. Later recommendations for a clinical, not community sample, are a cut-off of 11 points.</description>

    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-treatment (week 8); Baseline to 2-months post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ-9 is a 9-item depression screening tool based on the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder in the DSM-IV. Each item is rated from a 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) scale. Items are summed and total scores range from 0 to 27. Higher scores indicate worse depression. A score of 11 or more considered probable depression and 20 or more is considered severe depression. It is well-validated and widely-used in medical settings such as primary care. The PHQ-9 includes the two major symptom domains characteristic of depression: affective and somatic symptoms.</description>

    <description>The MRP teaches three portable, mindfulness strategies to train attention and manage symptoms: 1) Mantram (sacred word) Repetition, 2) Slowing Down, and 3) One-Pointed Attention. These tools are presented as working together synergistically and cumulatively, over time, to interrupt negative thoughts, behaviors, and emotional states such as anger, rage, irritability and impatience. Participants choose their own words or phrases and are encouraged to practice repeating a mantram at any time or place. In this study, MRP is delivered individually in eight weekly, 1-hour sessions, using a standardized manual, instructor guide, and homework assignments for experiential learning.</description>

    <description>The PCT is a form of individual therapy that is problem-oriented to improve current coping. It avoids details of traumatic experiences. In this study, it is delivered individually in 8 weekly, 1 hour sessions to serve as an active, attention control arm. Sessions are unstructured and managed so that there is some engagement of the participant's emotional concerns with an emphasis on strengths and process encouragement rather than skills training. Three components of PCT include 1) developing a therapeutic relationship for social support, 2) focusing on current problems and problem solving, 3) and setting goals.</description>

The scale rates 17 items representing the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) criteria B (re-experiencing), C (avoidance/numbing) and D (hyper-arousal). CAPS has demonstrated high levels of internal consistency, good inter-rater reliability, &amp; excellent convergent validity. The F1/I2 rule will be applied to establish the diagnosis of PTSD aligned with DSM-IV (e.g. one symptom of Criterion B, three of Criterion C, and two of Criterion D. The CAPS also includes an item to assess duration of PTSD symptoms. CAPS total score ranges from 0-136 with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.</description>

        <description>This subscale measures the frequency and intensity of (1) recurrent or intrusive recollections of trauma, (2) recurrent, distressing dreams of the trauma, (3) acting as if the traumatic event were recurring like a flashback, (4) intense psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that resemble the trauma; and/or (5) physiological reactivity on exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the trauma. Duration of these symptoms is greater than one month and symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of of functioning. Scores can range from 0 to 40 and higher scores mean greater severity of re-experiencing.</description>

These tools are presented as working together synergistically and cumulatively, over time, to interrupt negative thoughts, behaviors, and emotional states such as anger, rage, irritability and impatience. Participants choose their own words or phrases and are encouraged to practice repeating a mantram at any time or place. In this study, MRP is delivered individually in eight weekly, 1-hour sessions, using a standardized manual, instructor guide, and homework assignments for experiential learning.</description>

            <description>The PCT is a form of individual therapy that is problem-oriented to improve current coping. It typically details of traumatic experiences. In this study, it is delivered individually in 8 weekly, 1 hour sessions to serve as an active, attention comparison arm. Sessions are unstructured and managed so that there is some engagement of the participant's emotional concerns with an emphasis on strengths and process encouragement rather than skills training. Three components of PCT include 1) developing a therapeutic relationship for social support, 2) focusing on current problems and problem solving, 3) and setting goals.</description>

            <title>Present Centered Therapy (PCT)`</title>
            <description>The PCT is a form of individual therapy that is problem-oriented to improve current coping. It typically details of traumatic experiences. In this study, it is delivered individually in 8 weekly, 1 hour sessions to serve as an active, attention comparison arm. Sessions are unstructured and managed so that there is some engagement of the participant's emotional concerns with an emphasis on strengths and process encouragement rather than skills training. Three components of PCT include 1) developing a therapeutic relationship for social support, 2) focusing on current problems and problem solving, 3) and setting goals.</description>

          <title>Hyperarousal (Criterion D) on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)</title>
          <description>This subscale measures the frequency and intensity of increased arousal as indicated by two or more of the following: (1) difficulty falling or staying asleep, (2) irritability or outbursts of anger, (3) difficulty concentrating, (4) hypervigilance, and/or (5) exaggerated startle response. Duration of these symptoms is greater than one month and causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of of functioning. Scores range from 0 to 40. Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms.</description>
          <population>Intent to treat analysis included 89 MRP and 84 PCT participants. Completers at post-treatment included 69 MRP and 72 PCT participants. Completers at 2-months follow up included 65 MRP and 71 PCT participants.</population>

        <title>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</title>
        <description>ISI is a widely used measure of insomnia with well-established reliability and validity. It consists of seven items, three of which assess severity of insomnia (i.e., degree of difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, and waking too early). The remaining questions tap satisfaction with sleep pattern, effect of sleep on daytime and social functioning, and concern about current sleep difficulties. Both categorical and continuous measures of sleep difficulties can be assessed. Items are rated on a 0-4 Likert scale with higher scores meaning greater insomnia. Total scores range from 0-28. Original results were interpreted as 0-7 = no clinically significant insomnia, 8-14 = sub-threshold insomnia, 15-21 = moderately severe clinical insomnia and 21-28 = severe clinical insomnia. Later recommendations for a clinical, not community sample, are a cut-off of 11 points.</description>

Each item is rated from a 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) scale. Items are summed and total scores range from 0 to 27. Higher scores indicate worse depression. A score of 11 or more considered probable depression and 20 or more is considered severe depression. It is well-validated and widely-used in medical settings such as primary care. The PHQ-9 includes the two major symptom domains characteristic of depression: affective and somatic symptoms.</description>

            <description>The MRP teaches three portable, mindfulness strategies to train attention and manage symptoms: 1) Mantram (sacred word) Repetition, 2) Slowing Down, and 3) One-Pointed Attention. These tools are presented as working together synergistically and cumulatively, over time, to interrupt negative thoughts, behaviors, and emotional states such as anger, rage, irritability and impatience. Participants choose their own words or phrases and are encouraged to practice repeating a mantram at any time or place. In this study, MRP is delivered individually in eight weekly, 1-hour sessions, using a standardized manual, instructor guide, and homework assignments for experiential learning.</description>

            <description>The PCT is a form of individual therapy that is problem-oriented to improve current coping. It typically details of traumatic experiences. In this study, it is delivered individually in 8 weekly, 1 hour sessions to serve as an active, attention comparison arm. Sessions are unstructured and managed so that there is some engagement of the participant's emotional concerns with an emphasis on strengths and process encouragement rather than skills training. Three components of PCT include 1) developing a therapeutic relationship for social support, 2) focusing on current problems and problem solving, 3) and setting goals.</description>

Total scores range from 0 to 92. Higher scores indicating greater spiritual well-being. Validity has been demonstrated by significant Pearson correlations between measures of quality of life, mood, and religious growth. It has demonstrated internal consistency reliability.</description>

            <description>The MRP teaches three portable, mindfulness strategies to train attention and manage symptoms: 1) Mantram (sacred word) Repetition, 2) Slowing Down, and 3) One-Pointed Attention. These tools are presented as working together synergistically and cumulatively, over time, to interrupt negative thoughts, behaviors, and emotional states such as anger, rage, irritability and impatience. Participants choose their own words or phrases and are encouraged to practice repeating a mantram at any time or place. In this study, MRP is delivered individually in eight weekly, 1-hour sessions, using a standardized manual, instructor guide, and homework assignments for experiential learning.</description>

            <description>The PCT is a form of individual therapy that is problem-oriented to improve current coping. It typically details of traumatic experiences. In this study, it is delivered individually in 8 weekly, 1 hour sessions to serve as an active, attention comparison arm. Sessions are unstructured and managed so that there is some engagement of the participant's emotional concerns with an emphasis on strengths and process encouragement rather than skills training. Three components of PCT include 1) developing a therapeutic relationship for social support, 2) focusing on current problems and problem solving, 3) and setting goals.</description>
