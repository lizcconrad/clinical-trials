  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is an FDA approved mode of mechanical
      ventilation. This mode of ventilation is currently in routine use in adult, pediatric and
      neonatal intensive care units. The electrical activity of the diaphragm, the largest muscle
      used during inspiration, is measured. The ventilator triggers (synchronizes patient effort)
      and applies proportional assistance based on measured electrical activity of the diaphragm
      (Edi). This electrical activity is measured through a feeding tube that also has a
      multiple-array esophageal electrode in it. This mode of ventilation has been proven to be
      equivalent to pressure support ventilation (PSV). Theoretically, the breath-to-breath control
      offered by NAVA may not only trigger faster and synchronize better, but provide the support
      deemed appropriate by the central nervous center on demand. Traditionally in the intensive
      care unit (ICU), pressure support is applied to subject breathing spontaneously. Pressure is
      set to achieve a given tidal volume. The influence of changing lung compliance not only from
      the lung disease itself, but the interactions of the respiratory muscles can drastically
      change minute ventilation and contribute to hyper- or hypoventilation. These changes are
      typically found on assessment of end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2), blood gas, or oxygen
      saturation (SpO2) monitoring; all of which are potentially preventable if we allowed the
      central nervous system to control the ventilator. NAVA may allow us to couple the central
      nervous system (neuro-coupling) with the ventilator to provide real-time proportional
      assistance, reduce work of breathing and apply physiologic breathing patterns.
