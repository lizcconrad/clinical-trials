  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of adding 125
      mg or 250 mg doses of MK-7655 to imipenem/cilastatin in adults 18 years or older with
      Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection (cIAI). The primary hypothesis is that the MK-7655 +
      imipenem/cilastatin treatment regimen is non-inferior to treatment with imipenem/cilastatin
      alone with respect to the proportion of participants with a favorable clinical response at
      completion of intravenous (IV) study therapy.

          -  Laboratory abnormalities as specified in protocol.

          -  Currently participating in, or has participated in any other clinical study involving
