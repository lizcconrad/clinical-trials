  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As simulation is now used in many post-graduate education and assessment domains, the
      investigators want to learn about how autonomically engaged healthcare providers are with the
      investigators computer simulation paradigm. The investigators are interested in the
      relationship between autonomic arousal (as measured by heart rate variability and galvanic
      skin response), self-report of engagement, and performance in the simulation and cognitive
      debriefing.

    <time_frame>All data will be collected during the one hour when participants engage in the simulation activities and debriefing.</time_frame>
    <description>Participant engagement with simulation will be measured using physiological measures of heart rate variability and galvanic skin response as well as self-report measures during the verbal debriefing.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive performance</measure>
    <time_frame>All data will be collected during the one hour when participants engage in the simulation activities and debriefing.</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive performance will be assessed based on the choices that participants make during the clinical simulation as well as the details that they retain and express during the written debriefing.</description>

    <description>Participants in the low valence condition will participate in photo-based simulations. They will see a photo of the patient and hear affectively flattened audio. The script and clinical information remain the same as the high valence condition.</description>

    <description>Participants in the high valence condition will participate in video-based simulations. They will see a rich multimedia presentation of the clinical encounter, with affectively enhanced audio. The script and clinical information remain the same as the low valence condition.</description>

    <description>Participants in the low valence condition will participate in two photo-based simulations: first, an orientation to become familiar with the interface, and then a clinical simulation. Afterward, they will complete a written debriefing followed by an verbal debriefing with a study investigator. They will complete all activities while having their heart rate and galvanic skin response monitored using non-invasive methods.</description>
