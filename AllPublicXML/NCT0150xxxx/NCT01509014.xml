  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite proven benefits in reducing morbidity and mortality, many patients become nonadherent
      to statin therapy within the first year of starting. Due to their accessibility and frequent
      patient contact, pharmacists are well-positioned to improve medication adherence.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a simple intervention by community
      pharmacists can improve statin adherence in new statin users.
