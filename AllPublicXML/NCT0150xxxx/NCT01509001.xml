      Aim:

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of glimepiride(G) and metformin(M) on
      vascular reactivity, haemostatic factors and glucose and lipid profile in patients with type
      2 diabetes.

      Methods:

      A prospective study will be performed in 20 uncontrolled patients previously treated with
      dietary intervention. Participants will randomized into M (750 to 2500 mg/day) or G (1 to 8
      mg/day) therapy. After 4 months, the patients will be crossed-over with no washout period to
      the alternative treatment for an additional 4-month period on similar dosage schedule.

        -  The following variables were assessed before (basal values) and after 4 months of each
           treatment period:

             1. Hormonal and metabolic determinations: fasting plasma glucose, insulin,
                catecholamine, lipid profile and HbA1 levels.

             2. Haemostatic factors: t-PA antigen and activity, PAI-1 antigen and activity,
                platelet aggregation, fibrinogen and plasminogen levels.

             3. Cardiovascular evaluation: flow indexes of carotid and brachial arteries. Also, at
                the end of each treatment period, a 12-hour metabolic profile including
                measurements of glucose, insulin, glucagon, proinsulin and triglycerides levels at
                fasting and every 2 hours (7:00 am to 7:00 pm)will be done
