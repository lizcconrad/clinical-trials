    <textblock>
      This is the first academic registry study about adverse events or adverse drug reaction for
      Chinese medicine injection in mainland China.

      It is well known that Chinese medicine injection is just limited in mainland China, which
      also be accepted by China health care system.

      However, more and more adverse events or adverse drug reaction have been reported in recent
      years in the form of case report.

      In order to improving monitoring adverse events or adverse drug reaction of Chinese medicine
      injection in hospital, registry study will be introduced in this area.

      To calculate the incidence of adverse events or adverse drug reaction is one of the main aims
      for this study.

      According to the 'rule of three', 30,000 cases need to be registered at least.

    <measure>Number of participants with adverse events; incidence of Shuxuetong'ADRs and identify factors that contributed to the occurrence of the adverse reaction</measure>
    <time_frame>to assess Shuxuetong's &quot;adverse event&quot; and &quot;drug adverse reaction&quot; during patients' hospital stay, administration information of Shuxuetong will be registered every day. The registry procedure will last 3 years only for patients using Shuxuetong.</time_frame>
    <description>All participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 weeks.Patients using Shuxuetong will be registered on a registration form including disease background, Shuxuetong's administration, and extraction information from hospital information system. An adverse event or drug adverse reaction form also will be used to describe any doubted symptoms or signs from patients. A judgment will be made by doctors directly and a further analysis will be conducted by researchers to decide those potential side effects of Shuxuetong.</description>
