  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incisional hernia is one ot the most frequently seen long term complications in abdominal
      surgery. Despite studies on the optimal suturing technique for laparotomies, the risk for
      incisional hernia after midline incision remains about 5-20 %. One major risk factor for
      incisional hernia after a median laparotomy is obesity.

      The closure technique of midline incisions has remained unchanged since many decades and
      primarily consists of suturing the linea alba. Interest in prevention of incisional hernias
      with the aid of synthetic mesh is growing and only one large randomized trial is active
      recruiting patients in Germany, Netherlands and Belgium (Prima Trial).

      Patients with a BMI of more than 27 have a high risk of developing an incisional hernia after
      midline incision with an incidence of 22% after 12 months. This high risk group of patients
      may benefit from prevention.

      Some small studies have been performed to evaluate the usefulness and safety of primary
      laparotomy wound closure with the aid of prosthetic mesh. These studies show a very low risk
      for incisional hernias and a low infection rate, even when used in contaminated wounds such
      as colostomy surgery.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of incisional hernia prevention after
      elective median laparotomy in patients with a BMI of more than 27. A randomized controlled
      trial will be performed comparing the commonly used technique of running suture to close with
      the aid of a prosthetic onlay mesh. The primary outcome measure will be incisional hernia
      occurrence. Secondary outcome measures will be complications, surgical site infections,
      post-operative pain and quality of life.
