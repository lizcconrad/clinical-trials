  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the standard of care against EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome
      injectable suspension) to determine if total opioid consumption is reduced when using
      EXPAREL, therefore possibly reducing total hospitalization costs.

      This is a phase 4, prospective, sequential, open-label study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety, and health economic benefits of intraoperative local wound infiltration
      with EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) compared with postsurgical
      administration of standardized intravenous (IV) morphine sulfate for postsurgical analgesia
      in adult patients undergoing ileostomy reversal with general anesthesia.
