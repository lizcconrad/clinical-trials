      The purpose of this study is to determine soluble HJV could be an early diagnosis urinary
      biomarker of ischemia/reperfusion injury in post CPB-patients.

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common syndrome on Intensive Care Unit, and renal dysfunction
      would result in a further morbidity and mortality. Critical ills complicated with acute
      kidney injury are usually accompanied with multi-organ failure. Therefore, National Taiwan
      University Hospital Study group of Acute Renal Failure (NSARF) realizes that the
      characteristics of AKI is resulted from the perfusion less of body fluid and attempt to
      develop therapies to prevent or attenuate AKI, which have had limited success. We attempt to
      use the novel biomarker soluble hemojuvelin (sHJV) to evaluate the iron homeostasis on acute
      kidney injury and develop new strategies and therapies such as protease inhibitors on kidney
      function, as safety markers to monitor toxicity and as measures of treatment effect. Besides,
      we will focus on validation the sensitivity and specificity of sHJV on the clinical specimen
      of post-operative patients from NSARF data-bank. Merge the renal function and other types of
      biomarkers as panel to predict the post-operative outcome. Based on the different expression
      of these markers, using a panel of serum and urine markers may potentially help us to
      distinguish between various types of insults, establish the duration and severity of injury,
      predict the clinical outcome and help to monitor response to treatment in AKI.

      Blood samples are drawn before the first dialysis session after postcardiac sugary associated
      severe AKI ( initializing RRT). Blood is drawn into Vacutainer tubes containing EDTA, and
      immediately placed on ice and centrifuged within 1 h. All the samples are stored at -70Â°C
      until analysis.

        patients (cases) that developed AKI during the follow-up period of 72 h. AKI was defined as
        a 50% or greater increase in SCr from baseline according to the RIFLE-R criteria. For each
        of these cases, we then selected 20 controls from patients who also underwent open heart
        surgery but did not develop AKI. We matched the cases and controls as closely as possible
        for age, sex, baseline estimated GFR, comorbidities, medications, type of surgery and
        perioperative complications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AKI is defined as a serum creatinine level greater that 50% more than baseline during
             the first 3 postoperative days (PODs), and non-AKI, as a less than 10% increase.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with chronic kidney disease (baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;
             60 mL/min/1.73 m2 as calculated by using the 4-variable Modification of Diet in Renal
             Disease Study equation, or protein-creatinine ratio &gt; 100 mg/mmol) are excluded.
