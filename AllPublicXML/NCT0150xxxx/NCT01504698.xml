  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of manipulative treatment of children
      with neck and back pain. Because manipulation is the most frequently used treatment of
      musculoskeletal complaints in children, and an increasing number of Danish children see a
      chiropractor, it appears obvious to start the search for evidence by examining the effect of
      this treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parents receive text messages [SMS) on a weekly basis inquiring about the child's
      musculoskeletal pain as well as amount and types of sport during leisure time the past week.
      Following a report of pain, the parents will be interviewed by phone by a member of the
      clinical team, consisting of two licensed physical therapists and two licensed chiropractors,
      for a thorough description of the complaint. Based on this, the interviewer determines
      whether the complaint is negligible or whether the child should be seen by a member of the
      clinical team, in which case the child will be examined at his or her school. At this
      examination, the child will be evaluated for inclusion and exclusion criteria.
