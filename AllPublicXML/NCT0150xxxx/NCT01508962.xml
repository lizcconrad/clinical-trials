             neuron dysfunction.

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with all study procedures.

          -  Subject agrees to provide signed and dated informed consent form.

          -  Subject is a male or female, aged at least 18 years.

          -  Subject is not affected with ALS or an ALS-related disorder.

          -  Subject does not have a family history (i.e., at least 2 biological relatives) of ALS
             or an ALS-related disorder.

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with all study procedures.

          -  Subject agrees to provide signed and dated informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criterion
