  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common but often distressing condition. It can be treated with
      medications, but these are not always effective or tolerated. Ablation is a well-recognised
      technique that is recommended for those with symptomatic AF who have failed medical therapy.

      Ablation can be performed in a number of ways. In percutaneous ablation, ablation is
      performed via tiny punctures in the skin in the groin. In minimally-invasive thoracoscopic
      ablation, ablation is performed under general anaesthetic via very small incisions in the
      chest wall.

      Because AF can be intermittent, the only reliable way to look for it is with long-term ECG
      monitoring. A safe and practical way to do this is to use implantable loop recorders (ILRs).

      In this study, the investigators are trying to see if minimally-invasive thoracoscopic
      ablation is better than percutaneous ablation, and in turn if they are better than Direct
      current cardioversion (DCCV), using ILRs to monitor AF.
