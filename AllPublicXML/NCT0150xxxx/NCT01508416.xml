  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Multiple Myeloma (MM) are at increased risk of venous thromboembolic event,
      especially in newly diagnosed patients and during induction treatment with thalidomide in
      combination with dexamethasone. This association was mainly heightened during the 3 first
      months of chemotherapy.

      Several coagulation abnormalities have been described. Laboratory tests measuring the overall
      thrombophilic tendency might be useful to assess thrombosis risk.

      The aim of this study is to compare thrombin generation by calibrated automated thrombogram
      during the 3 first cycles of chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed MM.
