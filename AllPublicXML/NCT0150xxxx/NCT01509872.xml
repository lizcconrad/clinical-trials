  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in knowing whether a group-based, trauma-focused
      intervention (Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) is superior to a more general, non
      trauma-focused, psychosocial intervention (Child Friendly Spaces) in reducing post-traumatic
      stress, depression and anxiety and conduct problems and increasing pro-social behavior among
      war-affected children in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

    <description>Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (Cohen, Mannarino, Deblinger, 2006; Smith and Saunders, 2005) is a child-friendly, manualised psychological intervention for children who experience nightmares, flashbacks, anxiety, anger, social isolation, poor concentration or self-blame after experiencing or witnessing a violent and terrifying life event (e.g. rape, murder, abduction etc). This intervention was culturally modified for use with war-affected children.</description>

    <description>A Child Friendly Space is a psychosocial intervention combining creative (e.g. art), imaginative (e.g. drama), physical (e.g. football), communicative (e.g. group discussions) and manipulative activities (e.g. story telling). It aids children's natural development by providing a safe place for children to learn, express themselves, grow and develop, supported by trained animators and peer educators.</description>
