  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a new investigational drug (TPI 287) for
      early relapsed neuroblastoma. An investigational drug is one that has not yet been approved
      by the Food and Drug Administration. This investigational drug is called TPI 287. This study
      will look at the tumor's response to the study drug, TPI 287, in combination with Irinotecan
      and Temozolomide versus the combination of Irinotecan and Temozolomide alone. This study will
      also evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study drug, TPI 287.

    <description>To determine the safety and tolerability of TPI 287 in combination with Irinotecan and Temozolomide (TPI+I+TMZ) in pediatric and young adult patients with primary refractory or recurrent Neuroblastoma.
Phase I patients were all enrolled to receive TPI 287. Phase 2 is where randomization began. Patients were different patients than the Phase 1 patients. Below all patients that received TPI 287 are included in the TPI 287 group. This includes Phase I patients and the Phase 2 patients randomized to TPI 287.</description>

Phase II portion of trial- TPatients enrolled to this portion (different patients than enrolled to Phase 1) were randomized to Arm A: I+TMZ OR Arm B: TPI+I+TMZ Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.</description>

Patients who show progression on the I+TMZ arm may crossover to the I+TMZ+TPI 287 arm at anytime during cycles 1 to 6. If there is evidence of progression after completion of the I+TMZ arm (after completion of cycle 6) then the patient will have been considered to have completed therapy and is not eligible for the crossover.</description>

If there is evidence of progression after completion of the I+TMZ arm (after completion of cycle 6) then the patient will have been considered to have completed therapy and is not eligible for the crossover.

        <description>To determine the safety and tolerability of TPI 287 in combination with Irinotecan and Temozolomide (TPI+I+TMZ) in pediatric and young adult patients with primary refractory or recurrent Neuroblastoma.
Phase I patients were all enrolled to receive TPI 287. Phase 2 is where randomization began. Patients were different patients than the Phase 1 patients. Below all patients that received TPI 287 are included in the TPI 287 group. This includes Phase I patients and the Phase 2 patients randomized to TPI 287.</description>

          <description>To determine the safety and tolerability of TPI 287 in combination with Irinotecan and Temozolomide (TPI+I+TMZ) in pediatric and young adult patients with primary refractory or recurrent Neuroblastoma.
Phase I patients were all enrolled to receive TPI 287. Phase 2 is where randomization began. Patients were different patients than the Phase 1 patients. Below all patients that received TPI 287 are included in the TPI 287 group. This includes Phase I patients and the Phase 2 patients randomized to TPI 287.</description>
          <population>This group includes the 8 patients enrolled to phase 1 TPI 287 portion of the study plus the 4 additional patients randomized to TPI 287 in the Phase 2 portion = 12 patients total that received TPI 287 on this study.</population>
