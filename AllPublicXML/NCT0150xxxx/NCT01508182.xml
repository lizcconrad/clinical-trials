  <official_title>A Single-Dose, Open-Label, Randomized, 2-Way Crossover Pivotal Study to Assess the Bioequivalence of 2 FDC Tablets of Canagliflozin and Metformin IR (150 mg/500 mg) With Respect to the Individual Components of Canagliflozin (1x300 mg) and Metformin IR Tablets (2x500 mg) in Healthy Fed Subjects</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of fixed dose combination (FDC)
      tablets of canagliflozin and metformin immediate release (IR) in comparison with the
      individual components of the FDC tablets (canagliflozin and metformin IR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (identity of study drug will be known to volunteer and study staff),
      single-center study to evaluate the bioequivalence (to see if blood levels of one drug are
      equivalent to blood levels of another drug) of canagliflozin and metformin IR when
      administered orally (by mouth) as individual components (ie, separate tablets of
      canagliflozin and metformin IR) (Treatment A) and when administered as FDC tablets (ie,
      canagliflozin and metformin IR contained in the same tablet) (Treatment B). Healthy
      volunteers participating in the study will be randomly (by chance) assigned to receive a
      single dose of Treatment A followed by a single dose of Treatment B or Treatment B followed
      by Treatment A with a period of approximately 15 days between treatments. The total duration
      of the study will be approximately 51 days.
