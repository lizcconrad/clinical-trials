  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumour angiogenesis has been identified to play a critical role in tumour growth and this
      knowledge has led to the identification of new targets for cancer therapy. Multiple
      angiogenic factors are involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, among them VEGF (vascular
      endothelial growth factor) and its receptor are of crucial relevance. The inhibition of VEGF
      signaling by monoclonal antibodies or small molecules (kinase inhibitors) has already been
      successfully established for the treatment of different cancer entities and multiple new
      drugs are being tested in clinical trials. The ever-expanding list of antiangiogenic agents
      being available in the near future will raise the questions when to use which agent and in
      which sequence. As a consequence biomarkers are going to be indispensible tools for choosing
      the most effective drugs and to predict dosing and resistance.

      The present project is based on an academic clinical trial in which patients suffering from
      different cancer types (colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell cancer and
      hepatocellular cancer) treated routinely with antiangiogenic agents will be included.
      Consecutive serum and blood probes will be taken and will be examined and correlated with
      functional imaging and the clinical course. The following parameters have been selected:
      soluble markers in the plasma (VEGF, bFGF, ICAM, sVGFR-2 IL-8, SDF1 and Dickkopf 3) and
      cellular parameters like circulating endothelial cells (CEC) and circulating endothelial
      progenitor cells (CEPs).

      In conclusion, the present project is screening for potential biomarkers and biomarker
      combinations relevant for antiangiogenic drugs in different tumour types. The predictive
      value of such profiles should then be evaluated in larger cohorts. In the future such
      profiles could possibly help clinicians to use these agents more effectively and therefore
      also more economically.
