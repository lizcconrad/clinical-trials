    <textblock>
      Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is an anionic detergent that has been used as the major or sole
      surfactant in most dentifrices. But it is known to local irritating factor to oral mucosa and
      skin and results in many side effects. This study was to compare the effects of SLS-free
      dentifrice and SLS-containing dentifrice in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis
      (RAS).

    <description>The subjects were divided into three groups, each of which comprised 30 randomly assigned subjects: group I used SLS-free(a commercially available SLS-free dentifrice(Wiconi速 dentifrice) and SLS-A (a dentifrice containing 1.5%; Wiconi速 dentifrice + 1.5% SLS). The subjects used one of the two assigned dentifrices for 8 weeks, and then the other for the following 8 weeks. The order of the dentifrices used was selected at random, and there was a 2-week washout period between the two phases, during which the subject used the same dentifrice as they used before participating in this study. The subjects were asked to brush their teeth using their usual toothbrushing method with the dentifrice and toothbrush supplied.</description>
