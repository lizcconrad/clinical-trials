  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propofol is widely used by anaesthesiologists for deep sedation and general anaesthesia.
      During recent years nurses trained in the use of low dose Propofol sedation (NAPS) during
      endoscopy have been introduced. The method has been implemented at the endoscopic unit at
      Gentofte hospital since 2008(1). Propofol has a respiratory depressive effect which may
      result in depressed oxygen saturation in the blood (hypoxia). Due to a short acting half life
      this is prevented in the majority of cases. However, in spite of this, hypoxia is experienced
      in 4,4% of patients receiving propofol during endoscopy at Gentofte Hospital (unpublished
      data). It is well known that hypoxia constitutes a late expression of reduced oxygen tension
      in peripheral tissues. Whether the addition of capnography to standard monitoring during NAPS
      may be of benefit is widely unknown. The aim of this study is to examine whether the
      additional use of capnography to standard monitoring during endoscopy may improve patient
      safety in patients undergoing low dose Propofol sedation by reducing the number, duration and
      level of hypoxic events. The trial is a randomized clinical prospective case-control study.

    <description>If the addition of capnography to standard monitoring can reduce the number of hypoxic events in patients undergoing endscopy with NAPS. A hypoxic event is defined as an observed oxygen saturation of less than 92% . Data is collected by a computer with intervals of 12 sec as the smallest possible.</description>
