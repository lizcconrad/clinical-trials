  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - During puberty, children begin to develop into adults. Problems with the hormones released
      during puberty can affect the reproductive system. Some people have low hormone levels that
      severely delay or prevent puberty. Others start puberty abnormally early. Other people may
      have a normal puberty but develop reproductive disorders later in life. Researchers want to
      study people with reproductive disorders to learn more about how these disorders may be
      inherited.

      Objectives:

      - To learn how reproductive system disorders may be inherited.

      Eligibility:

        -  People with one of the following problems:

        -  Abnormally early puberty

        -  Abnormally late or no puberty

        -  Normal puberty with hormonal problems that develop later in life

        -  People who have not yet had puberty but have symptoms that indicate low hormone levels.

      Design:

        -  Participants will provide a blood sample for testing. They will complete a questionnaire
           about their symptoms. They will also have a scratch-and-sniff test to study any problems
           with their ability to smell.

        -  Participant medical records will be reviewed. Participants will also provide a family
           medical history.

        -  Family members of those in the study may be invited to participate.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

    <textblock>
      The key initiating factors for reproductive development remain among the great mysteries of
      pediatric and reproductive endocrinology. The onset of puberty is initiated by pulsatile
      secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. The neuroendocrine
      events leading to increased GnRH secretion and the resultant onset of puberty remain largely
      unknown.

      Isolated deficiency of GnRH results in the rare clinical syndrome of idiopathic
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), where decreased secretion of GnRH results in impaired
      gonadotropin secretion. The resultant hypogonadism presents with delayed, incomplete, or
      absent sexual maturation. Human and animal models have identified a number of genes
      responsible for IHH, but more than half of patients with clinical evidence of the disorder do
      not have a detectable mutation. In addition, there is significant clinical heterogeneity
      among affected individuals, including members of the same family harboring the same
      mutations. Careful human phenotyping of such patients and families has expanded our
      understanding of this spectrum of disorders to include oligo-digenic inheritence, as well as
      reversibility of the condition, and has provided insight into developmental pathways involved
      in the ontogeny of GnRH neurons.

      Genetic analysis of subjects with unknown mutations is likely to yield important insights
      into additional pathways involved in the regulation of GnRH secretion. Here, we propose a
      genetic investigation of subjects with IHH to characterize further the phenotypic effect of
      previously described genetic variants, as well as to identify novel genes involved in
      congenital GnRH deficiency. In collaboration with the Reproductive Endocrine Unit at the
      Massachusetts General Hospital, we will use both candidate gene and whole exome approaches,
      as well as linkage analysis. The collaboration will allow for sufficient statistical power to
      conduct such an investigation.

      This protocol will utilize the disease model of IHH to increase our understanding of the
      physiology of GnRH secretion, including the neuroendocrine regulation of GnRH pulsatility.
      Examining the genetic characteristics of subjects with isolated GnRH deficiency will reveal
      insights into the mechanisms underlying the reawakening of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal
      axis at puberty, providing opportunities for new diagnostic capabilities and therapeutic
      interventions for disorders of puberty and fertility.

    <criteria>

        -  The essential inclusion criteria include:

               1. failure to go through a normal, age-appropriate, spontaneous puberty and low sex
                  steroid levels in the setting of low/normal gonadotropins, or

               2. abnormally early development of puberty, or

               3. normal puberty with subsequent development of low gonadotropin levels, or

               4. pre-pubertal individuals with features suggestive of hypogonadotropic
                  hypogonadism.

               5. Family members: both affected and unaffected family members are strongly
                  encouraged to participate.

                  EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

                  Since hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a rare condition, this protocol remains
                  open to enrollment so that we may study all subjects that are both qualified and
                  interested in participating.

                  Because HH represents a spectrum, where associated clinical findings may provide
                  phenotypic clues to the assessment of inheritability and underlying physiology,
                  exclusion criteria are very limited:

          -  Patients who have additional pituitary deficiencies, effectively ruling out isolated
             GnRH deficiency, whether these deficiencies are congenital or acquired (e.g. secondary
             to malignancy, infection, or irradiation).
