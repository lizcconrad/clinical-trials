      This study has an open-label, five-period, single-sequence design. The purpose of this study
      is as follows;

        1. Primary

             -  To evaluate the influence of genotype of drug metabolizing enzyme or transporter on
                the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel

             -  To evaluate the influence of aspirin on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of
                clopidogrel

        2. Secondary

             -  To explore the representative biomarkers for the variable
                pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel

             -  To evaluate the influence of genotype of drug metabolizing enzyme or transporter on
                the drug-drug interactions between aspirin and clopidogrel

             -  To explore the representative biomarkers for the drug-drug interactions between
                aspirin and clopidogrel
