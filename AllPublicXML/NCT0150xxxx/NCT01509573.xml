      The research will examine the following Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To adapt a U.S.-developed family-focused and strengths-based prevention
      program to the context of HIV/AIDS-affected families in Rwanda (the Family-Strengthening
      Intervention in Rwanda or &quot;FSI-R&quot;) using prior qualitative findings and CAB input.

      Specific Aim 2: To deliver the intervention to a small group of families to collect
      preliminary data on intervention feasibility, acceptability, and to further refine the
      intervention manual for the FSI-R.

      Specific Aim 3: To conduct a pilot feasibility study of the FSI-R with 80 families.

      In pursuit of Specific Aim 3, this research will (a) conduct a preliminary exploratory
      analysis to examine the extent to which the FSI-R for HIV/AIDS-affected families is
      associated with improved caregiver-child relationships using measures of family
      connectedness, good parenting, and social support. Hypothesis 1: Participants in the FSI-R
      will demonstrate increases in protective processes compared to usual care controls not
      exposed to the FSI-R. It will also (b) conduct a preliminary exploratory analysis to
      determine the extent to which improved caregiver-child relationships are sustained four
      months after the conclusion of the FSI-R. Hypothesis 2: Four months after the conclusion of
      the intervention, participants in the FSI-R will demonstrate increases in protective
      processes compared to usual care controls not exposed to the FSI-R.

      The challenge of this project is to develop a family-based intervention to prevent mental
      health problems in children affected by HIV/AIDS that can be initiated as caregivers come
      into contact with health systems via routine HIV testing and care. Specifically, we propose
      to develop and pilot test a prevention-oriented family-strengthening intervention to mitigate
      the mental health risks facing HIV/AIDS-affected children (i.e., those who are HIV+
      themselves or who have an HIV+ family member, including those who have died). The
      intervention design, which is based upon the Family-Based Preventive Intervention (FBPI), is
      centrally focused on galvanizing mechanisms of resilience in children and families and
      building on local sources of strength. Our unique adaptation and pilot study will employ a
      family focus to attend to the reality that HIV/AIDS is a family disease, and to show that
      individual, familial, and community resources may help families to succeed despite chronic
      illness. The pilot intervention will use a randomized design, drawing study participants
      (N=80 families) from social work referrals. Protective factors characterizing the family and
      mental health problems in children and caregivers will be assessed pre- and
      post-intervention. In addition, we will survey both participants and interventionists to
      provide qualitative and quantitative data on the program's cultural acceptability and
      feasibility, and on their own satisfaction.

    <description>The Mental Health Assessment Batteries for Children and Caregivers are comprehensive surveys addressing a range of locally-relevant mental health problems and protective processes, as well as issues like functioning, stigma, hope, harsh parenting, parent-child relationships, and other risk and protective factors. The mental health components of the assessments have been subject to a validation study in this community. They were developed using qualitative data gathered from this population in 2007 and 2009.</description>

    <description>Core components of the FSI-R are derived from the FBPI theoretical framework, and were chosen to address key risk factors identified in qualitative data. The FSI-R holds separate preliminary meetings with caregivers and children to prepare for a larger family meeting. In these modules, the interventionist helps caregivers and children prioritize concerns or key messages that they most want to share with the other party. Role play and discussions are used to impart improved parenting and communication skills. In the family meetings, children and caregivers share their concerns with one another and develop a shared family narrative, which integrates past events into a singular story with shared goals and a future orientation. These family modules also discuss the services and supports (formal and non-formal resources) that the family can engage with in order to achieve their shared goals.
8-12 weeks for 1-2 hours per week, depending on each family's pace and coverage of the material.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria: All participants must be HIV/AIDS-affected (i.e., having an HIV+ family
        member, including those who have died). We will select single and dual caregiver families
        to reflect population dynamics in the area. Caregivers must be at least 18 years of age
        (the age of majority in Rwanda), must live in the same household as the children, and must
        be the child's legal guardian. Legal guardians may be aunts, uncles, grandparents, or
        foster parents. Caregivers must be willing to discuss HIV/AIDS with school-aged children in
        the family.

        Exclusion Criteria: Potential participants will be excluded if they do not live in the
        Rwinkwavu catchment area. Untreated mental illness or active suicidal ideation/attempts in
        the family also constitutes exclusion criteria (mental health treatment for these problems
        may occur in conjunction with the FSI). HIV-positive children are ineligible for the study
        if their HIV status has not been disclosed to them. Exclusion criteria also include lack of
        caregiver willingness to discuss HIV/AIDS with school-aged children in the family.
        Youth-headed households will be excluded due to concerns about youth caregivers' capacity
        to participate in the FSI in addition to other caretaking duties.
