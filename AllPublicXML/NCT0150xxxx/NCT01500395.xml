      The purpose of this study is to investigate the short to mid term efficacy and safety of
      different hybrid operations who had complex aortic lesions, such as ascending aortic/arch
      aneurysm, pseudo-aneurysm, Stanford Type A dissection, retrograde Stanford Type B dissection,
      dissection with primary tear located in the aortic arch, et al.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aneurysms and dissection involving the ascending aorta and aortic arch have historically been
      treated with open surgical techniques, requiring cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic
      circulatory arrest (DHCA). Despite increasing experience and refinement of these procedures,
      there remains a substantial rate of morality and morbidity. The goal of hybrid operations is
      to re-construct the ascending aorta and aortic arch to cover the primary entry tear of the
      dissection and to remodel the aorta. Hybrid Operations including debranching
      technique+Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR), Frozen elephant trunk technique,
      aortic arch replacement with concommitant TEVAR, et al. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the short to mid term efficacy and safety of different hybrid operations who had
      complex aortic lesions, such as ascending aortic/arch aneurysm, pseudo-aneurysm, Stanford
      Type A dissection, retrograde Stanford Type B dissection, dissection with primary tear
      located in the aortic arch, et al.

      Primary outcome measure is all-cause mortality. Secondary outcome variables include
      conversion to stent and/or surgery, induced thrombosis of the false lumen, cardiovascular
      morbidity, aortic expansion (&gt;5 mm/y of maximum diameter including true and false lumina),
      quality of life, and length of intensive care unit and hospital stay. The study designs to
      enroll 50 patients to be monitored for 24 months.
