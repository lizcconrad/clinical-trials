    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy in relation to dosing in the
      administration of Hair Stimulating Complex (HSC) in healthy men. HSC will be injected
      intradermally in the scalps of men with male pattern baldness (i.e. androgenetic alopecia).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HSC consists of proteins secreted by human dermal cells under proprietary culture conditions
      that include reduced oxygen and bioreactors. Under these conditions, the cells secrete
      soluble proteins that include both growth factors and soluble precursors to the deposited
      extracellular matrix. Several of these proteins are known to be important in the control of
      the hair cycle and will stimulate resting hair follicles to resume hair formation.

    <description>Hair Stimulating Complex will be injected intradermally into the scalp of the test subject at 2 timepoints (Baseline and 6 Weeks after Baseline) using sterile syringes with 30 gauge needles at a volume of 0.1 mL per injection. A total of 8 injections (about 3mm apart) will be administered into one of the the 2 randomized sites (left or right) of the subject's scalp. Six weeks after the Baseline injection, the same treatment site will receive a repeat dose (the same volume and number of injections as used in the baseline) with no crossover.</description>

          3. Subject should be in good general health.

          4. Male subjects must be classified 3 Vertex, 4, 4A (if large enough), 5, 5A, or 6 under
             the Norwood-Hamilton Classification for Male Pattern Hair Loss (See Appendix 1).

          5. Subject must be Fitzpatrick Type I, II, III and IV skin pigmentation (See Appendix 2).

             site (one in the center and one on the edge) of the two target regions of the scalp at
             miniaturization zone.

          9. Willing to have 2 cm2 hairs clipped at treatment areas.
