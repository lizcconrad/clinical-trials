  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase I/II clinical trial, the investigators seek to pilot the addition of
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to a commonly-used front-line therapy of pancreatic cancer,
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. The investigators plan a run-in to define tolerable doses, and
      will explore doses of 800 and 1200 mg/day in successive cohorts of 6 patients. The
      investigators will assess toxicity continuously, and determine the dose for the Phase II
      trial based on standard toxicity criteria.

      The correlative endpoints of this trial are directed to the pharmacokinetics of HCQ, and
      pharmacokinetic model of HCQ based on data from several ongoing trials, and the data from
      these patients will contribute to refining the model. The investigators will analyze both
      measured and model-predicted indices for their relationship to autophagy induction. Autophagy
      will be assessed as the accumulation of autophagocytic vesicles in the PMNs of treated
      patients, together with the induction of the expression of autophagy-related proteins on
      western analysis, quantitated by densitometry. The investigators will document the rates of
      metabolic response as a consequence of treatment, as a therapeutic marker that may be related
      to the degree of autophagy inhibition. Since the investigators have previously demonstrated a
      key role of JNK1 in the induction of autophagy by chemotherapy, the investigators will
      analyze archival tumor materials to determine variability in this marker, as a baseline for
      potential future trials. Finally, this study will incorporate metabolic profiling by mass
      spectrometry, which will be related to mutations (including Kras) in pretreatment tumor
      specimens. Mutational analysis will be accomplished by targeted sequencing or by
      next-generation sequencing, and the need for fresh tissue for all these endpoints will
      require patients to have a biopsy performed before treatment at at 6-8 weeks after beginning
      treatment. In the previous study of the Hh inhibitor GDC-0973 with the same chemotherapy, the
      investigators were able to obtain repeat biopsies successfully on all patients. The
      importance of these biopsies, to move the science forward in an era in which the tools now
      exist to provide meaningful correlative science, cannot be overstated.

      Recent strategies have focused on improving the efficacy of gemcitabine either by improving
      the method of delivery, or by combining gemcitabine with other non-cross resistant agents. A
      sequence of Phase III combination studies of gemcitabine in combination (with oxaliplatin,
      and with the targeted therapies bevacizumab and cetuximab) have been negative, though based
      on strikingly positive Phase II data generated in cancer centers. Several studies suggest
      that taxanes are active in pancreatic cancer, but a randomized trial of gemcitabine with
      taxanes has not been preformed, probably on the basis that the differences in Phase II were
      insufficiently persuasive. The development of a novel taxane conjugate with albumin,
      abraxane, with established activity in breast cancer, prompted a Phase II trial of
      gemcitabine/abraxane by Von Hoff (6). Phase I/II data were highly promising, with response
      rates of the order of 40%, with tolerable toxicity, and a one-year survival of about 48%. A
      phase III trial of gemcitabine versus gemcitabine/abraxane is in progress, and based on these
      promising data has served as the control chemotherapy for previous SU2C trials. The
      development of a more intensive, but toxic regimen (FOLFIRINOX) in no way diminishes the
      enthusiasm for this chemotherapy backbone, given the activity in Phase II trials that appears
      comparable (7). Given the promise of this regimen, and the possibility of making a
      substantial improvement in outcome with additional targeted interventions, we propose to
      continue to use this regimen in the current study.

      Of particular interest in extending these studies to pancreatic cancer is the finding that
      autophagy inhibition is particularly deleterious to cell lines bearing a mutant Kras protein.
      Additional studies as part of the SU2C pancreatic cancer project reveal that an autophagy
      program is activated in the presence of mutant Kras, and thus prompts the testing of this
      strategy in a setting in which Kras is commonly (about 85%) mutated (SU2C, unpublished data).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically documented advanced or metastatic
             adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease as defined by the RECIST criteria as at least
             one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter
             to be recorded) as 20mm with conventional techniques on either CT or MRI. Marker
             (CA19-9 or CEA) elevation alone is insufficient for entry.

          -  Patients may have had prior adjuvant treatment for pancreatic cancer. The last dose of
             chemotherapy must have been 4 months prior to study entry.

          -  Patients with prior radiotherapy are acceptable. It must be at least 4 months since
             administration of radiation therapy and all signs of toxicity must have abated.

          -  Patients must be age 18 years or older.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0-1.

          -  The following required Initial Laboratory Values should be obtained within 4 weeks of
             the start of treatment:

               -  Granulocytes 1,500/ml

               -  AST 5 x upper limit of normal

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or lactating as chemotherapy is thought to present
             substantial risk to the fetus/infant.

          -  Patients must have an accessible primary tumor or metastasis, and be willing to have a
             pre-treatment and post-treatment tumor biopsy (at 6 to 8 weeks after beginning).

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of greater than three months.

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Known allergy to HCQ

          -  Patients with previous treatment with abraxane.

          -  Patients on therapeutic doses of Coumadin ( 1 mg daily). The use of therapeutic or
             prophylactic low molecular weight heparin or fragmin is permitted.

          -  Patients with known G6PD deficiency, severe psoriasis, porphyria, macular degeneration
             or severe diabetic retinopathy are ineligible because of the potential for greater HCQ
             toxicity.
