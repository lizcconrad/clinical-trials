  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since its discovery in 1969, enterovirus 71 (EV71) has been recognised as a frequent cause of
      epidemics of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) associated with severe neurological sequelae in a
      small proportion of cases. There has been a significant increase in EV71 epidemic activity
      throughout the Asia-Pacific region since 1997. Recent HFMD epidemics in this region have heen
      associated with a severe from of brainstem encephalitis associated with pulmonary oedema and
      high case-fatality rates.

      The data from the phase 1 and 2 trials suggested that the inactivated EV71 vaccine had a
      clinically acceptable safety and good immunogenicity for healthy Chinese children and
      infants. According to the immunogenicity and safety results, the 320U with adjuvant with
      immunizing schedule of two doses (per 28 day) will be applied in phase 3 clinical trial.
