    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore and potentially increase the capacity of the non-VA
      community mental health system within the state of Colorado to provide a comprehensive and
      coordinated service delivery system for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)/Operation Iraqi
      Freedom (OIF) Veterans and their families. The specific population of interest is OEF/OIF
      Veterans with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and co-occurring behavioral health
      issues.

      The focus of this project is on qualitative data collection to facilitate product development
      including assessment and treatment guidelines to improve non-VA community mental health care
      for OEF/OIF Veterans with TBI and co-occurring behavioral health issues within the state of
      Colorado. In addition to the development of assessment and treatment guidelines, other
      products developed through this study will include a training and accompanying toolkit, which
      may be used for annual educational training of mental health providers. As such, there are no
      hypotheses associated with this study. This statewide initiative may not only improve quality
      and access to non-VA community mental health care for persons with TBI and co-occurring
      behavioral health issues within Colorado, but also serve as a model for implementation across
      the country.
