      Primary Outcome Measure: To see if there's any change in HbA1C at Visit 6 (12M) compared
      Visit 2 (baseline) within each group and between the two groups.

      All statistical analysis will progress through the SAS (Version 9.1). statistical test's
      significance level is 0.05. The principle is two-sided test.

      Secondary Outcome Measures :

      To see if there's any change in HbA1C at each Visit (Visit 3 - Visit 6) compared Visit 2
      (baseline) within each group and between the two groups.

      Add a Secondary Outcome Measure:

      Treatment satisfaction (DTSQ, Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire): To see if
      there's any change in treatment satisfaction scores compared Visit 2 (baseline) within each
      group and between the two groups.
