      In this prospective study is to examine whether the use of everolimus in patients after
      allogeneic SCT as part of GVHD prophylaxis for a further review in clinical studies is
      appropriate.

    <description>Primary endpoint Frequency of early withdrawal of treatment within the first 6 weeks on Everolimus
Reasons for withdrawal of Everolimus treatment:
Unacceptabel toxicity
Therapy failure:
Recurrence of moderate or severe chronic GvHD (according to NIH criteria), clearly differentiated from acute forms of GvHD
Reduction of LFS of more than 25% compared to the last value within 14 days before Everolimus treatment
Therapy with immunosuppressive drugs in addition to Everolimus</description>

    <description>Start therapy: 2x 0.75 mg/day (morning and evening) to receive a serum trough level of 3 - 5 ng/ml. First evaluation of Everolimus serum level 3-7 days after start of therapy, second 7 days later, subsequently on study weeks 4, 6, 9, 12 and 16. Dose has to be adapted if trough level exceeds 5 ng/ml. As soon as Everolimus trough level exceeds 3 ng/ml after start of therapy, calineurine inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporine) will be reduced: halve of the dose for the 3 consecutive days, withdrawal on day 4.
Prednisone will be reduced accordingly (a 22 weeks scheme is recommended) Everolimus will be used for 98 days or 14 weeks, as described above Everolimus therapy might be extended (independently of the study) if the patient suffering from milde chronic GvHD (according to NIH criteria) or milde PTOLD and lung function score is not reduced more than 25% since begin of Everolimus therapy Everolimus will be reduced to 50% of the dosage for 2 weeks before withdraw (normally weeks 15 and 16</description>
