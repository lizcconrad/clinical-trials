  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the WHO International Health Regulations Emergency Committee declared an end to the
      2009 H1N1 pandemic globally, the emergence of the novel 2009 H1N1 virus in March 2009 has
      affected more than 214 countries with at least 18000 deaths [1]. Patients with chronic
      underlying illness and extreme of ages are at risk of developing severe disease and
      complications [2-3]. Resistance to oseltamivir has also been reported [4]. Therefore,
      vaccination with the 2010/2011 trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) with the 2009 H1N1-like
      virus incorporated will be the best protection against the influenza infection, especially
      among the at risk population. Recent study on dose sparing seasonal influenza vaccine
      delivered via a novel intradermal microneedle has demonstrated good immunogenic responses
      similar to full-dose intramuscular vaccination [6]. Poor immunogenicity of the H1N1 2009
      component of the trivalent influenza has been reported [7].

      Study has also suggested the combined intradermal vaccination with local stimulation of
      dermal antigen presenting cells by applying imiquimod cream (Aldara) to the injection site,
      which activate antigen presenting cells (APC) through the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) may
      produce better immunogenicity [8].

      Imiquimod cream is currently registered for the treatment of warts and basal cell carcinoma.
      Scientific evidence has demonstrated that after treatment with imiquimod, the antigen is
      processed and presented to cells of the adaptive immune system leading to clearance of the
      virus and subsequent clearance of the lesions [9]. In addition to functional maturation,
      imiquimod induces migration of dendritic cells from the dermis to draining lymph nodes
      [10,11]. Subcutaneous administration of imiquimod as vaccine adjuvant simultaneously with the
      antigen of interest, has shown to induce enhanced responses towards the administered antigen
      [12].

      We therefore performed a prospective, double blind, randomized controlled study to compare
      the safety and immunogenicity between intradermal 2011/2012 TIV immunization with
      pretreatment of imiquimod cream and conventional full dose intramuscular 2011/2012 TIV
      immunization with pretreatment of aqueous cream as control.
