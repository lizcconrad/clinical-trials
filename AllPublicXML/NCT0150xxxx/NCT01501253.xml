      The aim of present study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two dose combination of
      S-Amlodipine/Telmisartan (2.5/40mg amd 2.5/80mg) compared with S-Amlodipine monotherapy
      (2.5mg) in hypertensive patients inadequately controlled by S-Amlodipine monotherapy.

      -  In patients with essential hypertension inadequately controlled by S-Amlodipine
           monotherapy to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two dose combination of
           S-Amlodipine/Telmisartan (2.5/40mg amd 2.5/80mg) compared with S-Amlodipine monotherapy
           (2.5mg)during 8weeks.

        -  Included S-Amlodipine run-in period(during 4 weeks_single blind) and Treatment
           period(during 8 weeks_double blind).
