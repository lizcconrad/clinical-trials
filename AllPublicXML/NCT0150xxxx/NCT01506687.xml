      Patients who receive tailored navigation (consisting of a letter and patient navigation
      services) and get screened will be significantly greater than the control group who receives
      treatment as usual.

      A majority of patients will opt for Fecal Occult Blood Testing (FOBT)as one of their
      preferred tests, after undergoing the &quot;Patient Navigator&quot; intervention and that proportion
      will be significantly greater than the group who opt for FOBT in the control group.

      Primary Outcome Measure:

      Number of patients who receive a letter and patient navigation services and get screened
      compared to the control group.

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      Proportion (%) of patients preferring FOBT vs.colonoscopy; Predictors of CRC screening and
      screening preference.

      Subjects: Ambulatory patients (men-women aged 50 years and above) recruited from primary care
      practices at the Group Health Centre, Sault Ste Marie, Ontario. All patients will be screened
      for eligibility and those who are eligible and agree to participate in the study will be
      randomized to either of the two study arms: intervention group or control group.
