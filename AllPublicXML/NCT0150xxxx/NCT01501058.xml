  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop a parent-assisted social skills training program for adolescents
      with autism spectrum disorder(ASD) and verify therapeutic effects of the program through
      case-control study.

        1. Both the case and the control of this study shall be a high-functioning group consisting
           of adolescents aged 11 to 18 years with ASD and an IQ of 80 or over. A total of 40
           adolescents will be recruited and divided into two groups of twenty. One will be the
           case group and the other will be the waitlist control group. Again, the case will be
           divided into two sub-groups of ten and carry out this new developed program for both
           parents and adolescents. That is, the program will be carried out two times in each of
           both groups. The waitlist control group will be allowed to receive personal outpatient
           treatment and general therapeutic intervention from community while waiting.

        2. Effects of the program will be measured both at the case and the control by using a
           scale which measures social interaction, quality of peer relationship, disposition of
           autism and social anxiety. Equal assessments for both the case and the control will be
           conducted right before the beginning of the program and right after the completion of
           the program and some of the survey will be retried in order to see mid- and long-term
           effects three months after the completion of the program.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Test of Adolescent Social Skills Knowledge(TASSK) at 3month</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline,3month</time_frame>
    <description>The TASSK is a 22-item criterion-referenced test developed for this study to assess the teen's knowledge about the specific social skills taught during the intervention. Two items were derived from key elements of each of the 11 didactic lessons. Teens were presented with sentence stems and asked to choose the best option from two possible answers. Scores range from 0 to 22, with higher scores reflecting greater knowledge of teen social skills.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Social Skills Rating Scale (SSRS) at 3 month</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline,3month</time_frame>
    <description>The SSRS consists of 38-items and took approximately 10 min to complete. Questionnaires were completed independently by the teen's parent and teacher. For example, items included ''Starts conversations rather than waiting for someone to talk first.'' The items were rated as either ''Never,'' ''Sometimes,'' or ''Very Often.'' The Social Skills and Problem Behaviors scales were derived from factor analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Friendship Qualities Scale (FQS) at 3month</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline,3month</time_frame>
    <description>The FQS is a teen self-report measure that assesses the quality of best friendships. It consists of 23 yes/no questions from five different subscales (Companionship, Closeness, Help, Security, and Conflict) and took approximately 10 min to complete. Teens were instructed to identify their best friend and keep this friendship in mind while completing this measure.</description>
