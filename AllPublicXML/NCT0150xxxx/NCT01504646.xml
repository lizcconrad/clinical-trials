  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study will be to evaluate the effects of Lyprinol® supplementation on
      airway inflammation and the bronchoconstrictor response to dry air hyperpnea in individuals
      with asthma. The investigators hypothesize that Lyprinol® supplementation, compared to
      placebo, will significantly attenuate airway inflammation and hyperpnea-induced
      bronchoconstriction in asthmatic individuals.

      Our research group has shown, on numerous occasions that fish oil has a markedly protective
      effect in suppressing airway inflammation and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in elite
      athletes and asthmatic individuals. Purified fish oil and the marine lipid fraction PCSO-524™
      (Lyprinol™) have both been used in supplementation studies in asthma [2, 10, 11]. While fish
      oil is a rich source of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), Lyprinol® is a patented extract of stabilized lipids from the New
      Zealand green-lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus, combined with olive oil and vitamin E. EPA
      and DHA are the main ingredients of fish oil, and thus there will be similarities between
      Lyprinol and fish oil in terms of mechanism of action. Thus, we are aiming to show that
      Lyprinol® can modulate these inflammatory eicosanoids to exert anti-inflammatory effects.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have been diagnosed with asthma and EIB. Evidence of a diagnosis of asthma will
             include medication use as well as history and symptoms as outlined in the NHLBI
             Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma. For the diagnosis of EIB,
             subjects must demonstrate a fall in FEV1 of ≥ 10% after dry air eucapnic voluntary
             hyperventilation (EVH), a simulated exercise challenge; FEV1 is a measure of lung
             function

          -  Not currently be taking any fish oil supplements

          -  Limit their fish consumption to 1 fish meal per week during the course of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe asthma is indicated. These subjects will be identified by a post-EVH drop in
             FEV1 that is greater than 50% during their first lab testing session or will have a
             history of severe asthma-related events such as hospitalizations or emergency room
             visits. Only mild to moderate asthmatics (i.e. subjects whose FEV1 drops by 10-50%)
             will be included in this study.

          -  They taking currently taking asthma maintenance medications

          -  They are pregnant

          -  They have a history of hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol), hypertension, diabetes,
             bleeding disorder, delayed clotting time, or seizure disorder

          -  They are allergic to shellfish, fish, corn, or soy products
