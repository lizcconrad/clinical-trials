  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The occurrence of emergence agitation (EA) in pediatric patients who have received
      sevoflurane anesthesia is a common postoperative problem. The prevalence of EA varies between
      10% to 80% depending on the scoring system for evaluation and the anesthetic technique used.

      Many authors reported various strategies such as use of sedative premedication, change of
      maintenance technique of anesthesia, or pharmacological agents administered at the end of
      anesthesia to reduce the incidence and severity of EA, and to allow a smooth emergence from
      sevoflurane anesthesia. Among these strategies, the use of pharmacological agents at the end
      of anesthesia is not affected by anesthetic duration, and may not prolong recovery duration
      of anesthesia excessively when these agents are administered as subhypnotic or small dose.
      The typical agents that can be administered in this way are propofol and fentanyl.

      Previous studies demonstrated that the use of either propofol or fentanyl at the end of
      anesthesia could reduce the incidence of EA.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the preventive effect on EA and the characteristics
      of anesthesia recovery between propofol and fentanyl administered at the end of sevoflurane
      anesthesia.

    <description>The investigator will evaluate the incidence and extent of emergence agitation of participants, according to Aono's scale, the 5-step Emergence Agitation (EA) scale. Also, the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale will be used to assess emergence agitation. Aono's scale scores ≥3, 5-step (EA) scale ≥4 or PAED scale scores ≥10 will be considered as presence of emergence agitation</description>
