  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various field studies has found that the modified , bivalent, whole cell - based oral cholera
      vaccine (OCV) to be safe, immunogenic and effective with protective efficacy of 67 % in
      earlier clinical trials. However, the effectiveness of the vaccine in &quot;real&quot; life situation
      using the public health system is unknown. It is critical to follow up in the same
      population, where pilot introduction of OCV was introduced and evaluate vaccine proactive
      effectiveness at individual as well as at population level. The follow - up and determination
      of effectiveness of mass OCV vaccination was requested by State Government.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the protective effectiveness of one or two
      doses of modified, bivalent, killed whole cell based OCV, given at least 14 days apart, when
      delivered through community - based mass vaccination campaign using existing public health
      infrastructure in a high - risk population in Satyabadi block of Puri district, Orissa,
      India.

      This study has following objectives

      Primary objectives:

      * To evaluate the individual level protective effectiveness of one or two doses of OCV
      against culture confirmed cholera episodes, severe enough to seek a formal health care.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate population - level effectiveness (herd effects)of OCV delivered through a
           community based mass vaccination when the vaccine is delivered to more than half of
           population at risk.

        -  To determine inverse correlation between vaccine coverage and cholera incidence among
           diverse geographical clusters.

      Rectal swabs will be collected from all cases that fulfills inclusion criteria. It will be
      plated directly into TCBS agar as well as after enrichment in APW for 6 to 20 hours (pH 8.6,
      37 degree centrigrade). After this overnight incubation, suspected colonies from TCBS will be
      tested biochemically and agglutinated with polyvalent, Ogawa and Inaba antisera. Biotyping of
      O1 isolates will be done with chicken erythrocyte agglunitation tests and determination of
      polymyxin sensitivity. Non - agglunating strains will be tested with antiserum to V cholarae
      O139 strain. V cholarae isolates will be tested for susceptibility to the following
      antimicrobials: tetracycline, erythromycin, furazolidin, trimithprim - sulfame thoxale,
      ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin.
