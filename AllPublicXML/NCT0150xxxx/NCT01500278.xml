    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to evaluate the short (12 Weeks) and long term (104 Weeks) efficacy
      of Certolizumab Pegol compared with Adalimumab both in combination with Methotrexate (MTX) in
      the treatment of moderate to severe Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) that is not responding
      adequately to MTX.

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Who Met the American College of Rheumatology 20 % (ACR20) Criteria at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects who met the ACR20 criteria were those subjects with at least 20% improvement from Baseline for Tender Joint Count (TJC), Swollen Joint Count (SJC), and at least 3 of the 5 remaining core set measures: 1) Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), 2) C-reactive Protein (CRP), 3) Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain-Visual Analog Scale (PAAP-VAS), 4) Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity-Visual Analog Scale (PtGADA-VAS), 5) Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity-Visual Analog Scale (PhGA-VAS).</description>

    <time_frame>Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 [ESR] was calculated using the Tender Joint Count (TJC), Swollen Joint Count (SJC), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR in mm/hour), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (PtGADA-VAS in mm) using the following formula: 0.56 x √ (TJC) + 0.28 x √ (SJC) + 0.70 x lognat (ESR) + 0.014 x Patient Global Assessment of Arthritis, where 28 joints were examined and a lower score indicates less disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Week 12 Responders Who Had a Disease Activity Score 28 [Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate] (DAS28 [ESR]) ≤ 3.2 at Week 104</measure>

    <description>DAS28 [ESR] was calculated using the Tender Joint Count (TJC), Swollen Joint Count (SJC), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR in mm/hour), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (PtGADA-VAS in mm) using the following formula: 0.56 x √ (TJC) + 0.28 x √ (SJC) + 0.70 x lognat (ESR) + 0.014 x Patient Global Assessment of Arthritis, where 28 joints were examined and a lower score indicates less disease activity.
The definition of Week 12 responders was DAS28[ESR] Low Disease Activity (LDA) (ie ≤ 3.2) or an improvement of ≥ 1.2 in DAS28[ESR] relative to Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 104</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI was derived based on the mean of individual scores in 8 categories of daily living actives (using 20 questions). Each question was scored 0-3 (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do), and the total HAQ-DI was scored on the scale of 0-3 as well. Change from Baseline was computed as the value at Week 104 minus the Baseline value. A negative value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Proportion of Subjects Who Discontinued After Response at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 12 up to Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>Response at Week 12 means that a subject had either a Disease Activity Score 28 [Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate] (DAS28 [ESR]) ≤ 3.2 at Week 12 or had a reduction of DAS28 [ESR] ≥ 1.2 from Baseline to Week 12. Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Proportion of Subjects Discontinued are presented per study week (days relative to Week 12 visit).</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study started to enroll patients in December 2011 and concluded in January 2016.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participant Flow refers to the Randomized Treatment Group (RTG) that consisted of all subjects randomized into the study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>CZP+MTX (RTG)</title>
          <description>Subjects received loading doses of CZP 400mg (200mg/PFS, ie, 2 injections) at Baseline, and Weeks 2 and 4; and CZP 200mg at Weeks 6, 8, and 10.
Week 12 Responders continued CZP 200mg at Week 12 and every 2 weeks thereafter through Week 102.
Week 12 Non-Responders were switched to receive ADA 40mg at Week 12 and every 2 weeks through Week 22. At Week 24, Week 12 Non-Responders who did not have DAS28(ESR) LDA or a DAS28(ESR) change from Week 12 reduction of ≥1.2 discontinued ADA treatment and were withdrawn from the Treatment Period.
All subjects received Methotrexate 15 to 25mg/week orally or subcutaneously from Baseline through Week 104. Regimens could have been changed at Week 52 only. Subjects who could not tolerate these doses could receive MTX at a minimum dose of 10mg/week orally or subcutaneously.</description>

          <title>ADA+MTX (RTG)</title>
          <description>Subjects received ADA 40mg (40mg/PFS, ie, 1 injection) at Baseline and then every 2 weeks through Week 10. In order to preserve the blind (ie, use of 2 injections) until Week 12, subjects received an injection of PBO in addition to ADA at Baseline, and Weeks 2 and 4.
Week 12 Responders continued ADA 40mg at Week 12 and every 2 weeks thereafter through Week 102.
Week 12 Non-Responders were switched to a loading dose of CZP 400mg at Weeks 12, 14, and 16 followed by CZP 200mg every 2 weeks through Week 22. At Week 24, Week 12 Non-Responders who did not have DAS28(ESR) LDA or a DAS28(ESR) change from Week 12 reduction of ≥1.2 discontinued CZP treatment and were withdrawn from the Treatment Period.
All subjects received Methotrexate 15 to 25mg/week orally or subcutaneously from Baseline through Week 104. Regimens could have been changed at Week 52 only. Subjects who could not tolerate these doses could receive MTX at a minimum dose of 10mg/week orally or subcutaneously.</description>

Week 12 Responders continued CZP 200mg at Week 12 and every 2 weeks thereafter through Week 102.
Week 12 Non-Responders were switched to receive ADA 40mg at Week 12 and every 2 weeks through Week 22. At Week 24, Week 12 Non-Responders who did not have DAS28(ESR) LDA or a DAS28(ESR) change from Week 12 reduction of ≥1.2 discontinued ADA treatment and were withdrawn from the Treatment Period.
All subjects received Methotrexate 15 to 25mg/week orally or subcutaneously from Baseline through Week 104. Regimens could have been changed at Week 52 only. Subjects who could not tolerate these doses could receive MTX at a minimum dose of 10mg/week orally or subcutaneously.</description>

        <description>DAS28 [ESR] was calculated using the Tender Joint Count (TJC), Swollen Joint Count (SJC), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR in mm/hour), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (PtGADA-VAS in mm) using the following formula: 0.56 x √ (TJC) + 0.28 x √ (SJC) + 0.70 x lognat (ESR) + 0.014 x Patient Global Assessment of Arthritis, where 28 joints were examined and a lower score indicates less disease activity.
The definition of Week 12 responders was DAS28[ESR] Low Disease Activity (LDA) (ie ≤ 3.2) or an improvement of ≥ 1.2 in DAS28[ESR] relative to Baseline.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Subjects With a Disease Activity Score 28 [Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate] (DAS28 [ESR]) ≤ 3.2 at Week 104, in Subjects Responding at Both Week 6 and Week 12</title>
          <description>DAS28 [ESR] was calculated using the Tender Joint Count (TJC), Swollen Joint Count (SJC), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR in mm/hour), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (PtGADA-VAS in mm) using the following formula: 0.56 x √ (TJC) + 0.28 x √ (SJC) + 0.70 x lognat (ESR) + 0.014 x Patient Global Assessment of Arthritis, where 28 joints were examined and a lower score indicates less disease activity.
The definition of Week 6/12 responders was DAS28[ESR] Low Disease Activity (LDA) (ie ≤ 3.2) or an improvement of ≥ 1.2 in DAS28[ESR] relative to Baseline.</description>
          <population>Week 12 Responders were defined as those with DAS28(ESR) LDA (defined as DAS28[ESR] ≤3.2) or a DAS28(ESR) CFB reduction of ≥1.2 at Week 12. Only subjects responding at both Week 6 and Week 12 are included in this analysis.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 104</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI was derived based on the mean of individual scores in 8 categories of daily living actives (using 20 questions). Each question was scored 0-3 (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do), and the total HAQ-DI was scored on the scale of 0-3 as well. Change from Baseline was computed as the value at Week 104 minus the Baseline value. A negative value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement.</description>
