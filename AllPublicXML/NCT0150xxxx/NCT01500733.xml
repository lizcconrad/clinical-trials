  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) are types of blood or
      lymph node cancers that mostly affect the elderly. CLL/SLL both create abnormal white blood
      cells that hurt the immune system and make it more difficult to fight infections. These
      cancers are usually diagnosed after age 50; more than half of the people with CLL/SLL are
      over age 70. Elderly people often do not respond well to standard chemotherapy for CLL/SLL.
      They may have other health problems that make chemotherapy difficult. In addition,
      individuals who have a genetic abnormality called 17p deletion also do not respond well to
      standard treatments for CLL/SLL. Researchers want to test a new cancer treatment drug,
      PCI-32765, to see if it can treat CLL/SLL in these hard-to-treat groups.

      Objectives:

      - To see if PCI-32765 is a safe and effective treatment for CLL/SLL in older people and
      people with 17p deletion.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals over 65 years of age who have CLL/SLL.

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have CLL/SLL and 17p deletion.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and imaging
           studies. Blood and urine samples will be taken. Optional bone marrow and lymph node
           biopsies may also be taken.

        -  Participants will take PCI-32765 capsules every day for 28 days (one cycle of
           treatment). Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and clinic visits.

        -  PCI-32765 will be given for six cycles of treatment. Those who benefit from the drug
           will continue to take it as long as there are no side effects and the disease does not
           progress. Those who do not benefit will stop treatment and have regular followup exams.

      CLL/SLL is a malignancy of B cells that predominantly affects the elderly population.
      Diagnosis is typically made in adults over the age of 50 and more than half of the people
      with CLL/SLL are over the age of 70. Elderly patients in particular have other comorbidities
      that limit the tolerability of standard CLL/SLL chemoimmunotherapy regimens and they often
      have inferior response to these particular regimens. In addition, those patients with a 17p
      deletion also have inferior outcomes due to rapid progression of disease as well as
      refractoriness to standard treatment regimens.

      It is still unclear what leads to the development of CLL/SLL. However, recent studies
      indicated that B cell receptor (BCR) signaling is an important contributor to the disease and
      could be a target for therapy. Bruton s Tyrosine Kinase (Btk) is an enzyme required for BCR
      signaling.

      Ibrutinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (Btk). In vitro
      lymphoma models have demonstrated that ibrutinib inhibits Btk. Inhibition of Btk blocks
      downstream BCR signaling pathways and thus prevents B cell proliferation. A phase 1 study of
      ibrutinib shows activity in multiple lymphomas including CLL/SLL.

      This study will investigate the efficacy of ibrutinib for patients with CLL/SLL in patients
      that are older than 65 who are in need of therapy.This protocol is intended both for patients
      who have been untreated and those who have undergone other therapies.
