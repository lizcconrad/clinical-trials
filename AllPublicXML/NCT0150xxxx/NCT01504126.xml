  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if it is feasible to give a beta-blocker
      such as Inderal (propranolol hydrochloride) with standard chemotherapy (paclitaxel and
      carboplatin or possibly docetaxel) to treat ovarian cancer. The safety of propranolol
      hydrochloride will also be studied.

      Propranolol hydrochloride is designed to block certain chemicals that affect the heart.
      Researchers want to learn if this might also boost the immune system, allowing the
      chemotherapy to be more effective.

      Paclitaxel is designed to block cancer cells from dividing, which may cause them to die.

      Carboplatin is designed to interfere with the growth of cancer cells by stopping cell
      division, which may cause the cells to die.

      Tests Before Treatment:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, the following tests and
      procedures will be performed before beginning treatment.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs (blood pressure
           and heart rate).

        -  Your medical history will be recorded, including any drugs you may have been taking and
           any side effects you may have had.

        -  Blood (about 5 ½ teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. Biomarkers are found in
           the blood and may be related to your reaction to the study drug.

        -  You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check your heart function.

        -  You will be asked to fill out several questionnaires about how you have been feeling,
           how your life has been affected by the disease, and your age, education, and marital
           status. These questionnaires should take about 30-40 minutes to complete.

      Study Drug Administration Before Treatment:

      You will take propranolol by mouth 2 times a day for 48-72 hours before your treatment. You
      should take it with a glass of water (about 8 ounces). If there is any concern about starting
      medication, you will meet with a heart doctor before treatment. You will stop taking
      propranolol with your last dose given the night before surgery.

      Tests During Surgery:

      During surgery, if your doctor thinks there is enough tissue available without affecting the
      amount of tissue needed to make a diagnosis, leftover tumor tissue from the surgery will be
      used for biomarker and immune system testing.

      Once your doctor knows the final diagnosis of the pelvic mass, he/she will be able to tell
      you if further treatment is needed and if you are still eligible to continue taking part in
      this study. You will be taken off study if the pathology report shows there is no sign of
      cancer and you do not need to receive chemotherapy.

      Study Drug Administration:

      After surgery, once you are able to tolerate drugs taken by mouth, you will restart taking
      propranolol by mouth 2 times a day every day.

      You will begin chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel or docetaxel) either before or 3
      weeks after surgery. The doctor will decide when you receive chemotherapy and the schedule of
      the drugs based on what is in your best interest.

      You will receive paclitaxel by vein over 3 hours followed by carboplatin by vein over 1 hour.
      You will receive a total of 6 cycles of chemotherapy. If the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest, you may receive docetaxel by vein over 1 hour instead of paclitaxel.

      If you are on a 3-week schedule, you will receive paclitaxel or docetaxel followed by
      carboplatin on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle.

      If you are on a weekly schedule, you will receive paclitaxel followed by carboplatin on Day 1
      of each cycle. On Days 8 and 15 you will receive only paclitaxel by vein over 3 hours.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will start chemotherapy before your surgery. You will
      have 3 cycles of chemotherapy before surgery and 3 cycles after surgery.

      Study Visits After Surgery:

      On Day 1 of each cycle:

        -  Your vital signs will be measured.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for CA-125 testing.

      After Cycles 3 and 6 of chemotherapy:

        -  Any updates to your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests and CA-125 testing.

        -  Blood (about 5 ½ teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. If you have
           chemotherapy before surgery, the Cycle 3 blood draw will be before surgery.

        -  You will fill out the study questionnaires about how you have been feeling and how your
           life has been affected by the disease.

        -  You will have an ECG if the doctor thinks it is needed.

        -  After the 6th cycle only, you will have a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to check the
           status of the disease if the doctor thinks it is needed.

      Length of Dosing:

      You may continue taking propranolol hydrochloride until the end of Cycle 6 of chemotherapy.
      You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable
      side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the follow-up visits.

      Follow-up Visits:

      About every 3 months for 1 year after you stop taking the study drug, the following standard
      tests/procedures will be performed:

        -  Any updates to your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests and CA-125 testing.

        -  You will have an ECG if the doctor thinks it is needed.

        -  You will have a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to check the status of the disease if
           the doctor thinks it is needed.

      Information about your health and treatment will be collected from your medical records while
      you are receiving follow-up at MD Anderson and will be kept as part of the study records.
      This information will include your past medical history, information from your physical exam,
      your diagnosis and pathology (tissue) reports, results of routine blood tests, current drugs
      you are taking, and follow-up information about your treatment, side effects, and health.

      This is an investigational study. Propranolol hydrochloride is commercially available and FDA
      approved to treat high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, and to protect the heart after a
      heart attack. Giving it to patients with ovarian cancer is investigational.

      Up to 25 patients will take part in this study. Up to 20 will be enrolled at MD Anderson. Up
      to 5 will be enrolled at Harris Health System.
