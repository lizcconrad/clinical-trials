  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with celiac disease complain of neurocognitive symptoms such as mental
      confusion, grogginess, difficulty with concentration and forgetfulness after exposure to
      gluten. However, there is little data on any possible association between impaired cognitive
      function and gluten intake in celiac disease. The investigators predict that patients with
      celiac disease, when exposed to gluten, will experience neurocognitive symptoms such as
      confusion, forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating.

      The goals of this study are to determine the prevalence of neurocognitive symptoms after
      exposure to gluten in patients with celiac disease and to characterize the nature of these
      symptoms both in terms of their duration and severity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female

          2. 18-50 years of age

          3. Celiac Disease Group: Positive small intestinal biopsies meeting Marsh II or III
             histologic criteria for celiac disease at least six months since the time of study
             entrance as well as positive IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody or positive
             IgA/IgG anti-Deamidated Gliadin Peptide (DGP) with normal serum IgA

          4. Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitive Group: Negative small intestinal biopsies and negative IgA
             anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) or negative IgA/IgG anti-Deamidated Gliadin Peptide
             (DGP) with normal serum IgA, but with symptomatic response to gluten withdrawal

          5. Subject should have well controlled celiac disease and have been on a gluten-free diet
             for at least six months prior to study enrollment

          6. Subject must provide informed consent, as approved by the Institutional Review Board,
             and agree to complete required study visits, blood work neuropsychological testing and
             a urine pregnancy test (if applicable).

          7. Subject agrees to use appropriate birth control for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has other food intolerances or food allergies (other than gluten) that would
             interfere with the conduct of the study (e.g. corn starch, soy).

          2. Subject has a history of severe, acute symptomatic reactions to sporadic gluten
             ingestion

          3. Subject has any chronic active gastrointestinal disease other than celiac disease
             (e.g. Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, autoimmune enteropathy, eosinophilic
             enteritis).

          4. Subject should not have daily symptoms concerning for brain fog such as mental
             confusion or difficulty concentrating, at baseline.

          5. Subject has symptomatic neurological or psychiatric disease(s) that would interfere
             with the conduct of the study.

          6. Subject should not have been on corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents in
             the past 3 months.

          7. Significant other co-morbidity as determined by the Principal Investigator

          8. Subject is deemed inappropriate by the Principal Investigator.

          9. Subject is pregnant or breast-feeding at time of participation.
