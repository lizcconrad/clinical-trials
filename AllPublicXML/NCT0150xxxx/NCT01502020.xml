  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Zyclara™ (imiquimod) Cream, 3.75% is approved by the FDA for the treatment of actinic
      keratoses on the full face or balding scalp. Zyclara is applied once daily for two, 2-week
      treatment cycles separated by a 2-week no treatment applied interval. A generic imiquimod
      cream, 3.75% has been developed by Actavis Mid-Atlantic LLC for the topical treatment of
      clinically typical, visible or palpable actinic keratoses (AK) of the full face or balding
      scalp.

      The current clinical study is designed to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of this
      formulation with the currently marketed Zyclara™ (imiquimod) cream, 3.75% formulation
      (Graceway Pharmaceuticals LLC).

    <description>Complete clearance rate (treatment success) was defined as the proportion of subjects in a treatment group with 100% clearance of all AK lesions within the Treatment Area. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects in the per-protocol (PP) population with treatment success at Week 14/EOS. All AKs (Baseline and new lesions), independent of size, within the Treatment Area were included in the AK lesion counts.</description>

    <description>Measures of test article compliance included the total number of days of test article applications recorded on the CRFs and verified from the data in the subject diaries. Compliant subjects were defined as those who applied at least 75% and no more than 125% of the test article applications.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject was male or female, 18 years of age or older.

          -  Subject provided written informed consent.

          -  Subject was willing and able to apply the test article as directed, comply with study
             instructions and commit to all follow-up visits for the duration of the study.

          -  Subject had a clinical diagnosis of actinic keratoses (AK) with at least five (5) and
             no more than 20 clinically typical, visible or palpable AK lesions, each at least 4mm
             in diameter, in an area greater than 25cm2 on the face (excluding ears) or balding
             scalp, but not both.

          -  Subject was in good general health and free of any disease state or physical condition
             that might have impaired evaluation of AK lesions or which, in the investigator's
             opinion, exposed the subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation.

          -  If subject was a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP), she must have had a negative
             urine pregnancy test (UPT) and agreed to use an effective form of birth control for
             the duration of the study (e.g., abstinence, stabilized on hormonal contraceptives for
             at least three months [oral, implant, injection, IUD, patch or NuvaRing] condom and
             spermicidal or diaphragm and spermicidal). Abstinence was an acceptable form of birth
             control for subjects who were not sexually active. Subjects who became sexually active
             during the trial had to agree to use an effective, non-prohibited form of birth
             control for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject was pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the study.

          -  Subjects had hyperkeratotic, hypertrophic or atypical AKs (e.g., AK &gt; 1 cm2 in size)
             in the Treatment Area.

          -  Subject was enrolled in an investigational drug or device study during the study
             period.

          -  Subject was planning to be exposed to artificial tanning devices or excessive sunlight
             during the trial.

          -  Subject was immunosuppressed (e.g., HIV, systemic malignancy, graft vs. host disease,
             etc.).

          -  Subject had experienced an unsuccessful outcome from previous imiquimod therapy (An
             unsuccessful outcome was defined as after a reasonable therapeutic trial with no
             compliance issues, topical application did not work).

          -  Subject had used an investigational drug or investigational device within 30 days
             prior to the Baseline Visit.

          -  Subject had laser resurfacing, PUVA (Psoralen + ultraviolet A) therapy, UVB therapy,
             chemical peels or dermabrasion on the face or balding scalp within 6 months prior to
             the Baseline Visit.

          -  Subject had cryodestruction or chemodestruction, curettage, photodynamic therapy,
             surgical excision or other treatments for actinic keratosis on the face or scalp
             within one month prior to the Baseline Visit.

          -  Subject had used oral corticosteroid therapy, interferon, cytotoxic drugs,
             immunomodulators, immunosuppressive therapies or retinoids within one month prior to
             the Baseline Visit.

          -  Subject had used topical medications, corticosteroids, alpha hydroxy acids (e.g.,
             glycolic acid, lactic acid etc. &gt; 5%), beta hydroxy acid (salicylic acid &gt; 2%), urea
             &gt;5%, 5-fluorouracil, diclofenac, imiquimod or prescription retinoids (e.g.,
             tazarotene, adapalene, tretinoin) to the face or balding scalp within one month prior
             to the Baseline Visit.

          -  Subject had used topical creams, lotions or gels of any kind to the selected Treatment
             Area within one day prior to the Baseline Visit.

          -  Subject had a basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma within the Treatment Area within
             one year of study enrollment.

          -  Subject had a history of sensitivity to any of the ingredients in the test articles.

          -  Subject had any skin pathology or condition (e.g., facial/scalp psoriasis, atopic
             dermatitis, acne, rosacea, etc.) that, in the investigator's opinion, could have
             interfered with the evaluation of the test article, worsened due to the treatment or
             required the use of interfering topical, systemic or surgical therapy.

          -  Subject had any condition which, in the investigator's opinion, would have made it
             unsafe or precluded the subject's ability to fully participate in the research study.

          -  Subject was known to be noncompliant or was unlikely to comply with the requirements
             of the study protocol (e.g., due to alcoholism, drug dependency, mental incapacity) in
             the opinion of the investigator.
