  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics equivalence and safety by
      comparing pharmacokinetics characteristics between the SYO-1126 and Glivec Film Coated tab 4T
      (400mg) when administered a single-dose to healthy male volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers are administrated single-dose over the period I and II (crossover) of
      SYO-1126 and Glivec Film Coated tab 4T (400mg) as of imatinib 400mg.

      Every time before and after each medication, pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and safety of
      SYO-1126 and Glivec Film Coated tab 4T (400mg) is performed using a blood sample and
      conducting some tests (vital signs, physical exam, ECG, laboratory test, etc.) respectively.
