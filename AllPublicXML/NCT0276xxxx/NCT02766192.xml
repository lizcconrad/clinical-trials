    <textblock>
      Background: The poor prognosis and public health burden of PTSD necessitates the development
      of more effective and broader treatment approaches. In the etiopathogenesis of PTSD, trauma
      memories become ingrained into key brain areas through conditioned learning and are triggered
      by various situations of daily life. The brain glutamate system plays a key role in the
      process of trauma learning and trauma memories via long-term potentiation. Ketamine
      administration modulates the glutamate system and has been used in the treatment of
      depression and PTSD. Previous studies demonstrate that a single low dose of ketamine rapidly
      improves symptoms of refractory PTSD and treatment resistant depression. Unfortunately the
      observed response is short-lived (4-7 days, maximum up to 2 weeks) and multiple doses often
      produce unacceptable side effects. TIMBER (Trauma Interventions using Mindfulness Based
      Extinction and Reconsolidation for trauma memory) psychotherapy, is a manualized and
      translational mindfulness based cognitive behavioral therapy specifically designed to target
      trauma memories and their expressions in PTSD patients. The placebo controlled pilot study
      examined the efficacy of a protocol combining a single infusion of low dose ketamine
      (0.5mg/kg) and TIMBER psychotherapy in subjects suffering from chronic PTSD. The objective of
      this pilot study was to optimize and individualize treatment of chronic PTSD using a rapid,
      effective, trauma specific, user friendly and inexpensive approach that uses cutting edge
      psychopharmacological combined with novel psychotherapeutic approaches.

      Methodology: The randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled pilot study used a crossover
      design. Ten subjects with refractory PTSD were assigned to one of two arms: one arm (n=5)
      received combined ketamine infusion and TIMBER therapy (TIMBER-K arm) and the second (n=5)
      received combined placebo (normal saline) infusion and TIMBER therapy (TIMBER-P arm). All 10
      subjects received a short version of TIMBER therapy after 10 minutes of onset of the infusion
      in which reactivation of trauma memories was initiated in a controlled manner using
      standardized scales and scripted narrative of the index trauma. This was followed by a
      standardized mindfulness based cognitive therapy module to quickly de-escalate the arousal
      symptoms followed by induction of detached observation and reappraisal of the trauma
      experience. After completion of the 40-min infusion, all subjects were trained on the full
      version of TIMBER therapy using methods of mindfulness based graded exposure therapy and a
      twice-daily schedule of home practice was initiated. The investigators are currently in a
      process of recruiting fifty more subjects to examine the effects in a larger sample.

    <description>Response (or Relapse status) was assessed by determining the change from baseline scores on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) at Days-1 (25th hour post-infusion), 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 and 49 and so on following the initiation of the protocol. This was done in this weekly fashion till 3 months after the infusion. A subject was considered to have relapsed when his/her scores were &gt;50 in the CAPS scale and &gt;51 in PTSD Symptom Checklist (PCL) scale respectively. A subject was considered to be a 'Responder' when there was a reduction of 20 or more points of these scores at 25th hours post-infusion compared to his/her baseline scores on CAPS and PCL. To be considered a responder, the response needed to be sustained for 7 days or more.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men or women, 21-60 years of age;

          2. Patients attending the outpatient psychiatry clinic of Cooper University Hospital will
             be screened for this study using DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD.

          3. Participants must have a level of understanding sufficient to agree to all tests and
             examinations required by the protocol and must sign a written informed consent
             document;

          4. Participants must fulfill DSM-IV criteria for current civilian or combat-related PTSD,
             based on clinical assessment by a study psychiatrist, on the self-rated PTSD Check
             list (PCL-C scores must be at least 51and CAPS score must be at least 50 at screening
             on the first 17 items of the scale).

          5. Women must be using a medically accepted reliable means of contraception (oral
             contraceptive medication etc.) or not be of childbearing potential (i.e., surgically
             sterile, postmenopausal for at least one year);

          6. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and
             pre-infusion;

          7. Throughout this study, the participants will be on stable dosage(s) of medication(s).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Meet criteria for psychotic disorders, e.g. schizophrenia/ schizoaffective disorder.

          2. Women who are pregnant or are breast-feeding (because the medical risk of using
             ketamine during pregnancy and breast-feeding are unknown);

          3. Serious, unstable medical illnesses such as hepatic, renal, gastroenterologic,
             respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrinologic, neurologic, immunologic, or hematologic
             disease (including obstructive sleep apnea, history of difficulty with airway
             management during previous anesthetics, ischemic heart disease and uncontrolled
             hypertension, and history of severe head injury);

          4. Clinically significant abnormal findings of laboratory parameters, or physical
             examination;

          5. Patients with uncorrected hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism;

          6. Histories of mental retardation

          7. History of one or more seizures without a clear and resolved etiology;

          8. Drug or alcohol abuse or dependence within the preceding 3 months: phencyclidine (PCP)
             is especially important in this context because of its resemblance with ketamine not
             only in structure but also its pharmacodynamic effects on NMDA receptors.

          9. Previous recreational use of ketamine;

         10. Diagnosis of schizotypal or antisocial personality disorder (since these are known to
             reduce the possibility of study completion; other Axis II diagnoses will be allowed).
