  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose is to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Triferic iron administered
      orally in healthy adult volunteers. It is a randomized multiple treatments, single dose
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, randomized multiple treatments, single dose study assessing the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and absolute bioavailability of Fer-In-Sol ( Ferrous Sulfate) and
      Triferic (ferric pyrophosphate citrate, or FPC) administered orally with Shohl's solution in
      healthy volunteers.

      Total participation in the study is approximately six weeks and is comprised of a screening
      visit, 6 treatment periods, and a follow-up visit.

      The study will be conducted over a 13 day period:

      Day 1 will used to determine the baseline serum iron profile for each subject.

      Each subject will subsequently receive in a randomized sequence between Day 2 and 10:

        1. A single oral dose of Fer-In-Sol at 3 mg Fe/kg body weight (bw).

        2. A single oral dose of Oracit Shohl's solution 0.67 mEq/L (0.7 ml/kg bw) followed after
           10 minutes by Fer-In-Sol at 3 mg Fe/kg bw

        3. a single oral dose of Triferic PO at 3 mg Fe/kg bw

        4. a single oral dose of Oracit Shohl's solution 0.67 mEq/L (0.7 ml/kg bw) administered 10
           minutes prior to a single oral dose of Triferic at 3 mg Fe/kg bw.

        5. a single oral dose of Oracit Shohl's solution 0.67 mEq/L (0.7 ml/kg bw) followed
           immediately by a single oral dose of Triferic at 3 mg Fe/kg bw.

      All subjects will receive a single dose of 6.6 mg Triferic as a 4 hour IV infusion (to mimic
      the 4 hour iron tolerance test) on Day 12.

      Blood samples will be obtained at various times to analyze for serum iron parameters and for
      safety.

         11. The patient donated blood or blood products (e.g., plasma or platelets) within 30 days
             prior to Screening.

         12. The patient has participated in an investigational drug study within 30 days prior to
             Screening.

         13. The patient is pregnant or intends to become pregnant before completing the study.

         14. The patient's current medical status, in the investigator's opinion, would preclude
             participation in the study.
