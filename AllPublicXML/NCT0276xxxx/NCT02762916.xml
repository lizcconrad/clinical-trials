      The current increase in chronic diseases calls for changes to the health system. It is
      necessary to promote expert patient in chronic disease. The expansion of new technologies
      gives us new tools to face new challenges, providing efficiency, expertise and autonomy. The
      characteristics of peripheral arterial disease make possible to promote expert patient and
      the self-management. In order to bring these concepts together the telemedicine program was
      created to promote expert patient for increasing the quality of life and satisfaction of
      patients and improving the efficiency of the health system.

      Methods: Randomized clinical trial on patients with peripheral arterial disease in
      intermittent claudication grade. They were randomized into two groups: intervention arm (IA)
      using CONTECI program for self-managing and control arm (CA), followed as usual vascular
      visits.

    <description>The intervention arm (IA), telehealth control, were followed up by himself helped by CONTECI program. They have to use every three months and if somethings was wrong the patient have to send mail to the doctor.
The intervention consisted to use the CONTECI program (included test) for the following of the patients.</description>

    <description>The Control Arm (CA) were followed up as usual every 6 months in outpatient vascular visits in the clinical hospital. If some patient have a complications or and emergency they have to do usual protocol, go to primary care or emergency.</description>

    <description>The intervention group patients were not followed by the usual protocol, but it used the program CONTECI (and test different directions) to guide the patient monitoring.
Both groups used antiplatelets and statines as usual protocol (these were not the interventions) We did not use drugs or device for the intervention, only a Telemedicine programme</description>
