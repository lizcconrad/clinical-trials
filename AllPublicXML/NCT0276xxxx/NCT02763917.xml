  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Asthma and obesity are public health crises that have concurrently risen over the
      past decades, affecting millions of children in the United States and disproportionately
      affecting low-income minority children in urban areas. The same children at highest risk for
      asthma and obesity also have greater exposure to indoor and outdoor pollution. Emerging
      evidence suggests that obesity may confer increased susceptibility to health effects of air
      pollution.

      Methods: Aiming to provide causal-level evidence of these observational findings, we propose
      a home intervention study to 1) test whether targeted reductions of indoor Particulate Matter
      (PM) concentrations improve the respiratory health of overweight inner-city children with
      asthma more than that of lean inner-city children with asthma and 2) investigate mediators of
      susceptibility to indoor PM among overweight versus lean children with asthma. We will
      accomplish these aims using a 1:1 randomized controlled trial of 200 children with persistent
      asthma (half normal weight, half overweight) living in Baltimore City. Participants will be
      randomized to receive either two active air purifiers containing high-efficiency particulate
      air (HEPA) filters or two sham air purifiers with their filters removed.

      Implications: If the aforementioned observational findings are confirmed, implications will
      be directly relevant to the over 170 million children around the world now estimated to be
      overweight or obese.

      The primary object of this study is to determine the efficacy of a targeted environmental
      intervention among overweight inner city children as compared to normal weight inner city
      children with asthma.

      Specific Aim #1: To determine if overweight inner-city children, compared to lean inner-city
      children, have greater improvement in asthma with an air purifier intervention aimed at
      reducing indoor PM.

      Hypothesis 1: An intervention using HEPA filter air purifiers in the homes of inner-city
      children with asthma will be associated with greater respiratory improvement in overweight
      children than in normal weight children.

      Specific Aim #2a: To investigate mediators of susceptibility among overweight versus normal
      weight children with asthma.

      Hypothesis #2. Candidate mediators, including increases in a) tidal volume and thereby
      increases in doses of inhaled particles, b) inflammatory and oxidative stress responses, c)
      corticosteroid resistance, and d) sleep disordered breathing mediate increased susceptibility
      to indoor PM among overweight versus normal weight children with asthma.

      Children with asthma will be enrolled in the study for about 16 weeks. They will have three
      clinic visits, an overnight sleep study, and two home environmental assessments for one week
      each. They will have a home and clinical assessment before randomization and another home and
      clinical assessment about 12 weeks after randomization. The primary outcome measure is
      maximum number of asthma symptom days.

    <description>We have chosen symptoms based on the strong relationship between symptoms and PM observed in previous studies. Symptoms during the previous two weeks will be captured with standardized questions used in many inner-city asthma studies, including our own that detected a strong association between indoor PM and asthma symptoms. A 'maximum symptom days' variable will constructed as the maximum of the variables: days of slowed activity, days of wheezing, coughing or chest tightness when running or going upstairs, and nights of waking with asthma symptoms in the past two weeks. We will administer questionnaires to the primary caregiver of children 8-11 years and to both participant and caregiver for adolescents age 12-17. Previous studies have indicated concordance between adolescent and the caregiver responses, and we will collect data to assess concordance within our study population. Individual symptom variables will serve as secondary outcomes.</description>

    <description>Two portable air purifiers containing HEPA filters will be placed in the bedroom and room where the participant reports spending the most time. We have chosen to deploy two air purifiers because we have observed a 50% reduction in indoor PM concentrations with two air purifiers. Participants will be instructed to run the air purifiers continually. Participants will receive educational materials about environmental factors that are important for asthma health and environmental modification strategies. Participants will also receive educational materials about health benefits of maintaining a normal weight.</description>

    <description>Homes in the control group will receive placebo air purifiers that have the internal air filters removed, but which will run normally. Participants will receive educational materials about environmental factors that are important for asthma health and environmental modification strategies, and educational materials about health benefits of maintaining a normal weight. At the end of the study, participants in the control group will receive active air purifiers. A control group is needed to ensure that reduced pollutant levels and health effects are not due to temporal trends and 'placebo effects' of being enrolled in an intervention trial. Participants will also be informed that being in the study does not prevent them from purchasing and using air cleaners during the study period.</description>
