  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Miscarriage is a common event associated with severe psychological and social morbidity,
      further tormenting in women suffering recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) by at least three
      consecutive losses.

      Ultrasonography and biomarkers have yet to precisely predict viability in pregnancies with
      symptoms of threatening miscarriage.

      A novel biomarker Preimplantation Factor (PIF) derived by the developing embryo might be the
      key factor for this prediction ameliorating the implantation process by promoting a favorable
      local immune system in the uterus.

      The investigators aim to establish a prospective early pregnancy cohort (PEP-cohort) that
      includes women throughout the first trimester by both assisted reproductive technology (ART)
      and spontaneous conceptions. By a combination of consecutive ultrasonographys and blood
      samples of known predictors of implantation PIF as a predictor of viability will be
      evaluated.

      These data are finally compared to the same data in a retrospective cohort of RPL patients
      emphasizing the role of PIF.

      All collected data will be stored in a Research Biobank for the current studies outlined as
      well as potential future studies of reproductive medicine in the first trimester.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to evaluate Preimplantation Factor (PIF) throughout the first trimester
      we need to employ two settings of recruitment.

      Early part:

      The PEP in ART (PEP-A) will enroll participants referred for fertility treatment at
      Rigshospitalet and North Zealand Hospital. Participants all have cryopreserved embryos
      suitable for frozen embryo transfer in a natural menstrual cycle. No type of ovulation
      trigger will be employed, as the LH peak is monitored via home urine-LH test.

      For a thorough examination of the luteal phase, participants are recalled for blood samples
      on day 7, 11, 14 and 16 after positive urine-LH test. Hereafter positive serum human
      chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) denotes a pregnancy and these participants are offered to
      continue in the later part of the PEP-cohort.

      Late part:

      PEP in Spontaneous conceptions (PEP-S) represents the sampling of expected normal pregnancies
      from the local community. Enrolled at the time of the first positive pregnancy test,
      participants are expected to be included from approximately 5 weeks of gestation. Hereafter
      participants are recalled every two weeks for blood sampling and transvaginal
      ultrasonographys of endometrial thickness until a gestational sac and yolk sac are visible
      for mean sac diameter measuring and eventually the crown-rump-length.

      Research biobank All collected data: questionnaires of medical history before enrollment,
      ultrasonographys and blood samples of progesterone, 17-OH-progesterone, estradiol,
      alpha-feto-protein (AFP), pregnancy associated placental protein A (PAPP-A), hCG and PIF are
      stored in a research biobank.
