      1. Aim- This study is aimed to access the accuracy of TensorTip MTX device measuring
           Hemoglobin A1C, Oxygen Concentration and Saturation ,Carbon Dioxide, Blood pH,
           Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Red Cells Count, platelets, Blood Urea Nitrogen, Sodium,
           Potassium, Chloride, total bilirubin, cholesterol (HDL, LDL), Serum Creatinine,
           Peripheral Pulse Rate, Blood Pressure, Mean Arterial Pressure, cardiac output, cardiac
           index, stoke volume and blood gases compared with the simultaneous results from hospital
           references device (when available)

        2. Hypothesis- Human physiological biomarkers may be measured from the color distribution
           of the internal or external (skin) tissue. The technology of the TensorTip device is
           based on the color distribution of the peripheral blood tissue, which enables the
           measurement of certain biomarkers and vital signs under consideration

      1. This is a comparative clinical trial in which the measurements obtained by the TensorTip
           device will be compared with those obtained by the reference devices used by the
           hospital on daily or periodic monitoring (the devices will be identified by name and
           version at the final report).

        2. Eligible real time color signal obtained by the TensorTip during the measurement shall
           be recorded simultaneously with the measurements obtained by the reference devices (as
           described in the above point).
