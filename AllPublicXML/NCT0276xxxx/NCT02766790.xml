  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TA-65 MD® is pure, natural, plant-based compound that can help maintain or rebuild telomeres.
      A telomere is a region of repetitive DNA at the end of a chromosome, which protects the end
      of the chromosome from deterioration. They shorten during cell division and eventually signal
      an irreversible state of growth arrest known as cellular senescence. The length of a person's
      telomeres is an indicator of his or her overall health status; short telomeres have been
      associated with cellular aging and dysfunction.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the effects of TA-65 MD® on telomere length
      and on immunosenescence in subjects who have had 9 months of twice daily TA-65 MD®
      administration, compared to placebo. TA Sciences has developed different doses of TA-65® .
      The study intends to determine effect of four different doses of TA-65 MD® in terms of
      biomarkers, telomere length and overall health and sleep status.
