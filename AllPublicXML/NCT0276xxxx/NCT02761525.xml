  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether oral topic silver nanoparticles are
      effective to reduce potential pathogen microbial loads in mechanical ventilation patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients were performed with oral hygiene as recommended by the clinical practice
      guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia associated with
      mechanical ventilation. After that, placed the treatment of an innocuous gel compound with
      12ppm of silver nanoparticles or gel alone according to randomization. Then obtain and plant
      samples taken before the treatment 6 hours after. Comparing the results of the baseline
      sample with the final.

    <description>Before oral hygiene in the intubated patient, it was taken with sterile swab, a saliva sample which was sown in dextrose Sabouraud agar and tryptone soya agar. 6 hours later, placement of the experimental gel, retook saliva sample with a sterile swab and they seeded in the same agars . Colony forming units were counted before and after the intervention using semi-automated colony counter .</description>
