  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LOADPRO Study is an intra-operative, non-significant risk (NSR) case series feasibility
      assessment of the Intellirod LOADPRO™ System measuring spinal rod strain in long spinal
      kyphotic corrective constructs.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Intellirod LOADPRO™ sensor is an intra-operative titanium and ceramic, single use,
      disposable, strain sensing device, which includes hermetically sealed, micro
      electromechanical systems (MEMS) and radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology to
      enable measurement of intra-operative rod strain values. The transponder attaches to any
      commercially available 5.5mm diameter CoCr or Ti Alloy rod commonly used for posterior
      pedicle fixation systems. The transponder is used only to acquire rod strain values and a
      unique device identification code, which is obtained by a hand-held reader, providing
      real-time, objective measurement of the mechanical rod strain.

      This non-significant risk case series is intended to assess the effectiveness of the
      Intellirod LOADPRO™ sensor methodology and the intra-operative measurement of spinal rod
      strain. The LOADPRO™ sensors will be removed from the spinal rods after obtaining load
      measurements.

    <description>In this research study, the LOADPRO device will be used solely to monitor and record rod strain readings. The device is not intended, and won't be used, to control or make any rod adjustments by the operative surgeon. In order to provide assurance that the readings cannot be used to make adjustments intra-operatively, the surgeon investigators will be blinded to the rod strain measurement readings.</description>
