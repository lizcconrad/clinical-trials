  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of the most common chronic health conditions, affecting 900,000 Ontarians, 2.4
      million Canadians and over 300 million people worldwide. Unlike most other chronic diseases,
      asthma affects a significant proportion of children - an estimated 21% in Ontario. Asthma is
      also the leading cause of hospitalization for children in Canada and is a significant cause
      of school and work absenteeism. Though asthma is generally considered a chronic disease, it
      can be fatal in some instances - in 2009, an estimated 91 Ontarians died of this condition.
      Effective management of asthma can prevent exacerbation and more severe negative health
      consequences. In fact, estimates show that over 80% of the asthma-related deaths could be
      prevented through proper education. However, evidence also shows that over 55% of patients
      with moderate to severe asthma do not have their asthma symptoms under control, despite
      regular doctor visits. Less than a third (31%) of asthma patients report receiving an asthma
      action plan from their physicians, although such plans are associated with fewer ER visits,
      lower hospitalization rates and improved lung function. Hence, there is a clear opportunity
      to improve the management of asthma and reduce the incidence of related complications.

      Given the scientific evidence of pharmacists effect on asthma management there is a strong
      rationale for introducing an asthma-specific pharmacist-led intervention for Ontarians
      suffering from this chronic disease. However, the implementation of such a program should be
      preceded by a pilot test to ensure that the program parameters are optimized to drive
      improved patient outcomes and maximum quality of service. The primary goals of this research
      project are to examine the impact of a pharmacist led asthma management intervention on
      patient health outcomes and to determine the optimum program structure to ensure quality of
      service delivery.

      This study employs a mixed-methods study design. Investigators will begin with a cluster
      randomized controlled trial and end with exit interviews.This study will consist of a
      prospective, randomized controlled trial conducted in the community setting. A total of 12
      pharmacies across the Greater Toronto Region will be recruited for this study. Each of these
      pharmacies will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention group or the
      control group. All data will be analyzed using statistical software. Significance level will
      be set at 0.05. Pharmacy level descriptive characteristics, including mean and standard
      deviation for the number of patients will be reported. There is a low perceived risk for this
      study; however, the investigators will take every precaution to ensure this study is
      conducted in an ethical manner, including protecting patient confidentiality and anonymity.

    <description>Patients in the control group will receive standard, dispensing services they currently receive from pharmacists. Control group pharmacists will continue to provide these services in accordance with the standards of practice adopted by the Ontario College of Pharmacists. They will not provide either of the 3 intervention components outlined above. Should a control group patient request additional information and/or services, the pharmacist will comply and provide these as deemed necessary for the particular patient. This could include the full range of educational and drug therapy optimization services outlined for the intervention group. If this occurs then the pharmacists will document all services provided in order for the research team to account for this in the analysis.</description>
