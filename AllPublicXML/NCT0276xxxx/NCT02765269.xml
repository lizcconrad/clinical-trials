    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Intelligent Pain Management System
      (IPMS) could make recording and interfering pain timely among cancer patients with pain. The
      system's usability, feasibility, compliance, and satisfaction will also be assessed.

      Research indicate that over one-third of cancer patients experienced cancer pain, which is
      known as a major reason leading to lower quality of life of the patients.In this present
      study, the investigators aim to design, develop, and test the feasibility of a low cost,
      conveniently implemented mobile application to facilitate real-time pain recording and timely
      intervention among Chinese cancer patients with pain. This system evaluate real-time pain and
      Karnofsky Performance Status（KPS）scores for quality of life, and to generate an action plan
      to visit the physician or to adjust pain medication dosage when the pain threshold is
      reached. The investigators study is to test this system's effectiveness.

    <description>Numerical rating scale allows a person to describe the intensity of his/her pain as a number usually ranging from 0 to 10, where &quot;0&quot; means &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;10&quot; means pain as &quot;bad as it could be&quot;. Higher values means worse outcomes. The investigators will compare average pain score assessed by numerical rating scale at the end of the trial period.</description>
