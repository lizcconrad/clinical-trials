  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an uncontrolled, open-label, Phase III trial of peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys) in
      participants coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV).
      Participants with HIV/HCV who do not show negative or reduced HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA)
      after at least 12 weeks of treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin will receive a
      low dose of peginterferon alfa-2a for 18 months. The primary objective is to evaluate safety
      and tolerability. Secondary objectives are to evaluate histological, virological, and
      biochemical effects.
