    <textblock>
      Polyps are fleshy outgrowths of the inner lining of the womb which may hinder implantation of
      embryo and lead to subfertility.This study evaluates whether removal of endometrial polyps in
      womb affects chances of pregnancy in women in whom no other causes of subfertility can be
      found. Half of the women would have these polyps removed after their consent and the other
      half who would not consent would not undergo any such intervention

    <description>. During the second visit after she consents to removal of polyp revealed on prior saline sonography, a dilatation and curettage would be performed under ultrasound guidance and after successful removal of polyp (polypectomy) saline sonography would be repeated to ensure completeness of removal.</description>

    <description>saline infusion sonography (SIS) on 8th to 11th day of menstrual cycle. On the day of admission SIS will be performed in an outpatient setting .Taking all aseptic measures a speculum will be inserted vaginally and up to 20 ml of sterile saline solution will be infused into the uterine cavity through a cervical foley's catheter of 5 french to distend the endometrial cavity. A transvaginal transducer will be used to scan the uterine cavity. In case the patient has polyps she would be offered removal under general anaesthesia on a subsequent visit as a day case procedure.</description>
