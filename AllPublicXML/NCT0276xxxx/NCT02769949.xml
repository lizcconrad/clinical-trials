  <brief_summary>

      Background: Some patients with unusual genetic conditions are referred to the National
      Institutes of Health (NIH). They may not be eligible to join current research studies.
      Testing such patients is a good way to improve the skills of research staff. The findings
      could lead to new processes and research.

      Objectives:

      To recruit a diverse group of pediatric subjects with genetic disorders. To give clinic staff
      hands-on experience working with these patients.

      Eligibility:

      Children any age with a known or suspected genetic disorder.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They may have lab and
      other tests.

      Family members may give DNA samples.

      Participants will have:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Height, weight, and other measurements taken.

      A clinical evaluation of their disorder.

      They may have:

      Blood, urine, and saliva samples taken

      Imaging tests. These may include x-rays, scans, ultrasound, or skeletal survey.

      A sleep study

      A visit with other specialists at NIH

      A genetic test from a commercial lab

      Medical photographs taken

      Other tests

      Participants may have follow-up visits. They may get medical or surgical treatment.

      The aim of this protocol is to allow genetic-related evaluations for patients with a variety
      of known or suspected genetic disorders, supplement and offer an additional opportunity for
      training in clinical genetics, dysmorphology and metabolic genetics in the National Institute
      of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and other Institutes of the National Institutes
      of Health (NIH). If not eligible for a specific NICHD research protocol, patients with
      genetic-related conditions may be evaluated under the auspices of this protocol to advance
      the clinical skills of physicians participating in NICHD clinical research and training
      programs, and to provide stimuli for new clinical research initiatives. Standard
      medically-indicated laboratory or radiological studies may be performed to confirm a
      diagnosis or to aid in the management of the patient. In some cases, the child participant
      may receive medical or surgical treatment for their disorder at the NIH CC according to
      current clinical practice. The overall purpose of genetic evaluations under this protocol is
      to support our clinical training and research missions. Family members of children evaluated
      on this protocol (who have informative meiotic inheritance relationships to the proband or
      index case) may be enrolled in the genetic/DNA testing part of the protocol.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Protocol investigators will make the actual selection of patients most appropriate for
             establishing a clinical diagnosis as well as for clinical training

          -  Existence of a referring community health care provider who would be able to manage
             medical care outside of NIH.

          -  Relatives may be enrolled if clinically indicated for the diagnosis of a proband.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Any medical, psychiatric, or social conditions, which, in the opinion of the
             investigators, would make participation in this protocol not in the best interest of
             the patient. Patients who are critically ill, unstable, or with severe organ failure
             that may effect/limit the evaluation and place unsustainable demands on Clinical
             Center or NICHD resources will be excluded.

          -  Subjects with disabilities are not formally excluded from the study unless the
             disability would specifically prevent their participation.
