  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and potential impact of an automated
      phone system in monitoring and improving self-care and health outcomes among patients with
      depression in Bolivia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive a weekly 10-15 minute automated phone call to their cell phone for
      disease assessment and self-care support for up to 12 weeks. During enrollment, the research
      team will explain how to use the automated phone system. During patients' automated calls,
      they will be asked questions about their self-care relevant to their diagnosis, symptoms of
      depression, and medication adherence (if patients are prescribed an anti-depressant). Based
      on the patient's self-report, they will receive targeted suggestions for how to improve their
      self-management. At the end of each automated call, patients will hear the phone number of
      their clinic, which they can call for a health problem or to disenroll from the program. At
      the time of recruitment, if possible, an initial automated call will be sent to the patient's
      phone so that they can learn what to expect and have the chance to ask questions of the
      research associate who will be present.

      In the event that the patient reports a health or self-care problem during their call (i.e.,
      the patient reports rarely or never taking their medication), a report will automatically be
      generated and sent by email to the research team plus the patient's designated clinician so
      that follow-up can take place. The secure email address will be verified with each clinician,
      and be password protected.

      The intervention will last up to 12 weeks, after which the patient will have a follow-up
      meeting with the research team and will complete a survey about the program. All follow-ups
      will take place either in person or over the phone.
