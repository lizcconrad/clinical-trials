  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The existing DBS setting in patients with DBS of the globus pallidus interna (GPi), which
      aims to treat motor symptoms by a high-frequency stimulation, will be temporarily reprogramed
      to stimulate the NbM at a low frequency using the distal electrodes positioned in the
      vicinity of the NBM.

      This study aims to investigate the neuropsychological effect of low frequency stimulation of
      the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, who were
      previously treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (GPi).

      The existing DBS setting in patients with GPi DBS, which aims to treat motor symptoms by a
      high-frequency stimulation, will be temporarily reprogramed to stimulate the NBM at a low
      frequency using the distal electrodes positioned in the vicinity of the NBM.This study
      consists of a three-day screening study of the NbM stimulation followed by a two-week,
      randomized, single-blind, crossover trial. Between the screening study and the crossover
      trial, one week of washout period will be applied to eliminate potential carryover effect
      from the previous stimulation.
