        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females aged 18 - 75.

          2. Female subjects must meet all of the following criteria:

               1. Not breastfeeding

               2. Negative pregnancy test result (human chorionic gonadotropin, beta subunit [hCG])
                  at Visit 0 (screening) (not applicable to hysterectomized females).

               3. If of childbearing potential (including perimenopausal women who have had a
                  menstrual period within 1 year), must practice and be willing to continue to
                  practice one of the following highly effective birth control methods during the
                  entire duration of the study:

             i. Diaphragm or partner use of condom in combination with combined (estrogen and
             progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of
             ovulation:

               -  Oral

               -  Intravaginal

               -  Transdermal ii. Diaphragm or partner use of condom in combination with
                  progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:

               -  Oral

               -  Injectable

               -  Implantable iii. Placement of an intrauterine device iv. Placement of an
                  intrauterine hormone-releasing system v. Bilateral tubal occlusion vi.
                  Vasectomised partner (provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the
                  female subject and that the vasectomised partner has received medical assessment
                  of the surgical success) vii. Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from
                  heterosexual intercourse) d) Must practice appropriate birth control as stated
                  above for 10 weeks after the last dose of study medication

          3. BMI 20 - 35.

          4. Clinical T2D diagnosis at least 6 months prior to enrolment.

          5. Metformin treatment, with stable dose for at least 1 month.

          6. HbA1c 55 - 86 mmol/mol (7,2-10 % DCCT).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History or sign of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of
             participation in the study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to
             participate in the study.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes mellitus and/or history of diabetic ketoacidosis
             or positive Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase Autoantibodies test (GAD antibodies test).

          3. Patients treated with antipsychotics, systemic glucocorticoids, neuropsychiatric
             stimulants, antidepressants with sympathetic activity, beta blockers or other
             pharmaceuticals rendering patient unfit for study participation as judged by the
             investigator.

          4. Patients treated with antidiabetic medications other than Metformin.

          5. Patients with any other endocrine disease except substituted hypothyroidism.

          6. Significant abnormal liver function defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;3x
             upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;3x ULN.

          7. Patients with impaired liver or kidney function (eGFR &lt; 60).

          8. Known or suspected history of significant drug abuse.

          9. History of alcohol abuse or excessive intake of alcohol as judged by investigator.

         10. History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing allergy/hypersensitivity, as
             judged by the investigator.

         11. Plasma donation within one month of screening or any blood donation or significant
             blood loss (&gt; 400 ml) during the 3 months prior to screening.

         12. Any other condition with in the opinion of the investigator would render the patient
             unsuitable for inclusion in the study and /or for the patients safety.

         13. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca
             staff and/or staff at the study site).

         14. Judgment by the investigator that the subject should not participate in the study if
             considers subject unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and
             requirements.
