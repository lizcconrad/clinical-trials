  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy (proportion of subjects with SVR12),
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of an 8- and 6-week treatment regimen of AL-335,
      odalasvir (ODV) and simeprevir (SMV) in chronic HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, 5 or 6 infected
      subjects without cirrhosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2b multicenter study. The study will include a screening period of maximum 6
      weeks, a treatment period of 6 or 8 weeks and a 24-weeks post-treatment follow-up period. The
      total study duration for each subject will be 36 to 38 weeks. This study investigates a 3
      direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA) combination of AL-335 (HCV NS5B inhibitor), odalasvir
      (ODV) (a second generation HCV NS5A inhibitor) and simeprevir (SMV) (HCV NS3A4 protease
      inhibitor). The results of this study will enable the selection of treatment and duration to
      be further developed.
