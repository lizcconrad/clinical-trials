  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment resistant motor features, such as postural instability and freezing of gait are
      common in people with Parkinson's disease and major contributors to morbidity and mortality.
      This project will use sleep studies, quantitative motor assessments and magnetic resonance
      imaging to examine the relationship between abnormally increased muscle activity during rapid
      eye movement sleep and the development and progression of treatment-resistant postural
      instability and gait disturbances. Specifically, the investigators will test the hypothesis
      that anticipatory postural adjustments (weight and pressure shifts) during gait initiation
      are significantly reduced in people with Parkinson's disease who have abnormally elevated
      muscle activity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep compared to individuals will
      Parkinson's disease whose REM sleep muscle activity is normal. In addition, the investigators
      will test the hypothesis that the level of RSWA at baseline is predictive of measures of
      motor decline (postural stability and gait) and alterations in the structure and function of
      locomotor brainstem networks. Since sleep disorders can emerge years before a diagnosis of
      Parkinson's disease, establishment of a link between sleep and treatment-resistant posture
      and gait disorders will help identify individuals at risk of developing these disabling motor
      features of disease.
