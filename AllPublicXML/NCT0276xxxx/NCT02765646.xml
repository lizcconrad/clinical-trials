      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the clinical performance of the Tryton Side
      Branch Stent used in conjunction with a commercially available Drug Eluting Stent (DES) to
      treat de novo bifurcated lesions involving both the Left Main (LM) and Circumflex Coronary
      Artery(LCX).

      The registry study will involve the collection of demographic and clinical data, including
      in-hospital and follow-up data to determine primary composite endpoint of MACE (Major Adverse
      Cardiac Events) at 9 months and secondary endpoints. Secondary endpoints are defined as
      successful deployment of the Tryton stent and main vessel DES within the target lesion,
      angiographic success &lt;30% residual stenosis in LM and LAD/LCX by visual estimate and TIMI 3
      flow post procedure, and freedom of in-hospital MACE.
