  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior to the deployment of transcatheter heart valves (THV), balloon aortic valvuloplasty
      (BAV) is often performed under rapid right ventricular pacing (burst &gt;180 bpm) with the
      induction of a functional cardiac arrest for up to 30 seconds. Aortic valve predilation aims
      at facilitating the crossing of the aortic annulus, accurate valve positioning and does also
      provide information on the anatomy of the valve complex. However, BAV has been shown to have
      a number of potentially detrimental effects.

      There is limited experience for the balloon expandable Edwards THV on the need for
      predilation (BAV). Experience so far has only been documented from smaller, uncontrolled case
      series.

      The investigators aim to document the incidence of several kinds of complications in a large,
      multicenter registry / prospective controlled cohort study to identify associations between
      patient related variables and outcomes.

      Aortic valve predilation aims at facilitating the crossing of the aortic annulus, accurate
      valve positioning and does also provide information on the anatomy of the valve complex.
      However, BAV has been shown to have a number of potentially detrimental effects, such as:

        -  Functional cardiac arrest induced by rapid pacing leads to transient coronary, cerebral,
           and renal ischemia.

        -  In patients with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), prolonged cardiac
           depression after rapid pacing is observed and may result in hemodynamic failure and
           systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Both are associated with a high
           periprocedural mortality.

        -  BAV has been identified as a major source of thrombotic and valvular material, thus
           increasing the risk for coronary obstruction with subsequent myocardial infarction
           and/or stroke.

        -  The local trauma in the left-ventricular outflow tract caused by BAV may potentially
           contribute to aortic root rupture.

      The investigators aim to document the incidence of cerebrovascular complications,
      paravalvular leakage and operative outcomes in a large, multicenter registry / prospective
      controlled cohort study to identify associations between patient related variables and
      outcomes.
