  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The tumor tissue of patients with pancreatic cancer will be submitted to next-generation
      sequencing (NGS) and these data will be evaluated with an oncology treatment decision support
      (TDS) software tool that is a medicinal product class 1 (CE-marked). This software will make
      evidence-based suggestions for drugs likely to be effective, ineffective, or toxic (FDA
      approved biomarkers). For patients fit for second-line therapy, the resulting recommendations
      will be judged by the tumor board.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumor tissue of patients (surgical resection, biopsy) will be used for SWEDAC-certified DNA
      extraction and NGS. Pseudonymised sequencing data will be fed into a TDS software tool
      (TreatmentMAP™, Molecular Health) and based on published evidence, suggestions will be made,
      graded into NCCN categories of approved drugs in indication or otherwise, clinical evidence
      or experimental. Same with anticipated inefficacy. In addition, FDA-approved biomarkers for
      toxicity will be analysed. This information is taken to the tumor board for making a decision
      whether this information is useful and eventually to recommend a treatment for a given
      patient.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient age ≥ 18 years up to 75 years

          -  Patient willing and able to provide informed consent

          -  TreatmentMAP™ NGS/TME is ordered by the tumor board (MDT) under routine clinical
             practice

          -  Diagnosis of a locally advanced, inoperable or metastatic pancreatic carcinoma,
             clinically and histologically verified according to the currently prevailing
             standards.

          -  Patient received first line therapy according to applicable guidelines and/or
             standards (SoC)

          -  Sufficient testing material available (e.g. tumor biopsy) to allow NGS/TME NGS panel
             testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with ongoing systemic infection,

          -  Patients with immunodeficiency,

          -  Patients with severe cardiovascular and pulmonary morbidity that might interfere with
             or preclude further systemic anticancer treatment,

          -  Patients on full therapeutic anticoagulation.

          -  Patients who, due to their clinical status, are not eligible for further systemic
             anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy etc.)

          -  Patients who, due to their disease status are in need of immediate therapy and cannot
             wait for the result of the NGS/TME process.
