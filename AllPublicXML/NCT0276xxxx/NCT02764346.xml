  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the use and impact of smartphone application (app) for adolescents
      with ongoing pain caused by their juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).The current project
      will include three studies. First, the investigators conducted usability sessions with
      adolescents with JIA to refine the app so that it is usable, acceptable and understandable.
      The aim of this study is to look at (a) how regularly the &quot;iCanCope with Pain&quot; app is used
      and (b) any effect the app has on young people's health. This study will compare two groups
      of young people: one that is using the new app, and one that receives usual medical care.

    <measure>Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be measured using the Standardized Universal Pain Evaluations for Rheumatology providers for children and youth (SUPERKIDZ). It consists of 4 domains: pain intensity and location (5 items), fatigue (1 item), pain interference/evaluative dimension (10 items), and affective/emotional dimension (4 items) for children &gt; 8 years. This online measure takes 3 - 5 minutes to complete, and has evidence of test-retest reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain-Related Activity Limitations</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain-related activity limitations will be measured using the Child Activity Limitations Interview (CALI-21). This is a well-validated 21-item self-report scale divided into (i) active (e.g., gym, sports) and (ii) routine (e.g., schoolwork, reading) activity subscales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain coping</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain coping will be measured using the Pain Coping Questionnaire which is an internationally used measure of pain coping strategies in pediatric populations. Respondents indicate on a 5-point scale how often they use a given type of coping strategy from among 8 different categories. Three higher order factor-derived subscale scores will be used for analyses, including approach coping (e.g., problem-solving), problem-focused avoidance coping (e.g., cognitive distraction), and emotion-focused avoidance coping (e.g., catastrophizing). The measure is considered to meet psychometric criteria for a &quot;well-established&quot; coping measure and is responsive to pain coping interventions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HRQoL will be measured using the PedsQL 3.0 Arthritis Module, which measures the potential impact on quality of life of having arthritis in childhood. The scale has 22 items and evaluates the severity of perceived problems with disease symptoms, daily activity limitations, treatments, worry/anxiety, and communication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health care utilization form</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>

    <description>In addition to standard medical care, adolescents in the experimental group will receive access to the &quot;iCanCope&quot; smartphone app for 8 weeks. The app consists of daily pain symptom tracking (pain intensity, sleep, mood, physical activity, and fatigue), goal setting, in-the moment coping strategies, as well as a social community component.</description>

In addition to standard medical care, adolescents in the attention control group will receive access to the &quot;iCanCope&quot; control app, with limited functionality.</description>
