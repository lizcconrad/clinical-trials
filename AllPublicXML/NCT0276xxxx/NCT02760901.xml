  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin is a major anti-neoplastic drug used for the treatment of solid tumors. Its chief
      dose limiting side effect is nephrotoxicity. Twenty percent of patients receiving high-dose
      cisplatin undergo severe renal dysfunction. Acetazolamide and N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
      ameliorated Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. No study to date evaluated the
      protective effect of acetazolamide or NAC against cisplatin nephrotoxicity in humans.

      Aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of acetazolamide or NAC against cisplatin
      nephrotoxicity in humans compared to mannitol and to each other.

      Patients and methods. A total 52 patients receiving standard hydration measures for cisplatin
      were randomized to three groups: 20 patients receiving mannitol, 15 patients receiving
      acetazolamide and 17 patients receiving NAC. Patients` kidney function was monitored using
      serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and blood urea nitrogen; kidney injury was assessed
      using RIFLE criteria. Patients` liver function tests and hematological parameters were also
      monitored.
