  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NOR-SYS II is designed for finding the cause of acute ischemic stroke lesions in Young
      adults, age 15 to 49 years. Risk factors, arterial wall changes by intima-media thickness and
      plaques and consequences of stroke are examined by standardized diagnostics.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NOR-SYS II is as far as possible standardized concerning patients' history, ultrasound
      examination of pre-cerebral and femoral arteries, and standardized examinations performed by
      speech therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.

      The ultrasound-protocol for carotid and femoral arteries is the same as previously performed
      in the NOR-SYS study. The Methods have been published before.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Established atherosclerosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Established atherosclerosis will serve as outcome measure for data collected during hospital stay and will be related to risk factors. The data will be presented one year after finishing the 5-years of inclusion of the whole study group.</time_frame>
    <description>The ultrasound protocol of the NOR-SYS study will be applied for carotid and femoral arteries. In addition angiographies will be done for patients with suspicious arterial disease. The measurements will be done within hospital stay after the acute stroke.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>New cardiovascular events</measure>
    <time_frame>One year after the stroke</time_frame>
    <description>Patients With different causes of ischemic stroke have different prognosis that is worst for recurrent stroke and other cardiovascular events for patients with atherosclerosis.</description>

    <time_frame>One year after the stroke</time_frame>
    <description>Death fro all causes with subgroups of cardiovascular death, cancer and other causes of death will be registered</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alive but not back to previous education or full-time job</measure>
    <time_frame>One year after the stroke</time_frame>
    <description>Not back to work because of stroke related problems. Standardized questionnaires will be used to collect information about education and work before stroke and the situation after 3 months and one year. The frequency and reasons why patients did not come back to their education situation or their job they did before the stroke are collected. We expect that it is still possible within a year from stroke onset, to specify the sort of problem related to stroke or unrelated to stroke. This may get more unspecific, the longer the time gets from stroke onset to follow-up. NOR-SYS II will focus on a particular group of patients that seem to function well but that struggle with unvisible problems such as tiredness and reduced capacity / energy to work.</description>
