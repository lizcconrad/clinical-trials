      This study will evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular
      (IM) recombinant human erythropoietin beta (r-HuEPO) in participants with anemia and
      histologically or cytologically confirmed cancer.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Response to Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Response to treatment was defined as an increase of greater than (&gt;) 1 gram per deciliter (g/dL) in hemoglobin level (irrespective of the need of transfusion) from Baseline value at Week 4.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Time to response was defined as the time between the start of treatment and the increase in hemoglobin level &gt;1 g/dL compared to baseline hemoglobin level. Time to response was estimated using Kaplan Meier method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Response to Treatment After 2 Weeks of Study Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Response to treatment after 2 weeks of treatment was defined as presence of any of the following criteria: reticulocytes &gt;40000 per microliter or &gt;25% increase in soluble transferrin receptor or &gt;0.5 g/dL increase in hemoglobin level.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With No Response to Treatment After 4 Weeks of Study Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;No Response&quot; to treatment after 4 weeks was defined as meeting any of the following criteria: &lt;1 g/dL increase in hemoglobin level or hemoglobin level &lt;8.5 g/dL or need of transfusion. If a participant had an increase in hemoglobin level of &gt;1 g/dL but required transfusion then the participant is considered as Non- Responder.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) Questionnaire Score at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>FACT-An comprises of 4 subscales of 27-item (FACT-General scale [FACT-G]): physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotion well-being, functional well-being, and an additional concerns anemia subscale. All questions are rated on a scale from 0 to 4, where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The physical well-being subscale consists of 7 questions with score range from 0-28; social/family well-being subscale consists of 7 questions with score range from 0-28; emotion well-being subscale consists of 6 questions with score range from 0-24; functional well-being subscale consists of 7 questions with score range from 0-28; anemia subscale consist of 20 questions with score range from 0-80. Total FACT-An score ranges from 0-188.</description>
