  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to evaluate the anti-relapse prophylactic activity of
      inoculating Natural Killer (NK) cells as consolidation therapy of acute myeloid leukemia in
      paediatric patients with cytologic remission. The patients included have intermediate risk of
      relapse and no indication for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      After the standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy treatment, patients will receive
      five days of fludarabine to try to kill any minimal residual disease and prevent NK cell
      rejection. Two different NK cells infusions will be performed within one week (day 0 and 7).
      Interleukin 2 (IL-2) will be administrated to increase the cytotoxic activity of NK cells.

      Hypothesis:

      NK cells are the natural defence against cancer cells. Thus, supplementing compatible NK
      cells from a related donor might increase the probability to eliminate any residual
      chemotherapy resistant cell in Acute myelogenous leukemia patients.

      Description:

      NK cells will be donated from a compatible family member who has a certain genetic code in
      their blood, called HLA, which partly matches patient genetic code, reducing any potential
      rejection. Interleukin-2 is co administrated during NK cell treatment to improve
      effectiveness.

      Methodology:

      The day that patient receive first NK cell infusion is called day 0. The days before are
      called minus days (-D). Conversely, the days after NK cell infusion are called plus days
      (+D).

      Study administration

        -  After standard chemotherapy treatment against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and
           restoration of haematologic normal levels, patients will receive a 60mg/kg of
           cyclophosphamide (day -6) and five daily intravenous cycles 25 mg/m2 of the
           chemotherapic fludarabine every day (day -5, -4, -3, -2, -1).

        -  Day 0 will be settled from 24h to 48h after fludarabine treatment completion. NK cells
           will be intravenous administered twice (day 0 and day 7). The first dose of NK cells
           (day 0) will contain up to 5x10^7 cells/kg with immunophenotype NK (CD3-CD56+). The
           second dose might be higher (up to 5x10^8 cells/kg) in case of no treatment related
           toxicity after first NK injection. In any case, no more than 1x10^6 cells/kg with an
           immunophenotype T (CD56-CD3+) will be administrated.

        -  From day 0, IL-2 1x10^6 UI/m2 subcutaneous will be administrated three times a week
           during two weeks.

      Study visits

      Before and after the treatment a bone marrow aspirate will be analyzed in order to evaluate
      minimal residue disease (cytology, cytometry and/or molecular studies) at least one month
      after NK injection. objective response rate will be reevaluated at least once a year.

      Before treatment starts:

        -  Birthday, gender and personal medical history will be recorded

        -  physical examination, including measurement of the vital signs (temperature, heart and
           breathing rate, etc…)

        -  Blood and urine test

        -  Bone marrow aspirate in order to evaluate the basal disease

      On every visit

        -  Physical examination and vital signs will be recorded

        -  Adverse event form

        -  Other concomitant drugs

      After NK treatment

        -  It will be 11 visits on days +30, +60, +90, +180, +270, +360, +480, +600, +720, +900,
           +1080 which included a blood and urine test and Lansky/karnofsky scale.

        -  Additionally on days +30, +360, +720 and +1080 a bone marrow aspirate will be performed
           to evaluate relapse.

      Length of the study:

      Up to 35 AML patients will be included in the study during a 32 months recruitment period
      with a patient follow-up of thirty-six months. The maximum length of the study will be six
      years.
