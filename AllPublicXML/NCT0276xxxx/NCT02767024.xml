      Single center, prospective, randomized, non-blinded research study comparing intravenous
      vasodilator infusion vs. inotropic infusion in patients admitted to the hospital or in the
      emergency room at Montefiore Medical Center presenting with the diagnosis of acute
      decompensated systolic heart failure with low cardiac output but no hypotensive.

    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is determine if the administration of diuretics with intravenous
      sodium nitroprusside (vasodilator therapy) in comparison to intravenous dobutamine (inotropic
      therapy) will lead to a reduction in the primary and secondary endpoints in patients with
      acute decompensated systolic heart failure with low cardiac output and no hypotensive.
