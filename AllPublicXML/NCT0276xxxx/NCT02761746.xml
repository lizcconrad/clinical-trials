  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site (Detroit, MI; Los Angeles, CA; Philadelphia, PA, and Washington,
      DC), two-group randomized controlled trial testing a two-session intervention designed to
      increase motivation for adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) among youth living with
      HIV (YLH) newly recommended to begin medications. Participants are randomized to receive the
      intervention, Motivational Enhancement System for Adherence (MESA), or the control condition,
      System for Health (SH: healthy eating and physical activity information). Both groups receive
      the standard of care regarding the initiation of ART. ART adherence (visual analog scale and
      hair sample assay) and health outcomes (viral load results, and CD4 counts) are assessed.
      Additionally, potential mediators (HIV knowledge, motivation for adherence, and self-efficacy
      for adherence) and predictors of intervention response (substance abuse, mental health
      symptoms, executive functioning, and stressful life events) are assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medication adherence rates among youth living with HIV (YLH) are inadequate to effectively
      manage the disease. Very few adherence interventions have been tested with youth, and those
      that have are difficult to implement in real-world settings due to high intensity of sessions
      or low attendance rates. Thus, there is a demand for innovative, feasible, and engaging
      behavioral interventions targeting adherence, especially among YLH, the largest initiators of
      antiretroviral treatment (ART). A universal primary prevention program is a novel approach to
      target adherence problems before they begin by providing a prevention intervention to all
      youth newly initiating ART. This study plans to test a brief, two-session, computer-delivered
      motivational intervention to prevent adherence difficulties among youth newly prescribed ART.
      All elements of the study (assessment, intervention, control condition) were piloted in a
      small multi-site randomized controlled trial (NIH-funded Adolescent Medicine Trials Medicine
      Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions: ATN). Results suggested feasibility and acceptability, as
      well as trends for improved adherence when comparing the intervention to an active control
      condition. For the proposed multi-site randomized clinical trial, youth newly beginning ART
      (N=300 from 4 ATN sites in the United States) will be randomize to the Motivational
      Enhancement System for Adherence (MESA) or to the control condition (System for Health: SH;
      nutrition and exercise information delivered by the same platform matched for dose). ART
      adherence (visual analog scale and hair specimen assays) and health outcomes (viral load
      results and CD4 counts) is the primary outcome. Potential mediators (HIV knowledge,
      motivation for adherence, and self-efficacy for adherence) on the treatment effects of MESA
      and moderators (substance abuse, mental health symptoms, executive functioning, and stressful
      life events) as predictors of differential intervention response will be assessed. It is
      hypothesized that participants randomized to MESA will show significantly greater adherence
      and health outcomes than participants randomized to SH over one year of follow-up.

    <description>MESA involves two sessions (ACASI assessment and intervention), one at study entry (prior to beginning ART) and one a month later. Then, participants will complete ACASI assessments only at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The first MESA session is tailored based on how important and how confident the person feels about taking medications as prescribed. The participant is also offered personalized feedback regarding immune status and HIV knowledge with actual adherence feedback provided in the second session. Finally, the participant may engage in goal setting. The second MESA session focuses on adherence behavior over the previous month and the consequences (good or bad) of that behavior.</description>

Then, participants will complete ACASI assessments only at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The first SH session targets healthy eating and physical activity and is matched for dose and length of time of the intervention session. Feedback and education are provided, if desired. Finally, the participants may engage in goal setting for healthy eating and physical activity. The second SH session focuses on the goals set during the first session and behavior over the previous month.</description>

    <description>MESA is tailored based on how important and how confident the participant feels about taking medications as prescribed. If the participant does not believe taking medications is important, they engage in a decisional balance exercise. If the participant believes taking medications is important, they move directly to confidence modules and goal setting. If the participant does not feel confident about taking medications, they engage in activities to boost self-efficacy. Participants are also offered personalized feedback regarding immune status and HIV knowledge with actual adherence feedback provided in the second session. Finally, goal setting is an option, and feedback regarding adherence behavior over the previous month.</description>
