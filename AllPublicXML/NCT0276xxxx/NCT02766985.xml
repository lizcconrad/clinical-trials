      The purpose of this study is to make a standardized and scalable Rasch-built clinical
      severity scale to help in finding genetic and environmental modifiers of disease in
      Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD).

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brooks scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Measures upper extremity function.Scores on the scale range from 1-6. A score of 1 means the person can elevate their arms above their head while arms remain straight. 6 means the person cannot elevate their arms to their mouth and do not have useful function of their hands.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vignos scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Measures lower extremity function. Scores on the scale range from 1-10. A score of 1 means the person can walk and climb stairs without assistance. A score of 10 means the person is bedridden.</description>

    <measure>Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>IOPI measures lip and tongue strength by measuring the amount of pressure a person can exert on the tool.</description>

    <measure>Manual muscle testing</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Measure person's range of motion. Scored on a scale with range of 0-5. Score of 0 means no movement. Score of 5 means the person has a full range of movement.</description>
