  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients may participate in this research study if they have glioblastoma. (a brain tumor)
      that has come back after being treated. Standard treatment for this cancer is a chemotherapy
      drug called bevacizumab. This research study involves bevacizumab in combination with a
      special diet called the Modified Atkins Diet (MAD).

      The purpose of this study is to research if patients can stay on the MAD when it is added to
      the standard bevacizumab treatment.

      Primary Objective

      - Determine compliance to treatment at 6 and 12 weeks. Compliance is assessed by review of
      the daily food diary and the urine and serum ketone levels. Diet compliance is defined as
      following the diet guidelines 80% of the time with resultant ketosis 80% of the time. If 60%
      of the patients are compliant with the diet, as defined above, that is a considered a
      positive result.

      Secondary Objective(s)

        -  Determine patient compliance in monitoring of blood glucose and urine levels of ketosis.

        -  Determine obstacles to compliance.

        -  Determine the frequency of achieving ketosis, as measured by urine ketones checked daily
           and serum BHB checked every two weeks.

        -  Determine quality of life (FACT-BR) and adverse events.

        -  Determine response, progression free survival at 6 months (PFS 6), and overall survival
           (OS).

      Exploratory Objective

        -  To correlate levels of ketosis and blood sugar with treatment outcome.

        -  To correlate the level of MCT4 expression and IDH1 mutation status with treatment
           outcome.

          -  Minimum interval since last drug therapy;

               -  3 weeks since last non-cytotoxic therapy

               -  3 weeks must have elapsed since the completion of non-nitrosourea-containing
                  chemotherapy regimen.

               -  6 weeks since the completion of a non-nitrosourea-containing therapy regimen.

          -  Patients must have no concurrent malignancy except curatively treated basal or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix and breast,
             adequately treatment stage I or II cancer from which the patient is in complete
             remission. Patients with other malignancies must also be disease free for at least
             three years.

          -  Patients must be maintained on a stable corticosteroid regimen from the time of their
             baseline scan until the start of the treatment and/or for at least 5 days before
             starting treatment.

          -  Patients with the potential for pregnancy or impregnating their partners must agree to
             follow acceptable birth control methods to avoid conception. The effects of
             bevacizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (double
             barrier method of birth control or abstinence prior to study entry, for the duration
             of study participation and after completing treatment. Should a woman become pregnant
             or suspect that she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this
             study, she should inform the treating physician immediately.

          -  Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more
             than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to bevacizumab.

          -  Patients who have had previous treatment with bevacizumab.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing

             (NYHA &gt; 2), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because bevacizumab is an
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with bevacizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with bevacizumab. These potential risks may also apply to other
             agents used in this study.
