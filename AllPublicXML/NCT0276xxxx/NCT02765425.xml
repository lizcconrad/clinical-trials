  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research objective of this study is to determine whether an intervention and associated
      robotic device called &quot;Assisted Movement with Enhanced Sensation (AMES) can be used to
      enhance balance recovery following an unexpected loss of balance by conditioning areas of the
      brain involved in lower-limb (LL) motor control. It is hypothesized that AMES can improve
      balance recovery, gait, and reduce falls in near-frail elderly people by improving LL
      strength, speed, and coordination.

      AMES, is a medical intervention and robotic device originally developed to aid patients'
      recovery from injuries to the central nervous system that limit movement. Earlier published
      studies demonstrated a unique property of AMES, namely that it is capable of reducing
      sensorimotor impairment in the severely impaired, an underserved population of patients with
      brain and spinal cord injuries. AMES applies assisted movement, biofeedback, and sensory
      stimulation simultaneously and non-invasively to the upper or lower limb, the initial intent
      being to address impairments such as weakness, spasticity, sensory loss, and dyssynergia
      (i.e., co-contraction). These reductions in impairment are achieved through cortical
      plasticity. In the present study, the same methodology will be applied to the lower limbs of
      the near-frail elderly to reduce falls by training faster reaction times, stronger reactions,
      and more coordinated recoveries from slips and trips

      The specific aim of this study is to determine preliminarily the efficacy of the AMES
      intervention in helping older adults quickly readjust their posture in order to recover from
      unexpected loss of equilibrium. An AMES device will be placed into operation at the
      University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Out-patient Rehabilitation Therapy Clinic
      at Fayetteville, Arkansas(AR), where we will recruit 20 healthy, but near-frail subjects. Ten
      of these participants will be randomly assigned to a treatment group, and the other 10 will
      be assigned into a control group that will not receive the AMES intervention. Before and
      after 12 weeks of training with the bipedal AMES device, ankle strength, range of motion,
      proprioception, and reaction time, as well as gait and whole-body stability following
      unexpected balance perturbations will be assessed. In addition to measuring sensorimotor
      impairment and static balance equilibrium,the incidence of falls in all 20 participants
      beginning with enrollment into the study for a total of 6 months will be tracked. A reduction
      in sensorimotor impairment, an improvement in dynamic balance, and a reduction in fall
      incidence in the treatment group, but not in the control group is expected.

    <description>The Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale is a 16-item self-report measure in which subjects rate their balance confidence for performing activities. This stem is used to lead into each activity considered: &quot;How confident are you that you will not lose your balance or become unsteady when you...&quot; Items are rated on a rating scale that ranges from 0 - 100 Score of zero represents no confidence, a score of 100 represents complete confidence Overall score is calculated by adding item scores and then dividing by the total number of items.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be trained while seated on the AMES device. As the footplate of the device rotates the ankle Â±15 deg in dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, the participant will assist that motion. Vibration (2-3 mm at 60 pulses/s) will be applied to the tibialis anterior tendon during plantarflexion and to the Achilles tendon during dorsiflexion. To assist participants in the assisted movement task, the AMES biofeedback screen will provide real-time visual feedback of the volitional ankle torque that the participants actively apply to the AMES device. Each training session will include 15 min of training of each ankle; training sessions will be conducted 3 times/week over a 12-week period, for a total of 9 hours of training on each ankle.</description>
