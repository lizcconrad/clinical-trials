      Interferon-free Antiviral Treatment of HCV-Positive Genotype 1b Related Indolent non-Hodgkin
      Lymphomas Patients Using Daclatasvir and Asunaprevir: A Pilot Study

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospectively collect cases with NHL (n=10), having HCV genotype 1b related NHL, who will be
      treated with ASV (200 mg twice daily) + DCV(60 mg once daily) for 24 weeks The patients will
      be observed and followed to determine whether there is regression of NHL after antiviral
      treatment. Conventional chemotherapy should be initiated shortly in cases without regression.

        This is an open label pilot without control group or other intervention. Participants will
        be recruited to a known intervention. Assessments will be conducted in an unblinded
        fashion. In terms of genotypes, 1b and 2a were suggested to be risk factors for the
        developing lymphoma in most HCV patients. In HCV-infected patients with splenic marginal
        zone or indolent B-cell NHL, many studies reported that combined treatment with
        interferon-alpha and ribavirin may lead to HCV clearance and concomitant regression of
        lymphomas
