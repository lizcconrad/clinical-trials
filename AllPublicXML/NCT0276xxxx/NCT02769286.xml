    <textblock>
      Treatment efficacy of osimertinib will be assessed in patients with lung cancer harboring
      activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations (cohort 1) and those harboring
      T790M (cohort 2) which were detected from circulating tumor DNA
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-label, single centre study of AZD9291 administered orally in
      patients with advanced lung cancer with activating mutations of EGFR gene with or without
      T790M which were detected from circulating tumor DNA. EGFR-TKI naïve patients with activating
      EGFR mutation will be enrolled in cohort 1. Patients with acquired resistance to prior EGFR
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) due to T790M mutation is going to be enrolled in cohort 2.

             swallow the formulated product or previous significant bowel resection that would
