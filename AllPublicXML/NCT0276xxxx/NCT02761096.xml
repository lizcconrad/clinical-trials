    <description>The acupuncture intervention will start no more than 48 hours after craniotomy and will be given once a day for 6 days (a total of 6 sessions within 8 days). It will be given in addition to conventional treatments. All interventions will be performed by one Korean Medicine doctor with over 5 years of working experience with a college education of 6 years. This doctor will be trained in the study protocol before the start of the trial.</description>

    <description>Acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and intradermal acupuncture will be performed at every session.
Sterile disposable stainless steel acupuncture needles (0.25 mm × 30 mm) will be used. Acupuncture needles will be inserted bilaterally at the following acupuncture points: LI4, LI11, PC6, ST36, GB39 and LR3, and GV20. If GV20 is close to the surgical site, this acupoint may be excluded.
An electric stimulator will be connected to the handle of each needle at LI4, LI11, ST36, and LR3 and a current of 5 Hz will be applied.
After the needles are removed, intradermal acupuncture needles with tape (DB130A; 0.25 mm × 1.5mm) will be inserted at the same acupoints (LI4, LI11, PC6, ST36, GB39, and LR3 bilaterally, and GV20) and left in place until the next session.</description>

    <description>The subjects in the control group will only receive conventional treatment. This involves general management after craniotomy in the department of neurosurgery and includes stabilizing vital signs, pain control, prevention and treatment of infections, and other IV fluid or drug therapy required based on the condition of the patient.</description>
