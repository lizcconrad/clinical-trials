      The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of injections of RBP-7000
      in subjects with stable schizophrenia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, single-center, Phase 1, single ascending dose study, designed to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single SC injection
      of low, medium and high doses of RBP-7000 in subjects with clinically stable schizophrenia
      who were not taking risperidone. The design was a sequential cohort with treatment initiated
      in 3 cohorts after safety and tolerability at a lower dose were confirmed.

      Eligible subjects received a single oral test dose of 0.25mg risperidone under medical
      supervision. Subjects who continued to be eligible were admitted to a residential unit for
      approximately 14 days, and received a single dose of RBP-7000. Subjects were discharged on
      Day 15 and returned to the clinical site weekly for approximately 10 weeks.

             last 4 weeks prior to study screening.

             prior to study screening.

          -  Subjects consuming &gt; 1 alcoholic drink per day within the last 30 days prior to study
             screening (defined as 1 oz. of 80 proof spirits, 12 oz. of beer, or 4 oz. of wine).

          -  Subjects with prior allergic reactions, sensitivities, or other known
             contraindications to any component of RBP-7000 (i.e., risperidone, poly
             [DL-lactide-co-glycolide], or N-methylpyrrolidone).

          -  Subjects with other concurrent uncontrolled illness that may have interfered with the
             ability to participate in the study.

          -  Women with a positive pregnancy test at screening. Women of childbearing potential,
             who were pregnant or lactating, seeking pregnancy, or failing to take adequate
             contraceptive precautions (e.g., an oral or injectable contraceptive, an approved
             hormonal implant or topical patch, or an intrauterine device). Should a female subject
             become sexually active, she must have agreed to use a double-barrier method or barrier
             plus spermicide. A woman of childbearing potential was defined as any female who was
             less than 2 years post-menopausal or had not undergone a hysterectomy or surgical
             sterilization, e.g., bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral ovariectomy (oophorectomy).

             (FSH) test at initial screening.

          -  Subjects with a positive urine drug screen for opioids, cocaine, amphetamines,
             methadone, marijuana, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methamphetamine, phencyclidine,
             or tricyclic antidepressants unless the positive screen was determined to be secondary
             to an allowable concomitant medication.

          -  Subjects with epilepsy or other seizure disorders, Parkinson's disease, or dementia.

          -  Subjects taking bupropion, chlorpheniramine, cimetidine, clomipramine, doxepin, or
             quinidine within the last 30 days prior to study screening.

          -  Subjects taking clozapine, phenothiazines, aripiprazole, or haloperidol within the
             last 30 days prior to study screening.

          -  Subjects taking serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine) within
             the last 30 days prior to study screening.

          -  Subjects taking medications, in addition to those listed above, which may have been
             expected to significantly interfere with the metabolism or excretion of risperidone
             and/or 9-hydroxyrisperidone that may have been associated with a significant drug
             interaction with risperidone, or may have posed a significant risk to subjects'
             participation in the study.

          -  Subjects who had been previously injected with RBP-7000 in this study. Subjects who
             were unable, in the opinion of the PI, to comply fully with the study requirements.
