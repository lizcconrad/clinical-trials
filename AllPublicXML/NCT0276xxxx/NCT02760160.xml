      To assess the effect of orally administered grape powder on the sunburn reaction in humans.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether oral grape powder will result in a reduction in biomarkers associated
      with basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Biomarkers taken from
      non-sun-exposed skin and UV-exposed skin before and after treatment will be compared.

      The ultimate goal of this study will be to generate new knowledge of the photoprotective
      effect of grape powder on UV exposure. The results may be employed as the basis for a larger
      clinical trial to evaluate the potential of grapes to prevent non-melanoma skin cancers
      (NMSCs) and sun damage.

    <measure>Number of subjects reporting protective effect against sunburn response to UVG and/or UVA1 following administration of dietary grape powder.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will be quantified by evaluation of a person's minimal erythema dose (MED), the smallest amount of ultraviolet (UV) required to achieve a sunburn response. 6 small areas of skin (2 inches by 2 inches) on the inner part of a person's arm will be exposed to 6 separate but increasing doses of UV. 24 hours after UV treatment, the area that received the smallest dose of UV and has a visible area of redness will be marked and the respective UV dose will be considered the MED. A desirable outcome would be if an individual's MED goes up after 2 weeks of grape treatment.</description>

    <measure>Measure whether dietary grape powder results in a significant (p&lt;0.05 using parire ttest) % change in markers associated with NMSC as measured by it biomarker: ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be used to quantify the percentage of stained cells using the microscope. This percentage will be compared in biopsy samples before and after grape treatment for each individual. The aggregate data will be presented using the following formula: (number of patients with a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of stained cells)/(total number of patients). Furthermore, western blot will be used to quantify the level of protein expression. The expression of each marker will be compared in each patient and the aggregate data will be presented using the following formula: (number of patients with a statistically significant decrease in expression of the respective biomarker)/(total number of patients). The percent change of each biomarker expression before and after treatment if a notable difference is observed using either IHC or western blot, or both will be calculated.</description>
