      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of change in diet quality (carbohydrate
      restriction versus fat restriction) on body composition, fat distribution, cardiometabolic
      risk factors, physical function, and quality of life in aging adults with obesity.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of change in diet quality (carbohydrate
      restriction versus fat restriction) on body composition, fat distribution, cardiometabolic
      risk factors, physical function, and quality of life in aging adults with obesity. Data from
      previous studies support the hypothesis that consumption of lower-CHO, higher-fat food
      sources rich in high-quality proteins and essential fatty acids, such as whole eggs, has
      beneficial effects on metabolic health. The study will test the hypothesis that a reduced CHO
      higher- fat, egg-rich diet induces selective depletion of total and abdominal adiposity,
      preserves lean mass, and reduces inflammation and oxidative stress. In turn, these favorable
      changes in body composition, fat distribution, and metabolic health will confer improvements
      in physical function in obese, aging adults.

      Results from this study will form an empirical basis for developing an easily implemented,
      non-pharmacologic treatment (i.e. change diet quality by incorporating more low carbohydrate,
      whole foods such as eggs) to prevent or reverse sarcopenia and other age-related diseases of
      metabolic origins.
