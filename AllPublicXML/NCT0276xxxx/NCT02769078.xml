  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this proposal is to execute a real-world database analysis to
      evaluate hospital readmissions among hospitalized nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF)
      patients in the U.S.

      <textblock>
        Patients who received any of the NOACs, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or warfarin

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a primary or secondary diagnosis of AF identified by International Classification
             of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes from the Cerner
             Health Facts hospital database between January 1, 2012 and August 31, 2014

          -  Age 18 years or older as of initial hospitalization with AF diagnosis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have any primary or secondary diagnosis code or procedure code for valvular disease
             during the study period. This exclusion criterion is consistent with that used in
             other previous BMS Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR) studies and is used
             to ensure that the study populations are NVAF patients

          -  Received multiple types of NOACs during the index hospitalization. Preliminary
             analysis showed that very few patients receive multiple types of NOACs during the same
             hospitalization. This exclusion criterion will allow to cleanly group patients into
             the different New oral anticoagulant (NOAC) usage groups
