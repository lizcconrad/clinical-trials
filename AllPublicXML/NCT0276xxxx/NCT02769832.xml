  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if Abraxane and Gemcitabine given together will
      be effective in treating small cell lung cancer that has progressed after one line of
      treatment.

      This study is designed as a second-line therapy for patients with histologically or
      cytologically confirmed small cell lung cancer. Eligible patients will receive Nab-Paclitaxel
      (Abraxane), 100 mg/m2, IV over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle followed by
      Gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2, IV over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Subjects can
      continue receiving Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity or withdrawal from the study. Tumor measurements will be done every 2 cycles.

          3. ECOG performance status 0-2

          4. Patients must have at least one measurable lesion as defined per RECIST 1.1

          5. Progression during or after prior first line chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Prior
             maintenance therapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy are allowed. Prior use of
             Rovalpituzumab is allowed. Immunotherapy or targeted therapy will not be considered as
             second line therapy.

          6. Before study therapy, a minimum of 21 days must have elapsed since any prior
             chemotherapy and 2 weeks from the last dose of prior targeted or immunotherapy.

          7. Prior definitive XRT is allowed if it has been 2 weeks since the end of definitive
             XRT. For palliative XRT, protocol-specified treatment can begin at minimum 48 hours
             after completion of radiation. Lesions within the XRT field can only be used as target
             lesions if definite progression has been demonstrated since the completion of
             radiation.

          8. Adequate major organ function including the following:

               -  Hematologic function: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1800 /mm3, platelet count
                  ≥ 100,000/mm3, and Hgb ≥ 9.0 gm/dl.

               -  Hepatic function: bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN, AST and ALT levels ≤ 2.5 x ULN. If liver
                  metastases are present, then AST and ALT ≤ 5 x ULN.

               -  Renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN.

          9. Patients must be willing and able to sign informed consent for themselves

         10. If female: childbearing potential either terminated by surgery, radiation, or
             menopause, or attenuated by use of an approved contraceptive method (intrauterine
             device [IUD], birth control pills, or barrier device) during and for 6 months after
             trial. If male, use of an approved contraceptive method during the study and 6 months
             afterwards. Females with childbearing potential must have a urine negative hCG test
             within 7 days prior to the study therapy.

             Females of child-bearing potential (defined as a sexually mature woman who (1) has not
             undergone hysterectomy [the surgical removal of the uterus] or bilateral oophorectomy
             [the surgical removal of both ovaries] or (2) has not been naturally postmenopausal
             for at least 24 consecutive months [i.e., has had menses at any time during the
             preceding 24 consecutive months]) must:

             Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on
             a monthly basis), or agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception
             without interruption, 28 days prior to starting IP therapy (including dose
             interruptions), and while on study medication or for a longer period if required by
             local regulations following the last dose of IP; and

             Have a negative serum pregnancy test (β -hCG) result at screening and agree to ongoing
             pregnancy testing during the course of the study, as per clinical judgement of the
             investigator, and after the end of study therapy. This applies even if the subject
             practices true abstinence* from heterosexual contact.

         11. Male subjects must practice true abstinence* or agree to use a condom during sexual
             contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while
             participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for 6 months following IP
             discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.

               -  True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the subject. [Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods
                  of contraception].

             surgery, or ongoing use of corticosteroids. Untreated or brain metastasis causing any
             symptoms. Treated brain metastasis must be stable for 4 weeks prior to first dose of
             study drug and not require steroids for at least 7 days prior to study treatment.

          9. Received any prior treatment with any taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel) for small cell
             lung cancer.
