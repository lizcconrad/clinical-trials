  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lab sampling for clinical trial participants can be a stressful and painful experience. Most
      trial participants will have blood drawn for lab samples at multiple study visits. The
      participants must fast for up to ten hours before the blood sampling, in many cases, and
      patients often report a painful experience if more than one venipuncture occurs. In addition,
      the number of collection tubes can increase the anxiety level of the patient and the
      phlebotomist.

      This project proposes to evaluate if essential oil aromatherapy results in less pain and /or
      anxiety when compared to usual care.

      The process of drawing blood for can be painful and stressful for any patient. Those patients
      who participate in a clinical trial agree to frequent lab sampling to monitor for effect and
      safety of the investigational product. The frequency is variable, from several times a day
      for a participant in the hospital to annually for some trials. Participants have reported
      anxiety regarding the number of tubes to be drawn, even resulting in near syncope, and pain
      with the venipuncture process.

      The clinical trial nurses at HealthEast have utilized a variety of therapeutic techniques to
      ease the pain and anxiety experienced by the trial subjects, such as redirection, deep
      breathing, hand massage and guided imagery. These techniques have not been evaluated for
      effectiveness in easing pain and anxiety nor have they been compared with no intervention to
      determine if any intervention was more efficacious in alleviating pain and/or anxiety.

      The primary objective of this study is determine if aromatherapy with an essential oil has a
      higher reported effect in anxiety and pain relief with venipunctures than standard of care
      (no therapy) among participants in HealthEast Clinical Trials Office studies.

      Secondary objectives include comparing the number of venipunctures and blood collection tubes
      in the treatment arms.

      This is a randomized, open label, prospective single site study designed to determine the
      effect of essential oil aromatherapy compared to usual care on pain and anxiety associated
      with venipunctures for clinical trial participants in the HealthEast Heart Care Clinic.

    <description>The participants randomized to aromatherapy will be offered one of three essential oils, 'applied' to their smell zone via cotton ball that are known to have anti-anxiety effect. These are:
ginger
calming
lavender The participant's choice will be documented in a database. The participant can chose an oil each time (i.e., they are not bound to use only the first choice oil). Pain and anxiety will be measured prior to receiving the essential oils and again after the phlebotomy procedure. Blood pressure and pulse will also be measured post-phlebotomy.</description>
