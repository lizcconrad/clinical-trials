  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children referred for routine EEG studies for suspected absence seizures will be asked, upon
      caregiver's informed consent, to perform 3 minutes of hyperventilation both in the supine
      position and while sitting up. We aim to demonstrate that hyperventilation is more effective
      in eliciting absence seizures in a sitting position than while lying down.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperventilation is a very effective means of eliciting absence seizures in children with
      absence epilepsy. Worldwide EEG protocols for routine EEG recording include 3 minutes of
      hyperventilation. The whole EEG recording, including hyperventilation, is performed with the
      child lying down on a bed/coach. Our clinical experience suggests that the body position may
      affect the yield of hyperventilation in provoking the absence event. That is,
      hyperventilation may be more effective when the child is sitting up, Therefore, children
      referred for a routine EEG for suspected absence seizures will add 3 minutes of
      hyperventilation on a sitting position to the routine 3 minutes of supine hyperventilation.
      At least 5 minutes of rest will be allotted between both procedures.

      Patients' caregivers will sign an informed consent form. Patients will randomly be divided
      into 2 groups: one group will first perform supine hyperventilation followed by sitting
      hyperventilation; the second group will perform hyperventilation in the opposite order, ie,
      first sitting up and then in supine position.
