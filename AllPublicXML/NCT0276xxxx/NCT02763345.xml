  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community Case Management (CCM) is a clinical decision aid used by frontline Health
      Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) in Malawi to manage uncomplicated cases of pneumonia and
      malaria (amongst other conditions). Children identified has having complicated illness are
      urgently referred to larger health facilities better equipped to clinically manage these more
      complex presentations. There is evidence to suggest HSAs are missing opportunities to refer
      seriously ill children, and parents/caregivers are failing to comply with urgent referral
      recommendations when given; reducing the overall effectiveness of the CCM strategy. Use of
      mobile technology for deploying CCM has been demonstrated in prior research as feasible to
      evaluate, acceptable to health workers and parents/caregivers and improving health worker
      fidelity to the guidelines, but it is unknown if this translates into increased referral and
      referral completion rates. This trial seeks to evaluate the added value of a purpose
      developed mobile solution for CCM, called Supporting LIFE electronic Community Case
      Management (SL eCCM App) on HSA referral and parent/caregiver health seeking behavior.

    <description>Children are assessed and treated according to the WHO and UNICEFs paper-based Community Case Management decision aid for Malawi for a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 7-weeks. Clinical assessment is guided by the paper-based 'Sick Child Form' presented in English, and clinical data is recorded by Health Surveillance Assistants manually in the Village Clinic Register.</description>

    <description>Health Surveillance Assistants use the Supporting LIFE electronic Community Case Management App (SL eCCM App) deployed on a smartphone and replicating paper-based CCM guidelines to assess and treat children in conjunction with standard care, for a minimum of 2-weeks and maximum of 7-weeks. Clinical data is recorded in both the SL eCCM App and Village Clinic Register.</description>
