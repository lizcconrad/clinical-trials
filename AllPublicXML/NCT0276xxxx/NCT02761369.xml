  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The neurobiological underpinnings of obesity point to brain asymmetry in cortical and deeper
      brain regions. Furthermore, chemical, structural and functional imbalance in cortical and
      sub-cortical brain regions alters reward processing, attentional control and self-regulation
      in food-addicted obese individuals. In this study the investigators use TMS with a special
      multichannel H-coil developed by their lab to safely stimulate cortical and deeper brain
      regions in obese humans. The investigators aim to produce interhemispheric neuroplasticity
      (INP) using a paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol over the DLPFC, to restore
      neurobiological functioning, alleviate food addiction symptoms, and promote weight loss.
