  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether maintaining an apical patency causes
      postoperative pain in posterior teeth with necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apical patency (AP) is a procedure that prevents accumulation of soft and hard tissue debris
      within the cement canal. However, some RCTs indicate that maintaining an AP causes
      postoperative pain, whilst some RCTs pointed out there is no difference in terms of pain when
      AP has been performed. We, therefore, would like to conduct a RCT to increase the sample size
      of the previously performed RCTs to do an systematic review.

    <description>Endodontic treatment was performed in posterior teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical periodontitis using a reciprocating single-file system (Reciproc). Local anesthesia was provided (2% Novocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine), isolation with rubber dam and standard access cavity preparation was done.Using 2.5 % sodium hypochlorite, canal negotiation was done &amp; apical patency was achieved with #10 K-files in patency group after determining working length. Coronal flaring with # 2 and #3 Gates-Glidden drills was done. The canals were obturated with gutta-percha and epoxy resin sealer. The treatments were carried out in one-visit.</description>
