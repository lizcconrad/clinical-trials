      This study is designed to identify patients' features predictive of difficult endotracheal
      intubation using a flexible fiberscope.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation is an important act in the practice of anesthesiology. Direct
      laryngoscopy is the most commonly used technique to accomplish this task. Airway
      characteristics predicting difficult intubation with direct laryngoscopy are well defined.
      Physical findings, such as Mallampati classification or measurements of the thyromental
      distance, mouth opening, and neck extension have been validated to help anticipate difficult
      situations with the direct laryngoscope. When direct laryngoscopy is difficult, early
      conversion to an alternative technique reduces the risk of airway compromise and associated
      morbidity.

      Many alternative intubation devices are now available, and part of the anesthesiologist's
      task is to select the alternative approach best suited to each patient's specific features.
      Despite its use for both elective and unexpectedly difficult intubation, predictive criteria
      for successful airway management with the flexible fiberscope have not been developed.

      The purpose of this study is to identify patient morphometric or morphological
      characteristics, if any, that could predict difficult intubation when using the flexible
      fiberscope for perioperative tracheal intubation in an elective surgical population.

    <description>To calculate the Intubation Difficulty Scale the following variables will be collected: number of attempts, number of operators, necessity to use an alternative intubation technique, glottic visualization and effort needed to obtain optimal view of the glottis, necessity of external laryngeal pressure and vocal cords position during intubation.</description>

    <description>Characteristics of patients will be assessed before induction of general anesthesia
Glottic visualization will be evaluated by direct laryngoscopy.
The endotracheal tube will be loaded onto the scope after silicon spray lubrication
Intubation will be performed with the flexible fiberscope with the patient in supine position with head and neck in neutral position
With the tip of the fiberscope in satisfactory position, the endotracheal tube will be advanced into the trachea. The scope will then be removed.
Accurate positioning of the endotracheal tube will be confirmed by capnography and lung auscultation.</description>
