    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of 10 to 12 individuals receiving 60 mg of sustained release
      dexamphetamine will be studied. These individuals have received this medication before in a
      previous trial where the pharmacodynamics were investigated. This trial will last 5
      consecutive days during which blood samples will be drawn for pharmacokinetics analyses.
      Dried blood spots will also be collected for the clinical validation of the bioanalytical
      method wherein these are used.
