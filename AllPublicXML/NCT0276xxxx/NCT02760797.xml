  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter study designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and therapeutic activity of emactuzumab and RO7009789 administered in
      combination in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are not
      amenable to standard treatment. This study will be conducted in two parts: a dose-finding
      stage (Part I) and an expansion stage (Part II).
