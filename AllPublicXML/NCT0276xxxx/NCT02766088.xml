    <description>All participants will have an enrolment visit with collection of a blood sample and a termination contact/visit. Participants or their parents/guardians will be contacted weekly or every two weeks to monitor the occurrence of febrile episodes. Additional visits will be made if febrile episodes occur. In case of dengue suspicion, a blood sample will be collected.</description>
