      This is a 24-month study to assess copper (Cu) parameters in subjects with Wilson Disease
      treated with standard of care (SOC) medications. Data will be collected during routinely
      scheduled Wilson Disease clinic visits at approximately 6-month intervals.

      After providing informed consent, subjects meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria
      will be enrolled into the study as outpatients. Subject's routine Wilson Disease clinic
      visits will be scheduled according to the standard clinical practice at the study center and
      at the discretion of the treating physician at approximate 6-month intervals.

      At the time of enrollment, subjects will be receiving SOC therapeutic agents for the
      treatment of Wilson Disease. If treatment is interrupted or stopped during the course of the
      study, subjects will continue in the study and biological samples and clinical data will
      continue to be collected for the full 24-month study period. Dosing with SOC agents, which
      can include penicillamine, trientine, zinc, or a combination of a Cu chelator and zinc, will
      be individualized and managed by the treating physician at the study center according to
      standard clinical practice at the site.

          -  Male or female subjects, aged 18 years or older as of signing the ICF.

          -  Receiving Standard of Care therapeutic agents (penicillamine, trientine, zinc, or
