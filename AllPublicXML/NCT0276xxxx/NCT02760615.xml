    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate in a step-wise approach the disease drug-drug
      interaction (DDI) potential for vedolizumab to indirectly affect the exposure of cytochrome
      P-450 (CYP) substrate drugs by modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines in participants with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) who are treated with vedolizumab.

      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab, which is being tested to assess
      the possibility of drug-drug interactions when administered with other medications. The study
      will comprise of 2 parallel parts: Part 1 and Part 2.

      Part 1 will enroll approximately 40 participants: 20 healthy participants and 20 participants
      with UC or CD who are not currently being treated with vedolizumab. All participants will
      receive the following medications:

        -  Caffeine 100 mg

        -  Losartan 50 mg

        -  Omeprazole 20 mg

        -  Dextromethorphan 30 mg

        -  Midazolam 2 mg

      Part 2 will enroll approximately 20 participants on established vedolizumab intravenous (IV)
      maintenance treatment of 300 mg for the treatment of UC or CD. Participants will receive the
      same medications and dosages as in Part 1 in addition to their scheduled vedolizumab 300 mg
      IV.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. For Part 1 and Part 2,
      participants will arrive at study unit for check-in (Day -1) and will return to the study
      unit for dosing and PK assessment on Day 1 and study exit on Day 2 or will be kept from
      Check-in through at least 24 hours after dosing for safety and PK assessments before
      discharge. The total confinement period (optional) will be up to 3 days for both the parts.
      The overall time to participate for each participant in Part 1 will be approximately 6 weeks
      and for Part 2, it will be approximately 12 weeks.
