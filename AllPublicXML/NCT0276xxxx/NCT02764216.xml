  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal treatment of HNCUP remains controversial and lacks evidence from prospective
      randomized trials. The management of these patients relies primarily on surgery and
      radiotherapy. The role of radiotherapy in sterilizing putative mucosal sites remains
      controversial. The main debate concerns the extent of the radiation field. Although
      pan-mucosal irradiation from the nasopharynx to the hypopharynx and bilateral neck nodes
      reduces the risk of emergence of a mucosal primary or a nodal relapse, it has been associated
      with significant toxicity and long-term morbidity (mostly xerostomia and dysphagia). Most
      single institution retrospective studies have not shown any advantage for more extensive
      irradiation.Therefore, elective mucosal irradiation may might be appropriate only for these
      patients.
