  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of prospective cohort study is to describe the developmental profile of
      refraction change in a large cohort of Chinese CC patients. The decisive factors to the range
      of myopic shift in unilateral CC appeared to be different from that in bilateral CC,
      indicating dramatic differences in the etiopathogenesis and refractive prognosis between
      bilateral and unilateral CC.

      The refractive status is crucial to visual function and may change throughout life. For
      patients with congenital cataract (CC), the developmental profile of refraction is
      complicated due to the potential influences of diverse clinical manifestations and various
      treatments, and has not yet been fully characterized.

      The investigator described the developmental profile of refraction change in a large cohort
      of Chinese CC patients. The decisive factors to the range of myopic shift in unilateral CC
      appeared to be different from that in bilateral CC, indicating dramatic differences in the
      etiopathogenesis and refractive prognosis between bilateral and unilateral CC. The refraction
      data from CC patients provided in the study are of clinical significance to the guidelines
      for CC treatment, especially for IOL calculation concerning the laterality of CC.

        Patients with CC were enrolled from the Childhood Cataract Program of the Chinese Ministry
        of Health (CCPMOH). The study involved 1,164 participants (6,585 persontimes) enrolled from
        Jan 2010 to Oct 2015. Cataract removal and/or intraocular lens (IOL) implantation were
        conducted by two experienced cataract surgeons for participants.
