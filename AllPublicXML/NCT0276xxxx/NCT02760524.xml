      The major goal of this study is to determine whether Neuro-Emotional Technique is a viable
      treatment option for decreasing distress in cancer patients. The potential advantages of NET
      are: 1) it is designed specifically to address distressing stimuli and unresolved emotional
      memories; 2) it is a brief, time-limited intervention; and 3) its multi-modal design may
      appeal to and benefit a broader range of patients than a single mode intervention

             section 4.2.3.

          -  Received a cancer diagnosis at least 6 months prior to being contacted for
             participation in this study

        Exclusion Criteria:
