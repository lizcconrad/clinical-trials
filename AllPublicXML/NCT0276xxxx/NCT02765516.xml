  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to utilize information on associations between genetic
      predisposition pertaining to multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the degree
      of responsiveness of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering to plant sterols
      (PS). The predictive potential of SNPs associated with PS responsiveness will be evaluated
      using a randomized human intervention trial examining responsiveness of lowering blood LDL-C
      levels to PS intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On average plant sterol (PS) consumption of 2-3 grams a day leads to a ~10% decrease in
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, inter-individual response to PS
      consumption varies, with some individuals showing low or no reductions in LDL-C levels, while
      some even showing an increase in levels. Determining factors that predict the direction of
      response of LDL-C to PS would be helpful in identifying individuals who should consume PS and
      individuals who should seek another method of treating hypercholesterolemia. The objective of
      this research proposal is to test the a priori predictive potential of a combination of three
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), i.e., genosets, previously associated with response
      to PS in a post-hoc manner. A clinical trial with a priori recruitment of participants based
      on genoset which will test LDL-C response to PS consumption using a randomized, double blind,
      placebo controlled crossover design is proposed.
