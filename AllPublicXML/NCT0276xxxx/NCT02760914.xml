      The aims of the present project are to study possible differences in inflammatory gene
      expression and protein secretion in various compartments of adipose tissue being exposed
      during open cardiac surgery in patients with coronary heart disease undergoing coronary
      artery bypass surgery.

      The present study is observational with biochemical end-points to disclose inflammatory
      mechanisms in various compartments of adipose tissue in patients with coronary heart disease
      (CHD) compared to patients without significant CHD. Fifty patients with CHD undergoing
      coronary artery bypass surgery with open chest procedure will be included and 20 patients
      with valve disease without overt CHD undergoing open valve surgery will serve as a control
      group. No specific restrictions to inclusion other than lack of consent to participate after
      written and oral information are listed. In patients undergoing open heart surgery for CHD,
      representative peri-operative biopsies from epicardial, pericardial and subcutaneous fat will
      be gathered, carefully processed and deep-frozen to 80 degrees of frost for later analyses on
      histological/cellular components and on messenger ribonucleic acid for selected inflammatory
      variables. Simultaneously, blood samples (arterial blood at start of operation) will be
      collected, processed and deep-frozen at 80 degrees of frost for later analyses of relevant
      circulating inflammatory variables to correlation analyses with tissue samples, possibly also
      PaxGene tubes for messenger ribonucleic acid in circulating leukocytes.

      The study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and in accordance with
      approval from the Regional Ethics Committee.
