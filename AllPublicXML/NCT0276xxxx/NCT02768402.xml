      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and performance of the Caisson
      Interventional Transcatheter MitralValve Replacement (TMVR) system for the treatment of
      severe symptomatic MitralValve Regurgitation (MR).

    <textblock>
      The treatment guidelines for valvular heart disease indicate that surgical correction of
      primary mitral valve regurgitation (MR) is a Class I recommendation. Further, recent evidence
      indicates that valve replacement is at least as effective as repair in both primary and
      secondary MR patients. However, many patients are not referred for surgery as they are
      considered to be too high of a risk to undergo on pump, open-heart procedures. Percutaneous
      aortic valve replacement has made treatment of stenosed aortic valves available to high-risk
      surgical patients who would have otherwise been medically managed. Percutaneous mitral valve
      (MV) replacement offers similar advantages. Currently, the only approved percutaneous
      treatment for MR is MitraClip. MitraClip is limited to a specific population of high risk
      surgical patients with valvular prolapses that are amenable to repair by the edge to edge
      technique. The feasibility of percutaneous MV replacement has been shown in animal studies,
      the implantation of aortic valves at the mitral position, and early evaluations of purpose
      made transcatheter MVs in humans. To meet this medical need, Caisson Interventional has
      developed a percutaneous delivery system for a bioprosthetic mitral valve. As with patients
      with aortic valve (AV) deficiencies, this device can be used to provide needed therapy to
      patients who might not otherwise receive treatment beyond medical therapy. This study will
      provide initial information on the safety and performance of this system.
