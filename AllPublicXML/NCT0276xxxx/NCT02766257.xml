  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long surgical wait-times and limited hospital capacity are common obstacles to surgical care
      in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Ambulatory surgery might offer a solution to
      these problems. The aim is to study the introduction of ambulatory surgery in a pediatric
      hospital in SSA.

      This is a cross-sectional descriptive study which took place over 6 months. It includes all
      the patients assigned to ambulatory surgery in the Pediatric University Hospital in
      Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
