  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, multicenter, open label, and non-randomized clinical study on adult
      participants with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The study will be conducted in two
      phases. Pre-screening phase will assess the BRAF V600 mutation in a new mutation analysis
      triggered by a mutant plasma cfDNA test result. Treatment phase will assess the clinical
      outcome for the participants treated with vemurafenib plus cobimetinib. The length of the
      study will be approximately 38 months.
