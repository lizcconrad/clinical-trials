  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outcome of patients with relapsed or refractory adult T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia
      (T-ALL) and the related disease T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) is extremely poor with 30%
      of the patients responding to first salvage therapy and long-term survival of only 10%.
      Therefore, novel therapies for patients with relapsed/refractory T-ALL/LBL represent an unmet
      clinical need.

      Recent data provide strong evidence that CXCR4 signaling plays a major role in T-cell
      leukemia cell maintenance and leukemia initiating activity, and targeting CXCR4 signaling in
      T-ALL cells reduces tumor growth in an animal model. In this study, the investigators propose
      that the addition of BL-8040 to nelarabine as a salvage therapy for patients with
      relapsed/refractory T-ALL/LBL will result in a higher CR rate than nelarabine alone without
      an increase in toxicity and will allow patients to proceed to a potentially curative
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant.

                  oophorectomy must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure or
                  confirmed by an ultrasound. Tubal ligation must be confirmed with medical records
                  of the actual procedure.

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign an IRB-approved written informed consent
             document.

             preceding 2 weeks.

          -  Active CNS involvement with leukemia

          -  Active HIV or hepatitis B or C infection.

          -  Any medical condition which, in the opinion of the clinical investigator, would
             interfere with the evaluation of the patient. Subjects with a clinically significant
             or unstable medical or surgical condition or any other condition that cannot be
             well-controlled by the allowed medications permitted in the study protocol that would
             preclude safe and complete study participation, as determined by medical history,
             physical examinations, laboratory tests, and according to the investigator's judgment.
