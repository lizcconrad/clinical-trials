  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/2, dose-escalation and dose expansion study of a
      CXCR4 inhibitor, USL311, alone and in combination with lomustine in subjects with advanced
      solid tumors (Phase 1) and subjects with relapsed/recurrent GBM (Phase 2). The study is
      designed to explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of
      USL311 alone and in combination with lomustine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All Subjects:

         13. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of GBM

         14. Subjects must have documented recurrence after first-line treatment

             treatment and/or radiotherapy either within 14 days prior to first dose of study
             drug(s) or have not recovered (to grade ≤ 1) from all clinically significant
             toxicities related to prior therapies

          2. Subjects who have had any major surgery (not including re-resection surgery required
             in Phase 2) within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug(s), or minor surgery
             within 14 days prior to first day of study drug(s)

          3. Subjects taking any protocol prohibited medications within 14 days prior to initiating
             study drug(s) treatment

          4. Subjects who have been treated with an investigational agent or investigational
             interventional device within 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug(s)

          5. History of significant cardiac disease

          6. Pregnant or breastfeeding

          7. Any other significant co-morbid conditions that in the opinion of the Investigator
             would impair study participation or cooperation
