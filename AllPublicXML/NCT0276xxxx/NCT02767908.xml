  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is proposed to build on the investigators demonstration of the
      effectiveness of default delivery of smoking interventions in hospital inpatients by testing
      a multi-component intervention to prevent relapse to smoking after hospital discharge. The
      proposed intervention is designed to integrate easily with existing services, and hence be
      widely implemented if shown to be effective

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators analysis of electronic primary care records has recently estimated that
      approximately 1.1 million smokers are admitted to English hospitals every year . Every one of
      these admissions represents a prime opportunity to intervene to promote smoking cessation,
      particularly since most smokers abstain from smoking while in hospital. Recent NICE guidance
      (PH48) recommends that smoking cessation interventions should be provided in routine care
      pathways for all smokers admitted to hospital; The Investigators earlier work (Evaluation of
      the impact of a systematic delivery of cessation interventions on delivery of smoking
      cessation in secondary care. REC Reference Number:10/H0403/34) in this Programme
      (RP-PG-0608-10020) has demonstrated that default delivery of cessation support to all smokers
      in hospital significantly increases uptake of support and doubles the proportion of smokers
      who quit long term. Clinical experience indicates that many smokers admitted to hospital,
      particularly those with an illness caused or exacerbated by smoking, are motivated not to
      smoke again after discharge but are also likely to be heavily dependent on smoking and in
      many cases are disabled by lung or heart disease, socially isolated, and socio-economically
      deprived. On leaving hospital, many participants returned to a home environment where smoking
      has been an integral part of daily life for many years. It is therefore not surprising that
      whilst many participants managed to stay smoke-free during their hospital stay, relapse after
      discharge is common.

      The Investigators previous study, among smokers who received care similar to that now
      recommended by NICE, 62% of participants abstinent at discharge had relapsed by 4 weeks, and
      81% by 6 months. The Investigators hypothesise that many of these relapses could be prevented
      by interventions that help to sustain cessation and the maintenance of smoke-free home after
      discharge.

      The investigators therefore propose to test the effectiveness of an intensive home support
      intervention for newly-abstinent smokers leaving hospital and involving home visits to
      support cessation and establishment of a smoke-free home; ensure receipt and correct use of
      smoking cessation pharmacotherapy; deliver behavioural support or else, where local services
      are preferred, transfer to local community Stop Smoking Services (SSS).

    <description>Participants in the usual care group will be offered and, if accepted, provided with smoking cessation support that meets the recommendations of NICE PH48 guidance including pharmacotherapy and behavioural support before leaving hospital, referral to NHS SSS for continued care after discharge, and ascertainment of smoking status at 4 weeks; participants will also be asked to consent to smoking status ascertainment at three months. Those who report cessation at 4 weeks and/or three months will be requested to agree to a home visit for CO validation. All will be asked at four weeks and 3 months to list the cessation support, in terms of pharmacotherapy and behavioural support from local or other services, delivered since the last contact.</description>

    <description>A home visit will be carried out as soon as practicable after discharge and typically within 48 hours, to deliver a multi-component intervention. Intervention components all have an existing evidence base proving or suggesting potential efficacy for smoking cessation and/or relapse prevention, though their feasibility and importance when delivered as a combined package have not been tested.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a tailored support package which will include; Nicotine replacement products, behavioural support, including telephone support, Carbon dioxide measurements, home air quality measurements, signposting to support groups, and self-help materials.For participants who decline a home visit, the above support options will be offered as far as possible through telephone contact and delivered to the extent accepted by the participant. Those who report cessation at 4 weeks and/or three months will be requested to agree to a home visit for CO validation.</description>
