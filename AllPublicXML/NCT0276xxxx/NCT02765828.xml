  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to determine if tongue strength and tongue ultrasound
      measurements differentiates patients with untreated late-onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) from
      patients with acquires/hereditary myopathies or neuropathies. It is hypothesized that
      abnormalities in tongue function and structure in patients with LOPD may be useful in
      discriminating this condition from others that have similar presentations.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal lingual (tongue) strength measured via manual muscle testing (MMT) measured via ordinal scale (see description)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Lingual strength will be rated with a validated 0-4 ordinal scale.
Score Description
0 - Normal strength, no weakness.
- Mild weakness. The tongue can be overcome with effort.
- Moderate weakness. Easy to overcome.
- Minimal movement. Unable to protrude to either side.
- No movement detected.</description>

    <measure>Echo intensity measured with ultrasound assessment utilizing grayscale analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Comprises part of assessment of lingual (tongue) structure via qualitative tongue ultrasound assessment. Echo intensity measurements consist of drawing a box over subcutaneous tissue and muscle areas of interest using the grayscale histogram function. This number will be recorded along with the standard deviation (grayscale analysis).</description>
