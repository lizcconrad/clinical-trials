      Diagnosis of lesions of pancreas, the upper gastrointestinal tract, as well as adjacent
      structures, such as lymph nodes, is still showing advancements especially with the increased
      use of endoscopic ultrasound. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration and fine
      needle biopsy (EUS-FNA/FNB) have become mainstay diagnostic techniques for these lesions. The
      purpose of the study is to compare between the currently used, ProCore needles and the new
      biopsy needle, SharkCore, for the histological diagnosis and evaluation of lesions.

      Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration and fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNA/FNB) have
      become mainstay diagnostic techniques for the diagnosis and evaluation of lesions of the
      pancreas, the upper gastrointestinal tract, as well as adjacent structures, including lymph
      nodes. Cytology specimens provided from FNA cannot fully characterize certain neoplasms such
      as lymphomas or mesenchymal tumors. Core biopsy specimens for histological examinations are
      needed to provide accurate diagnoses.

      ProCore needles (ProCore, Wilson-Cook Medical Inc. Winston-Salem, NC) were designed to obtain
      histological and cytological samples. Studies comparing ProCore needles with standard FNA
      needles showed no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, histological core tissue
      procurement or mean number of passes.

      To overcome the above mentioned limitations (mainly suboptimal core tissue procurement
      rates), a new novel SharkCore needle (Beacon Endoscopic, Newton, MA, USA) has been designed
      and approved for clinical human use by the FDA.

      The objective of the study is to compare the new EUS guided histology biopsy needle SharkCore
      to the currently used EUS histology needle, ProCore, for the histological diagnosis and
      evaluation of lesions.

    <description>General anesthesia or conscious sedation will be started and an upper endoscopic ultrasound will be inserted into the participants mouth and advanced to the site of the lesion. The lesion will be punctured by the ProCore needle, then the stylet is completely removed, and negative suction pressure is applied using a 10 ml syringe for 30 seconds while the needle is stationary with the target. Then, the needle is moved back and forth several times within the target, utilizing the fanning technique. Finally, suction is released by closing the lock of the syringe and the needle is removed.</description>
