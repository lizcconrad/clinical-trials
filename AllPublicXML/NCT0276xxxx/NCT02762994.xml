    <textblock>
      BCD-085-2 is a next step in clinical investigation of BCD-085. BCD-085 is a monoclonal
      antibody to interleukin 17. During BCD-085-2 trial patients with moderate to severe plaque
      psoriasis, in whom poor response to previous treatment including UV-therapy and biologic
      drugs was registered, will receive 40, 80 or 120 mg of BCD-085 subcutaneously at weeks 0, 1,
      2, 4, 6, 8, 10. Efficacy and safety parameters will be evaluated.
