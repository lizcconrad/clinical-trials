    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify a suitable dosing regimen of IV baclofen to serve as
      a temporary substitute for an oral regimen.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Baclofen intravenous solution 2 mg/mL will be manufactured and provided by Allaysis, LLC.
      Prism Clinical Research will purchase oral baclofen tablets (10 mg) from a commercial
      supplier. Subject will start baclofen at a 5 mg oral dose every 8 hours. Oral baclofen will
      be increased incrementally and self-administered over 13 days to a maximum dose of 20 mg
      every 8 hours. Subjects will be crossed over to 16 mg intravenous baclofen infused over 120
      (n=6) or 150 (n=6) minutes every 8 hours for 11 doses. Subjects will be changed back to oral
      baclofen at a 15 mg dose self-administered every 8 hours and tapered off of baclofen over 15
      days. Following the completion of this group of 12 subjects, the remaining 30 subjects will
      receive IV baclofen at the infusion duration that best meets the criteria for bioequivalence.

    <time_frame>2 dosing intervals (total of 16 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate and confirm selected infusion rates of IV baclofen which best achieve bioequivalence to oral baclofen at steady state in healthy adults.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants experiencing sedation due to the treatment measured by the sanford sleepiness scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Over the course of the intervention (~3 months) subjects will be assessed using the Modified Sanford sleepiness scale prior to the first and second intravenous drug administration then every 30 minutes for four hours after drug administration. If this assessment shows that the subject is not at their baseline, assessments will continue every 30 minutes until the subject has returned to the baseline function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants experiencing nystagmus due to the treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Over the course of the intervention (~3 months) subjects will be assessed using the following rating scale and definitions of ataxia and nystagmus prior to the first and second intravenous drug administrations then every 30 minutes for four hours after drug administration. If this assessment shows that the subject is not at their baseline, assessments will continue every 30 minutes until the subject has returned to the baseline function.
Nystagmus:
0 = None
mild - present only on extreme gaze (beyond 45 degrees lateral gaze)
severe - present on neutral to 45 degrees lateral gaze</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants experiencing ataxia due to the treatment measured by tandem gait</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Over the course of the intervention (~3 months) subjects will be assessed using the following rating scale and definitions of ataxia and nystagmus prior to the first and second intravenous drug administrations then every 30 minutes for four hours after drug administration. If this assessment shows that the subject is not at their baseline, assessments will continue every 30 minutes until the subject has returned to the baseline function.
Ataxia: For those who are ambulatory, this will be assessed by gait. Ratings will be: 0=none
Mild - unsteady with tandem gait testing, but able to perform without assistance
Severe - unable to perform gait testing without assistance. For non-ambulatory subjects, ataxia will be assessed by finger to nose and finger pursuit maneuvers.</description>
