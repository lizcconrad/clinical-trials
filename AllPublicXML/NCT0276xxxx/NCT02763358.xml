      This study is designed to test the usability of the Bite Counter in an attempt to reduce
      participants' daily bites while also increasing their daily steps.

    <textblock>
      Self-monitoring is an important component of behavioral management of obesity. The Bite
      Counter is a wrist-worn device which detects the motions characteristic of taking a bite of
      food or a drink of liquid, to provide the wearer with a cumulative count of bites and sips
      over the day. In earlier studies the method was shown to accurately count bites across a wide
      variety of foods, utensils and subject demographics, and to provide an unbiased intake
      measurement. The proposed work will continue to improve the bite counting method by adapting
      to varying eating rates, develop a self-managed bite count-based weight loss protocol, and
      perform an independent test of the protocol. An improved Bite Counter device will also
      measure activity (steps).

    <description>This study is a 15-week assessment of the possible utility of a wrist-worn device, the Bite Counter, in assisting the weight loss behavior change efforts of overweight and obese individuals. The Bite Counter tracks and analyzes wrist motions to identify those associated with taking bites of food and drinking beverages. It also has a step-counter feature. This study is designed to determine if using the Bite Counter with specific goals to reduce the numbers of bites and increase the numbers of steps will result in those changes.</description>
