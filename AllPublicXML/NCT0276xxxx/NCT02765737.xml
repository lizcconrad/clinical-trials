               6. 2 burn areas, each with a minimum size of 16cm2 (burn areas may be two separate
                  burns or within one large burn, see Section 9.4.2)

          2. Age ≥ 12 months and ≤ 70 years

          2. Patient criteria that will make patient ineligible for enrollment:

               1. Ventilator dependence

               2. Active malignant disease or patient is less than 1 year disease-free

               3. Use of immunosuppressive agents, radiation or chemotherapy within the past 30
