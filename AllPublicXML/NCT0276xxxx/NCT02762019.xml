  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with cancer undergoing intensive chemotherapy (CT) regimens experience many side
      effects among which oral mucositis (OM) is one of the most debilitating. Modifications of
      CT's schedule and prolonged hospitalization may be necessary in presence of OM, causing poor
      general conditions and debilitation. Moreover, the use of narcotic analgesics and total
      parenteral nutrition may be required, triggering not only a physical deficit but also an
      economic burden. Despite the frequency and impact of OM among children with cancer, there is
      no consensus on standard therapy for this condition. Previous studies demonstrated that high
      power laser therapy can help the maintenance of nutritional status in patients with OM and
      can remarkably reduce costs/resources needed. Laser therapy has evidence of efficacy in
      reducing symptoms and in preventing the onset of OM in adult cancer patients but only one
      randomized controlled trial, with a limited number of children enrolled, supports its use in
      children for treatment of OM induced by chemotherapy.

      This multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial evaluates the efficacy of laser for
      treatment of oral mucositis secondary to chemotherapy in children aged 3-17 years.

      The study involves 8 italian hospitals.
