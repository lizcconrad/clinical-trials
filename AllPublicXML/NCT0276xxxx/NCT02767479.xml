  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients infected with H. pylori are treated with rabeprazole 10 mg bid, AMPC 750 mg bid and
      CAM 200 mg bid or esomeprazole 20 mg bid, AMPC 750 mg bid and CAM 200 mg bid. Eradication
      rates are compared. Patients who have ever failed in eradication by CAM-based regimen are
      treated with rabeprazole 10 mg bid, AMPC 750 mg bid and MNZ 250 mg bid or esomeprazole 20 mg
      bid, AMPC 750 mg bid and MNZ 250 mg bid.

      bid, AMPC 750 mg bid and MNZ 250 mg bid. CYP2C19 genotypes and susceptibility to CAM are
      genetically measured. Other factors are also analyzed with reference to eradication rates.

    <measure>influence of CYP2C19 genotypes on the eradication rates of H. pylori</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>influence of CYP2C19 genotypes on the eradication rates of H. pylori are analyzed. CYP2C19 genotypes are classified to the three groups, rapid metabolizer (RM), intermiediate metabolizer (IM) and Poor metabolizer (PM). Because esomperazole is metabolized by CYP2C19, the effects of esomeprazole is influenced by genotypes of CYP2C19. The eradication rates in RMs, IMs and PMs are compared.</description>
