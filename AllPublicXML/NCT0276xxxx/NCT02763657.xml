  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children's understanding of linear-order (e.g., Dan is taller than Lisa, Lisa is taller than
      Jess) and set-inclusion (i.e., All tulips are flowers, All flowers are plants) relationships
      is critical for the acquisition of deductive reasoning, that is, the ability to reach
      logically valid conclusions from given premises. Behavioral and neuroimaging studies in
      adults suggest processing differences between these relations: While arguments that involve
      linear-orders may be preferentially associated with spatial processing, arguments that
      involve set-inclusions may be preferentially associated with verbal processing. In this
      study, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how and when these
      processing differences appear in children from 8 to 14.
