  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 56 patients completed a previous study regarding non-operative treatment for acute
      achilles tendon rupture. This study consists of an additional follow up after 4-5 years
      depending on original date of injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 patients suffering from acute Achilles tendon rupture was originally randomized to each
      arm, and followed up after 6 and 12 months. Of these a total of 56 patients was included in
      the final analysis, and invited to participate in this additional follow-up, 4-5 years after
      their original injury. Originally patients was monitored using: ATRS questionnaires, ATRA:
      Achilles Tendon Resting Angle, Heel Raise Work: number of lifts, lift height and total work,
      and tests of strength and stiffness in the ankle using a kinetic dynamometer.

    <time_frame>Test is performed once, 4-5 years after the initial injury</time_frame>
    <description>The total work (joules), max height of lift (mm) and number of lifts is recorded. THe patient is placed standing on one leg on a platform tilted 10 degrees (heel below toes), and is asked to lift the heel (and thereby bodyweight) as high as possible, once every 2 seconds. When the patient can no longer maintain height or pace, the test is finished.</description>

    <description>Ankle immobilized with orthosis (DJO Nextep Contour 2 Walker) with 3 1.5 cm wedges in the heel, fixing the angle between 20-30 degrees. The orthosis was used for 8 weeks, gradually removing the wedges. Full weight bearing was allowed from day 1. The orthosis was worn 24 hours / day the first 2 weeks.
From week 2 controlled motion exercises and removal of the orthosis 5 times a day.</description>
