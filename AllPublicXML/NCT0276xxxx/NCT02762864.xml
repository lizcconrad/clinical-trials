      To compare the effect of PRU(platelet (P2Y12) reaction units)-guided treatment on the change
      in

        1. time of initial leg pain and time of termination of exercise test by pain, evaluated on
           the graded stationary bicycle test,

        2. the lower limb perfusion by using MRI blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) and
           dynamic contrast enhancement sequences and measures the extracellular volume fraction
           (ECV) as an indicator of fibrosis severity in calf muscles, from one to 52 weeks
           post-revascularization in patients with peripheral artery disease who have undergone
           endovascular revascularization -/+ bypass surgery for moderate to severe claudication or
           ischemic rest pain.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to PRU-guided and non-PRU-guided group. In the non-PRU
      -target group, dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel 75 mg and aspirin 100 mg daily will
      be continued for 6 months after the procedure for patient followed with single antiplatelet
      therapy with clopidogrel 75 mg daily throughout the follow-up period. In the PRU-target
      group, dual antiplatelet therapy will be the same protocol as in the non-PRU-target group for
      patients with PRU &lt;234 seconds. However, for patients in the PRU-target group with PRU ≥234
      seconds, rescue medicine will be added to keep PRU&lt;234 seconds.

         12. Inability of the patient to comply with study procedures and/or followup (e.g.,
             alcohol or drug abuse).

         13. A known bleeding diathesis, hemostatic or coagulation disorder, or systemic bleeding,
             whether resolved or ongoing.

         14. MRI examination is prohibited due to renal insufficiency or renal failure requiring
             dialysis. Any condition that can not receiving MRI examination, such as
             claustrophobia, previous abdominal aortic stent(strong artifact).

         15. History of previous intracranial bleed at any time, gastrointestinal bleed within the
             past 6 months, or major surgery within 30 days (if the surgical wound is judged to be
