      Recently, osteoporosis has been recognized as a serious health problem in the elderly, it has
      also increased in young • middle-aged layer. Ginseng is history 2, 000 years Korean typical
      herbal medicine which is used as a medicinal is known the mystery of Elixir from a long time
      ago. A previous study was administered ginseng extract results in animal models induced
      osteoporosis, the bone-related biomarkers, including improved bone density and bone mass.

      The investigators performed a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human
      trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ginseng extract on improvement of Bone
      metabolism in menopausal women. The investigators measured Serum Osteocalcin, Urinary
      Deoxypyridinoline, DPD/OC ratio, Serum CTX, NTX, Ca, Phosphorus, BSALP(vone specific-alkaline
      phosphatase), P1NP(Procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide), WOMAC index(Western Ontario and
      McMaster Universities Arthritis).
