  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will record patient electrocardiograms - as well as various other body signals
      (e.g., blood pressure, pulse wave, peripheral hemoglobin oxygen saturation) - as monitored
      routinely both during and immediately subsequent to surgical operations performed under
      general anesthesia. Through retrospective analysis of patients' heart rate variability (HRV),
      in concert with the other abovementioned parameters, the investigators seek to forward the
      development of novel mathematical models and tools for on-line detection of cardiovascular
      and autonomic dysfunction in the perioperative setting.

    <description>The analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has been used to assess autonomic nervous system responses to therapeutic interventions, and to quantify risk in a wide variety of both cardiac and non-cardiac disorders when combined with other diagnostic tests - though HRV analysis has seen its greatest cardiologic use in post-myocardial infarction risk stratification and in assessing risk for arrhythmic events. HRV analysis has become widespread and relatively simple to perform - however, until now, these analyses have not been performed in detail in the perioperative period.</description>
