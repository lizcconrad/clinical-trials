      BCD-055-2 is international multi-center comparative double-blind randomized clinical trial to
      evaluate efficacy and safety of BCD-055 (JSC &quot;BIOCAD&quot;, Russia) and Remicade® in patients with
      ankylosing spondylitis.

      BCD-055 is biosimilar of infliximab (JSC &quot;BIOCAD&quot;, Russia)
