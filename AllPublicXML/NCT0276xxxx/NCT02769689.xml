  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is the most feared complication when
      natalizumab (NTZ) is used in the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). The risk of
      PML increases after 18 months of treatment. When switching from NTZ to another disease
      modifying treatment (DMT) in these MS patients with an active disease, there is a high risk
      of inflammatory reactivation. Nonetheless, a washout period of several weeks is necessary
      before initiating a new DMT.

      The primary purpose of this protocol is to investigate the impact of high dose of oral
      methylprednisolone, given once a month during the washout period between NTZ and Fingolimod
      (FTY).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with MS receiving NTZ for at least 18 months and without any disease activity during
      the previous year will be eligible. Included patients will receive either methylprednisolone
      (1 gramme, 1 day every 4 weeks for a total of 3 grammes) or undistinguishable capsules of
      placebo.

      Every patient will initiate a treatment with FTY 7 weeks after the last NTZ perfusion.
      Methylprednisolone or placebo will be taken 4, 8 and 12 weeks (W4, W8 and W12) after NTZ
      discontinuation.

      A spinal and brain MRI will be performed at baseline (last NTZ perfusion, noted W0) and 16 to
      18 weeks after. The last clinical follow-up will be made after 24 weeks.
