  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: CRLX101 consists of a sugar molecule cyclodextrin linked to a chemotherapy drug
      called camptothecin. The combined molecule or nanoparticle drug conjugate travels through the
      blood. Once inside cancer cells, the chemotherapy drug is released from the molecule.
      Olaparib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from repairing the DNA damage caused by
      chemotherapy. Researchers want to see how safe it is to give CRLX101 and olaparib together
      and to see how well the combination treats a specific type of lung cancer called small cell
      lung cancer (SCLC).

      Objectives:

      To test the safety and maximum dose of CLRX101 and olaparib together. To test how well they
      treat small cell lung cancer.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 18 and older with small cell lung cancer.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with standard cancer care tests.

      Participants will get the 2 study drugs in 28-day cycles. CRLX101 will be given every 2
      weeks, through a small plastic tube in an arm vein. Olaparib will be taken by mouth twice a
      day most days. Participants will keep a pill diary.

      For Cycle 1, participants will have 3 visits. All other cycles will have 2 visits.

      At study visits, participants may have:

      Blood and hair samples taken

      History and Physical exam

      Questions about health and side effects

      Pregnancy test

      Optional tumor biopsy where a piece of tumor is removed by needle after numbing the skin. .

      CT scan

      Injection of CRLX101 (twice per cycle)

      &lt;TAB&gt;Olaparib prescription &lt;TAB&gt;

      Participants will have a follow-up visit 4 weeks after finish taking the drugs. They will
      have a physical exam and blood tests. They may have a tumor biopsy. The study team will call
      the patient every 3 months for follow up after completing the study treatment.

      Background:

        -  Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis.

        -  Although highly responsive to chemotherapy initially, SCLC relapses quickly and becomes
           refractory to treatment within a few months.

        -  Urothelial Carcinoma (UC) of the Bladder is the fourth most common malignancy in men and
           the ninth most common in women. There is no effective second-line therapy available for
           patients who progress after first-line of therapy.

        -  Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States. While prostate
           cancer is initially responsive to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), the median
           duration of sensitivity is 24-36 months. Moreover, patients develop resistance to
           current treatment options.

        -  The use of PARP inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy builds upon pre-clinical
           data in lung cancer and other cancers supporting the notion that PARP inhibitors
           potentiate the effect of DNA damaging therapies.

        -  Despite their highly synergistic activity in preclinical models, human studies combining
           PARP inhibitors and camptothecins have not translated into clinical benefit due to
           enhanced toxicity with the combination.

        -  One approach to improve ability to combine camptothecins with agents that sensitize
           their activity like PARP inhibitors is to use alternative formulations that minimize
           toxicity to the normal tissues.

        -  CRLX101 is a nanoparticle drug conjugate composed of 20 (S)-camptothecin (a potent and
           highly selective topoisomerase I inhibitor) conjugated to a linear,
           cyclodextrinpolyethylene glycol-based polymer.

        -  Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor indicated as monotherapy in patients with deleterious or
           suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutated advanced ovarian cancer who have been
           treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy. Olaparib has an established
           safety profile and it is under investigation in a number of different cancers.

      Objectives:

        -  Phase I: To determine the MTD/ recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CRLX101 in combination
           with olaparib in patients with refractory cancers

        -  Phase II: To determine the antitumor activity of olaparib plus CRLX101 with respect to
           progression free survival at 16 weeks separately in SCLC patients with resistant and
           sensitive relapse

      Eligibility:

      Phase I

        -  Male or female adult patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed, advanced solid tumor that is refractory to
           standard therapy and/or for whom no further standard therapy is available

        -  ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1 or 2

      Phase II

        -  Male or female patients greater than or equal to 18 years old

        -  Have a pathologically (histology or cytology) confirmed diagnosis of SCLC

        -  Disease progression on or after at least one platinum-based standard chemotherapy
           regimen for either limited or extensive stage disease.

        -  Have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1

        -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2

      Design:

        -  Patients meeting eligibility criteria will receive CRLX101 (IV Q 2weeks) plus olaparib
           (PO BID days 3-13 and days 17-26 administered in 28 day cycles, until disease
           progression or development of intolerable side effects. The MTD of the combination will
           be used in Phase II.

        -  Patients in Phase II will receive, the RP2D at DL4R CRLX101 12mg/m2 and olaparib 250mg
           BID.

        -  Blood, tumor and hair samples will be collected at multiple time points for PK, PD
           analyses. Hair sample collection is optional. Tumor biopsies are optional and will be
           performed only in SCLC patients (in Phase I and II) at the following time points:
           pre-treatment, on cycle 1 day 4 and at disease progression.

        -  Toxicity will be graded according to CTCAE version 4.0.

        -  Tumor assessments will be made using CT scans (chest, abdomen and pelvis) at baseline
           and after every 2 cycles according to RECIST version 1.1.

        -  After discontinuation of study treatment, follow-up for survival will be carried out
           every 3 months.

        -  The maximum number of patients on the phase I portion of the trial is 30 and the two
           cohorts in phase II may accrue up to 20 evaluable patients each. Thus, the maximum
           number of evaluable patients who may enroll on this trial is 70. In order to allow for a
           small number of in-evaluable patients, the accrual ceiling will be set at 75.

        -  It is anticipated that approximately 1 to 2 patients per month may enroll onto this
           trial; the trial is expect to complete accrual in 3-4 years.

          -  Patients could have received any number of therapies for relapsed or progressive
             disease, including re-treatment with original frontline regimen. A minimum of 2 weeks
             will be required from any prior therapy, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or
             radiation. In addition, recovery to Grade less than or equal to 1 from all reversible
             toxicities related to prior therapy is required at study entry. No previous
             irradiation to the site of measurable or evaluable disease, unless that site had

          -  The effects of CRLX101 and olaparib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For
             this reason and because these agents are known to be teratogenic, women of
             childbearing potential and men must agree to use highly effective contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation and for 120 days (both male and female) following

             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately. Fertile females of childbearing potential are defined
             as women physically capable of becoming pregnant unless the female patient cannot have
             children because of surgery or other medical reasons (effective tubal ligation,
             ovaries or the uterus removed, or are post-menopausal). Post-menopausal is defined as:

          -  The effects of CRLX101 and olaparib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For
             this reason and because these agents are known to be teratogenic, women of
             childbearing potential and men must agree to use highly effective contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation and for 120 days (both male and female) following
             last dose of study drug. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately. Fertile females of childbearing potential are defined
             as women physically capable of becoming pregnant unless the female patient cannot have
             children because of surgery or other medical reasons (effective tubal ligation,
             ovaries or the uterus removed, or are post-menopausal). Post-menopausal is defined as:

               -  Amenorrheic for 1 year or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments,

             longer

        available may be enrolled if the patient has a clinical course that is consistent with
        prostate cancer and available documentation from an outside pathology laboratory of the
        diagnosis. All efforts should be made to have the material forwarded to the research team
