      The purpose of this study include (1) To investigate the efficacy of ventilator
      hyperinflation technique to re-expand lung atelectasis on patients with critical trauma who
      intubated and mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit, (2) To investigate the
      effectiveness of ventilator hyperinflation technique to improve airway clearance on patients
      with critical trauma in the intensive care unit, and (3) To explore the acute responses of
      ventilatory functions to ventilator hyperinflation technique on patients with critical trauma
      who intubated and mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Chest Radiography</measure>
    <time_frame>&quot;Change from Baseline in Chest Radiography at Day 1 after Received Intervention (VHI)&quot; and &quot;Change from Baseline in Chest Radiography at Day 3 after Received Intervention (VHI)&quot;</time_frame>
    <description>The study took three day, chest radiography will be taken at 2 day before the study begin (first film; base line) and after day 1 (second film) and day 3 of the study (third film).
Any improvement will be assessed by comparing the second and the third film to the first film by a radiologist who will be blinded to the treatment given.
Atelectasis will grade using the following rating scale: 0 = no atelectasis; 1 = plate-like atelectasis; 2 = mild lobar collapse; 3 = moderate lobar collapse; and 4 = complete lower lobar collapse. Separate results will comply for the left and right lungs.</description>

    <description>All of the participants in control group will be treated with conventional treatment for 3 days, The conventional treatments consist of: (1) Passive chest mobilization, (2) Positioning, (3) Side lying (good lung down), (4) Vibration.

    <description>All of the participants of the experimental group will be treated with ventilator hyperinflation technique (VHI) for 3 days. Tidal volume will increase from baseline (100% VT) to the tidal volume target at 1.5 times (150% VT). At this level, patients will receive six breathes and in each breathe will be sustained for 5 second (6 hyperinflation breathe per set); expiratory VT will return to baseline after each breath. Four sets of hyperinflation breathing will be used. After this, VT will decrease to baseline and patients have a 60 second for rest between hyperinflation set. The ventilator hyperinflation technique (VHI) consists of three consecutive periods; (1) baseline period: 10 minutes, (2) intervention period, and (3) recovery period: 10 minutes.</description>

    <intervention_name>Ventilator hyperinflation technique</intervention_name>
    <description>Hyperinflation using a ventilator or &quot;ventilator hyperinflation technique (VHI)&quot; was developed from the manual hyperinflation (MHI) technique. There is no need to disconnect the patient when using the VHI technique and consequently there is no loss of PEEP and little or no risk of the adverse effects associated with MHI.</description>
