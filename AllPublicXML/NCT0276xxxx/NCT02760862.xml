    <textblock>
      Fifty patients of both sex, aged 18-50 years and ASA I and II undergoing elective lower
      abdominal and pelvic surgery under spinal anesthesia were included in this randomized
      double-blind study. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups 25 each; group (I) received
      intravenous hydrocortisone 100mg every 8 hours for 48 hours and group (II) received
      intravenous infusion of mannitol 20% 100ml over 30 minutes followed by 100ml every 12hours.
      Mean (+/- SD) of headache intensity at 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after beginning of treatment
      was assessed using visual analog scale.
