  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to look at two different programs that may help people who are HIV+
      and have pain and depression. The investigators are trying to understand how to help people
      learn to live better lives even with these chronic illnesses.

      The primary aim of this RCT is to evaluate the HIVPass intervention. HIV+ participants
      (n=236) with chronic pain and depression will be recruited at primary care HIV Clinics
      through posted advertisements in the waiting rooms of the PCP offices and by physician
      referral. After an initial phone study screen, research staff will meet with interested
      individuals in their PCP offices for informed consent, baseline interview and randomization
      into one of two study groups (Health Education or HIVPass Counseling). Seven intervention
      sessions (HE or HIVPASS) will occur during the first 3 months of study participation. For all
      participants, the first session is a collaborative in-person joint session with the
      participant, his/her PCP and the study BHS. Session 2 is conducted immediately after this
      collaborative session, and is also in-person. Sessions 3-7 are conducted by phone. Follow-up
      assessment interviews will be at months 1, 2, 3 (post-intervention), 4, 6, 9 and 12.

    <description>The seven sessions will cover: 1) nutrition (2 sessions), 2) sleep hygiene, 3) building immunity (e.g., how to avoid colds/flu), 4) injury/disease prevention (e.g., seat belts, sunscreen, when to get regular check-ups/screenings etc.), 5) benefits of exercise/cardiac health, 6) alternative medicine (massage, acupuncture). These sessions will be primarily didactic and consist of health education, followed by discussion as to how this information compares to that which the participants may have been exposed to in the past.</description>

    <description>Over 7 sessions, the interventionist and the participant will explore the relationship between pain, depressive symptoms, and HIV. General information about pain, HIV and depression will be discussed, as will avoidance of physical activity. Psychoeducation about these areas will be tied to the participant's stated life goals, and exposure exercises and goal lists will be developed. Later sessions will integrate continued efforts towards reaching goals and reducing avoidance. A release of information will be obtained from the participant to allow study session chart notes to be placed in the medical record at the participant's PCP office and to allow the PCP and the study interventionist to discuss treatment coordination.</description>
