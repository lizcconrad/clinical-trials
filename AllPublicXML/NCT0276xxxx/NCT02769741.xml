  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the nutritional effect of cashews on LDL-C concentrations and
      secondarily on other aspects of the fasting lipoprotein lipid profile in healthy men and
      women with moderately elevated cholesterol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will utilize a randomized, two-period crossover design to examine the effects of
      cashew consumption on LDL-C and other aspects of the fasting lipoprotein lipid profile in
      healthy, moderately hyper-cholesterolemic individuals consuming a typical &quot;American diet.&quot;
      Two arms consisting of two 28-day controlled-feeding treatment periods will allow for an
      isocaloric comparison of a diet with or without cashews.
