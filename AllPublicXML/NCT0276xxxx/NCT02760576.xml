    <description>Each test site area is divided into test subsite areas that are approximately at least 0.5 cm*2. The application of test material is 2 mg/cm*2. Thus, each 50 cm*2 test site area of a subject requires 100 mg of a test material to obtain a standard 2 mg/cm*2 test application.</description>
