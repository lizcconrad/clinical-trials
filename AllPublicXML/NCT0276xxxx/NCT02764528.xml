  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the handwashing intervention trial is to determine whether an interactive,
      storytelling approach to promoting handwashing with soap by health care workers can improve
      mothers' handwashing behavior during the first month of her child's life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infectious diseases, such as umbilical cord infection, pneumonia, and sepsis, are responsible
      for about a quarter of neonatal deaths. Contaminated hands likely play a role in transmitting
      pathogens to a neonate, therefore handwashing with soap has the potential to interrupt
      transmission and improve neonatal health. The primary objective of this study is to develop
      and evaluate a scalable, cost-effective handwashing promotion program to improve handwashing
      behavior among mothers and caregivers of neonates. The investigators will first conduct a
      qualitative study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a set of interventions. The
      investigators propose to evaluate the impact of the intervention components, designed as
      three progressively intense interventions, using a randomized controlled trial with elements
      of a stepped wedge design. The study will be conducted in Meru County, Kenya, enrolling a
      total of 800 pregnant women who seek non-emergency antenatal care at a government health
      facility during a 1 year period. Clinic based health care workers and community health
      volunteers will disseminate the intervention using an interactive storytelling approach. The
      focus of the interactions between the health care workers and volunteers and the participant
      will be on addressing barriers to handwashing through interactive question and answer
      sessions, rather than a didactic, educational session. The investigators will assess the
      impact of interventions on observed maternal and caregiver handwashing behavior and estimate
      the cost effectiveness for each intervention.

    <description>Pregnant women will receive handwashing promotion from a trained facility-based health care worker during her regular antenatal visit at a healthcare clinic. To the extent feasible, everyone accompanying the pregnant woman will be invited to take part in the behavior change communication session. The participant will be provided with several bars of soap to take home and she will be encouraged to maintain a designated place for washing hands (with soap and water) at the home. A poster indicating the key events for handwashing with soap will be posted at the clinic and smaller posters will be given to the participant to post in her home. A system will be established to send regular SMS messages to the participant promote handwashing with soap during the neonatal period.</description>

    <description>Women will receive all components of the clinic + home-based handwashing promotion intervention in addition to one handwashing device (i.e. tap and basin to use as a handwashing station) during the first home visit by the community health volunteer. The community health volunteer will work with the woman and her family to identify the location where the neonate will be most of the time in order to position the handwashing station as close to the neonate as possible.</description>
