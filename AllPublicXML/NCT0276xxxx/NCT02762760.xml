    <textblock>
      A prospective phase I study to evaluate the safety of a single intra-articular injection of
      Ampion™ as a treatment for arthritis of the basal thumb joint.

      Primary Objective is:

      To evaluate the safety of Ampion™ (up to 3 mL) in comparison to saline placebo (up to 3 mL)
      when injected into the basal thumb joint.

    <description>The Clinical safety of treatment on base of the thumb will be assessed by recording AEs at all in-clinic visits and the 24-hour, post-injection telephone contact call, by the results of the physical examination of the thumb joint and vital signs (at all in-clinic visits), and by recording prior and concomitant medications including start/stop dates, indication, dose and frequency (at 24 hour post-injection telephone contact call and all in-clinic visits).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able to provide written informed consent to participate in the study.

          2. Willing and able to comply with all study requirements and instructions of the site
             study staff.

          3. Male or female, 40 years to 85 years old (inclusive).

          4. Radiographic evidence of Basal joint arthritis (Eaton-Littler classification, stages 1
             through 4).

          5. Pain associated with basal joint arthritis, defined as a score ≥ 4 as evaluated by the
             Australian-Canadian OA Index (AUSCAN)-numeric rating score (NRS, 0-10).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. As a result of medical review and screening investigation, the Principal Investigator
             considers the subject unfit for the study.

          2. Previous Ampion™ injection.

          3. A history of allergic reactions to human albumin (reaction to non-human albumin such
             as egg albumin is not an exclusion criterion).

          4. A history of allergic reactions to excipients in 5% human albumin (N-acetyltryptophan,
             sodium caprylate).

          5. Women who are currently pregnant or who could become pregnant.

          6. Inflammatory or crystal arthropathies, acute fractures, history of aseptic necrosis,
             as assessed locally by the Principal Investigator.

          7. Any other disease or condition interfering with the free use and evaluation of the
             index thumb for the duration of the trial (e.g., congenital defects, stricture).

          8. Major injury to the index thumb within the 12 months prior to screening.

          9. Any pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment targeting OA started or changed
             during the 4 weeks prior to treatment or likely to be changed during the duration of
             the study.

         10. Use of the following medications are exclusionary:

               -  IA injected pain medications in the study thumb during the study;

               -  Analgesics containing opioids;

               -  NSAIDs (including but not limited to ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen, diclofenac)
                  acetaminophen is available as a rescue medication during the study from the
                  provided supply;

               -  Topical prescription treatment on osteoarthritis index thumb during the study;

               -  Significant anticoagulant therapy (e.g., Heparin or Lovenox) during the study
                  (treatment such as Aspirin in the cardio-protective dose (81mg) and Plavix are
                  allowed);

               -  Systemic treatments that may interfere with safety or efficacy assessments during
                  the study;

               -  Immunosuppressants;

               -  Use of corticosteroids &gt; 10 mg prednisolone equivalent per day (if ≤ 10 mg
                  prednisolone, the dose must be stable, defined as chronic use of the same dose
                  for at least 1 month).

         11. Any human albumin treatment in the 3 months before randomization.
