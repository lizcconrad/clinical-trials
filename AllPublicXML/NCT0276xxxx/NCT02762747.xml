    <textblock>
      This is a RCT on drain versus no drain after laparoscopic totally extra-peritoneal
      hernioplasty. We will assess the difference in seroma formation after surgery in 2 two groups
      by an independent assessor clinically and radiologist to document the size of seroma after
      surgery. Other secondary outcomes will be measured including post-operative pain, discomfort,
      analgesic used, patient satisfaction, recurrence of hernia, wound infection, etc.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inguinal hernia is a common disease and causes significant morbidity if left untreated. With
      the advances of laparoscopic approach of extra-peritoneal hernioplasty, it significantly
      reduces the post-operative pain and lead to a better quality of life with higher acceptance
      to patients.However, similar to traditional Litchenstein approach, post operative seroma
      formation is still a common problem encountered after surgery. Numerous method has been
      described to reduce chance of seroma formation, however, none was proven to be effective
      except pre-peritoneal drainage. There are currently 2 large retrospective non-randomized
      cohort study to evaluate the effectiveness of preperitoneal drainage available for reference.
      We therefore study the feasibility and efficacy of preperitoneal drainage with large scale
      randomized trial.

      Patient fulfill inclusion criteria and consent to surgery and study will be recruited. A
      standardized pre-peritoneal dissection and mesh placement will be adopted. Immediately before
      deflation of pre-peritoneal space, randomization will be performed by calling research
      assistant for study group using computer generated code. Drain will be placed for 23 hours
      after operation and ultrasonography will be performed immediately after removal of drain. USG
      will be repeated at post-operative 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after
      surgery. For non-drain group, a fake drain will be attach to the skin of the wound to achieve
      double blinding to patients and assessors. In addition to seroma, patient demographics and
      secondary outcome including post-operative pain score, discomfort, foreign body sensation,
      patient satisfaction, infection, recurrence, etc will be studied.
