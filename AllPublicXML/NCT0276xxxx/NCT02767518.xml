  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-group study comparing the effect of a &quot;prehabilitation&quot; program to usual care on
      quality of life and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing elective repair of their
      thoracic aorta.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing elective repair of their thoracic aortic aneurysm will be randomized to a
      &quot;prehabilitation&quot; program prior to their surgery or to usual care. The prehabilitation
      program is self-directed program designed to improve health and quality of life prior to
      surgery. The program is currently offered to general surgery patients; this study will
      examine the feasibility and acceptability of such a program in a different patient
      population.
