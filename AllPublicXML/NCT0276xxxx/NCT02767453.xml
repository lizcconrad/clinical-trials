  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the limited effectiveness of drains during Total
      Shoulder Arthroplasty. Drains are used during joint arthroplasty procedures to decrease
      infection rates, swelling,and the number of dressing changes required during a hospital stay.
      The use of drains has been heavily investigated in the hip and knee replacement literature,
      but there have been no investigations regarding their use in shoulder replacements, despite
      frequent use.

      Clinical benefit has not been consistently documented regarding drain usage in hip and knee
      arthroplasty and the investigators hypothesize that they are of limited utility in total
      shoulder arthroplasty as well. The investigators will perform a prospective investigation of
      total shoulder arthroplasty patients- dividing them into two groups- half will receive a
      drain at the time of surgery and the other half will not be receiving a drain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of closed-suction draining has been well studied in the hip and knee arthroplasty
      literature. Drains have been used with the intention of decreasing infection, ecchymoses, and
      frequency of dressing changes. Some have reported a corresponding decrease in hematocrit for
      patients receiving post-op drainage leading to increased transfusion needs. Given that no
      clinical benefit has been consistently documented regarding drain usage in knee and hip
      arthroplasty, they are no longer routinely used in those operations. The use of such drainage
      systems in shoulder arthroplasty, however, has not been studied and the benefit of drain use
      in regards to patient outcomes is questionable. As such, the study is a prospective
      investigation comparing outcomes in two groups of total shoulder arthroplasty patients, those
      receiving a drain at the time of surgery and those without a drain. The short-term outcome
      measurements include peri-operative hematocrit and hemoglobin, infection rate, hematoma
      development, transfusion requirement, ecchymosis and wound complication. Long-term outcomes
      include shoulder functional scores as measured by post-operative visits and any need for
      revision shoulder surgery.

    <description>A hemovac drain removes blood/fluid from a space created during a surgical procedure. Typically, surgeons place a plastic tube in the shoulder joint to drain fluids that may accumulate after surgery. Hemovac drain is a FDA-approved device routinely used or wound drainage; however, there is no known evidence whether this improves outcomes of surgery.</description>
