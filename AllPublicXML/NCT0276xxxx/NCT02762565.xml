    <textblock>
      Early detection of breast cancer improves the survival rate and makes treatment less costly.
      This study would measure the accuracy a low-cost hand-held commercially viable device, iBE,
      for the detection of clinically relevant findings in the breast using the results of current
      mammography as a comparison. This research will have no impact on clinical decision making.
