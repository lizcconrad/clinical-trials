  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to test two strategies for implementing a shared decision
      making tool to be used by providers while talking to patients about lung cancer screening.
      Eight participating sites will be randomized to compare standard implementation with
      intensive implementation. The investigators will also determine the effect of allowing
      providers to design their own risk threshold algorithms into a lung cancer screening decision
      aid, Decision Precision. Additionally, the investigators will determine the factors that were
      most important for successful implementation of the shared decision making tool. Finally, the
      investigators will survey patients to evaluate the effects of Decision Precision on patient's
      knowledge of the risks and benefits of lung cancer screening, the quality of their decision
      making, and their satisfaction with care.

      The overall goal of this quality improvement project is to test two strategies for
      implementing shared decision making, which incorporates the Decision Precision lung cancer
      screening tool. The investigators will use multi-site, cluster-based randomization to compare
      standard implementation with intensive implementation. Secondly, the investigators will
      determine the effect on tool use of allowing providers to design their own risk threshold
      algorithms by enrolling sites in a step wedge design into risk tailoring. Thirdly, the
      investigators will determine the factors that were most important for successful
      implementation of the shared decision making tool. Finally, the investigators will have a
      human subjects research component to evaluate the effects of Decision Precision on patient's
      knowledge of the risks and benefits of lung cancer screening, the quality of their decision
      making, and their satisfaction with care.
