  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This program will seek to implement a quality improvement program to improve the care of
      Veterans with TIA or minor stroke at 6 Veteran Health Administration Hospitals. The
      investigators will evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the quality improvement
      program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1. To develop a quality improvement program to improve the care of Veterans with TIA or
      minor stroke that can be deployed nationwide. The program will include multiple components: a
      reporting system that is based on validated electronic quality measures (eCQMs) that will
      allow staff to monitor the time-sensitive processes of care and outcomes of their population
      of Veterans with TIA or minor stroke; clinical protocols to improve the timeliness and
      completeness of care; professional education materials; and clinical note templates for use
      by nursing and pharmacy staff. Lessons learned at the individual sites engaged in the quality
      improvement program will be shared across sites by use of a web-based platform and a virtual
      collaborative.

      Aim 2. To evaluate the effectiveness of the Aim 1 QI intervention program for Veterans with
      TIA or minor stroke against usual care. Teams at the 6 intervention sites will be given the
      quality improvement program components. The primary effectiveness outcome is the proportion
      of Veterans who received all of the guideline-concordant processes of care for which they are
      eligible referred to as the &quot;Without-Fail&quot; care rate. The secondary effectiveness outcome is
      the 90-day recurrent vascular event rate.

      Aim 3. To evaluate the implementation of the QI intervention program across the 6
      participating sites. The implementation outcomes will be: participating clinician
      satisfaction with the quality improvement program; participating staff members' assessment of
      the quality improvement program components including the eCQM and the web-based platform in
      terms of usability, complexity, and relative advantage; and the adaptability of the program
      over the course of the study.

      Aim 4. To evaluate CFIR constructs and contextual factors associated with successful and
      suboptimal implementation of this new program for Veterans with an acute medical problem
      requiring timely care.

      Secondary Aim To evaluate the sustainability of the program. Sustainability will be evaluated
      over a one-year period that begins immediately after the one-year active implementation
      period.

    <description>Teams at the 6 intervention sites will be given both the QI program (to improve care) and eCQM data (to monitor the care they are delivering to their patients). The primary effectiveness outcome is the proportion of Veterans who received all of the guideline-concordant processes of care for which they are eligible referred to as the &quot;Without-Fail&quot; care rate. Determined by analysis of electronic medical record data.</description>
