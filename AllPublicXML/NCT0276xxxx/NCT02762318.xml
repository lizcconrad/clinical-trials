      To identify novel genetic variants causing skeletal dysplasia in Qatari populations and to
      additionally develop an understanding of how those variants influence skeletal biology at a
      molecular and cellular level.

      Achieving this goal will be split into two aims:

        -  Aim 1: Perform a clinical characterization of a study group of patients with various
           forms of skeletal dysplasia seen in pediatric orthopedics clinic at Hamad Medical
           center, HMC. This will be followed by whole exome or genome sequencing and analysis to
           search for novel pathogenic variants responsible for the clinical presentation of these
           patients

        -  Aim 2: The genes and variants identified in Aim 1 will be characterized to determine
           their effects on osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation and function.

      All the subjects will be recruited from the pool of patients seen by the Pediatric Orthopedic
      Consultants at the Bone and Joint Institute. Subjects will be coming to the clinic for their
      standard care. They will be identified during that visit as candidates for the study. They
      will then be told about the study by their physicians. If a patient is interested in
      participation, the physician will introduce the CRC to him/her who will proceed with the
      consent process.

      Consenting and the study procedures might be performed during that same visit if time allows,
      or in a new scheduled visit arranged at that time.

      This research will also involve a pedigree creation. Secondary subjects (family members or
      relatives) will be told about the study by the research subject. The secondary subject will
      be able to read a copy of the consent form, think of his participation, and if interested
      they will be told to contact the Investigators. A suitable time will then be arranged, by an
      appropriate member of the research team, for the secondary subject to visit the clinic in
      order to proceed with the consent process and the study procedures.

Up to 25 ml of blood will be withdrawn. If for any reason, the blood sample cannot be obtained, a swab will be applied to the inside of the cheek to obtain saliva.
A questionnaire will be used to collect information about individual A routine physical exam will be performed. The subject's medical record will be reviewed To well document some of the specific phenotypes and conditions, physicians might take photographs of the affected body area.
For secondary subjects (relatives or family members), normal examination and routine lab tests/ imagining will be done if needed as per the related standard care.</description>

    <ipd_description>To facilitate future genetic diagnostics related to skeletal dysplasias, the variants identified and their classifications will be shared in Gulf-based health forums and the international online databases of clinically significant genetic variation in humans (ie Clinvar, dbSNP). The data gathered regarding the spectrum of disorders identified will be similarly disseminated. HMC-affiliated investigators will use the data generated for poster and oral presentations at international meetings. Similarly, the genetic data will be likewise shared at the relevant local and international meetings. Most importantly, we are committed to publishing the results in a timely fashion in the biomedical literature, aiming for publications in high quality, high impact, peer reviewed journals. All original data and reagents generated will be made available to other investigators according to the conventions of biomedical science.</ipd_description>
