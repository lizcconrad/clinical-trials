  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of PET/MRI (Positron Emission
      Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to give physicians preoperative information about
      specific sites in the body that the endometrial cancer may be present. If the PET/MRI is
      accurate and successful in providing this information, then women in the future may be able
      to have less extensive surgery for their endometrial cancer after evaluation with PET/MRI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PET/MRI has recently become available at the institution and reports of its sensitivity,
      specificity, NPV (Negative predictive value) , PPV (Positive predictive value), and accuracy
      in endometrial cancer are not found in the literature to date, to the best of the
      investigator's knowledge. The GE PET/MRI recently obtained here at Mayo, Rochester has the
      potential to improve the sensitivity of detection of metastatic disease, compared to other
      imaging modalities, because of its superior PET technology and updated Q Clear software. For
      these reasons it is reasonable to expect improved sensitivity to detect metastatic disease in
      endometrial cancer, possibly proving PET/MRI to be a superior modality for preoperative
      screening and potentially allowing for less morbid surgical management for patients with high
      risk endometrial cancer.
