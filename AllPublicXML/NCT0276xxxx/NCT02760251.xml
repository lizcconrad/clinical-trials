  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate immunomodulatory effects of thrombopoietin-receptor Agonist
      (TPO-RA) in patients with primary ITP, who failed first-line therapy or who became intolerant
      to it. It is hypothesized that the early phase of this autoimmune disease may exhibit a
      stronger immunomodulatory potential in response to a stimulus, such as romiplostim. Such a
      process may subsequently be capable to induce regulatory mechanisms or tolerance.

      Romiplostim (a thrombopoietin-receptor agonist, TPO-RA) will be administered subcutaneously
      once weekly over 22 weeks with a starting dose of 1mcg/kg body weight. The dose will be
      adjusted based on platelet counts as described in the summary of Product Characteristics
      (SmPC).

    <description>The primary aim of the study is to demonstrate an immunomodulatory effect of the study drug. Investigators expect a shift in the Th1/Th2 balance towards Th2.
The primary outcome is to compare the pre- and post-treatment IL-4 concentrations (pg/ml) of all included patients (Th2 profile). Assessment of change in pre- and post-treatment IL-4 concentrations (pg/ml).</description>
