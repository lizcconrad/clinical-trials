  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to conduct 18-, 24-, and 36-month assessments with
      mother-toddler dyads who participated in a study that is testing the effects of a
      multicomponent lifestyle intervention as a means to prevent excessive gestational weight gain
      in obese women. Specifically, dyads will be invited to participate in home-based assessments
      to videotape an evening meal, have anthropometric measures taken, and complete study
      questionnaires. The overall goal is to understand factors related prospectively to responsive
      feeding between mothers and toddlers at 18 months; determine whether responsive feeding at 18
      and 24 months predicts change in zBMI and adiposity from 18-36 months; and explore which
      factors are most strongly predictive of child zBMI change from birth to 36 months.
