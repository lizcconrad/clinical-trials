  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We performed a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, pilot study in four adult
      medical intensive care units. Patients presenting septic shock were rapidly administered one
      of two regimens of hydrocortisone, either a 50-mg intravenous bolus every six hours during
      seven days (200-mg group) or a 100-mg initial bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 300
      mg daily for five days (300-mg group). Hydrocortisone was stopped abruptly at the end of
      treatment.

      Hydrocortisone hemisuccinate (Hydrocortisone Upjohn) was supplied as a powder in 100 mg vials
      to be reconstituted with 2 ml of sterile water diluent. The placebo was saline serum supplied
      as 10 ml ampoules. The study drugs were administered according to two protocols. In the
      200-mg group, patients received an intravenous bolus of 50 mg of hydrocortisone every six
      hours for seven days associated with a continuous infusion of placebo for five days. In the
      300-mg group, patients received an initial bolus of 100 mg of hydrocortisone followed by a
      continuous infusion of 300 mg per day for five days associated with a bolus of placebo every
      six hours for seven days. In the two groups, hydrocortisone was stopped abruptly at the end
      of treatment. The investigators had the choice or resuming hydrocortisone at the end of the
      fifth day if deemed necessary.
