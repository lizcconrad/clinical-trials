  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this multicentric, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind study is the validation of pulsed ELF-MF stimulation as non-invasive and safe
      tool to promote recovery in acute ischemic stroke patients.

      124 patients with acute ischemic stroke will be recruited and randomly assigned to real or
      sham group. Patients will be stimulated with pulsed ELF-MF (75 Hz, 1,8 mT), for 120 min
      daily, for 5 consecutive days, starting within 48 hours from the onset of stroke.

      The primary outcome will consist of reduction of the expected infarct growth at MR measured
      in the subacute and chronic phase. Secondary outcomes will explore clinical effectiveness,
      safety and tolerability of pulsed ELF-MF in acute ischemic stroke.

    <description>SHAM pulsed ELF-MF stimulation will be administrated by a rectangular, flexible coil, positioned upon the ischemic hemisphere and connected to the pulse generator (B-01; IGEA, Carpi, Italy).
