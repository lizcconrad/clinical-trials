      The purpose of this study is to determine the bioequivalence of Rosuvastatin/ Verisfield 20
      mg film-coated tablets and Crestor™/ AstraZeneca 20 mg film-coated tablets.

      This study aims to compare the absorption and disposition kinetics of two products containing
      rosuvastatin under fasting conditions. These products are: Rosuvastatin/ Verisfield 20 mg
      film-coated tablets, a Test product manufactured by HELP S.A., Greece and Crestor™/
      AstraZeneca 20 mg film-coated tablets, a Reference product manufactured by AstraZeneca, UK.
      The bioequivalence of a single 20 mg dose of both products will be assessed by comparing the
      pharmacokinetic parameters derived from the plasma concentration-time profiles for
      rosuvastatin.
