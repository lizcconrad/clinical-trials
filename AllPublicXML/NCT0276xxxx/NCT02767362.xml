      This is a preoperative window, phase 0 study of short-term atorvastatin treatment in obese
      women who are to undergo surgical staging for endometrial cancer. After recruitment is
      completed, 24 paired endometrial biopsies and hysterectomy specimens from endometrial cancer
      patients treated at UNC will be retrospectively obtained from the Department of Pathology to
      serve as controls. These cases will be matched for stage and grade to the endometrial cancers
      of those women enrolled on this phase 0 clinical trial and will undergo the same
      immunohistochemical analysis. Two previous phase 0 window studies of metformin in endometrial
      cancer have found no difference in Ki-67 expression between preoperative endometrial biopsy
      and hysterectomy specimen in control patients, although a difference was seen in metformin
      treated patients. However, the investigators plan to include a control group to ensure that
      changes found between pre- and post-atrovastatin treated patients are due to the effects of
      this drug versus differences in the type of specimen examined (i.e. endometrial biopsy
      specimen obtained in clinic versus hysterectomy specimen obtained at the time of surgery). In
      addition, enrolled patients will undergo repeat endometrial biopsy post- atorvastatin
      treatment at the time of their surgical staging. Thus, study investigators plan to compare
      pre-treatment endometrial biopsies to both post-treatment endometrial biopsies and
      hysterectomy specimens as well as have a historical control group.

    <description>Measurement of the change in tumor proliferation as measured by Ki67 immunohistochemical staining after 2-4 weeks of treatment with atorvastatin. For visual comparisons of pre- and post-treatment measures, informative plots will be generated. For statistical comparisons of pre- and post-treatment measures absolute difference scores will be created. An absolute difference score is the subtraction of a post-treatment measurement from a pre-treatment measurement. The nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests will be used to examine the significance of the absolute difference scores for each measure of interest.</description>

    <description>Once enrolled on this pre-operative window study, patients with endometrial cancer will be treated with the standard clinical dose of atorvastatin (80 mg once daily orally) for an average of 2-4 weeks prior to surgical staging. Patients will need to be able to undergo atorvastatin treatment for a minimum of 2 weeks but no more than a maximum of 4 weeks prior to surgical staging.</description>
