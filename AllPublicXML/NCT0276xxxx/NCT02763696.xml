    <textblock>
      The vaginal microbiota is an important biological barrier for host against pathogens or
      opportunistic pathogens. Undermining the balance of the vagina is closely related to
      infectious diseases and tumors.

      The vaginal microbiota of child-bearing women of age is dominated by Lactobacillus species,
      including major four species: Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus
      gasseri and Lactobacillus iners, followed by obligate anaerobes such as Gardnerella
      vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Mobiluncus curtisii, and Prevotella .

      Currently, There are almost 99% bacteria can not to be found with bacterial culture. Based on
      microscopy and conventional culture method to obtain vaginal microflora information have a
      variety of deviation. For this reason, The in-depth study of complex vaginal flora and the
      correct understanding of disease faces a serious obstacle. With the development of
      High-throughput sequencing technologyï¼Œ metagenomics can get all the composition and
      distribution of microorganisms from the sample which traditional knowledge may not be with
      microorganism culture method. Therefore, Re-evaluation of existing microflora diagnostic
      criteria for clinical diagnosis of the disease is necessary.

      In this study, the investigators use high-throughput sequencing technology to detect women of
      childbearing age vaginal microflora of metagenomic distribution. Including bacteria, fungi,
      viruses, protozoa, and other microorganisms. Based on the study results of metagenomic, the
      investigators want to re-cognition the&quot;normal flora&quot;of women of childbearing age ,and develop
      vaginal microflora microscopic evaluation of the integrity of the reference standard.
