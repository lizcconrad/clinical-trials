  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill trauma patients has been shown to significantly
      increase mortality, length of stay, and costs, however detection has proven difficult as
      markers like elevated creatinine and decreased urine output may take days to manifest and are
      late indicators of AKI. The combination of two urinary biomarkers, Tissue Inhibitor of
      Metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2) and Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 7 (IGFBP-7), has
      been shown to increase within 12 hours following renal insult, allowing assessment of risk
      for developing acute kidney injury. Therefore, the investigators plan to assess if acute
      kidney injury in critically ill trauma patients can be determined earlier using urinary
      TIMP-2 and IGFBP-7 via the NephroCheck testing system. These markers have not been
      specifically evaluated in trauma patients at risk of AKI.
