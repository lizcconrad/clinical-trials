      The objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Luliconazole Cream 1%, as
      measured by circulating plasma levels of luliconazole, when maximal quantity of Luliconazole
      Cream 1% is applied to patients 12 years to &lt; 18 years of age with moderate to severe
      inter-digital tinea pedis or tinea cruris.
