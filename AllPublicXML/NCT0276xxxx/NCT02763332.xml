  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of the fibromyalgia is about 10-15% in the European countries. It is unclear
      the etiology and pathogenesis of the syndrome. Several factors such as dysfunction of the
      central and autonomic nervous systems, neurotransmitters, hormones, immune system, external
      stressors, psychiatric aspects, and others seem to be involved. But the symptom commonly
      expressed by the people who suffer from it is pain.

      The main goal of the present study is to analyse the effect of the kinesiotaping on the pain,
      comfort and postural position of the patient with fibromyalgia.

      All of the participants were recruited, in a non-probabilistic way, from the Valencian
      Association of Affected of Fibromyalgia from date to april 2016. Inclusion criteria include:
      age between 18 and 70 years old and diagnosis of fibromyalgia based on the American College
      of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic criteria. Once they expressed their interest in taking part
      of the study, potential participants underwent an examination by a rheumatologist of the
      association to confirm the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. People with other different diagnosis,
      musculoskeletal or neurological disorders that prevented the follow-up study, infections,
      whiplash, migraine, skin hypersensitivity or heart devices were excluded.

      The participants were randomly allocated (random numbers table) to two different groups
      depending on the placement of the Kinesio Tape © (KT) by a physiotherapist which did not
      participated in the study. Thus, one group was composed by 18 women and was called &quot;Upper
      trunk group&quot; (UTG). The other group, composed by 17 women and called &quot;Global trunk group&quot;
      (GTG).

      Patients were informed about the purpose of the study, procedures and risks, and they
      provided written informed consent before the treatment. The study protocol was approved by
      the authors´ University Ethic Committee where the study was conducted. All procedures were
      conducted in accordance to the Declaration of Helsinki.

      A prospective, randomized, double blind, controlled trial was carried out. Participants were
      assessed two times, one before the intervention and another afterwards. They received a
      treatment of kinesiotaping during three weeks. Participants came to our laboratory each week
      in order to change their bandage and assure the adherence to the treatment.

      The physiotherapist who conducted the assessments was blinded to the treatment received by
      the patients and the statistician was completely blinded to the goals of the study. The
      physiotherapist who applied the treatment had an extensive experience Kinesio Tape ©.

      All enrolled participants were aware that they could receive two types of treatments but did
      not know the purposes of each treatment. They were instructed to not change their daily
      routines.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The pain intensity was recorded by a visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain. The pain was expressed on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 &quot;maximum tolerable pain.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comfort.</measure>
    <time_frame>three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Five VAS were used to identify their level of comfort in the following corporal regions: head-neck, shoulders, thoracic segment, lumbar region and pelvic region (0=absolute discomfort and 10=full comfort). Participants placed a mark along the line in order to measure their comfort level, which was scored to the nearest centimeter.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact on quality of life.</measure>
    <time_frame>three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) was used to assess the functional status of this population. This questionnaire is composed of 10 questions. Items 4 through 10 are horizontal linear scales marked in 10 increments on which the patient rates work difficulty, pain, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety and depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Was determined using self-administered questionnaire, designed for this purpose included a 16-item. The reliability of the questionnaire was analyzed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient, which indicated a good internal consistency (α = 0.70).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trunk posture.</measure>
    <time_frame>three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the position of the superior part of the trunk, the evaluation of the minor pectoral length in supine position was employed, taking the distance (with a tape measure) between the posterior edge of the acromion to the stretcher while the patients remain in that position with their hands laying on their belly.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perception of change</measure>
    <time_frame>three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Was evaluated with the Patient's Global Impression of Change scale after treatment. Participants were asked to score their perception of changing after the intervention received with a one-item questionnaire with seven alternatives (1= maximum change to 7 = no change at all).</description>

    <description>In the UTG, the bandage was applied over the superior fibbers of the trapezious and levator scapulae muscle using a strip in a 'Y' shape. The individuals were asked to remain in an upright sitting position and the base of the strip was attached to the skin beyond the acromion without any tension. Later, we placed the two straps of the bandage with a range of tension from 15 to 25%. The main goal of this shape is achieve muscular relaxation of the trapezius, scapula levator and supraspinatus.</description>

    <description>In the GTG the bandage was applied parallel to the paravertebral muscles in a 'C' shape. The individuals were sit in the same position with the head in the neutral position. The strip was pasted with approximately 25% of tension all over the paravertebral musculature. The main goal was procuring a global mechanical correction of the superior part of the trunk.</description>
