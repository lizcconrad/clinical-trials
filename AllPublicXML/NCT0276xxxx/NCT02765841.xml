  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 single-arm, open-label, international, multi-center clinical trial to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of lomitapide in pediatric patients with HoFH who are
      receiving stable lipid-lowering therapy, including LDL apheresis. The study is comprised of a
      12-week Run-in Period, a primary 24-week Efficacy Phase, followed by an 80-week Safety Phase.
