    <textblock>
      Comparison of conventional assessment of anesthetic depth by anesthesiologists (moderate,
      deep or light anesthesia) with EEG monitoring (Narcotrend® state/index). In case of mismatch
      statistical analysis for underlying factors are done.

    <textblock>
      In this observational study estimation of anesthetic depth by anesthesiologists is compared
      with the EEG based monitoring Narcotrend®. 10-20 voluntary anesthesiologists of the Kepler
      University Hospital, unfamiliar with EEG-monitoring during anesthesia, assess depth of
      anesthesia (moderate, deep or light level) during a steady-state period by clinical signs and
      measured or calculated concentrations of anesthetics. Concurrently Narcotrend® provides data
      of anesthetic depth (index, stadium) blinded for the anesthesiologist. Each anesthesiologist
      is included 30 times during study period. The aim of this study is to define conformity
      between subjective and objective assessment of narcotic depth. In the cases of divergence
      data of the patient (age, body mass index, comorbidity…), data of the anesthesiologist (age,
      years of practice…), data of anesthesia (balanced anesthesia, target controlled infusion,
      endtidal concentration of volatile anesthetic…) and data of the operation (eye surgery,
      cardiac surgery…) will be analyzed by statistics with regard to underlying or concomitant
      factors. These findings could help to develop recommendations in the use of EEG-processed
      monitoring to improve subjective assessment and facilitate an adequate depth of anesthesia to
      be provided for every patient.

    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Depth of anesthesia will be assessed by the anesthesiologist in an subjective way. During a defined period of stable anesthesia state, the indicated subjective depth levels will be assessed by the anesthesiologist and will be compared to those obtained by narcotrend (Narcotrend-Index). Anesthesiologists will assess by deep, moderate and superficial depth of anesthesia. Narcotrend indices will also be assigned to three groups (superficial, moderate, deep levels). After the procedure, both systems will be compared. In the case of non-correlation, other factors like i.e. patient's age, comorbidities, years of practice of the anesthesiologist etc. will be analysed for any other type of correlation.</description>

        Patients:

        Randomization of patients (m/w) after informed consent. For detailed inclusion criteria see
        corresponding section.

        Patients are randomly assigned to anesthesiologist. Anesthesiologists are blinded and must
        assume anesthesia level. Evaluation will be performed by study leader.
