  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to validate the sensitivity and specificity of the
      Respirio Flu Test and the eLab Flu Test in detecting Influenza A as compared to the gold
      standard for detection, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).

      The secondary aims are to:

      Validate the sensitivity and specificity of the Respirio Flu Test and the eLab Flu Test in
      detecting Influenza B as compared to the gold standard for detection, Reverse Transcriptase
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR); Evaluate the correct interpretation of the Respirio Flu
      Test by subjects with influenza-like symptoms; Evaluate the subjects' satisfaction with the
      convenience, comfort and ease of use of the Respirio Flu Test.

    <description>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is a molecular diagnostic technique for the detection and identification of influenza viruses, both for clinical samples and isolates. The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) allows template viral RNA to be reverse transcribed producing complementary DNA (cDNA) which can then be amplified and detected.</description>
