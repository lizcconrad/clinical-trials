  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      White matter hyperintensity (WMH) has been found to be related with cognitive and emotional
      dysfunction. A presumed mechanism is that WMH disrupts the structural connectivity within a
      large-scale brain network, thereby impairing the brain's ability to integrate the neural
      processes efficiently. It is not yet clear, what the pattern of brain network disruption
      relates to WMH and how the brain network disruption induced by WMH has an effect on cognition
      and emotion performance. Using multi-model magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, we
      aimed to explore the mechanisms of cognitive decline and depression related with brain
      network dysfunction in patients with WMH, and to provide objective imaging marker for early
      diagnosis and prevention of WMH associated cognitive decline and depression.
