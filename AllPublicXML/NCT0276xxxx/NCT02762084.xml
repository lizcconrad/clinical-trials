      Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled evaluates the efficacy and safety
      of patidegib gel, 2% and 4% in comparison with vehicle in subjects at least 18 years of age
      that meet the diagnostic criteria for basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS). Subjects will be
      randomized to receive patidegib gel 4%, patidegib gel 2%, or the vehicle gel for a 26 week
      treatment period.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled study designed to compare
      the efficacy and safety of patidegib gel, 2% and 4% in comparison with that of vehicle. To be
      eligible for the study, subjects must be at least 18 years of age and must meet the
      diagnostic criteria for basal cell nevus syndrome BCNS.

      Approximately 18 subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1
      ratio to receive patidegib gel 2%, patidegib gel 4%, vehicle gel. One or two tubes of the
      assigned study drug will be dispensed to the subject at the Baseline visit. Additional tubes
      will be dispensed at subsequent visits through Week 22. The study drug will be applied
      topically to the entire face as well as to treatment-targeted surgically eligible basal cell
      carcinomas (SEBs) at other anatomical sites twice daily for 26 weeks of treatment.

      Information on reported and observed adverse events will be obtained at each visit. An
      abbreviated physical examination will be performed at Baseline, Week 14, and Week 26.

      At Baseline and Weeks 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26, all visible BCCs (excluding areas below
      the knees) will be identified by the Investigator, circled in ink, photographed, measured,
      and recorded on a body diagram. Treatment targeted SEBs are defined as the five SEBs on the
      face and/or other anatomical areas identified at Baseline as SEBs will be treated during the
      26 week treatment phase. If a subject has 5 eligible previously untreated facial SEBs
      (excluding tumors on nose and eyelids) these tumors will be the subject's 5 baseline
      treatment targeted SEBs and non-facial baseline SEBs will not be treated with study
      medication.

          4. The subject must have a history of at least 10 BCCs in toto present at Baseline and/or
             treated within 24 months prior to screening.

          5. The subject has at Baseline a total of at least 5 previously untreated SEBs (greatest
             diameter 5 mm or greater on the face excluding the nose and periorbital skin, 9 mm or
             greater on non-facial areas excluding the skin below the knees), as documented
             clinically by the Investigator at Baseline. Untreated is define as no previous
             surgical or topical or intralesional drug treatment. Previous treatment with
             systemically administered drugs more than 6 months prior to Baseline is not considered
             previous treatment as long as there was no clinical evidence of resistance to oral HH
             (e.g., vismodegib, patidegib, and sonidegib) inhibitors. Baseline treatment targeted
             SEBs must not exceed a diameter of &gt; 2cm. At least one of these tumors must be
             appropriate for a 2 mm punch biopsy for biomarker analysis at Baseline and Week 6
             visits. If a subject has 5 or more facial, excluding periorbital and nasal skin, SEBs
             at Baseline, non-facial SEBs will not be treatment targeted SEBs.

          6. The subject is willing to have SEBs biopsied for biomarkers and plasma to be collected
             to measure drug levels as required in the protocol.

          7. The subject is willing to abstain from application of non-study topical prescription
             and over the counter medications to facial skin and within 5 cm of treatment targeted
             SEBs at other anatomical areas for the duration of the study except as prescribed by
             the Investigator. Moisturizers and emollients are allowable. Subjects will be
             encouraged to use sunscreen with a sunscreen protection factor (SPF 15 or higher) at
             least once daily on all exposed skin sites.

          8. Female subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening.

          9. If the subject is a male with a female sexual partner who is of childbearing potential
             the couple is willing to use two effective methods of birth control during the
             duration of the trial and for one month after the last application of the gel. A
             female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone
             a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal
             for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding
             24 consecutive months, must agree to use two effective methods of contraception for
             the duration of the study and at least 1 month after the last study drug application.
             The two forms of birth control authorized are defined as the use of a barrier method
             of contraception (condom with spermicide) in association with one of the following
             methods of birth control: bilateral tubal ligation; combined oral contraceptives
             (estrogens and progesterone) or implanted or injectable contraceptives with a stable
             dose for at least 1 month prior to Baseline; hormonal intra-uterine device (IUD)
             inserted at least 1 month prior to Baseline.

         10. The subject is willing to contact the study center after each primary skin care
             physician (PSCP) visit to provide the study center details of the visit and any
             treatment of skin tumors.

         11. The subject is willing to forego treatment of the treatment targeted baseline SEBs
             except when the Investigator and/or primary care giver believes that delay in
             treatment potentially might compromise the health of the subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is a woman of childbearing potential. This proscription is based on the
             key role of the HH pathway in embryogenesis, the known preclinical teratogenic effects
             of systemic cyclopamine, a naturally occurring inhibitor of smoothened, and the
             unknown level of systemic exposure following topical application in humans. A female
             of childbearing potential is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a
             hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal
             for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding
             24 consecutive months.

          2. The subject has used topical products to the face or within 5 cm of a treatment
             targeted SEB or systemic therapies that might interfere with the evaluation of the
             study medication during the study. Specifically these include the use of:

               -  Topical glucocorticoids 30 days prior to screening

               -  Retinoids (e.g., etretinate, isotretinoin, tazarotene, tretinoin, adapalene)
                  systemically or topically or &gt; 5% of an alphahydroxy acid (e.g., glycolic acid,
                  lactic acid) or 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod (except as topical treatment to
                  discrete BCCs) systemically or topically to the skin during the six months prior
                  to entry.

               -  Systemic chemotherapy within one year prior to screening. (Note: field therapy
                  with topically applied treatments can be done as long as they are not applied
                  within 5 cm of a treatment targeted tumor).

               -  Known inhibitors of the HH signaling pathway (e.g., vismodegib, patidegib, and
                  sonidegib) topically or systemically within 6 months of entry into the study.

          3. The subject has a history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the study
             medication formulation.

          4. The subject is unable or unwilling to make a good faith effort to return for all
             follow-up visits and tests.

          5. The subject has uncontrolled systemic disease.

          6. The subject has clinically important history of liver disease, including viral
             hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis.

          7. The subject has any condition or situation which in the Investigator's opinion may put
             the subject at significant risk, could confound the study results, or could interfere
             significantly with the subject's participation in the study. This includes history of
             other skin conditions or diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination
             findings, or clinical laboratory findings giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or
             condition that contraindicates use of an investigational drug or that might affect
             interpretation of the results of the study or render the patient at high risk from
             treatment complications.

          8. The subject has a history of invasive cancer within the past five years excluding
             non-melanoma skin cancer, Stage I cervical cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ of breast,
             or chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (Stage 0).

          9. The subject has current, recent (within 4 weeks of Baseline visit), or planned
             participation in an experimental drug study while enrolled in this study.

         10. Female sexual partner(s) of male subjects who are unwilling or unable to comply with
             pregnancy prevention measures.
