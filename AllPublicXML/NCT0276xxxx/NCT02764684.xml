      Objective:

      In this study the investigators aim at investigating:

        1. probiotics ability to modulate the microbiome and microbial translocation,

        2. if probiotics affect the level of cholesterol, triglycerides as markers of
           cardiovascular risk factors and

        3. if a reduction of microbial translocation is associated with a reduction of inflammation
           in the gastro-intestinal tract.

      Design:

      The study is a prospective clinical intervention trial of 40 HIV-infected patients.

      Method:

      The investigator will administer the bacteria Lactobacillus Rhamnosus in capsular form to
      each patient 2 times a day in 8 weeks. At baseline and at the 8th week of the intervention,
      the investigators will collect blood samples, feces samples and make a positron emission
      tomography-magnetic resonance scans.
