  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to study the effects of alcohol on three forms of bariatric surgery,
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric
      banding (LAGB). The surgery is not part of the clinical trial. If insurance does not cover
      the procedure, then the patient is responsible for payment of the surgical process. The
      investigators are doing pre and post surgery testing to provide a better understanding of the
      effect of bariatric surgery-induced weight loss on 1) alcohol absorption, distribution and
      elimination from the body, 2) the effects of alcohol on mood, and 3) the effects of alcohol
      on driving.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes six groups of women: One group will be undergoing RYGB another group will
      be undergoing LAGB, a third group will be undergoing SG, the fourth group will be women who
      underwent RYGB 1-5 years ago, the fifth group will be women who underwent LAGB 1-5 years ago,
      and the sixth group will be women who underwent SG 1-5 years ago.

    <description>Morbidly obese subjects undergoing gastric bypass surgery. Subjects will be assessed in four testing sessions about 1 week apart in a randomized cross-over fashion before surgery. During the first two sessions, their response to alcohol or nonalcoholic (placebo) beverage will be evaluated. During testing sessions three and four, their response to alcohol administered intravenously will be evaluated. These four testing sessions will be repeated when subjects loose ~ 16% of their presurgery body weight.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be asked to press a button (&quot;work&quot;) to receive either a &quot;drink&quot; or saline through an IV catheter. The amount of alcohol infused after earning their reward will be based on their body composition and will raise their blood alcohol level by 10 mg/dl (eight time less than the legal limit for driving). We will set a safety limit to 150 mg/dl so that subjects will not be allowed to work for alcohol until their blood alcohol levels go below that limit.</description>
