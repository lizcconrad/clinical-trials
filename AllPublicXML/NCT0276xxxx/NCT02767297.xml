      To determine the relative bioavailability of the capsule (reference) and tablet (test)
      formulations of FDL169 in healthy adult males and females, and to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile FDL169 tablets (test formulation) in both healthy adult males
      and females, and subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF).

      This is a three-part study.

      Part 1:

      Part 1 of the study is a single dose, open-label, randomized crossover study in healthy male
      and female subjects to compare the relative bioavailability of two formulations of FDL169.

      Part 2:

      Part 2 of the study is a multiple, escalating dose study of three different doses of the test
      formulation of FDL169 in healthy male and female subjects to evaluate the PK profile of the
      test formulation of FDL169.

      Part 3:

      Part 3 of the study is a single dose, open-label study in male and female subjects with CF to
      determine the PK profile of the test formulation of FDL169.
