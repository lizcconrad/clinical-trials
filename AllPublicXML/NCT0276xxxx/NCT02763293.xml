    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease with a high prevalence. Its etiology is
      unknown and is considered a multifactorial disease. It is known that the existence of a
      genetic factor, industrialization and development of the country and environmental factors
      have great influence on the appearance of intestinal pathology (the Val; Buderus; Molodecky).
      CD is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease localized throughout the course of the digestive
      tract (oral-anal). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a treatment program
      combining technical nonmanipulative appropriate in affected patients (CD) to increase the
      overall quality of life and related EC, lower abdominal pain direct and indirect osteopathic
      soft, observe the sense of change after treatment, and psychological aspects.

      All of the participants were recruited, in a non-probabilistic way, from the Valencian
      Association of Enfermos de Crohn y Colitis Ulcerosa (ACCU) The participants were allocated to
      two different groups depending on their possibility of participation in the therapeutic
      sessions. The group that received the therapy was called experimental group (EG) and the
      group, who did not, control group (CG). The participants were allocated independently of
      their disease status (outbreak or remission).

      An experimental study carried out during a period of four weeks in order to explore the
      effect of the specific treatment on the following outcomes: global quality of life, quality
      of life in CD and pain.

      The participants, in the EG were treated in three sessions, that lasted 45 minutes, during
      the study duration (1 session each 9-10 days). The physiotherapist who applied the treatment
      had an extensive experience in manual therapy.

      Both groups come to laboratory two times for the assessment, one at the beginning of the
      study and the other one at the end. In each session several questionnaires were administered
      by a physiotherapist who was blinded to the group assignment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with active CD of at least one year of evolution, aged between 18
             and 65, with a presence of abdominal pain, receiving conservative or surgical
             treatment (after 6 months after surgery and absence of diverting ileostomy) were
             included. Once they expressed their interest in taking part of the study, potential
             participants underwent an examination by a specialist of the association to confirm
             the diagnosis of CD.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Conversely, patients with non-specific inflammatory bowel, abdominal tenderness,
             infection, ischaemia, physical damage, or specific immunologic sensitivity or
             pregnancy be excluded of this study were discarded for the study.
