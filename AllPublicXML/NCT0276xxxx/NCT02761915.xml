  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first in human study is to determine the safety and feasibility of
      1RG-CART therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. 1RG-CART therapy is a
      novel immunotherapy under investigation in which patients have their T-cells (a type of white
      blood cell) collected and modified in the laboratory, before they are given back to the
      patient. The T-cells are modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) which targets
      disialoganglioside (GD2), a marker expressed on the surface of neuroblastoma cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to explore the feasibility of deploying autologous anti-GD2 CAR
      T-cells for the immunotherapy of neuroblastoma. The CAR T-cell trials employing second
      generation receptors and lymphodepleting conditioning regimes have produced objective
      clinical responses in patients with relapsed leukaemias. The current trial aims to evaluate
      similar CAR T-cells but directed against the antigen GD2. Neuroblastoma is well suited to
      this form of targeted therapy because of the homogeneous and almost universal expression of
      GD2 on the surface of neuroblastoma cells, and because of the poor prognosis of eligible
      patients.

      1RG-CART will be administered intravenously. As the CAR T-cells are designed to survive and
      proliferate on encountering antigen, no direct relationship is anticipated between cell dose
      and either efficacy or toxicity. Rather, clinical benefit is more likely to be observed in
      those patients in whom in vivo expansion successfully occurs. A possible key determinant of
      expansion will be prior lymphodepletion of the patients. For this reason this trial is
      designed to evaluate a phased introduction of lymphodepletion in successive patient cohorts,
      rather than T-cell dose escalation. Only if there is insufficient expansion of T-cells
      following full lymphodepletion will the T-cell dose be escalated.

             However, those patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before
             enrolment and agree to use two highly effective forms of contraception (oral; injected
             or implanted hormonal contraception and condom; have an intra-uterine device and
             condom; diaphragm with spermicidal gel and condom) effective at the first
             administration of the lymphodepleting regimen or at administration of the 1RG-CART
             (whichever comes first), throughout the trial and for six months afterwards are
             considered eligible. Note that for female patients who receive cyclophosphamide or
             rituximab, the contraceptive period should be extended to 12 months after
             cyclophosphamide/rituximab administration.

         12. Male patients with partners of child-bearing potential (unless they agree to take
             measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective contraception
             [condom plus spermicide] effective at the first administration of the lymphodepleting
             regimen or at administration of the 1RG-CART [whichever comes first], throughout the
             trial and for six months afterwards). Men with pregnant or lactating partners must be
             advised to use barrier method contraception (for example: condom plus spermicidal gel)
             to prevent exposure to the foetus or neonate.

         13. Known to be serologically positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV.

         14. Any other condition which in the Investigator‟s opinion would not make the patient a
             good candidate for the clinical trial.

         15. Is a participant in another clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product
             (CTIMP). Participation in an observational trial or in the follow-up phase of a CTIMP
             would be acceptable.
