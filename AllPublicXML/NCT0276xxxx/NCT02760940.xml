      Anemia is a clinical manifestation, which is commonly observed in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease, and it accounts for significant loss in the quality of life of these patients.
      The aim of the current study is to assess the effect of orally administered iron treatment,
      as well as its response predictors in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who are in
      remission and present anemia. The study will recruit 100 patients with Crohn's disease (CD)
      and 100 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) diagnosed and regularly monitored in the
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center at the University Hospital of the Federal University of
      Juiz de Fora, for clinical, hematological, biochemical and immunological assessment. Blood
      samples will be collected (10 ml) and the following tests will be performed in all the anemia
      patients (in remission) at the beginning of the treatment and 8 weeks later: complete blood
      count, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular
      hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) , transferrin
      saturation index, ferritin, serum iron, hepcidin, quantitative C-reactive protein (CRP),
      interleukin-6 (IL-6)) and fecal calprotectin. In addition, quality of life, anxiety and
      depression and fatigue questionnaires will be applied to the patients (IBDQ, HAD and
      Chalder). The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria will be used to diagnose anemia,
      therefore, hemoglobin lower than 12 g/dl for women and 13g/dl for men will be considered
      anemia; hemoglobin lower than 10 g/dl will be considered severe anemia. Patients with mild
      and moderate anemia in remission will be initially treated with oral iron (oral liposomal
      iron) and the occurrence of possible symptoms related to oral iron intolerance will be
      assessed, as well as the patients' disease activity level and quality of life. The patients
      in follow-up will be subjected to new laboratory tests after the eighth oral iron treatment
      week. The results of the current study are expected to help assessing the oral iron efficacy
      and response predictors, as well as the side effects of the treatment and its impact on the
      quality of life of patients.

      1. Study Design:

           Two hundred (200) patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission - 100 patients
           with Crohn's disease and 100 patients with ulcerative colitis - will be randomly
           selected.

           The patients will be informed that their participation in the study will generate no
           expense or financial benefit to them. Any doubts they may have about the study will be
           clarified and they will be free to participate in it or not. Their refusal will not
           result in any penalty or change in the way they will be served. They may withdraw their
           consent or discontinue their participation at any time.

           Laboratory tests will be conducted at the University Hospital, according to the
           follow-up routine applied to patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and they will
           represent no risk to health different than that of common blood tests.

           The study protocol will be submitted to the Research Ethics Committee of the University
           Hospital for evaluation. All patients included in the study will sign a free and
           informed consent form. The patients will be assessed according to eligibility criteria
           and their demographic data (age, gender) and body weight will be recorded at the first
           visit. They will undergo an interview to assess symptoms and possible disease activity
           one week before the beginning of the treatment. They will also fill out a questionnaire
           about quality of life, anxiety and depression and another one about fatigue before and
           after the treatment. Only patients who have completed the 8-week treatment will be
           included in the study.

           Blood samples (10ml) will be collected for hematological, biochemical and immunological
           assessments, after the treatment. The following hematological and biochemical tests will
           be performed in patients with anemia: complete blood count, MCV, MCH, MCHC, ferritin,
           transferrin saturation index, hepcidin, quantitative CRP, IL-6 and fecal calprotectin.

           The blood collection will be performed by a biochemistry resident at the University
           Hospital of Juiz de Fora, as well as the examinations, which will be done under the
           supervision of biochemistry professors of the University Hospital residency program.

           All patients in the study will be subjected to the following tests: a. clinical
           assessment; b. questionnaire on quality of life c. questionnaire on fatigue d.
           questionnaire on anxiety and depression e. biochemical assessment; f. ileocolonoscopy
           with biopsy for histopathological study.

        2. Study flowchart

             1. Phase I

                  -  Patient selection

                  -  Clinical, biochemical, colonoscopic and histopathological assessment

                  -  Assessment of IBDQ, HAD and Fatigue scales

             2. Phase II

                  -  Supplementation with oral iron

                  -  Monitoring of complications

             3. Phase III

                  -  Clinical, biochemical, colonoscopic and histopathological reassessment

                  -  Reassessment of IBDQ, HAD and Fatigue scales

                  -  Study completion

        3. Statistical analysis The collected data will be analyzed by a specific statistical
           software (SPSS -Statistical Package for Social Sciencesâ„¢, version 21.0).

      The patients will be divided in two groups (mild and moderate anemia) for data analysis,
      according to their hemoglobin levels. The comparisons between groups, as well as the possible
      relations between socio-demographic and clinical variables, and changes in IBDQ, HAD and
      fatigue scales will be analyzed through parametric Student's t-test, Chi-square test or
      nonparametric Mann-Whitney test, whenever appropriate. Univariate and multivariate logistic
      analyses will be performed to identify possible independent predictors of oral iron response
      within the entire group.

      The results will be presented as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The
      statistical significance level will be set at P &lt;0.05, for comparison.

    <description>The supplementation will be performed in patients with mild to moderate anemia, since patients with severe anemia usually require more aggressive treatments. The replenishment will be provided at no cost to the patients at the dose of 2 (two) iron liposomal iron tablet per day (equivalent to 28 mg of iron). The patients will be instructed to take one tablet of 14 mg twice a day. They will be monitored by telephone in weekly interval periods throughout the intervention phase in order to optimize their adhesion to the treatment and verify the occurrence of possible side effects and the improvement in hemoglobin level.</description>

The questionnaire comprises 12 items related to the intensity of fatigue symptoms. It is a Likert-type scale with scores ranging from one to four in each item. The items are calculated in bimodal scores. Considering the Likert scale, the values ranging from one to four in bimodal calculations will be considered zero.
