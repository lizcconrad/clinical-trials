  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ST266 will reduce pocket depth (PD) as an
      adjunctive to scaling and root planing (SRP) in subjects with moderate to severe periodontal
      disease.

      The study is a 9-month, randomized, double-blind, parallel-design study of subjects with
      existing moderate to severe periodontal disease randomly assigned to one of three groups. The
      primary endpoint of PD change will be evaluated following 9 months of treatment. Subjects
      will be followed for 9 months for safety and radiographic evaluations.

      Subjects who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized to one of three treatment groups.

      Randomization will be stratified by site and smoker status (never smoked or quit smoking more
      than two years ago vs. has smoked within the last two years). Randomization will be blocked
      such that assignment to treatment groups both within sites and within smoker status will be
      approximately even (1:1:1). Treatment will be initiated after SRP.

      All subjects will be evaluated at baseline and Days 1, 15, 30, 60, 90, 180, and 270.
