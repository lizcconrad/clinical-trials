    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine study is intended to replicate and extend the
      immunogenicity and safety results obtained in earlier Phase 1-2 and Phase 2 studies. The
      study is being conducted to demonstrate that the immunogenicity profile of the Quadrivalent
      VLP Vaccine meets the US Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) licensure
      criteria. The study will also help to define the optimal dose, establish potential
      competitive advantages, and support the design of future studies.

      This randomized, observer-blind, multicenter, Phase 2 study will be conducted at multiple
      sites across the United States and Canada.

      The influenza strain composition of the Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine used in this study includes
      2 influenza A virus strains (A/California/7/2009 [H1N1] and A/Switzerland/9715293/2013
      [H3N2]) and 2 influenza B virus strains (B/Phuket/3073/2013 [Yamagata lineage] and
      B/Brisbane/60/2008 [Victoria lineage]), based on the 2015-2016 recommended World Health
      Organization (WHO) strains for vaccination in the Northern hemisphere.

      Approximately 900 healthy subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 parallel
      treatment groups. Subjects in each group will be stratified into 2 age strata: 18 to 49 years
      and 50 to 64 years in a 2:1 ratio.

      Subjects will receive one intramuscular (IM) injection of their assigned vaccine:

        -  15 µg/strain of Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine, or

        -  30 µg/strain of Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine, or

        -  15 µg/strain of the licensed and commercially available quadrivalent vaccine FluLaval®
           Tetra.

      Subjects will participate in this study for approximately 8 months, during which 5 visits
      will be scheduled, and phone contact will be made on Day 1, Day 8, and every 2 months
      thereafter for up to 6 months post-Day 21 visit (Day 201). Safety laboratory assessments will
      be performed at Screening, on Day 3 and within 48 hours of Day 3 results availability, for
      grade 3 or grade 4 abnormalities or if deemed necessary by the investigator or early
      termination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be able to read, understand, and sign the informed consent form (ICF);
             complete study-related procedures; and communicate with the study staff at visits and
             by phone.

          2. Subjects are considered by the Investigator to be reliable and likely to cooperate
             with the assessment procedures and be available for the duration of the study.

          3. Male and female subjects must be 18 to 64 years of age, inclusive, at Screening (Visit
             1).

          4. Subjects have a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 18.0 and ≤ 32.4 kg/m2 at Day 0.

          5. Subjects must be in good general health prior to study participation (no more than 30
             days prior to study vaccine administration) with no clinically relevant abnormalities
             that could jeopardize subject safety or interfere with study assessments as assessed
             by the Principal Investigator or sub-Investigator (thereafter referred as
             Investigator) and determined by medical history, physical examination, biochemistry,
             hematology, and urinalysis. Note: Subjects with a pre-existing chronic disease will be
             allowed to participate if the disease is stable and, according to the Investigator's
             judgment, the condition is unlikely to confound the results of the study or pose
             additional risk to the subject by participating in the study. Stable disease is
             generally defined as no new onset or exacerbation of pre-existing chronic disease 6
             months prior to immunization. Based on the Investigator's judgment, a subject with
             more recent stabilization of a disease could also be eligible.

          6. Female subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at Screening (Visit
             1) and a negative urine pregnancy test at Randomization prior to immunization.

          7. Female subjects of childbearing potential must use an effective method of
             contraception for 1 month prior to immunization and agrees to continue employing
             adequate birth control measures for at least 60 days post-immunization. Moreover, she
             must have no plan to become pregnant for at least 2 months post-immunization.
             Abstinent subjects should be asked what method(s) they would use, should their
             circumstances change, and subjects without a well-defined plan should be excluded.

             The following relationship or methods of contraception are considered to be effective:

               -  Hormonal contraceptives (e.g., injectable, topical [patch], or estrogenic vaginal
                  ring);

               -  Intra-uterine device with or without hormonal release;

               -  Male partner using a condom plus spermicide or sterilized partner (at least 1
                  year prior to immunization);

               -  Credible self-reported history of heterosexual abstinence until at least 60 days
                  postimmunization;

               -  Female partner.

          8. Non-childbearing females are defined as:

               -  Post-menopausal (absence of menses for 24 consecutive months and age consistent
                  with natural cessation of ovulation).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participating in this
        study:

          1. According to the Investigator's opinion, history of significant acute or chronic,
             uncontrolled medical or neuropsychiatric illness. &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; is defined as:

               -  Requiring a new medical or surgical treatment within one month prior to study
                  vaccine administration;

               -  Requiring a change in medication dosage during one month prior to study vaccine
                  administration due to uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity, or for chronic
                  diseases, significant change in medication dosage within 6 months prior to study
                  vaccine administration based upon the investigator's judgment (elective dosage
                  adjustments in stable subjects are acceptable).

          2. Any medical or neuropsychiatric condition or any history of excessive alcohol use or
             drug abuse which, in the Investigator's opinion, would render the subject unable to
             provide informed consent or unable to provide valid safety observations and reporting.

          3. Any autoimmune disease other than hypothyroidism on stable replacement therapy or any
             confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition or immunodeficiency including known

             trivalent/quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine by either intradermal or
             intramuscular [IM] route) within 6 months prior to randomization and up to completion
             of Day 21 visit.

          7. Use of any investigational or non-registered product within 30 days or 5 half-lives,
             whichever is longer, prior to randomization or planned use during the study period.
             Subjects may not participate in any other investigational or marketed drug study while
             participating in this study until Day 201 visit.

             immunosuppressant drug, or any immunoglobulin preparation within 3 months of
             vaccination and until the completion of Day 21 visit. Low doses of nasal or inhaled
             glucocorticoids are allowed. Topical steroids are permitted.

          9. Any significant disorder of coagulation including treatment with warfarin derivatives
             or heparin. Persons receiving prophylactic anti-platelet medications (e.g., low-dose
             aspirin [no more than 325 mg/day]), and without a clinically apparent bleeding
             tendency are eligible. Subjects treated with new generation drugs that do not increase
             the risk of intramuscular bleeding (e.g., clopidogrel) are also eligible.

         10. History of allergy to any of the constituents of the Quadrivalent VLP vaccine
             (including H1N1, H3N2, B/Bris, and B/Phuket), to any components of the licensed

             ibuprofen) within 24 hours of randomization to prevent or pre-empt symptoms due to
             vaccination. Subject discovered to have taken a prophylactic medication within the 24
             hours prior to planned randomization must be delayed until at least the 24 hours
             period is met.

         15. Have a rash, dermatological condition, tattoos, muscle mass, or any other
             abnormalities at injection site that may interfere with injection site reaction
             rating.
