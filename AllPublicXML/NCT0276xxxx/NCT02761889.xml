    <textblock>
      The present study evaluates the clinical outcomes following definitive ultra-high dose per
      fraction external beam radiation therapy delivered in patients with organ-confined
      adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      Patients enrolled in the study will undergo image-guided, volumetric intensity-modulated arc
      radiotherapy (IGRT-VMAT) with state-of-the-art treatment-planning and quality assurance
      procedures with emphasis on normal tissue sparing and delivery accuracy via the use of
      devices that ensure stability and beam location reproducibility. A rectal balloon with air
      filling will be used for prostate target immobilization and anatomical reproducibility, while
      a urethral catheter loaded with beacon transponders will be used to ensure set-up
      reproducibility and online target tracking. Previously untreated patients with prostate
      cancer will be treated with 45 Gy in five fractions of 9 Gy over 5 consecutive days.

      Patients will be followed at one month post-treatment and every 3 months for up to 12 months
      (+/- 4 weeks) and every 6 months (+/- 6 weeks) thereafter. Acute and late toxicity
      evaluations will focus, though not exclusively, on urinary, rectal and sexual functions and
      will be assessed through validated Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC),
      International prostate symptom score (IPSS) and International index of erectile function
      (IIEF) questionnaires. Serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) values will be drawn on the same
      schedule as clinical follow-up. Patients will be continuously monitored for a minimum of 5
      years.
