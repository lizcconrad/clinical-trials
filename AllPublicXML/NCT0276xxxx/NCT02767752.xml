  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial that
      will compare the efficacy of T-ChOS in combination with gemcitabine to gemcitabine alone as
      adjuvant treatment for 6 months in patients with surgically resected pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.
