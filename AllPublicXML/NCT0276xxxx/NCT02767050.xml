      The following observational study evaluates incidence of caries in smoking and smokeless
      tobacco based on habit history by clinical examination and DMFT index.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries is an irreversible microbial disease of the calcified tissues of the teeth,
      characterized by demineralization of the inorganic portion and destruction of the organic
      substance of the tooth, which often leads to cavitation. It is a complex and dynamic process
      where a multitude of factors influence and initiate the progression of disease. There are
      practically no geographic areas in the world whose inhabitants do not exhibit some evidence
      of dental caries. It affects persons of both genders in all races, all socioeconomic strata
      and every age group. Likewise, there is strong evidence that tobacco use has numerous
      negative effects on oral health, for example staining of teeth, dental restoration,
      development of oral diseases. A biologically reasonable explanation for an association
      between chewing tobacco use and dental caries may be the presence of higher levels of
      fermentable sugars in chewing tobacco products which can stimulate the growth of carcinogenic
      bacteria. The decreased buffering effect possible lower pH of smokers saliva and higher
      number of lactobacilli and streptococcus mutans group may indicate an increased
      susceptibility to caries in smokers. On the other hand, there are researches which conclude
      that presence of extrinsic tobacco stains appear to provide a protective effect from caries.

        Patients attending Panineeya Institute of Dental Sciences and Research Centre having
        tobacco chewing and smoking habits without fluorosis would be included in the study after
        their informed consent.

        DMFT index is scored for 613 patient of both the genders, visiting OPD of oral medicine and
        radiology after the clinical diagnosis of caries along with radiographs. The clinical
        scores are recorded along with investigations and a proforma would include the habit with
        duration, frequency, area of placement and form of tobacco intake.
