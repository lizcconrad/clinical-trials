  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is unknown whether beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in Gestational Diabetes
      Mellitus (GDM) is representative of a chronic maternal defect, unmasked by pregnancy, or
      whether it is the result of an imbalance of a placental hormones. Undiscovered placental
      factors which vary between pregnancies likely contribute to the pathogenesis of GDM. To
      elucidate the pathophysiology underlying GDM, the investigators will attempt to discover
      these factors and characterize pregnancy-associated changes in insulin secretion and
      sensitivity in women with and without GDM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) complicates 3-7% of pregnancies in the United States and
      is associated with perinatal morbidity and a high risk of future maternal type 2 diabetes.
      Current prevention and treatment of GDM relies on techniques developed in the type 2 diabetes
      population, without regard to unique physiology in pregnancy. GDM occurs in the setting of
      profound pregnancy changes in glucose metabolism: late pregnancy is normally characterized by
      marked insulin resistance. In order to maintain normal glucose levels and avoid GDM,
      pancreatic beta cells must augment insulin secretion to compensate. Women with GDM have
      inadequate beta-cell compensation for pregnancy-induced insulin resistance, resulting in
      hyperglycemia. It is unknown whether beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in GDM is
      representative of a chronic maternal defect, unmasked by pregnancy, or whether it is the
      result of an imbalance of a placental hormones. Undiscovered placental factors which vary
      between pregnancies likely contribute to the pathogenesis of GDM. Discovery of these factors
      and elucidation of the pathophysiology underlying GDM will allow for the development better
      GDM-specific prevention and treatment strategies.
