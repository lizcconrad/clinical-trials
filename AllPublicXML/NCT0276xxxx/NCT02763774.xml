  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to analyze effects of three types of cardiac rehabilitation protocol on
      fuctional capacity, inflammatory markers, pulmonary function and clinical outcomes after
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with left ventricular disfunction.
      Patients will be randomized and allocated in three groups according to type of exercise
      protocol: 1. walk; 2. cycle; 3. functional electrical stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have been demonstrated beneficial effects of exercise to minimize impact of
      CABG. However, there is no consensus on what kind of exercise is safe and effective for
      patients with left ventricular dysfunction.

      Walking

    <description>Participants will be sumitted to progressive exercises and supervised by a physiotherapist, active-assisted to free active exercise in upper and lower limbs, stationary running and walking. The intensity of walk will be determined by the Borg's sujective effort perception scale - (modified from zero to 10). On first postoperative day, participants will perform exercises in supine position. From the second to the fifth postoperative day, they will perform progressive walking.</description>
