    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the effectiveness of musical training in in improving the
      psychological well-being, in particular their self-esteem, depression, happiness and quality
      of life of children from low income families.Half of the participants will receive weekly
      one-hour lessons on musical training for 12 weeks, while the other half are the placebo
      controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children from low income families generally suffer from hard conditions,such as poor living
      conditions, inadequate nutrition, and delay in accessing health care services. Such problems
      may made children suffer from developmental problems and malnutrition and to have a lower
      level of intelligence and difficulties in language comprehension, which may not only have
      profound impacts on children's physical well-being, but on their psychological well-being as
      well. Musical training is considered to have potential for promoting psychological well-being
      among children mostly because music is found to be important to a child's early psychological
      development. A growing number of educators and researchers suggest that, of all the stages of
      life, infancy may be the time when music has the most important impact on an individual.
      Babies hear language long before they are able to comprehend it. The quality and the quantity
      of what is unconsciously absorbed in infancy relates directly to later development. Musical
      training has been used for various purposes such as improving language development, self
      expression, memory skills, concentration, social interaction, fine motor skills, listening,
      problem solving, teamwork, goal setting, and coordination. More importantly, when a child
      learns to sing and play music, other areas of development — creativity, family bonding,
      self-esteem, confidence, emotional development — are also positively impacted.

      Nevertheless, although musical training is popular and is considered to be a beneficial
      intervention in the promotion of psychological well-being, longitudinal studies that examine
      the efficacy of music-making in children from low-income families are limited. Importantly,
      there is to date no study that examines the effects of musical training on enhancing the
      psychological well-being among these children. There is an imperative need for rigorous
      empirical scrutiny of the effectiveness of musical training in promoting the psychological
      well-being in children from low-income families. Therefore, the aim of this study is to
      examine the effectiveness of musical training in in improving the psychological well-being,
      in particular their self-esteem, depression, happiness and quality of life of children from
      low income families.

    <measure>The change of quality of life from baseline at 12 weeks follow-up between intervention and control group.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects' quality of life will be assessed at 12 weeks after starting the intervention, using the Chinese version of the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scale (PedsQL 4.0).
The parents will be asked to fill in this questionnaire for their children. The PedsQL is designed to measure children's healthrelated quality of life. It comprises 23 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale. These items are categorised into four domains: physical functioning (eight items), emotional functioning (five items), social functioning (five items) and school functioning (five items). The total possible range of scores is from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

    <description>The subjects'self-esteem will be assessed at baseline, by asking their parents to fill in the Chinese version of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES).
The RSES is designed to measure the global self-esteem of children and adolescents. The scale comprises 10 items, rated using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree), with total possible scores ranging from 10 to 40. Higher scores indicate higher levels of self-esteem.</description>

    <description>The subjects' depression will be assessed at baseline, using the Chinese version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC).
The parents will be asked to fill in this questionnaire for their children. It is to assess the number of depressive symptoms for children. The CES-DC consists of 20 items that are measured on a 4-point Likert scale in relation to the experience of last week. Each item is rated from 0 to 3. The higher scores of CES-DC indicate the high numbers of depressive symptoms. The cutoff of this scale is 16, which indicates the children currently experiencing a significant level of depressive symptoms.</description>
