      This is a study of participants with a diagnosis of migraine who completed another clinical
      trial known as I5Q-MC-CGAB (CGAB) (NTC02163993). In CGAB, participants received either
      LY2951742 or placebo. This study will evaluate how certain biomarkers may be related to the
      participant's response in CGAB. The study will last about five days.
