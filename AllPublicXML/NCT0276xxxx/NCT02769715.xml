    <textblock>
      Removable partial dentures (RPDs) are traditionally fabricated by lost-wax casting technique,
      a time-consuming and very laborious manual technique. Recently, fabricating removable partial
      dentures using computer designing and laser sintering techniques have been introduced. The
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the patient satisfaction with new computer-generated
      removable partial dentures and compare it to the traditional removable partial dentures.

      Patients seeking Removable partial dentures in the undergraduate clinic at McGill University
      were asked to participate in the study. Patients were treated by undergraduate students under
      the supervision of expert prosthodontists. Both the dentists treating the case and the
      patients were blinded to the type of RPD used. The Principal investigator was responsible for
      preparing the laboratory prescriptions and sending the final impressions to the dental lab in
      order to assure blinding of the patient and the treating dentists.

      Patients were treated according to standardized clinical procedures. Both dentures were
      fabricated from one master cast to ensure standardization. The cast was scanned digitally to
      fabricate the laser-sintered dentures, and then was used to fabricate the cast dentures
      traditionally using lost-wax casting technique. For each patient, two dentures were
      fabricated from one final impression; one by casting technique and the other by
      laser-sintering. Patients were given randomly one denture first and followed-up for 1, 2 and
      4 weeks. Then, they were given the second denture and followed-up again. At each follow-up
      visit, patients filled McGill Denture Satisfaction Instrument. At the end of the study
      patients were asked which denture they prefer to keep.

    <description>Mean patient satisfaction in McGill Denture Satisfaction Survey was assessed in regard to 9 aspects of the dentures; general satisfaction, chewing efficiency, chewing ability, easiness to clean, stability, comfort and oral condition. Mean of patient satisfaction in each of these 9 aspects will be presented for both cast and laser-sintered dentures.</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked which denture did they prefer to keep after trying both cast and laser-sintered removable partial dentures. The number of patients who preferred each denture will be presented as well as the number of patients who have no preference.</description>

    <description>The master cast was scanned using 3D scanner. In the digital file, the path of insertion was determined using a special software. The survey line was drawn and all undesirable undercuts were eliminated. After that, the entire framework design was built virtually 3 dimensionally using a special software (3Shape Software) according to the specified design in three steps: deciding the contour of the component, building the tissue surface then creating the polished surface. The file was saved in STL file and was transferred to rapid prototyping machine. Framework was produced by selective laser sintering technique using the alloy powder (Sintech Metal).</description>
