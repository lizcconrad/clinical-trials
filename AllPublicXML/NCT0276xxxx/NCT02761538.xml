      The investigators developed the Aviitam® online platform. The purpose of the project is to
      test the medico-economic impact related to the utilization of the Aviitam online platform in
      primary care.

      Primary objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness at 24 months follow-up of the utilization
      of the Aviitam® online software in primary care for people with obesity and at least one
      comorbidity compared to a usual follow-up in primary care.

      Secondary objectives: Weight loss; quality of life ; blood pressure change; changes in lipid
      profile, blood glucose and HbA1c; physician satisfaction; patients satisfaction, profiling of
      patients and data mining analysis on the collected data.

      Method : Overweight &amp; obese patients with associated comorbidities will receive a 24 months
      follow-up to assess the impact of the use of the online platform Aviitam®.

      Practitioners will be randomized by lot between an Aviitam® group and a control group (usual
      care).

      A medico-economic analysis will be conducted with a cost-effectiveness analysis and a budget
      impact analysis.

      With no hypothesis on the primary endpoint, the calculation of the required number of
      subjects was based on the quality of life. 150 patients will be included per group Patients
      of the 2 groups will be assessed at baseline and after 24 months. The first day of each
      month, each patient included in the study will receive a questionnaire to fill online to
      evaluate their health care consumption in the previous month and the EQ5D questionnaire , a
      standardized questionnaire validated in French to assess the effects on health and to be used
      to calculate cost - utility.

      Expected results and perspectives Proving the effectiveness of the Aviitam® online program
      focused on non-drug therapies and therapeutic lifestyle changes for overweight and obesity
      management with reduced health costs, improvement in quality of life, reduction in weight and
      improvement of comorbidities.

      In terms of public health, the use of the platform Aviitam® can be expect to improve
      management of excess body weight and reduced health costs. Furthermore, Aviitam® could be a
      valuable tool to support healthcare professionals in outpatient therapeutic education
      approaches.

      Method : Overweight &amp; obese patients with associated comorbidities (hypertension,
      prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, sleep disorders, past history of CVDs &gt; 6 months,
      stable CVD, peripheral arterial disease) will receive a 24 months follow-up to assess the
      impact of the use of the online platform Aviitam®.

      Practitioners will be randomized by lot between an Aviitam® group and a control group (usual
      care).

      A medico-economic analysis will be conducted with a cost-effectiveness analysis and a budget
      impact analysis.

      With no hypothesis on the primary endpoint, the calculation of the required number of
      subjects was based on the quality of life. 150 patients will be included per group, for a
      total of 300 patients.
