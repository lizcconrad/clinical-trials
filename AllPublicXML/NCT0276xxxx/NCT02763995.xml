  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the main cause of death in Spain. In HIV patients, the
      uncontrolled viral replication, antiretroviral therapy (ART) and coinfections contribute to
      develop metabolic diseases and increase the prevalence of risk factors for CVD. These
      patients are aging which results in a higher probability of comorbidities, increased number
      of medications, possibility of having a negative outcome associated with medication (NOM) and
      increased cardiovascular risk (CVR). Various studies have established that pharmaceutical
      care (PC) results in better control of cardiovascular risk factors.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical care achieved through
      pharmacotherapy follow-up on cardiovascular risk and health related quality of life (HRQoL)
      of HIV patients older than 50.

      Quasi-experimental clinical study, pre-post intervention, performed with one patient cohort.

      Study will be carry out at a tertiary hospital. The population will be constituted of
      patients who receive care from the outpatient department of the pharmacy service in use of
      antiretroviral therapy.

      Variables will be obtained from patients' clinical histories, from dispensing records and
      through interviews with patients.

      Main variables:

        -  cardiovascular risk estimated according to Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE)
           and Registre Gironí del Cor (REGICOR) equations

        -  HRQoL measured by the Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) and Medical Outcomes
           Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) questionnaires.

      Other variables: sociodemographic, clinical, pharmacological, related to CVR, related to NOM
      and to the interventions.

      Interventions will be performed every two months until complete 12 months of follow-up.
      Pharmacotherapy follow-up will be conducted according to the Dader method. The interventions
      will be health education for lifestyle modification, improve adherence and aimed to the
      resolution of NOM and drug-related problems.
