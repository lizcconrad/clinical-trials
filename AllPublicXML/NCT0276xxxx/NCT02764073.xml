  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite impressive improvements in treatment strategies, heart failure (HF) morbidity and
      mortality remains substantially high worldwide. Pulmonary congestion is considered the
      leading cause for hospital admissions and death among patients with HF. Physical examination
      is crucial for titrating medical treatment in these patients, but despite a good specificity
      it is not sensitive enough to detect early elevated cardiac filling pressures.

      The N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a recognized powerful predictor
      for HF prognosis. Recently, cardiotrophin-1 and galectin-3 have been proposed as new relevant
      biomarkers for HF evaluation.

      Echocardiography can be also used to noninvasively measure left ventricular filling
      pressures. Lung ultrasound (LUS) through interstitial B-line evaluation has been recently
      proposed as a bed-side, noninvasive tool to assess interstitial lung water. B-lines correlate
      with NT-proBNP and E/e' levels in patients with acute dyspnea, chronic HF or after a stress
      test. LUS can also identify clinically silent pulmonary edema, suggesting that it may
      complement clinical evaluation to improve hemodynamic profiling and treatment optimization.

      Biompedance is a bedside method for total body fluid status assessment. It defines individual
      fluid status/compartments/overload on the basis of an individual's normal extracellular
      volume and body composition. Recent studies indicate that bioimpedance-derived fluid overload
      indices are independent predictors of mortality in renal failure patients.

      To date, no study has evaluated bioimpedance performance for fluid assessment in HF patients.
      The investigators aim to cross-sectionally compare bioimpedance parameters with clinical
      evaluation, LUS, cardiac biomarkers, and echocardiographic characteristics, in a cohort of
      incident consecutive patients with HF. Two years patients' survival will be evaluated to
      propose the best evaluative algorithm and rank the various methods for prognostic
      significance.

    <description>The technique involves attaching electrodes to the patient's forearm and ipsilateral ankle, with the patient in a supine position. The BCM® measures the body resistance and reactance to electrical currents of 50 discrete frequencies, ranging between 5 and 1000 kHz. Based on a fluid model using these resistances, the extracellular water (ECW), the intracellular water (ICW) and the total body water (TBW) are calculated. All calculations are automatically performed by the software of the BCM® device. Absolute fluid overload (AFO) is is defined as the difference between the expected patient's ECW under normal physiological conditions and the actual ECW, whereas the relative fluid overload (RFO) is defined as the absolute fluid overload AFO to ECW ratio.</description>

    <description>Examinations will be performed in the supine position. Scanning of the anterior and lateral chest will be performed on both sides of the chest, from the second to the fourth (on the right side to the fifth) intercostal spaces, at parasternal to mid-axillary lines. B-lines will be recorded in each intercostal space and were defined as a hyperechoic, coherent US bundle at narrow basis going from the transducer to the limit of the screen. B-lines starting from the pleural line can be either localized or scattered to the whole lung and be present as isolated or multiple artifacts (with a distance 7 mm between 2 artifacts). The sum of B-lines produces a score reflecting the extent of lung water accumulation (0 being no detectable B-line).</description>

    <description>All echocardiographic measurements will be carried out according to the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography by an observer unaware of the lung ultrasound and bioimpedance results. Echocardiographic evaluation will provide information about cardiac anatomy (e.g. volumes, geometry, mass) and function (e.g. left ventricular function and wall motion, valvular function, right ventricular function, pulmonary artery pressure, pericardium).</description>
