    <textblock>
      This study included 20 patients listed for liver transplantation in addition to 20 age- and
      sex- matched controls. Neurological, psychiatric, laboratory and radiological examinations
      were performed for both patients and controls before and 6 months after liver
      transplantation. Assessment of cognitive functions by Trail Making Test A (TMT A), TMT B,
      Digit Symbol Test (DST), and Serial Dotting Test (SDT) was done before and after liver
      transplantation.
