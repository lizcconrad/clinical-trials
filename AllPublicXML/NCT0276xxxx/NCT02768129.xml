  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate the role of central neural pathways in mediating
      chronic pain. The aim of the study is to test the effect of stimulating brain regions that
      are part of a network underlying central pain processing using a non-invasive brain
      stimulation technique, transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). Prior studies have
      used tDCS to target both sensory related cortical areas and those important for higher-order
      representations of pain. This study will target brain regions important for the behavioral
      response to the chronic sensation of pain. The hypothesis is that stimulation of these brain
      regions can modulate not only the affective component of pain, but ultimately also improve
      functioning and quality of life. This hypothesis will be tested by treating study
      participants eighteen and older with chronic low back pain (CLBP) of greater than six months
      using tDCS. To be part of this study, participants must meet all the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria.
