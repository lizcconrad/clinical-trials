    <textblock>
      This pilot and feasibility study is focusing on patients presenting with suspected
      malignancies of the lung and pleura who are considered to be good surgical candidates. The
      primary end-point of the study is to determine the sensitivity of OTL uptake and expression
      in identifying those lung and pleural nodules when excited by an imaging probe. There will be
      a single dose of 0.025 mg/kg for intravenous injection over approximately 60 minutes, two to
      three hours, prior to surgery.
