  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multi-center, single-arm study, planned in 110 patients. The primary objective
      of the study is to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of a magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI)-guided transurethral ultrasound therapy system (TULSA-PRO) intended to ablate prostate
      tissue of patients with localized, organ-confined prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Profound Medical Inc. has developed a novel technology called the MRI-guided transurethral
      ultrasound therapy system (TULSA-PRO). The technology is developed for patients with organ
      confined prostate cancer. The therapeutic endpoint of this technology is thermal coagulation
      of prostate tissue.

      The treatment is conducted within a MRI suite, which enables real-time temperature images of
      the heated region to be acquired as the ultrasonic treatment is delivered. Using MRI
      thermometry during treatment, dynamic temperature feedback control over the intensity of the
      ultrasound beams and rotation of the Ultrasound Applicator can shape the pattern of thermal
      coagulation accurately and precisely in the prostate gland.

      It provides advantages of a non-invasive procedure with short treatment times.
