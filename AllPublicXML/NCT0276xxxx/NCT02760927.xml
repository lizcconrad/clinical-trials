      Assessment of AnchorFast Guard Oral Endotracheal Tube Fastener on Patients Intubated with
      Oral Endotracheal Tubes with Subglottic Suction
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation is the trans laryngeal placement of a tube into the trachea via the
      nose or mouth. Subglottic suctioning, during endotracheal tube securement, is important for
      mechanically-ventilated patients to allow for the clearance of secretions that may accumulate
      during intubation. This protocol examines an enhancement to the current AnchorFast Guard
      device in order for the device to hold a subglottic suctioning lumen in addition to the
      intubation tube.

    <description>The AnchorFast Guard oral endotracheal tube fastener provides a convenient means to hold an oral endotracheal tube securely in place without the use of adhesive tape. The oral endotracheal tube fastener allows repositioning of the tube in either direction along the track without removal of the device.</description>
