      Study hypothesis: Post-processed SDCT images provide additional diagnostic value over
      conventional CT datasets.

      The CT examination would be a clinically-necessary, standard-of-care CT performed as per the
      clinical indication. The protocol and scan parameters for the CT exam will be similar to that
      of an equivalent scan performed with any other CT scanner. There would be no additional
      scanner of injection of any drug specifically for the study. The conventional CT images
      generated by the scanner will be used for clinical purposes as routinely practiced.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Data will be recorded as mean +/- standard deviation for each parameter. Student's t test and Wilcoxon's test will be performed to compare objective and subjective data respectively. In addition, differences on lesion detection and characterization, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of conventional CT and SDCT images will be compared using a receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis. Additionally, agreement between both readers will be evaluated using Cohen´s kappa test (poor agreement for κ ≤ 0.19; fair agreement for κ = 0.2-0.39; moderate agreement for κ = 0.4-0.59, substantial agreement for κ = 0.6-0.79 and very good agreement for κ = 0.8-1.00; 19). A P value of &lt;0.05 will be required for statistical significant difference.</description>
