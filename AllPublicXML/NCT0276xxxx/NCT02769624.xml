  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study investigators propose to explore the effects of a locally delivered
      inhaled pulmonary vasodilator (inhaled treprostinil) on exercise performance, pulmonary blood
      flow, venous pressure response and vascular function in stable Fontan patients. Investigators
      will also assess the effects of resting and acute rises in exercise induced systemic venous
      pressure on liver stiffness and will also assess whether treprostinil will attenuate the
      acute stiffness increase that investigators expect to see. This will be a prospective,
      randomized, double-blinded placebo controlled, crossover trial. Following recruitment and
      informed consent, each participant will undergo three study visits, including baseline
      testing (visit 1), followed by two sets of exercise and vascular function tests (visit 2 and
      visit 3) at CCHMC. Twenty-six patients will be enrolled in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients age 18 years and older

          2. Single ventricle patients status post Fontan procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically unstable: these are patients who are experiencing new cardiovascular
             symptoms such as worsening shortness of breath, new onset arrhythmia, uncontrolled
             heart failure, or evidence of clinically significant cirrhosis or renal failure.

          2. Evidence of Fontan pathway or intra cardiac obstruction as identified on prior
             clinically indicated imaging studies (echocardiography and MRI);

          3. Evidence of left or right systemic ventricular systolic dysfunction with an Ejection
             fraction of &lt;40% on either echocardiogram or MRI from previously documented clinical
             data;

          4. Presence of uncontrolled arrhythmias;

          5. Unable to perform exercise testing for any reason or if deemed by the PI or designee
             that exercise testing would not be in the best interest of the participant

          6. Currently pregnant and/or breastfeeding

          7. Patient unable to provide informed consent

          8. BMI &gt; 30 mg/m2
