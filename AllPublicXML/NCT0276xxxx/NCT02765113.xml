      1. Background: Blepharospasm refers to orbital and periorbital orbicularis muscle
           spontaneous spasmodic contraction. Continuous spasm can be long or short, the
           performance of non spasm will strongly closed repeatedly. At present, the pathogenesis
           of blepharospasm is not clear, in addition, there is no particularly effective
           treatment.

        2. Purpose：compare two different surgical methods, observe the improvement of symptoms and
           prognosis of patients with blepharospasm.

        3. Scientific hypothesis: At present, the pathogenesis of blepharospasm is not clear, but
           clinical patients with blepharospasm showed bilateral eyelid twitching, eyes open
           difficulties and the symptoms are worse when tension, anxiety, insomnia, light
           stimulation and wind outside stimulation. At the same time, in the clinic，the
           investigators found that facial nerve and trigeminal nerve combing can improve the
           clinical symptoms of the patients. Therefore, the investigators speculated that over
           activity were related to clinical symptoms and corneal reflex pathway of blepharospasm
           patients.

        4. Research content: the blepharospasm patients were randomly divided into two groups,
           prospective comparative analysis of two different surgical methods for the treatment of
           blepharospasm. One group of patients were performed facial nerve combing and
           microvascular decompression, the other group of patients were performed facial nerve,
           trigeminal nerve combing with microvascular decompression, to observation of
           postoperative clinical improvement of two groups of patients.

        5. Expected results:To define a surgical method for the treatment of blepharospasm, and to
           promote the use of the academic and clinical practice.
