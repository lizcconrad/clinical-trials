  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NCTT is a prospective, multicenter, observational research network for subjects with
      chronic spinal cord and/or chronic traumatic brain injury.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatment for Spinal Cord Injury and Traumatic Brain Injury focuses on stabilizing
      the patient and preventing secondary injury with the aim of maximizing the best chance of
      recovery. Most patients will show varying amounts of recovery, but, when the injury is
      severe, that recovery is only partial. Enrollment in the NCTT will allow for classification
      and characterization of injury, function, co-morbidities, secondary issues/problems, research
      interests and will serve as a conduit for enrollment into interventional studies.
