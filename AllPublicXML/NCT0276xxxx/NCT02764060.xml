  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to examine in periodontitis patients with visible tongue coating
      the changes in microbial load (aerobic and anaerobic) of the 14 day use of a tongue scraper
      versus the use of a regular toothbrush to clean the tongue.

      Volatile sulphur compounds (VSC's) are the most important causes of bad breath. Since the
      micro-organisms that produce VSC's are also periodopathogens, intuitively, one would think
      that there is a positive correlation between VSC levels in exhaled breath and periodontitis.
      However, not all periodontitis patients have bad breath. A possible explanation can be a
      positive relationship between tongue coating an bad breath. In the past, tongue cleaning was
      already researched in an oral healthy population. This research aimed to examine in
      periodontitis patients with visible tongue coating the changes in microbial load (aerobic and
      anaerobic) of the 14 day use of a tongue scraper versus the use of a regular toothbrush to
      clean the tongue. Additionally changes in tongue coating; and patient perception about tongue
      cleaning was researched.
