    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to administer a cross-sectional survey to directly compare the
      differences patients and physicians hold regarding ovarian cancer prognosis and survival,
      complications arising from treatment, and counseling on advance directives, living wills,
      palliative care, and hospice services. Overall, the project will pinpoint opportunities for
      better patient physician communication regarding prognosis and end-of-life care and allow for
      more informed and tailored decision-making.
