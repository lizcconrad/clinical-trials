      A study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple
      ascending doses of AZD9567.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, randomised, single-blind, multiple ascending dose, double-dummy sequential
      group study in healthy subjects .

      The study is planned to have 6 cohorts with the option to include up to two additional
      cohorts if deemed necessary. Nine subjects participated in the first cohort (7 subjects
      randomised to receive AZD9567 and 2 subjects randomised to receive prednisolone 20 mg)and
      eleven subjects will participate in subsequent 3 cohorts (7 subjects will be randomised to
      receive AZD9567 and 4 subjects randomised to receive prednisolone 20 mg). A cohort 5 was
      included in the study in version 4.0 of the CSP. In this cohort two doses of prednisolone was
      tested, 5 mg and 20 mg. Up to six dose levels of AZD9567 are planned to be tested in the
      study and an additional cohort will be used in case any previous dose needs to be repeated or
      a new lower dose explored (ref CSP 5.0).

      Therefore a maximum of 95 individuals could be included in the study (as stated in version
      5.0 of this protocol). Subjects will be dosed for 5 consecutive days and a follow-up visit
      will occur 10-14 days after the last dose.

         21. Positive screen for drugs of abuse or alcohol at Screening or on admission to the
             clinical unit.

         22. History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing clinically important
             allergy/hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to study
             drugs.

         23. Excessive intake of caffeine containing drinks or food (e.g., coffee, tea, chocolate),
             as judged by the Investigator.

         24. Receipt of live or live attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the first
             administration of IMP.

         25. Use of drugs with enzyme inducing properties such as St John's Wort within 3 weeks
             prior to the first administration of IMP.

         26. Use of any prescribed or non-prescribed medication during the two weeks prior to the
             first administration of IMP or longer if the medication has a long half-life.
             Explanatory note: the prohibited medication includes antacids, analgesics (other than
             paracetamol/acetaminophen), herbal remedies, megadose vitamins (intake of 20 to 600
             times the recommended daily dose) and minerals

         27. Plasma donation within one month of screening or any blood donation/blood loss &gt; 500
             mL during the 3 months prior to screening.

         28. Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been
             approved for marketing) within 3 months or 5 half-lifes, whatever is the longest of
             the first administration of IMP.

             Explanatory note: the period of exclusion begins three months after the final dose or
             one month after the last visit whichever is the longest. Subjects consented and
             screened, but not randomised in this study or a previous phase I study, are not
             excluded.

         29. Vulnerable subject, e.g., kept in detention, protected adult under guardianship,
             trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order.

         30. Involvement of any Astra Zeneca or PAREXEL or study site employee or their close
             relatives.

         31. Judgment by the Investigator that the subject should not participate in the study
             Explanatory note: for example, if the subject has any ongoing or recent (i.e., during
             the screening period) minor medical complaints that may interfere with the
             interpretation of study data, or is considered unlikely to comply with study
             procedures, restrictions and requirements, the subject should not be randomised.

         32. Subject who is a vegan or has medical dietary restrictions.

         33. Subject who cannot communicate reliably with the Investigator/site staff.
