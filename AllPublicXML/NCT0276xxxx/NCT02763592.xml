  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of 5% lidocaine medicated plaster on
      allodynic symptoms of localized neuropathic pain after knee surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial
      comparing 5% lidocaine medicated plaster (5LP) and placebo whether neuropathic pain symptoms
      (dynamic mechanical allodynia, pressure, hot and cold) have a different chronological
      improvement with 5LP compared to placebo. Pain intensity and pain relief, sleep and quality
      of life and osteoarthritis severity are also assessed.
