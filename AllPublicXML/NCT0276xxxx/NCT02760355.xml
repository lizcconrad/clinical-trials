  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, the investigators plan to treat patients with chronic hepatitis C due to
      HCV genotype 3 infection using an interferon-free regimen consisting in the administration of
      ribavirin and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir - a combination of a nucleotide RNA polymerase inhibitor
      with a non-structural protein 5A inhibitor. Patients will undergo a euglycemic
      hyperinsulinemic clamp, using tracers, and indirect calorimetry to assess whether the viral
      suppression induced by this regimen will be capable of reversing the glucose metabolic
      alterations induced by HCV in both the liver and extrahepatic compartments. Adipose and
      muscle tissue biopsies will also be performed to assess some specific molecular changes
      induced by HCV.

    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies have shown that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces insulin
      resistance, which may progress to type 2 diabetes in susceptible individuals. Despite the
      fact that HCV infects the liver, insulin resistance in these patients appears to originate
      mostly in extrahepatic tissues, particularly in muscles and adipose tissues. The aim of this
      trial is to assess the relative contribution of hepatic vs. extrahepatic tissues to the
      pathogenesis of insulin resistance in chronic hepatitis C. To do so, 20 patients will be
      enrolled in a single-arm, open-label study. Study subjects will include 10 patients without
      any feature of the metabolic syndrome, and another 10 with the metabolic syndrome. All
      patients will receive the same regimen consisting of Ledipasvir 90 mg/Sofosbuvir 400 mg, one
      tablet once a day, associated with body weight-dose adjusted, 200 mg-tablets of ribavirin
      (1,000 mg in two administration in patients &lt;75 Kg of body weight, or 1,200 mg in two
      administrations for those &gt;75 Kg) for 12 weeks. Insulin resistance will be investigated at
      baseline (before treatment) and after 6 weeks of treatment using a euglycemic
      hyperinsulinemic clamp with deuterated glucose: results obtained at 6 weeks - i.e. at the
      time of complete viral suppression - will be compared to basal conditions i.e. before
      antiviral treatment.
