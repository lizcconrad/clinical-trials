      The purpose of this research study is to determine if using HeartMath's biofeedback with
      emWave Pro daily mindfulness practice: is a practical and effective intervention to improve
      job satisfaction and performance of physicians, advance practice clinicians, and nurses;
      improves patient satisfaction; and affects resting blood pressure and heart rate when
      comparing baseline to follow-up measures.

      This research study seeks to determine if using a daily mindfulness practice with EmWave Pro
      HeartMath helps to achieve coherence through various standardized, interactive mindfulness
      techniques, such as guided meditations focusing on positive emotions, breathing, and imagery.
      The investigators seek to determine if using HeartMath's biofeedback with emWave Pro daily
      mindfulness practice: is a practical and effective intervention to improve job satisfaction
      and performance of physicians, advance practice clinicians, and nurses; improves patient
      satisfaction; and affects resting blood pressure and heart rate when comparing baseline to
      follow-up measures.

      All participants will attend a one-time one-hour training session to explain cardiac
      coherence and how to use emWave Pro. Participants will be randomized to be either in the
      treatment group or the control group. Participants will use emWave Pro for at least one
      5-minute session daily, Monday through Friday. The treatment participants will use it daily
      for all 12 weeks. The control participants will use it daily only for weeks 7-12. The
      treatment group will have the added component of weekly visits during the first 6 weeks of
      the study from an investigator and the research coordinator. The purpose of the weekly visits
      is focused on reinforcing accountability and achievement of coherence.

      The participants will also complete questionnaires at baseline, week 6, and week 12 about
      demographics, job satisfaction, and job performance. Participants' blood pressure and heart
      rate will be collected at those three time points. Additionally, information about
      participants' use of HeartMath, sick days, and patient satisfaction will be collected after
      week 12.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline, week 6, and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form (MSQ-SF) uses a 5-point Likert-type scale with 20 items. Responses range from 1 (very satisfied) - 5 (very dissatisfied) so the lower the score the higher the job satisfaction and the higher the score the lower the job satisfaction.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline, week 6, and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) has a range of scores between 0 and 40. A higher score indicates more stress.</description>

    <description>The Medical Office Survey on Patient Safety (MOSOPS) is a 51-item survey that measures 12 domains of office culture conceptually related to patient safety. The lower the overall score the less job performance and the higher the score the better the job performance.</description>

    <description>The patient satisfaction surveys are used by clinics in the UF Physicians Faculty (UFP) Practice and are managed by UFP administration. Patients are asked questions about rating their visit, instructions and explanations given during the visit, appointment scheduling, wait time, customer service, and demographics.</description>
