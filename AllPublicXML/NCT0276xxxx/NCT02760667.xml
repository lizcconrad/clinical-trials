  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of induction chemotherapy followed by
      transoral surgical treatment and neck dissection, in definitive management of moderately
      advanced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. The surgical treatment will carry out
      Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS) or Transoral Laser Microsurgery (TLM) for the primary tumor,
      and neck dissection for the management of cervical lymph nodes.

      The primary outcome measure will be disease specific survival (DSS). The secondary oncologic
      outcome measures will be locoregional control, relapse free survival, overall survival, and
      Quality of Life (QOL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for advanced (stage III and IV) oropharyngeal squamous cell
      carcinoma are concomitant chemoradiation, or surgery followed by adjuvant radiation therapy
      with or without concomitant chemotherapy. These approaches have persistent and significant
      lifelong side effects and sequella related to treatment, and in particular radiotherapy. The
      side effects of radiotherapy (augmented with concomitant chemotherapy) include soft tissue
      fibrosis, loss of salivary function, dry mouth, life long disturbed taste function, poor
      dental health with rapidly decaying teeth, dysfunction of swallowing, significant loss of the
      mobility of the base of tongue and pharyngeal constrictors, loss of laryngeal elevation,
      esophageal stricture, and at times severe side effects such as soft tissue necrosis or
      osteoradionecrosis of the mandible. About 10% of the patients undergoing chemoradiation for
      oropharyngeal cancer develop long term swallowing dysfunction with feeding tube dependency.
      As a result , patient's quality of life (QOL) is adversely affected. Improvements in the side
      effect profile of treatment, the functional outcome, and the QOL remain very important areas
      of advancement in treating this patient population. Improvements in functional outcome need
      to be achieved while maintaining or improving the oncologic outcome and cure rates for
      cancer, compared to the standard of care.

      Use of new Taxane based chemotherapy along with Platinum drugs (Cisplatin and Carboplatin) in
      high dose neoadjuvant setting, coupled with novel minimally invasive Transoral Laser
      Microsurgery (TLM) and Transoral Robotic Assisted Surgery (TORS), allows potential for
      improved oncologic outcome as well as avoidance of long term sequalla of high dose radiation
      therapy to head and neck. These transoral surgical approaches (TLM and TORS) provide improved
      functional outcome compared with traditional open composite resections and complex
      reconstructive algorithms for oropharynx. TLM and TORS are currently in clinical use for
      early (stage T1 and T2 with N0 or N+ve) oropharyngeal cancer.

      An area not adequately or at all investigated in treating moderately advanced oropharyngeal
      cancer is combining neoadjuvant high dose chemo-induction followed by minimally invasive
      transoral surgery (TLM and TORS) and neck dissection as the definitive treatment.

      This approach has the potential for far improved functional outcome by avoiding short and
      more importantly long term and permanent sequella of radiation therapy in oropharyngeal
      cancer treatment. This approach is a new paradigm in treatment of oropharyngeal cancer, and
      can significantly improve the functional outcome of cancer treatment.
