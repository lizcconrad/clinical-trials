  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present trial will be performed to evaluate whether SHR1020 in combination with docetaxel
      in patients with Local Advanced or Metastatic or recurrent Non Squamous NSCLC is more
      effective as compared to placebo in combination with docetaxel. A secondary aim is to obtain
      safety information as well as information on quality of life of patients treated with SHR1020
      in combination with docetaxel.
