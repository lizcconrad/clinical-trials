      Comparison of participants in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with observational data
      from patients operated in Sweden during the same period of time. The primary objective is to
      compare effects from a complex surgical intervention from RCT and observational data.

  <detailed_description>

      Randomised controlled trials (RCT) are &quot;golden standard&quot; for assessing interventions in
      medical science. Due to ethical or practical reasons, RCTs may however not always be
      feasible. The study objective was to test if the results from the RCT differ from
      observational data in a setting with a complex surgical intervention.

      Using the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry database we intend to compare patients
      operated with laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery within a register based RCT from May 1st
      2010 until Nov 14th 2011, with all patients operated with the same procedure registered in
      the database during the same period of time.

      Primary end-point measures are severe complications within 30 days (safety outcome) and
      surgery for small bowel obstruction (efficacy outcome) within 4 years.
