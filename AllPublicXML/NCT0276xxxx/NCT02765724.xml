  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, parallel-group, single-dose study of the PK and safety of 400 mg
      pacritinib administered orally to patients with stable chronic liver disease and healthy
      control subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All study participants will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility for the
      study. All screening evaluations must be performed within 28 days of pacritinib dosing (Day
      1). Assignment of patients to each hepatic impairment group will be defined by Child-Pugh
      Clinical Assessment Score at the time of Screening. Group 3 patients will not be dosed until
      at least 2 patients combined from Groups 1 and 2 have completed the study (Day 8). Healthy
      subjects will be enrolled after hepatic impairment accrual is complete to allow for age-,
      gender- and body mass index- (BMI) matching with the hepatic impairment population.
      Participants will be admitted to the study site on Day -1 (i.e., Check-in). On Day 1, upon
      receipt of all baseline safety evaluation results and confirmation of eligibility, study
      participants will be administered a single dose of 400 mg pacritinib orally under fasting
      conditions. Fasting will start 10 hours prior to pacritinib administration and continue for
      an additional 4 hours after administration. Following administration of pacritinib,
      participants will remain confined to the study site for 168 hours (8 days) after pacritinib
      dosing for collection of blood for PK and safety assessments.
