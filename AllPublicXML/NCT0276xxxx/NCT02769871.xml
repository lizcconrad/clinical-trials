  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to examine the effect on smoking cessation rate by showing stroke
      patients who are active smokers images of their strokes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that showing actual images of a patient's stroke to the
      participant on either brain CT or MRI will be a similarly easy to understand quantification
      of damage done to the participant's body. Given the link between smoking and stroke risk, the
      investigators believe that providing this imaging in addition to standard smoking cessation
      education may improve rates of smoking cessation after stroke. If this proves true, addition
      of a patient's neuroimaging to standard post-stroke smoking cessation education would be an
      easy method to improve smoking cessation rates in stroke patients, at minimal cost.

    <description>Standardized smoking cessation counseling will be provided at the participant's initial interview. Participants will be provided pamphlets from the National Stroke Association and the American Heart Association regarding risk factor reduction. Packets will include general information on risks associated with smoking along with the benefits of cessation, and methods to quit. Pamphlets will include Life's Simple 7 (American Heart Association, 2014) and Be Smoke Free: Facts about Smoking and Stroke Risk (National Stroke Association, 2009). Counseling will be scripted and standardized to ensure similar language with all participants.</description>

    <description>Participants in the intervention group will undergo standardized smoking cessation counseling (as offered to the active comparator group) and will also be shown computer images of head CT or brain MRI (DWI/FLAIR series) of their strokes. Basic orientation to neuroimaging (laterality, positioning, parts of the brain) will be provided first, and then the image of the stroke itself will be reviewed. Participants will be provided with a paper copy of the slice demonstrating the largest volume of stroke to keep. In comparison, participants will also be shown images of a normal healthy, and images of a patient with recurrent strokes due to smoking. Participants will be told that smoking cessation would help to prevent additional stroke, but that it would not repair the damage already done, as visualized on the neuroimaging.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18

          -  Active smoker, as defined: at least 100 cigarettes in their entire life, must have
             smoked cigarette at least once in 4 days prior to onset of stroke

          -  Primary ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke identified on neuroimaging (MRI DWI/ADC or CT
             of brain)

          -  Onset of stroke symptoms within 30 days to time of recruitment

          -  Capacity to comprehend counseling data: Each participant will be given a cognitive
             screening test to assess the ability to comprehend and accurately answer the medical
             history questionnaire (MMSE). If the participant fails this test (score &lt; 23), they
             will be excluded.

          -  Patients discharged home or short term rehab with expectation of returning home within
             the study period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients whose stroke deficits clinically prevent them from reasonably being
             physically able to continue to smoke, such as bilateral upper extremity paresis,
             tracheostomy, GCS ≥9

          -  Patients with sensory aphasia that impairs comprehension

          -  Subarachnoid hemorrhage

          -  Transient ischemic attack

          -  Other cause of cerebral ischemia or hemorrhage not defined as primary ischemic or
             hemorrhagic stroke (i.e. hemorrhagic metastases)

          -  Patients whose stroke symptoms started &gt;30 days from time of enrollment

          -  Patients discharged to acute rehab, long term acute care hospital or hospice who are
             unlikely to have access to cigarettes

          -  Patients unable to complete cognitive screening test for whom an appropriate proxy
             does not exist

          -  Patients who do not speak fluent English (given that the study largely revolves around
             oral education on smoking cessation, clear communication between participant and
             coordinator must be possible)
