  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this project is to to quantify the physiology of neonatal drug
      withdrawal and develop non-pharmacological techniques to help improve the therapeutic
      management of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Novel approaches to diagnosing and treating Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) are needed for
      reducing prolonged pharmacological management, minimizing hospitalization and improving
      developmental outcomes in drug exposed newborns. This study seeks to examine the physiology
      and symptoms of drug withdrawal (e.g., irritability marked by movement activity;
      cardio-respiratory instabilities) in infants exposed to drugs in utero and test whether
      sensory stimuli (tactile, auditory) reduce dysregulated systems in the withdrawing infant.

      Candidates at-risk for NAS due to fetal drug exposure will be identified to investigators by
      the infant's Attending physician. Investigators will use a modified-consecutive sampling
      technique, restricted by equipment and personnel availability, for enrolling infants.
      Participants will be studied throughout their hospitalization. Effects of stimulation will be
      examined at different stages of withdrawal. Efficacy of stimulation will be examined as a
      potential complementary treatment of NAS.

    <description>Prospective, Within-Subject Design. Compare effects of SVS to no SVS on physiology of withdrawal within each infant. Each infant serves as his/her own control and receives periods of SVS and periods of no SVS. SVS is alternated in intervals between continuous stimulation (ON) and no stimulation (OFF) throughout inter-feed intervals. The order of the ON-OFF cycles is randomized across subjects and counterbalanced between feeding periods within subjects.</description>
