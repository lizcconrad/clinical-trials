  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, controlled phase IV clinical trial among postmenopausal patients
      with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.The main purpose is to compare the effects of
      steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) exemestane and non-steroidal AIs on the lipid levels of
      breast cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study subjects are composed of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast
      cancer who have received exemestane, anastrozole or letrozole followed by testing of safety
      variables such as low-density lipoprotein- cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride(TC), total
      cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol(HDL), blood calcium, transaminase and
      fasting plasma glucose at different time intervals in two years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathologic analysis verifies to be early-stage invasive breast cancer while
             immunohistochemistry shows estrogen receptor(ER) and/or progesterone receptor(PR)
             positive (ER/PR positive is defined that &gt;1% of cells are positive).

          2. The patients have received surgery for breast cancer and recovered well for an
             interval of at least 1 week.

          3. The patients have received post-operational adjuvant chemotherapy and/or adjuvant
             radiotherapy whereas the interval of chemotherapy and/or adjuvant radiotherapy is more
             than 2 weeks.

          4. The postmenopausal women have been confirmed to be to menopausal as defined in NCCN
             guidelines(including post bilateral oophorectomy; age≥60 year-old; age≤60 year-old,
             menopause for more than 1 year and plasma Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and
             estradiol levels meet the menopausal scope).

          5. Do not receive concomitant endocrine therapy, e.g. drug-induced menopause, tamoxifen.

          6. The patients do not have severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction.

          7. ECOG score: 0-1

          8. The patients have enough organ function and meet the scope of aromatase
             inhibitors(AIs) therapy. The laboratory test indexes must comply with the following
             requirements:

             Blood routine: neutrophil≥1.5G/L, platelet count ≥75G/L, hemoglobin ≥100g/L Liver
             function: serum bilirubin ≤ 2 times the upper limit of normal value; ALT and AST≤3
             times the upper limit of normal value; Renal function: serumcreatinine≤140μmol/L

          9. Serum low density lipoprotein-cholesterol(LDL-C) value &lt;3.37mmol/L

         10. Imaging examination identifies none of local recurrence or distal metastasis.

         11. No other combined malignancy.

         12. The patients have good compliance to the therapy and follow-up to be scheduled and are
             able to understand the study protocol and sign the Informed Consent Form.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. The patients are not qualified to receive the adjuvant endocrine therapy with AIs.

          2. The patients previously received other endocrine therapy (e.g. tamoxifen) simultaneity
             or the treatment with AIs (excluding those with a course of less than 3 months)

          3. The patients received or are receiving the lipid-lowering therapy.

          4. The patients suffer from other combined malignancy.

          5. The patients have uncontrollable mental illness.

          6. The patients experience severe cardiovascular diseases in the recent 6 months (e.g.
             unstable angina, chronic heart failure, uncontrollable hypertension &gt;150/90 mmHg,
             myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular disorders).
