  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this project is to Compare new msCS and standard DSC-PWI methods in GBM
      patients undergoing post-operative MRI for monitoring of tumor progression.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will compare the novel to the standard DSC-PWI methods in twenty five GBM
      patients to determine whether novel method improves image quality in tumor regions. We will
      also compare accuracy of pseudoprogression (PsP) vs. early progressive disease (ePD)
      determinations by the two techniques. If successful, the project will culminate in a novel
      imaging method sequence optimized to monitor progression and guide treatment decisions in
      post-operative GBM patients.

        A total of 25 patients diagnosed with GBM will be enrolled and stratified by the
        methylation status of their tumor; 17 MGMT-unmethylated and 8 MFMT-methylated will be
        enrolled.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histology: Glioblastoma (grade 4 astrocytoma)

          -  Standard-of-care, post-gd T1w image changes suggestive or consistent with of
             progression.

          -  Standard-of-care MRI included conventional DSC-PWI without unexpected technical
             difficulties.

          -  Methylation status of tumor available in medical record.

          -  Able to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications either to 3T MRI (e.g. certain metallic and electronic implants,
             claustrophobia) or IV gadolinium contrast (allergy, pregnancy, breast-feeding, renal
             insufficiency). Screening for these contraindications will be based on history only
             (as it is for all routine outpatient clinical MRI at UWHC).

          -  Significant physical or mental disease which would preclude successful compliance and
             participation in the study or, in the opinion of the principal investigator, or
             co-investigator, constitute a hazard, such that enrollment in the study would not be
             in the patient's best interest.

          -  Special subjects such as minors, mentally disabled persons, or prisoners.
