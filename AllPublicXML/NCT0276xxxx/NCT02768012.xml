      Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction (AISD) affects the majority of women taking
      antidepressants and reduces medication compliance: however there is a paucity of
      evidence-based strategies for the management of this condition. Mindfulness-based cognitive
      therapy (MBCT) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of non-antidepressant-induced
      sexual dysfunction and may be beneficial in the treatment of AISD. The investigators propose
      a randomized, controlled, proof-of-principle trial to establish preliminary evidence of
      efficacy of MBCT in AISD and to inform the design of a larger trial to evaluate its
      effectiveness

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized, controlled, proof-of-principle trial to establish
      preliminary evidence of efficacy of MBCT in AISD and to inform the design of a larger trial
      to evaluate its effectiveness.

      2. Objectives

        1. To provide preliminary evidence of efficacy of MBCT in the management of AISD.

        2. To establish the feasibility of conducting a larger RCT of MBCT in AISD by assessing
           recruitment, attendance and retention rates.

        3. To determine the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the Changes in
           Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ-14) and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).

        4. To gain initial estimates of variability for sample size calculation for future trials
           of interventions in this patient population.

      Study design: Randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial. There will be two treatments: a
      mindfulness-based group intervention and a wait-list control. Randomization will be 2:1
      (MBCT: WLC). This will be an open-label single center study.

      Procedures: Ethics approval will be obtained from the University of British Columbia (UBC)
      Clinical Research Ethics Board (CREB). Upon referral to the UBC sexual medicine clinic, women
      are assessed by a clinician with expertise in sexual medicine. Those diagnosed with AISD, and
      deemed as likely eligible, are informed about the study and invited to meet with the study
      coordinator who will assess study criteria and provide more detail about the study
      procedures. If the patient agrees to participation, she will first read the consent form and
      accept it. The coordinator will then email her a direct link to the online survey. Upon
      accessing the link, she will then be routed to the online questionnaire.

    <description>The researchers will calculate an 80% confidence interval for the between group difference on change in CSFQ-14 score pre to post intervention using a linear mixed model that includes treatment, time and time-by-treatment as fixed effects and patient as a random effect. If the confidence interval excludes 0 the researchers will consider this preliminary evidence of efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Estimation of the minimal clinically important improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>At treatment completion (8 weeks) patients will be asked to assess their response to MBCT treatment on a five-point descriptive scale (none = no good at all, treatment was ineffective; poor = some effect but unsatisfactory; fair = reasonable effect but could be better; good = satisfactory effect but still some problems; excellent = ideal response, sexual dysfunction gone). The minimal clinically important improvement for the CSFQ-14 and the FSFI will be determined from the group reporting a &quot;good&quot; response following established methods.</description>
