    <textblock>
      Cervix cancer is a major global health concern. A way to screen and immediately treat
      precancerous lesions (Screen-and-Treat) is greatly needed. Developed by MobileOCT, polarized
      difference imaging and conventional imaging are used to identify suspicious lesions. We aim
      to compare this non-invasive method with colposcopy. Patients at the Dickens Clinic will have
      3-5 minutes of non-invasive imaging before colposcopy. Pathology will be compared both to
      colposcopy impression versus MobileOCT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects capable of giving informed consent or have an acceptable surrogate capable of
             giving consent on subjects behalf.

          -  Subjects are 18 years of age or older

          -  Subjects are scheduled for colposcopy clinic based on screening with abnormal pap
             smear or have repeat colposcopy indicated for specific clinical indications, based off
             of American Society of Cosposcopy and Cytology.

          -  Subjects are women.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Males (males do not have a cervix and thus cannot undergo colposcopy).
