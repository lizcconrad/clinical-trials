  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:The purpose of this research study is to test the effectiveness of the standard
      high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) on days 1 through 5 followed by a single dose of pembrolizumab
      on day 14 as induction therapy in patients with relapsed and refractory acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML). Patients who achieve a response to treatment will continue on the study drug
      (pembrolizumab) every 3 weeks for up to 2 years maintenance therapy.

      Purpose:This is a study about a new investigative drug, pembrolizumab (MK-3475) that is being
      studied in a clinical research trial together with standard chemotherapy (HiDAC) in relapsed
      and refractory AML. The study will also explore the association between potential immune
      biomarkers and clinical outcomes with pembrolizumab; therefore all patients will have blood
      and bone marrow samples collected before and after treatment to determine the dynamic nature
      of immune signatures pre and post-treatment.

      Primary Objective

      1. Estimate the objective overall rate of CR (CR+CRi) for age-adjusted HiDAC (age &lt;60 years:
      2 gm/m2 IV Q12hours days 1-5; age &gt;60 years: 1.5 gm/m2 IV Q12hours days 1-5) followed by
      pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 14 in relapsed and refractory AML patients

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Estimate the rate of unacceptable toxicity associated with HiDAC followed by
           pembrolizumab as induction therapy

        2. Estimate the objective overall response rates (PR+CR+CRi) for HiDAC followed by
           pembrolizumab.

        3. Characterize the toxicity associated with HiDAC followed by pembrolizumab as induction
           therapy

        4. Characterize the toxicity associated with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3weeks when used as
           monotherapy maintenance after an initial response to induction phase HiDAC followed by
           pembrolizumab

        5. Estimate the relapse-free survival (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients
           receiving maintenance pembrolizumab

        6. Estimate the overall survival (OS) of patients who received induction phase treatment.
