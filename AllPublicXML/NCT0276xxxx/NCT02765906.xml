    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a life-threatening condition unique to pregnancy which occurs in 5-8% of all
      pregnancies. It contributes to a large proportion of maternal mortality worldwide and these
      deaths largely result from delayed diagnosis.

      A number of studies have shown that patient knowledge about preeclampsia is poor and that
      patient education can improve patient awareness. The investigators would like to find out
      what type of patient education is most effective. The investigators propose a three arm
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) where the first arm will receive a graphic card depicting
      signs and symptoms of preeclampsia, the second arm will watch an educational video on
      preeclampsia, and the third arm will have no visual form of patient education; they will be
      exposed only to the counseling they receive with their routine prenatal care. The card and
      video were both developed by the Preeclampsia Foundation and in a prior RCT the card was
      shown to be a useful educational intervention. This study would expand on this previous data
      by comparing the graphic card to an informational video available on the Preeclampsia
      Foundation's website
      (http://www.preeclampsia.org/component/allvideoshare/video/featured/7-symptoms-every-pregnant
      -woman-should-know?Itemid=479). The effectiveness of this video has not yet been tested as an
      educational tool. Patients in the arm receiving the graphic card for educational intervention
      will be allowed to keep this card. Primiparous patients seen in the ambulatory prenatal
      clinic and Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) clinic will be enrolled at 18w0d-24w6d gestation. At
      the time of enrollment baseline preeclampsia knowledge, demographics, and patient anxiety
      before and after initial exposure to the educational interventions will be assessed. A follow
      up assessment of knowledge of preeclampsia will be obtained at 32-36 weeks gestation to
      measure retention of knowledge. Patient medical records will be reviewed for delivery
      outcomes which will be recorded and compared.

      This is a three-arm prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate patient knowledge of
      preeclampsia after different forms of education. In the first arm participants will be given
      a graphic card depicting signs and symptoms of preeclampsia; they will be permitted to keep
      this card. In the second arm participants will be shown an educational video on preeclampsia.
      In the third arm participants will have no visual form of patient education; they will be
      exposed only to the counseling they receive with their routine prenatal care. Participants
      will be primiparous patients recruited from the prenatal clinic at 18-24 weeks gestation. At
      time of consent, baseline anxiety assessment with the STAI-6 questionnaire will be obtained
      followed by a short demographic survey. Participants will be given a short survey on
      preeclampsia knowledge. They will then be randomized to either preeclampsia education with
      educational video, graphic card or no visual educational intervention. The participants will
      be randomized by computer-generated randomization schema (1:1:1). Those randomized to the
      card will be given a few minutes to review the card. Those randomized to the educational
      video will watch the video which runs two minutes and 45 seconds. For those randomized to no
      further intervention, the initial interview will then be over. For the first two arms
      receiving the graphic card or watching the video, the STAI 6 assessment will be
      re-administered immediately after the educational intervention and then the interview will be
      over. Medical record numbers from every participant will be collected for chart review of
      demographics, preeclampsia risk factors, pregnancy follow up (including triage calls and
      visits) and delivery outcomes. The participants will be approached again at 32w0d-36w6d
      gestation to complete a follow up preeclampsia knowledge survey to assess retention of
      knowledge. This follow-up survey will be collected via phone interview. Participants in the
      control arm receiving routine prenatal care will also complete a follow up knowledge survey
      as a control.

    <description>The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a reliable and sensitive measure of anxiety at a given moment in time. A shorter form, the STAI-6, was created for efficiency and has been verified as comparable in reliability and validity to the full STAI assessment (Marteau, TM and Beckker, H. The development of a six-item short form of the State Scale of the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). British Journal of Clinical Psychology. 1991: 31: 301-306).</description>

    <description>A randomized controlled trial comparing patient education on preeclampsia with a graphic card vs. patient education with a written pamphlet vs. no patient education showed that patient education improved significantly when patients were provided with a graphic card depicting signs and symptoms of preeclampsia and that this improvement occurred regardless of health literacy score (You WB, Wolf MS, Bailey SC, Grobman WA. Improving patient understanding of preeclampsia: a randomized controlled trial. American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology. 2012;206:431.e1-431.e5.). The graphic card is now available on the Preeclampsia Foundation's website (http://www.preeclampsia.org/market-place/educational-illustrated-signs-symptoms-pad-detail).</description>
