  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the effects of an integrated program of touch-observation and task-based
      mirror therapy on sensorimotor function in nerve injury patients. Before the return of
      protective sense (Value of Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test &gt; 4.31), half of the
      participants received 15 minutes of mirror therapy program, followed by 20 minutes of regular
      hand therapy and 20 minutes of physiotherapy.While the other half received 15 minutes
      protective sensory reeducation programs, 20 minutes of regular hand therapy and 20 minutes of
      physiotherapy in each treatment session. Once the patients had regained the protective sense
      (Value of Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test &lt; 4.31), the discriminative sensory reeducation
      program was started for the participants in both groups. The hypothesis was that using the
      mirror therapy for sensorimotor reeducation in the early phase after nerve repair would yield
      better results with regard to the returning of sensation, sensorimotor control ability and
      hand function than using a classical reeducation program alone.

    <description>The experimental group received 15 minutes of touch-observation and task-based mirror therapy program, followed by 20 minutes of regular hand therapy and 20 minutes of physiotherapy in each treatment session before the returning of the touch of a Semmes-Weinstein monofilament marked 4.31. Once the patients had regained the protective sense (SWM &lt; 4.31), the mirror therapy program was replaced with a discriminative sensory reeducation program. Treatment duration was 12 weeks, at a frequency of three sessions per week.</description>
