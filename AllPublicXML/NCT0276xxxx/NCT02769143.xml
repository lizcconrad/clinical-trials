  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women in the postmenopausal period suffer hormonal changes that contribute to a number of
      negative factors to health, such as reduced bone mineral density and loss of muscle mass,
      which contribute to the increased incidence of falls and consequent risk of fractures. Among
      the possibilities to alleviate these symptoms are mainly drug treatment and the systematic
      practice of physical exercise. Exercise stands out for not offering adverse effects. One form
      of exercise that has been recently investigated is the whole body vibration, another form of
      exercise well accepted by the population is the Pilates method.

      Taking into account the lack of literature on the benefits of vibration training; and also
      the Pilates method on bone mineral density, muscle strength, flexibility, postural balance,
      fear of falling and the quality of life of postmenopausal women, explains the importance of
      this work.

      Women in the postmenopausal period suffer hormonal changes that contribute to a number of
      negative factors to health, such as reduced bone mineral density and loss of muscle mass,
      which contribute to the increased incidence of falls and consequent risk of fractures. Among
      the possibilities to alleviate these symptoms are mainly drug treatment and the systematic
      and regular physical exercise. However, drug treatment primarily involves hormone replacement
      therapy, which is associated with increased risk of heart disease, stroke and breast cancer.
      Thus, exercise stands out for not offering adverse effects, however, when it comes to bone
      metabolism, it is not yet clear what type of exercise is the most effective for women in the
      postmenopausal period.

      One form of physical exercise that has recently been investigated is the whole-body vibration
      (WBV), characterized by individual placement on a vibrating plate capable of transmitting
      vertical acceleration for the musculoskeletal system, however, the intensity (frequency and
      magnitude) ideal to allow increased bone metabolism has not been established and remain
      controversial.

      Other forms of exercise have been recommended for postmenopausal women, such as those of
      muscular endurance. Exercises involving strength training, using weight can contribute to the
      improvement of bone mineral density of women in the postmenopausal period. Another form of
      exercise that also offers endurance is the Pilates method. However, the effects of this
      technique on bone mineral density, has not been investigated, despite having shown potential
      contribution on the variables pain, functional capacity and quality of life in postmenopausal
      women.

      This study is justified because there are still shortages of literature and evidence about
      the benefits of vibration training; and also Pilates, on bone mineral density in
      postmenopausal women. There are also still little information about how much vibration
      training can influence muscle strength, flexibility, postural balance, fear of falling and
      the population's quality of life in question.

    <measure>Bone mineral density</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>To analyze the bone mass of the femoral neck and lumbar spine (L1-L4) will use the device-ray Absorptiometry Dual Energy X (DXA) HOLOGIC, DQR-1000 PLUS model. The technique is based on the attenuation by the patient's body, a radiation beam generated by an X-ray source with two power levels, and exposure to radiation is lower than that of a conventional X-ray examination. The technique allows to estimate bone mass in whole and body segment. The results are transmitted to the computer that is connected to the device.
Bone mineral density (BMD) is expressed as absolute values (g / cm2 grams of bone mineral content per area or analyzed bone cm2).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>The muscle strength of the lower limbs will be measured through the movements of extension and knee flexion (concentric / concentric) with the Biodex System 4.0 equipment (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY), using to the extent the number less preferably with three tries, five repetitions each at an angular velocity of 60 and 180 degrees per second (60º / s and 180º / s). Among the attempts will be respected 30 seconds of rest. Will be considered for analysis, peak isokinetic torque (PT) and total work (TW), expressed in newtons per meter (Nm) and joules (J) respectively. Prior to the test, the device will be calibrated following the manufacturer's standards. The heating will be held for five minutes in an upright stationary bike with light load (25 watts) and comfortable speed (50 revolutions per minute).</description>

    <measure>Flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>For analysis of the flexibility instrument will be used Fleximeter (Institute Code Research, São Paulo, Brazil), for the flexion and extension of the trunk. For the trunk flexion movement, the volunteer should remain standing, with extended knees, bent arms, hands resting on the neck. Fleximeter will be positioned laterally in the thoracic region, with the display facing the evaluator, the right side of the trunk. With voluntary upright, the evaluator should reset the Fleximeter and later support the hands on the knees of voluntary in order to preclude the bending thereof. Following the voluntary hold the maximum flexion of the trunk, holding this position for a few seconds so that the evaluator performs the reading range of motion. For the trunk extension movement, the procedures will be the same, however, voluntary hold the maximum extension of the trunk.</description>

    <measure>Postural balance</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>For assessment of postural balance static will be used a force platform, BIOMEC 400 model (EMG System of Brazil Ltda., São Paulo). The assessor will explain the test procedures for voluntary, which will have a moment of familiarization with the equipment and the test will run. Following the participants carry out the balancing task with bipedal support, (with eyes open and eyes closed), semi-tandem (with eyes open and then with eyes closed) and one-leg (with eyes open). 30 seconds three attempts will be made with equal rest time (30 seconds) there between. The order of execution of each task (bipedal, single leg and semi-tandem) will be randomized. For further analysis of the data, the average of attempts is used. The volunteers should be barefoot, loose arms and relaxed beside the body and the following head positioned horizontally at ground level, being oriented to look at a fixed target (white paper circle with 3 cm in diameter) positioned in the wall at a distance of 2 meters</description>

    <measure>The Timed Up and Go test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be used for analysis of functional mobility and the risk of falls. marking will be placed on the floor measuring three meters from the front of a chair with arms. The volunteer will be oriented that when said the word &quot;already&quot; should get up from the chair, normally walk to the end marker, turn and walk back to the chair, sitting down again. The timer will be triggered to be said the word &quot;already&quot; and stopped at the time the volunteer sit in the chair. The shorter the time taken for completion of this course, the better the result of the test (less than 10 seconds is considered low risk for falls; between 10 and 20 seconds, medium risk of falls; above 20 seconds a high risk of falls). Three attempts will be performed and only the best will be considered.</description>

    <measure>Fear Falls</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of the fear of falling will be held across the range Falls Efficacy Scale - International (FES-I) in your translated and adapted for the Brazilian population, consisting of 16 questions that identify concern about the possibility of falling in daily activities, outdoor activities and social participation, their total score ranges between 16 and 64 points, so that higher scores indicate greater concern about falling. It demonstrates good reliability and internal consistency with values similar to the original version, considered appropriate to assess the fear of falling in the population of elderly Brazilians.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>For the quality of life will be used the Brazilian version of the SF-36 questionnaire. This questionnaire consists of 11 questions and 36 items covering eight components (domains or dimensions), represented by functional capacity (ten items), physical (four items), pain (two items), general health (five items), vitality (four items), social functioning (two items), emotional aspects (three items) and mental health (five items). The individual receives a score in each domain, ranging from 0 to 100, 0 being the worst score and 100 the best.</description>
