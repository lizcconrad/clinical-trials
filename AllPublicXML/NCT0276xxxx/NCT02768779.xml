  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hair samples from subjects on antiretroviral therapy, both HIV- and HIV+ patients with HIV
      RNA &lt;50copies/mL for &gt;6 months will be analyzed to investigate the influence of race, hair
      color and hair treatment on ARV response.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A small thatch of hair (approximately 20 strands) will be collected from 85 participants who
      are currently taking antiretrovirals (ARVs). Hair collection will be evenly distributed into
      color cohorts: Black, Brown, Blonde and Grey. Participants will need to be &gt;80% adherent to
      their medication and have had an undetectable HIV RNA VL within the previous 6 months. In the
      lab, samples will be used to develop IR-MALDESI MSI hair protocols for high sensitivity and
      accuracy to quantify ARVs in 5 therapeutic drug classes (Integrase Inhibitors, Nucleoside
      Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, Entry
      Inhibitors, Protease Inhibitors).

    <description>Within the laboratory, experimental factors controlling IR-MALDESI response to key ARVs representing various drug classes will be systematically evaluated using the design of experiments (DOE) statistical approach (41,127) for an unbiased optimization of IRMALDESI response to each of the ARVs and their major metabolites. The goal will be to achieve a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) below clinically relevant hair strand concentrations.</description>
