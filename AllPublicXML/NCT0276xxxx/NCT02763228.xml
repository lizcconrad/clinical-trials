  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether a physical activity (exercise)
      program in the community will improve the functional and overall health status of older women
      with a history of breast cancer. The physical activity or exercise program is designed for
      all older breast cancer survivors, and in particular for African-Americans and women of lower
      socio-economic status, who are the least likely to engage in physical activity.

      Specific Aim #1: To determine the effect of a refined and culturally-sensitive physical
      activity intervention on functional outcomes at 20 and 52 weeks among older Breast Cancer
      survivors who are within five years of treatment completion for stage I-III Breast Cancer
      (BCa).

      Specific Aim #2: To examine whether race and socioeconomic status (SES) moderate the
      intervention effect on physical activity (PA) levels and functional outcomes at 20 and 52
      weeks.

      Specific Aim #3: To examine the effect of the PA intervention on longitudinal changes in
      beliefs, attitudes and preferences (KAPs) and PA levels, and the extent to which changes in
      these factors mediate intervention effect on functional outcomes.

      Specific Aim #4: To determine the effect of the PA intervention on surrogate biomarkers
      associated with breast cancer prognosis and functional disability.

    <description>The exercise in this study will consist of two types of exercise training: resistance training and aerobic exercise. Resistance training is like &quot;weight lifting&quot; to improve strength and function. Participants will complete resistance training by using resistance machines and free weights. Aerobic exercise is exercise that intends to improve the cardiopulmonary or oxygen/lung and heart systems. It is often referred to as &quot;cardio&quot; exercise. Treadmill walking, stationary cycling sessions, and/or other exercises will be used for aerobic exercise.
Participants will be instructed in the exercise routine by physical fitness experts and trainers.</description>
