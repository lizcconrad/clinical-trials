    <textblock>
      This study is focusing on patients presenting with suspected malignancies of the pituitary
      gland who are considered to be good surgical candidates.The primary end-point of the study is
      to determine the sensitivity of OTL38 uptake and expression in identifying those nodules when
      excited by an imaging probe.There will be a single dose of 0.025 mg/kg for intravenous
      injection over approximately 60 minutes, two to three hours, prior to surgery.
