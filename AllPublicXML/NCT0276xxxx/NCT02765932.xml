  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study looking at the impact of psychosensory therapy and how it can
      diminish pain and consumption of pain medications. The primary study objective is to evaluate
      the change in Visual Analogue Score (VAS) score assessing for pain from Baseline, every day
      of inpatient stay, 7 days after leaving hospital (via phone), and 3 months post-op(via phone)
      and to correlate the psychosensory therapy and overall use of pain medications/narcotics.

    <textblock>
      The study will aim to enroll 50 subjects. 25 subjects will receive placebo therapy which will
      be dummy movements while the other 25 will receive psychosensory therapy. The treatment group
      will involve a touch technique called havening.

    <description>The research assistant will administer one of the several psychosensory touch techniques prior to surgery. This will involve the touching of upper arms, palms, and a visualization process. This will last no longer than 10 minutes. These techniques will also be performed by the patients prior to any rehab sessions and before going to sleep. The patients will be asked to perform these touch techniques with the eyes closed and imaging having no pain. The patients will also be asked to keep a record of all medications.</description>
