        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Patients aged 18 years or older;

          2. Patients with at least 2 years history of SARC prior to the study and mild to moderate
             asthma (GINA criteria 2 and 3) inadequately controlled on inhaled corticosteroids and
             in whom &quot;as-needed&quot; short acting beta-agonists provide inadequate clinical control;

          3. Forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) &gt; 70% of the predicted normal value
             demonstrable at least 6 hours after last short acting β-2 agonist use or 12 hours
             after last long acting β-2 agonist (LABA) use;

          4. NSS at baseline ≥ 3. Baseline NSS will be defined as the mean of the 6 last
             assessments of the patients' diary (3 last days before randomization);

          5. Positive results of skin prick test on at least one seasonal allergen within the last
             3 years;

          6. Patients who provided a signed written informed consent form;

          7. Patients who are able and willing to complete web-based Patient's Diary;

          8. Patients who agree to maintain consistency in their surroundings throughout the study
             period;

          9. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) including peri-menopausal women who have had a
             menstrual period within 1 year have to have a negative pregnancy test. Results have to
             be available until the Visit 2 and negative for the patient to be entered in the
             study.

         10. WOCBP have to use an effective method of birth control throughout the study period and
             for 4 weeks after study completion (defined as a method which results in a failure
             rate of less than 1% per year) such as:

               -  combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated
                  with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)

               -  progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
                  (oral, injectable, implantable)

               -  intrauterine device (IUD)

               -  intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)

               -  bilateral tubal occlusion

                  assessment of the surgical success)

               -  sexual abstinence In each case of delayed menstrual period (over one month
                  between menstruations) confirmation of absence of pregnancy is strongly
                  recommended. This recommendation also applies to WOCBP with infrequent or
                  irregular menstrual cycles.
