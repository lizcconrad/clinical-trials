    <textblock>
      This project will investigate worsening of symptoms in endometriosis patients undergoing
      artificial reproductive techniques (ART). The study compares patients with peritoneal/ovarian
      and deep infiltrating endometriosis to relevant reference groups. Symptoms are monitored with
      a questionnaire with the categories quality of life, pain and bowel habits. The EHP-30®
      questionnaire is included in the questionnaire.

    <textblock>
      Endometriosis affects up to 10% of all fertile women, and is associated with symptoms like
      infertility, dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia and chronic pelvic pain. 10-25% of endometriosis
      patients need artificial reproductive techniques (ART) to become pregnant. Endometriosis is
      estrogen dependent, and in theory this means, that the increased levels of estrogen during
      fertility treatment will worsen endometriosis symptoms. Endometriosis is a benign disease,
      and treatment is guided by the patient's symptoms. Worsening of endometriosis symptoms during
      fertility treatment may result in cessation of the treatment, operation and risk of
      complications.

      This project will investigate worsening of symptoms in endometriosis patients undergoing
      artificial reproductive techniques (ART). The study compares endometriosis patients
      undergoing ART to two relevant reference groups; one group consisting women undergoing ART
      with infertility because of factors other than endometriosis, and one group consisting women
      with medically treated endometriosis not undergoing ART. Symptoms of endometriosis during ART
      will be monitored using a questionnaire that among other questions includes the validated
      questionnaire Endometriosis Health Profile 30® (EHP-30®). The questionnaire is administered
      before starting ART and later in the cycle before the patient gets to know if she is
      pregnant. The questionnaires as well as data collection will be administered electronically
      in REDCap® which is a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and
      databases.

    <description>Three categories with frequency, general, and worst perception of pain. In each category the patient has to rate her pain on the NRS scale according to dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, defecation and urination pain. In addition there are qualitative questions in the same categories of pain.</description>
