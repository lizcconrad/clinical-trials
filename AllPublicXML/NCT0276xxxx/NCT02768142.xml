  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Throughout the history, the neonate was dependent on maternal touch and care for survival. In
      modern obstetrics, with hospital care the neonates are seldom separated from their mothers
      after delivery. Early skin to skin (ESTS) contact after delivery was found to increase milk
      production, lactation and improve maternal and neonatal outcome.

      Oxytocin is the primary hormone responsible for uterine contraction and prevention of
      postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). ESTS contact increases oxytocin secretion.

      The rate of cesarean deliveries (CDs) increased dramatically over the past decades. CD was
      found to decrease postpartum milk production, postpones early lactation and decreases
      exclusive breastfeeding.

      During the typical CD, the neonate is usually presented for a short while to the mother and
      breastfeeding is usually delayed at least a number of hours until after the surgery and the
      recovery period.

      Natural CD, enable ESTS contact during the surgery and give the mother the opportunity to
      start breastfeeding immediately after delivery of the neonate in the surgery suit. Oxytocin
      secretion increases with ESTS and during breastfeeding.

      The aim of this study is to examine blood loss that occurs after Natural CD compared to
      standard CD without an ESTS contact.
