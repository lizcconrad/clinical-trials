  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of nebulized 3% hypertonic saline solution with
      salbutamol in the treatment of children under 2 years, hospitalised for acute viral
      bronchiolitis. Half of the participants will receive nebulized 3% hypertonic saline solution
      with salbutamol three times daily, the other half will receive standard supportive care,
      which is the cornerstone of the bronchiolitis management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute viral bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in infants up
      to two years old. Currently there is no effective treatment so standard treatment remains
      supportive care with supplemental oxygen to correct hypoxia, minimal handling to minimise the
      risk of exhaustion and the provision of fluids.

      In recent years some studies have suggested that nebulised hypertonic saline, which improve
      airway hygiene, may influence the course of the illness and reduce the duration of
      hospitalisation without significant side effects.

      Study protocol: half of the included patients will receive standard treatment for
      bronchiolitis, which includes only supportive care, the other half will additionally receive
      nebulized 3% hypertonic saline solution with salbutamol (to avoid potential bronchial
      obstruction) three times daily.
