  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of Low Frequency Repetitive
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (LF r-TMS) of the pre-Supplementary Motor Area (pre-SMA) on
      tremor as measured by the tremor rating scale (TRS) in patients with Essential Tremor (ET).

      Hypothesis: Pre-SMA LF r-TMS will result in a &gt;30% reduction in tremor as measured by the
      TRS. Another purpose of this study is to identify the mechanism by which LF r-TMS of the
      pre-SMA effects tremor in patients with ET.

      Hypothesis: Inhibition of the pre-SMA by LF r-TMS improves tremor in ET by normalizing
      pre-SMA output, and improving motor control, as determined shortening of the delay in the
      second agonist burst, seen in ET patients. At conclusion of this study expect to have
      sufficient pilot data to justify larger pivotal trials designed to establish the efficacy of
      pre-SMA r-TMS in ET.

    <description>The intervention to be administered is the MagVenture MagProx100 Stimulator with a Cool-B65 A/P coil l to administer active rTMS at 1Hz, 1,200sec, 110% resting motor threshold (rMT); 1200 pulses total. Two Thymapad Stimulus Electrodes will be placed in the appropriate position during active rTMS administration.This intervention method will be used for all 15 treatment sessions (20 minutes/session).</description>

    <description>The intervention to be administered is the eSHAM system used in conjunction with the MagVenture MagProx100 Stimulator with the Cool-B65 A/P Coil. For eSHAM administration two Thymapad Stimulus Electrodes will be placed on the scalp location that corresponded to left DLPFC. This intervention method will be used for all 15 treatment sessions (20 minutes/session). Previous studies have shown the eSHAM system effectively blinds participants to rTMS treatment (active versus sham).</description>
