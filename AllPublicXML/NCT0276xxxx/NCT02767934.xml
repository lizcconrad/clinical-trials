  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating small amounts
      of cancer cells that remain after attempts to remove the cancer has been made in patients
      with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may
      strengthen the immune system and help it to target remaining cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab in minimal residual disease (MRD)-positive acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicity profile of pembrolizumab in patients with previously-treated ALL.

      II. To gain a preliminary assessment of how MRD response translates into relapse-free and
      overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare disease assessments by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) and polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) to a newly-developed and more sensitive next generation sequencing (NGS)-based
      platform.

      II. To correlate response to pembrolizumab to immunologic markers in peripheral blood and
      bone marrow specimens.

      III. To evaluate if treatment with pembrolizumab has a measurable impact on hematopoietic
      engraftment and graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in patients who subsequently undergo allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 21 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients achieving complete MRD response may receive up to 1 additional year of treatment at
      the discretion of the investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 12
      weeks for up to 2 years.
