          -  Have a diagnosis of HR+, HER2- breast cancer. Although not required as a protocol
             procedure, metastatic disease should be considered for biopsy whenever possible to

             crisis is not the mere presence of visceral metastases, but implies severe organ
             dysfunction as assessed by symptoms and signs, laboratory studies, and rapid
             progression of the disease.

          -  Have inflammatory breast cancer.

             scientifically or medically compatible with this study. If a participant is currently
             enrolled in a clinical trial involving non-approved use of a device, then agreement
             with the investigator and Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) clinical research physician
             (CRP) is required to establish eligibility.

          -  Have received treatment with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any

          -  Have had major surgery within 14 days prior to randomization to allow for
             post-operative healing of the surgical wound and site(s).

             would preclude participation in this study (eg, history of major surgical resection
             involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative
             colitis).

          -  Have a personal history within the last 12 months of any of the following conditions:
             syncope of cardiovascular etiology, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation,

          -  Have a history of any other cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma
             in-situ of the cervix), unless in complete remission with no therapy for a minimum of
             3 years.

          -  Have received an autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplant.

          -  Have clinical evidence of active bacterial or fungal infection or active viral
             infection that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in
             this study (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or viral hepatitis). Screening test
             is not required for enrollment.
