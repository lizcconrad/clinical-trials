    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to assess the safety and effectiveness of photochemically
      induced collagen cross- linking (CCL) at irradiance of 18mW/cm2 in eyes with Keratoconus and
      Ecstasia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Riboflavin drops are used every 2 minutes for 30+ minutes until the corneal stroma is
      saturated with Riboflavin as evidenced by observing Riboflavin in the Anterior chamber. Two
      arms in the study, one uses Riboflavin with Epithelium on and the other with Epithelium off.
      Once it is observed that the Riboflavin has penetrated the stroma and is seen in the anterior
      chamber, the cornea is exposed to Ultraviolet light at an irradiance level of 18mW/cm2 for 5
      minutes. A contact lens is applied until the epithelium has fully healed in 3 to 5 days. The
      study is for 6 months. The corneal curvature as well as the uncorrected and best corrected
      vision and corneal thickness are evaluated pre-operatively and at 6 months. The primary
      variable that is assessed to determine the efficacy of the drug is the Kmax - Steep corneal
      curvature. Secondary effectiveness criteria are uncorrected and best corrected vision and
      corneal thickness. adverse events are also monitored.
