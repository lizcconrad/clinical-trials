  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized clinical trial, controlled, open label that aimed to compare two
      groups after discharge of a tertiary care: type 2 diabetes patients followed exclusively by
      primary care (control group) and patients followed by primary care and supported by phone
      calls (intervention group).

    <textblock>
      The investigators designed a randomized controlled trial. Patients with stable and controlled
      type 2 diabetes, and considered to be eligible to discharge from specialized care to primary
      care will be included. Patients with severe neuropathy, not controlled ischemic heart disease
      and nephropathy stage IV/V will be excluded. Enrolled patients will be randomized in two
      groups: follow-up supported by periodic nurse phone calls plus primary care (intervention
      group) or followed by primary care team (control group). The intervention group will receive
      regular telephone calls (every 3 months for 1 year) and will have a toll-free number to
      resolve questions about the disease management. Main outcome is the glycemic control between
      groups after 1 year of follow-up. Secondary outcomes include: rate of hypoglycaemia, blood
      pressure control,emergency visits, nephropathy progression and death.

    <description>Patients in intervention group will receive periodic phone calls (every three months) and will have a toll-free number to resolve questions about the disease management. The phone-calls will be performed by trained nurses and will follow a structured format. Nurses will address some topics: patient's treatment adherence, technique of insulin administration, disease understanding, hypoglycaemia management, healthy diet, smoke cessation and foot care.</description>
