    <textblock>
      Impairments in plasticity and working memory in schizophrenia have been hypothesized to
      reflect dysfunction at the N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR). However, the
      specific mechanisms through which the NMDAR is involved in working memory versus plasticity
      differ. Towards gaining a deeper understanding of how NMDAR signaling relates to individual
      cognitive functions in healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, the investigators used
      a single dose of d-cycloserine (DCS) as an experimental probe to examine the effects of
      enhancing NMDAR signaling on plasticity versus working memory in healthy adults and
      individuals with schizophrenia.

      Background: Cognitive impairments in schizophrenia, such as deficits in plasticity and
      working memory, have been hypothesized to reflect dysfunction at the N-methyl-D-aspartate
      glutamate receptor (NMDAR). However, given that divergent properties of the NMDAR underlie
      its roles in plasticity versus working memory and that various aspects of NMDAR function are
      abnormal in schizophrenia, examining the effects of DCS in both healthy and patient
      populations is crucial.

      Methods: The investigators used a single dose of the partial NMDAR agonist, d-cycloserine
      (DCS) to probe the effects of enhancing NMDAR signaling on working memory and plasticity.
      Working memory was assessed using a spatial n-back task. Plasticity was assessed using two
      learning tasks, the weather prediction task and information integration task, and an EEG
      paradigm that assesses changes in visual evoked potential amplitude following high frequency
      visual stimulation. Sixty-five healthy adults and forty-five schizophrenia patients were
      randomized to receive 100 mg acute DCS (healthy adult n = 32; schizophrenia n = 24) or
      placebo (healthy adult n = 33; schizophrenia n = 21).

    <description>Percent Correct Responses out of 240 trials (for schizophrenia patients) or 320 trials (for healthy adults) on the N-Back Task, which is a spatial working memory task in which participants identify whether each new stimulus on the computer screen is in the same location as the stimulus shown in trials ago. Patients with schizophrenia completed 80 trials at each of 3 working memory loads (0-, 1-, 2-back loads) and healthy adults completed 80 trials at each of 4 working memory loads (0-, 1-, 2-, 3-back loads).</description>

    <description>EEG data were recorded using a 128 channel cap while participants viewed a black and white checkerboard stimulus on a computer screen in 6 x 2-minute blocks before and after viewing a quickly flashing checkerboard stimulus for 2 minutes. Change in the mean amplitude of the visual evoked potential from before versus after viewing the quickly flashing checkerboard stimulus was used to assess plasticity.</description>
