    <textblock>
      This is a biomedical study on a medical device. 120 patients will participate in this study
      and will be split into 2 groups:

        -  60 patients in the &quot;usual care&quot; group: these patients will receive the usual care
           proposed by their doctor for 12 months.

        -  60 patients in the &quot;ODRA&quot; group: these patients will wear the ODRA brace for 12 months
           in addition to their usual care. They will be instructed to wear the brace for at least
           6 hours per day, 5 days per week and to take it off during rest periods when lying down.

      The distribution of patients in the groups will be randomized. For this study, patients will
      be followed for 12 months, spread over 3 visits: inclusion visit, follow-up visit at 6 months
      and 12 months.

    <description>The patients will benefit only from the coverage proposed usually, by their regular doctor and according to the notices of the medical and paramedical specialists taking care of this pathology (physiotherapists, orthopaedic osteopaths, sports medicine physician, surgeon, rheumatologists, rehabilitative doctors, etc.). In the absence of recommendations on the modalities of coverage of the gonarthrose and in front of diverse clinical habits, the &quot;usual&quot; said coverage can be at the same time medicinal (anti-inflammatory, painkilling, …), non-medicinal (physiotherapy, port of an orthosis, …), even surgical, according to the influencers.</description>
