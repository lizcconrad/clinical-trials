      Evaluation of a new basic filling restorative material.

      In contemporary dentistry, clinicians have essentially three types of material choices for
      direct restorations: amalgam, resin composite, and glass ionomer restoratives.

      Due to the toxicity of mercury and the subsequent environmental problems, the search for
      alternatives continues and search into new composite restorative materials intensifies.
      Recognized disadvantages of tooth colored resin based restorative materials are as
      polymerization shrinkage, postoperative sensitivity and technical procedure complexity.
      Higher rates of occlusal wear and lower toughness are disadvantages of glass ionomer
      restoratives.

      Therefore, alternative materials are being developed to compensate the disadvantages of
      current contemporary tooth coloured restorative materials. Nevertheless, the search for
      simplification for restoring missing dental tissues introduced the &quot;basic filling concept&quot;.

      This project aims to study the clinical performance of this new basic filling restorative
      material for Class I and Class II cavities. 80 patients are recruited to the project which is
      carried out at the School of dentistry, Istanbul Medipol University, Turkey.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of a new basic filling
      restorative material for Class I and Class II cavities that needs to be restored in permanent
      teeth.

      Basic filling material combines the handling properties of glass ionomer restorative
      materials with the mechanical properties of resin composite restorative materials.

      Extensive laboratory studies have been performed on the new material, but the clinical
      attributes have yet to be disclosed.

      The study will be carried out as a prospective study, with assessment of the restorations
      after three year.

      The project includes 80 patients. Most of the patients have been recruited from the Istanbul
      Medipol University Dental Clinics in Istanbul.

      After giving their consent to take part in the study Class I &amp; II restorations of both upper
      and lower molars and premolars are performed

      The treatment procedure is:

      The patients are offered local anesthetic before treatment start. The cavity is excavated and
      filled according to the guidelines for composite restorations.

      The control procedure is:

      The restoration is evaluated according to marginal adaptation, cavo surface marginal
      discoloration, approximal contact, fractures, caries associated with restorations and
      postoperative hypersensitivity. The controls will take place after two weeks, one year, two
      years and three years.

    <description>2 independent evaluators The primary outcome will consist in the FDI (World Dental Federation) instrument for dental restorations assessment, as it was published after consensus in 2007 and updated in 2010 . This instrument is composed of three dimensions (biological, functional and esthetic), each consisting of several items that are assessed by clinical and radiographic examination according to Likert scales of 5 terms. Some items are evaluated quantitatively, others visually.The worst score of all items is retained as the overall score of the restoration, thus resulting in a single (ordinal) primary outcome.
