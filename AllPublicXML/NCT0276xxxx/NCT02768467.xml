  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior studies have been performed to understand the optimal way to minimize the morbidity
      rate of buccal mucosa. While some studies have reported primary closure to be inferior to
      healing by secondary intention, this appears to be true for large defects greater than 2 cm
      in width. For small defects for which the wound can be closed without tension, the most
      recent study has shown improved pain outcomes in the immediate post-operative setting,
      although no difference is seen long term whether or not the wound was primarily closed.
      However, for larger defects, standard practice is to allow delayed healing by secondary
      intention.

      The use of Alloderm graft placement for donor site coverage was first described in Armenakas'
      group. Alloderm is an acellular dermal lattice from human allograft skin. The only study to
      report the use of Alloderm failed to find a significant improvement in patient outcomes;
      however, very small defects were included in this study and the control group underwent
      primary closure, which has been shown to be inferior for large defects. Importantly, no
      increase in post-operative pain was noted, although there was some increased swelling
      reported. From experience, patients with moderate and large (&gt;2 cm width) defects following
      buccal mucosa harvest benefit from Alloderm placement with decreased post-operative pain,
      more rapid resumption of normal diet and mouth function with no associated increase in
      morbidity of the procedure. This study aims to determine whether this is a reliable
      improvement in technique.

      This study will clarify how the cheek heals after the buccal mucosa is removed during
      reconstructive surgery. Subjects will be randomized to either receive tissue collagen matrix
      or no stitches after the surgery. Subjects will be evaluated up to six months to determine if
      the outcomes of the tissue matrix graft are better for the subject.
