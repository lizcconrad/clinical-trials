      In acute ischemic stroke, the identification of an etiology is of major importance to prevent
      recurrence by providing the best treatment. Because of numerous possible underlying
      etiologies, the etiological work-up of ischemic stroke includes a wide range of diagnostic
      tests, which can be invasive, long and expensive. Moreover, many patients receive a diagnosis
      of undetermined stroke even after all available diagnosis tests are done, precluding optimal
      treatment.

      Asymptomatic MES detected by transcranial doppler have been reported in patient with ischemic
      stroke. It has been previously demonstrated that MES predict stroke recurrence and that the
      frequency of MES depends on stroke etiology. However, the pattern of MES has never been
      correlated to stroke etiology. Transcranial-holter is a novel ambulatory system which allows
      prolonged recording (up to 4 hours) leading to an increased detection of MES.

      Therefore, transcranial holter with an 4 hour-recording will be performed for consecutive
      eligible patients hospitalized in our stroke care unit. During the recording, the patient
      will be able to continue their usual activities (eating, walking, speaking and sleeping).

      All the included patients will have a classical follow-up at 3, 6 months and 12 months. The
      neurologist, blinded to the results of transcranial-holter, will have to prescribe and
      analyze the results of diagnostic tests to identify stroke etiology. Stroke etiology will be
      established according to the ASCOD classification. Questioning and neurological exam (NIHSS
      score) will be performed looking for potential recurrent stroke.
