  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of ruboxistaurin for its safety, tolerability, and
      effectiveness in treating adult patients with heart failure. Patients will receive 1 dose of
      oral ruboxistaurin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ruboxistaurin is a drug initially developed for treatment of diabetic peripheral retinopathy.
      The proposed indication for ruboxistaurin in this study is the treatment of adult patients
      with New York Heart Failure Association (NYHA) Class III-IV heart failure. Ruboxistaurin is a
      protein kinase c-alpha (PKC-alpha) inhibitor and thus will produce an inotropic effect in the
      heart which holds the potential to improve cardiac function.
