  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to design and test the safety and feasibility of virtual reality
      technologies and experiences of egocentric avatar embodiment in the application of physical
      and cognitive behavior therapy in functional neurological symptom/conversion disorder.
      Investigators hypothesize that patients will safely use and accept this modality of treatment
      and will show evidence of a decrease in symptom frequency.

      This is a treatment development trial, participants randomly assigned to active treatment
      will be enrolled in embodied Virtual Reality therapy. The therapy will be based on principals
      of exposure and behavioral shaping therapies and mirror visual feedback therapy. The therapy
      will be delivered over 8 sessions and modified as indicated by clinical feedback. A fixed
      protocol will be developed with exact methods to be used to be determined. After a fixed
      protocol has been established, a treatment manual will be created to use in further
      controlled trials.

    <description>Participants will be asked to play a game in Stanford's Virtual Reality Human Interaction Lab that engages visual pathways and involves body tracking and controlled sensory feedback reinforcing movement in real and virtual time by immersive head mounted displays. This game will have subjects fully embody and inhabit an avatar from an egocentric perspective. In addition, over consecutive sessions subjects will be asked to use a mobile smart phone based virtual reality program designed to deliver various and customized emotionally provocative stimuli.</description>
