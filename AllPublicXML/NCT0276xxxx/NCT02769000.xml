      Evaluate safety and toxicity/adverse events associated with delivery of low dose whole brain
      irradiation in patients with early Alzheimer's dementia according to the National Institute
      of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and
      Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria.. As a secondary goal it will establish
      whether or not the intervention with low dose whole brain irradiation stabilizes or decreases
      cerebral amyloid deposits and whether these correlate with the recognized progression of
      Alzheimer's dementia. The investigators will also collect information from the FDG and
      Amyvid® PET Scans to determine if there is any correlation between neurocognitive/quality of
      life scores and changes in amyloid plaque size, number and location.

      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently the 7th leading cause of death in the United States
      with approximately 5.9 million Americans living with the progressive and debilitating
      condition. AD predominantly affects older individuals as 86% of AD cases are in individuals
      65 years of age and older. Further, approximately $172 billion of health care spending
      annually can be attributed to costs associated with AD care on top of the 11 million
      caregivers that provide care in unpaid capacities, such as family members, friends, etc.

      In 1975, a cohort of nearly 2,800 people who were 65 years of age and free of dementia
      provided a basis for an incident study of dementia, as well as for Alzheimer's disease. This
      cohort was followed for almost 29 years and its sentinel findings included a significantly
      higher lifetime risk for both Alzheimer's and dementia in women compared to men. The
      estimated lifetime risk was nearly one in five for women compared to one in ten for men. In
      addition to the higher lifetime risk in women, expectancy of longer life and the aging of the
      &quot;baby boomers&quot; combined with improved healthcare is expected to increase the number of
      Americans who will reach 85 years of age or more. It is very clear that as the age increases,
      so does the incidence of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia.

      Between 2010 and 2050, it is expected that there will be a 30% increase in the number of
      individuals greater that 85 years of age. Although the absolute number may not appear to be
      significant, this increase of approximately 17 million people will challenge the healthcare
      system because of the cost associated with dealing various acute and chronic medical
      conditions including AD.

      While other major causes of death continue to experience decline, those from AD continues to
      rise. In 1991, only approximately 14,000 death certificates recorded Alzheimer's disease as
      an underlying cause. In 2006, it was noted that there was an increase of approximately 46% in
      which Alzheimer's disease was listed as the direct cause of death. This is significant when
      compared to the present leading cause of death, heart disease, which decreased by 11% in the
      same time.

      From a neurophysiological standpoint, what is known about Alzheimer's disease is that there
      appears to be a progressive process that is associated with the deposition of β Amyloid. This
      appears to have a triggering mechanism, which causes the phosphorylation of a TAU protein,
      which then leads to development neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), which are believed to be
      responsible for memory loss, especially short-term and other associated problems with
      Alzheimer's related dementia. It also appears that there may be a selective deposition of the
      β Amyloid in the hippocampus and the prefrontal regions, which are the major short-term
      memory regions of the brain.

      Extensive research has been ongoing to try to find various ways in which the excess
      deposition of β Amyloid, the removal of excess β Amyloid, the initiation sequence that it is
      involved in with phosphorylated TAU and other selective processes can be altered in an effort
      to mitigate the devastating end term results. To date, there have been several trials,
      including a vaccine trial performed in Europe and in the United States, which seem to show
      that clearance of the β Amyloid is possible. However, there was not significant improvement
      in neurocognitive function (NCF), which led to the discontinuation of these trials.

      This lack of improvement in NCF was believed to be secondary to the fact that the β Amyloid
      had already resulted in the phosphorylation of the TAU protein and development of NFT. Thus
      removal of the initiator was accomplished, but only after the end damage had developed. Then
      why consider irradiation?

      The use of radiation in the treatment of non-oncologic human populations has enjoyed a long
      history and a more recent renaissance. It is now commonly used to prevent heterotopic bone
      formation and re-development of keloids or heterotrophic scars post-operatively. It has been
      shown in a randomized trial to effectively treat planter fasciitis and has been used in
      post-operative treatment of resected pterygium. It has been used in the treatment of
      Hidradenitis suppurativa, Duputryen's disease and Ledderhose's disease. These sites routinely
      are treated with low dose fractionated external beam irradiation, commonly in doses that
      ranging from 7 to 24 Gy.

      The use of external irradiation has also been reported in the treatment of symptomatic
      systemic amyloidosis. In published peer reviewed articles treatment sites have include
      trachea-pulmonary, ocular, laryngeal and for use as a conditioning agent for autologous BMT
      in patients with systemic amyloidosis. These reports used external beam irradiation that
      ranged from 5.5 - 45 Gy and detail durable local control with these doses.

      Because of this effect, a series of basic science experiments were initiated with genetically
      altered mice: the B6; Cg - Tg 85 Dbo/J over express amyloid and the B6; 129-Psen1tm1MpmTg
      over express both amyloid and TAU, making them prone to early Alzheimer's disease
      development.

      Both single and fractionated CNS irradiation in a genetically altered mouse model were
      tested, and have shown similar results with reduction in amyloid plaque number, size and
      volume. Moreover, the fractionated studies the investigators have demonstrated statistically
      significant improvement in the treated mice using the Morris Water Maze Test when compared to
      control non-treated animals, an effect which held up whether the animals were adolescent,
      mature or aged (up to 18 months old).

      The exact mechanism by which radiation therapy confers benefit in the Alzheimer's disease
      mouse model will be difficult to elucidate as the exact pathobiology of Alzheimer's disease
      is not known. Possible mechanisms include the following: reduction of β amyloid by reducing
      production or increasing clearance; reduction in Tau; induction of beneficial inflammatory
      mechanisms; induction or inhibition of heat shock proteins; altering cerebral
      microvasculature; and/or reversal of maladaptive neuroplasticity in the hippocampus.
      Investigations of these possible mechanisms are currently underway.

      One of the complications related to studying Alzheimer's disease is the actual diagnosis.
      Unlike malignancies where a biopsy can be obtained, Alzheimer's disease is a diagnosis of
      exclusion or made at autopsy. While the Europeans have recently identified and agreed on CSF
      biomarkers for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, the investigators have not accepted that
      premise in the United States. At the present time, PET imaging which utilizes various
      compounds has been utilized to identify depositions of amyloid in the CNS. More recently,
      there is some suggestive evidence that a specific type of cataract may be seen in a high
      percentage of patients with Alzheimer's disease related to possible β Amyloid deposition in
      the lens region (29-30). Many rely on the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for clinical diagnosis of
      Alzheimer's disease.

      While it is a diagnosis of exclusion, there are well-accepted neurocognitive tests (NCT) used
      to monitor Alzheimer's disease progression. The Mini Mental exam is one of the general NCT
      used to help establish the diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia. There are other more sensitive
      neurocognitive tests available to track progression of Alzheimer's dementia, which the
      investigators will use in this study. Note estimation of premorbid IQ is only completed at
      the screening appointment and administration of the BNT and JLO only occur at the baseline
      pre-treatment visit and the 12-months post-treatment follow up visit to minimize participant
      fatigue and familiarity with the test materials. Administration of the NCT at the screening
      visit will serve two purposes. Data obtained from the screening visit will ensure that
      subjects who are enrolled in the trial meet criteria for early AD based on the more
      comprehensive battery of tests, as diagnosis of dementia is improved with use of quantitative
      measurement of multiple domains. The NCT at this screening visit will also expose
      participants to the NCT and since practice effects are greatest between the first and second
      exposure to NCT, practice effects will be minimized using this exposure and repeated measures
      ANOVAs.

      Psychological functioning and quality of life (QOL) will also be evaluated to monitor
      participants' emotional status throughout the trial. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and
      the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaires will be used to assess depression and
      anxiety, respectively. If any participant endorses suicidal ideation on the PHQ-9, the
      Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) will be administered to fully evaluate the
      participant's suicidal ideation and study stopping rules will be implemented as needed to
      ensure the individual's safety. QOL will be evaluated by the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's
      disease (QOL-AD) and Quality of Life in Late-stage Dementia (QUALID) and Everyday Cognition
      (ECog) questionnaires (patient and caregiver forms).

      Concern may be raised regarding the use of whole brain irradiation and its potential
      deleterious effect on neurocognitive testing. There have been reports on post-radiation
      neurocognitive testing in the setting of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), which is
      whole brain fractionated RT commonly employed for patients with pulmonary small cell
      carcinoma. The standard whole brain PCI dose is 2.5 Gy x 10, considerably higher than the 2.0
      Gy x 5 or 2.0 Gy x 10 schemes planned in the present study. Furthermore, patients in the PCI
      studies also received chemotherapy in addition to whole brain irradiation, and chemotherapy
      itself effects long-term NCF. In these PCI reports, if any neurocognitive decline was
      identified, it was modest, occurred within a short interval, e.g. 6-9 months, and improved.
      The investigators are thus proposing a 9-month follow up period for the 1st subject cohort
      (2.0 Gy x 5) before proceeding with the 2nd cohort (2.0 Gy x 10), although both cohorts will
      undergo NCF and QOL testing through 12 months.

      Grosshans and colleagues from M. D. Anderson found that PCI is &quot;unlikely to significantly
      affect NCF.&quot; They evaluated cognitive function in small cell lung cancer patients who
      received PCI (mean 2.5 Gy x 10). After chemotherapy, but before PCI, 47% already had evidence
      of impaired cognitive function. On multivariate analysis, there were no significant further
      declines after PCI. On univariate analysis, there were unsustained, early decreases in
      executive and language function, which did not persist with follow-up. A Japanese group
      applied the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (revised Japanese version, HVLT-R) in 40 whole brain
      RT patients, at baseline, 4 months, and 8 months. Whole brain fractionation was either 2.5 Gy
      x 4, 3.0 Gy x 10, or 2.5 Gy x 10. The respective probabilities of decline in HVLT-R total
      recall at 4 months were, respectively, 40%, 7%, and 0%, and at 8 months 13%, 14% and 0% (48).

      Also applicable is a recent report of whole brain (and whole spine) RT for medulloblastoma in
      children, a population believed more vulnerable to cognitive decline from RT. They did not
      receive chemotherapy, rather RT alone, 36 Gy in 36 fractions (1.0 Gy BID) to the entire brain
      and spine, followed by a boost to 68 Gy in 68 fractions to the tumor bed, typically posterior
      fossa. Using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children to give verbal quotient,
      performance quotient, and full-scale intelligence quotient, cognitive function was preserved
      for all test domains throughout the study at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years, with no decline
      over time.

      Low dose whole brain RT has demonstrated safety in many studies, and the investigators will
      be using even lower doses. These lower radiation therapy doses have a history of excellent
      success for patients with non-cerebral amyloidosis, and have had durable response combined
      with the necropsy / neurocognitive testing in genetically altered Alzheimer's disease mouse
      model, the investigators decided to proceed with a human trial, using fractionated whole
      brain radiation doses of 2.0 Gy x 5, then 2.0 Gy x 10. Subjects will be followed with
      neurocognitive testing at 6 weeks, 3, 9 and 12 months post RT. Additionally, given that the
      development of supranuclear cataract has been reported in a high percent of AD patients, the
      investigators will recommend ocular testing at baseline and at 1 year to assess a potential
      abscopal effect, collateral benefit to the non-targeted lenses from treatment of the primary
      disease in the brain.

      With respect to the development of cataracts in association with AD, early and accurate
      diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still a challenge and the confirmatory diagnosis is
      made by presence of features including beta-amyloid plaques postmortem. In 2014, Tian et al
      suggested that AD may have a common pathophysiology with supranuclear deposits of
      beta-amyloid in the human lens. The brain and the lens tissue both arise from the ectoderm
      tissue (neuroectoderm and surface ectoderm respectively). Their conclusions were based on a
      meta-analysis of studies, which provided mixed data regarding the correlation of beta-amyloid
      in the lens samples of patients with AD, Down syndrome and controls. Given the chronicity of
      the terminally differentiated cell types in the lens that may be affected by Alzheimer
      disease's pathology, they concluded that there is a possibility than an ocular biomarker for
      early AD may exist in the lens. This would suggest that an early ophthalmic examination may
      provide a window of hope into early diagnosis of AD. It may also provide an opportunity for
      early treatment and perhaps monitoring of improvement in supranuclear cataracts with systemic
      therapy.

      A precedent for this is already found in Wilson's disease. Kayser-Fleischer (K-F) ring seen
      in Wilson's disease (WD) is due to copper deposition in the Descemet's membrane in the
      sclero-corneal junction in the eye. Although believed to be pathognomic of WD, it may be seen
      in many other hepatic conditions and intraocular copper-containing foreign bodies. The K-F
      ring detected in pre-symptomatic cases of WD may lead to speedy diagnosis and early
      management. Co-relation of K-F ring in WD to the disease severity, disappearance with
      successful treatment, reappearance with non-compliant treatment aids in management of WD. K-F
      ring detection in first-degree relatives of the index case is also important.

      With the proposed ocular exams at baseline and at 9-months post treatment, the investigators
      hope to detect any cataracts in the subjects and effects of the proposed radiation
      treatments. The questions the investigators will have are how often they encounter them in
      early Alzheimer's and whether they improve (an abscopal effect) after radiation therapy, even
      though the lenses will be excluded from the RT treatment fields. Exams will only be done for
      subjects who have at least one natural lense still present. Subjects with previous cataract
      corrections will not have ocular exams performed.
