      of an injection of RBP-6000.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, first-in-human study, designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single subcutaneous (SC) injection of
      RBP-6000 in opioid dependent subjects. Enrollment will begin with 6 subjects, and additional
      subjects will not be enrolled until safety through Day 4 has been reviewed and analyzed.
      Subjects will remain in a residential unit through Day 30 post-injection and will continue
      with visits to the clinical unit until Day 85 or plasma buprenorphine levels are below 100
      pg/mL, whichever comes later. The expected maximum duration of participation for each subject
      (including screening) is 120 days.

      Safety will be assessed by adverse events, electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory
      assessments, local injection site tolerability and vital signs. PK will be assessed by
      measuring concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine in plasma. The need for rescue
      medication will be assessed using clinical judgment along with information provided by the
      COWS scores.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  If female, must be surgically sterile or two-years post-menopausal and have a negative
             pregnancy test. Subjects should take reasonable precautions during the study to avoid
             pregnancy by agreeing to remain abstinent or to practice double-barrier forms of birth
             control from study screening through the last dose of study medication.

             treatment with methadone.

          -  Willing to cooperate with study procedures and provide written informed consent prior
             to start of any study procedures.
