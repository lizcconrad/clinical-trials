      Youths diagnosed with early onset schizophrenia will demonstrate amelioration of auditory
      hallucinations after one week of twice daily treatment with transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS).

      Background: Early onset schizophrenia (EOS) involves positives symptoms such as psychotic
      behaviors, as well as negative symptoms such as disruptions to normal emotions and behaviors.
      Antipsychotics are the primary method of treatment in pediatric populations, but can produce
      unpleasant or dangerous side effects. Medication response is highly variable. Recent evidence
      demonstrates transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) relieving auditory hallucinations
      (AH) associated with schizophrenia in adults, and to a lesser degree negative and cognitive
      symptomology. Such studies provide important scientific and technical knowledge that may be
      applied to pediatric populations.

      Hypothesis: 1. Primary: Youths with EOS will demonstrate amelioration of AH after
      administration of tDCS. 2. TDCS will be well-tolerated in pediatric populations with minimal
      adverse side effects.

    <description>The primary efficacy assessment is the mean change from baseline to the last observed post-baseline visit, expected average of every 3 months (with last observation carried forward) in total score on the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to last observation: at baseline, following 5 days of TDCS, and at 1, 3, and 6 months, expected average of 3 months for us to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary secondary outcome measure will be the change in severity of other symptoms of schizophrenia, assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) from baseline to last observation, expected average of every 3 months. The PANSS can be computed as a dimensional scale including positive, negative, depression, disorganization, and grandiosity/excitement.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) Disorders
             (SCID) primary diagnosis of DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             Disorders-Version IV) schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder

          -  Ages 8 to 25 years-old

          -  Persistent auditory hallucinations

          -  Full Scale intelligent quotient (IQ) greater than 60.

          -  Stable antipsychotic medication for &gt; 4 weeks

          -  If female and not infertile patient must agree to use one of the following forms of
             contraception for the duration of study participation: systemic hormonal treatment or
             an interuterine device (IUD).

          -  Legal guardian has provided written informed consent and the subject has provided
             written informed assent when able. Expectation that a majority of subjects will be
             able to assent but the potential for the younger children and/or those that are of
             borderline intellectual functioning will not be able to assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of alcohol, substance dependence or abuse in the past 90 days

          -  Open skin wounds that would preclude use of TDCS electrodes

          -  If female, pregnancy or breast feeding, as determined during eligibility pre-screen
             call

          -  Subjects exhibiting significant ongoing severe disruptive, aggressive, self-injurious,
             or sexually inappropriate behavior will not be eligible for enrollment.

          -  Presence of any medical condition that would make treatment with tDCS less safe. This
             includes any implanted metal device or any cardiac pacemaker. Subjects with a history
             of a seizure disorder are permitted if the subject has been seizure free for 6 months
             and is currently treated with an anticonvulsant that has been stable for 4 weeks.

             the requirements of the study for any reason. This may include an appreciable hearing
             or visual impairment.
