    <textblock>
      This study trials a prototype artificial pancreas system that consists of a Roche insulin
      pump, a Dexcom continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and an experiential MMPPC (multiple model
      probabilistic predictive control) algorithm housed on an android cell phone. The system doses
      insulin based on CGM sensor glucose levels and the experimental algorithm.

      The aim of this clinical study is to determine the efficacy of the MMPPC controller in
      adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes in a hotel setting.

      This study trials a prototype artificial pancreas system that consists of a Roche insulin
      pump, a Dexcom continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and an experiential MMPPC (multiple model
      probabilistic predictive control) algorithm housed on an android cell phone. The system doses
      insulin based on CGM sensor glucose levels and the experimental algorithm. The algorithm runs
      through a glucose control platform called the DiAs (Diabetes Assistant)

      The aim of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of the MMPPC controller in
      adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes testing the use of predefined tuning parameters
      to provide adaptability to patient. We will assess the safety of the system with both
      unannounced meals, and meals using a meal announcement with a premeal insulin bolus based on
      the subject's estimated carbohydrate content of the meal

        for at least 12 months 3. Age between 15.0 to 55.0 years of age 4. Use of an insulin pump
        for at least 3 months 5. Current use of continuous glucose monitoring with Dexcom sensor 6.
        Subject comprehends English 7. Females of childbearing potential must use an adequate
        method of contraception and have a negative pregnancy test 8. Total daily insulin
        requirement ≥ 0.3 units/kg/day 9. A1C between 7.0 and 10% 3.2 Exclusion Criteria

          1. Diabetic ketoacidosis in the past 6 months

          2. Hypoglycemic seizure or loss of consciousness in the past 6 months

          3. Hypoglycemia unawareness as defined by no recognition of hypoglycemia until the
             glucose is &lt;60 mg/dL and no adrenergic symptoms at glucose of 60 mg/dL (shakiness,
             palpitations, diaphoresis). Subjects will also be administered the Clark questionnaire
             for hypoglycemia unawareness. If they have a score ≥ 4, they are excluded from the
             study

          4. Subjects requiring an intermediate or long-acting insulin (such as NPH, detemir or

             at the time of enrollment. Any prior use of other anti-diabetic medications must be
             washed out for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment.

          6. Current use of other medications, which in the judgment of the investigator would be a
             contraindication to participation in the study

          7. Subject has a medical disorder that in the judgment of the investigator will affect
             completion of any aspect of the protocol

          8. Subject is currently participating in another investigational device or drug study
             within 30 days or 5-half lives of the drug.

         12. Subject has renal failure on dialysis

         13. Systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mmHg on screening visit

         14. Diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg on screening visit

         15. Subjects with inadequately treated thyroid disease or celiac disease

             completion of the protocol

         17. Subject has received inpatient psychiatric treatment in the past 6 months

         18. Subject consumes more than an average of 4 standard alcoholic drinks/day in the last
             30 days

         19. Subject has an active skin condition that would affect sensor placement

         20. Subject is unable to avoid acetaminophen for the duration of the study
