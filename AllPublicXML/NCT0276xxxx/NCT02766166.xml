  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CHAOS is based on the investigator's new and exciting results from pre-clinical and large
      longitudinal multi-center observational clinical studies of critically ill patients and
      asymptomatic community-based adults with little or no advanced disease.

      By integrating approaches from the physical, biological, computational, statistical and
      clinical sciences, this observational study will test the hypothesis that early diagnosis of
      subclinical signatures of critical illness encoded within physiological signals complements
      conventional clinical predictors by providing unique prognostic insight.

      The primary goal is to reduce mortality, morbidity and complications by early identification
      of individuals with brewing subclinical critical illness and adverse events before overt
      clinical presentation (e.g., cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, hemorrhage, respiratory failure,
      circulatory collapse). This will provide the necessary lead time for healthcare providers to
      deliver early, more effective and/or preventive therapies. Through innovative approaches,
      CHAOS also meets the challenge of medical errors to reduce missed diagnosis, misdiagnosis,
      preventable harm and variability in provider adherence to best practice guidelines.

      The goal is to validate predictive algorithms and identify subclinical signatures of illness,
      ranging from asymptomatic adults in the community to very sick patients in the hospital. The
      overall goal is to make healthcare more precise, effective, efficient, safe and timely while
      reducing costs, preventable harms and adverse events.
