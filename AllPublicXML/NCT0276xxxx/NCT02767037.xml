  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no clear diagnostic test that can be used to confirm the diagnosis of
      Parkinson's disease, or a biomarker that can track its progression. Patients with Parkinson's
      have many abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system, which may be related to Parkinson's
      changes outside of the brain. A new device called the SudoScan, which measures autonomic
      sweating changes, may be a simple way to test for autonomic changes in Parkinson's.

      The investigator plan to see whether SudoScan can identify Parkinson's disease and whether
      SudoScan abnormalities might be present even in early (prodromal) Parkinson's stages.

      The investigator will assess SudoScan in a group of Parkinson's patients, normal healthy
      controls, patients with non-Parkinson's neurodegeneration, and patients with REM sleep
      behavior disorder (an early/prodromal Parkinson's state). Abnormalities will be correlated
      with standard autonomic tests and with skin biopsy findings Parkinson's degeneration in the
      peripheral autonomic fibers.

      If the investigator can find a reliable way to diagnose and follow Parkinson's disease, he
      will be able to correctly identify Parkinson's (even in its earliest stages). This will
      improve the chance to find protective treatments against Parkinson's, by preventing false
      diagnosis and by providing a new marker to track disease progression.

      If successful, the investigator will aim to validate the findings on a large sample of
      Parkinson's and also to track changes over time in the original cohorts
