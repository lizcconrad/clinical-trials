    <textblock>
      This study will compare interscalene nerve block versus liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel) for
      pain control after total shoulder replacements. Each method will be assessed in terms of post
      operative pain scores, pain medication consumption, length of stay, complications (nerve
      injuries, hematomas, cardiac/respiratory events) and rate of readmission due to pain. The
      aims of this study will be achieved through a randomized controlled trial and
      cost-effectiveness analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the decision to proceed with shoulder replacement surgery, patients will be asked to
      participate in this randomized trial.

      Consent will be completed after explanation of each treatment group and the data to be
      collected. Patient age, gender, BMI, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score
      will be recorded as baseline demographic data.

      Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment groups by simple randomization into
      one of two groups: Group 1 will receive interscalene nerve block, Group 2 will receive
      liposomal bupivacaine for postoperative analgesia. Randomization will be stratified by site.
      The surgeon will perform randomization when the patient enters the preoperative area.

      The surgeon at each site will be trained prior to enrollment on the correct way to perform
      Exparel injections intraoperatively. Patients in the interscalene nerve block group will be
      given a single shot block in the preoperative area by a fellowship-trained anesthesiologist.

      Surgical time, type of implant, incision length, and amount of anesthesia required will be
      recorded for each patient.

      Patients will record their pain scores, medication and side effects data after surgery until
      96 hours after surgery. Our primary analysis data points for pain scores and pain medication
      use will be 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, and 2 weeks after surgery. The outcome
      assessor on the study team will be blinded to the treatment group.
