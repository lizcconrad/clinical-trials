      The aim of the study is to compare the measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL),
      macula and optical disc parameters obtained by optical coherence tomography (OCT), and
      intraocular pressure (IOP) between the patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO)
      and healthy controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred and thirty two eyes of 66 patients with TAO and 72 eyes of 36 healthy controls
      were included in the study. Proptosis level was determined by Hertel exophthalmometer. Optic
      disc, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer and macula parameters were measured by OCT. All
      measurements were compared between the patients and age and sex-matched healthy controls.
