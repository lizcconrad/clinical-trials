  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this trial is to determine whether initiating moderate- or high-intensity
      atorvastatin therapy in hemodialysis patient not previously on a statin reduces inflammation
      and lowers average Epogen utilization. Statin naive patients on maintenance HD will be
      started on 20mg atorvastatin daily for weeks and then titrated up to 40mg atorvastatin daily
      for an additional 12 weeks. Patient's inflammatory markers (ferritin, CRP) and weekly Epogen
      usage will be monitored.

      Patients will be identified and consented. After informed consent is obtained, baseline
      demographic information, past medical history, dialysis specific information, and laboratory
      metrics (lipid profile, inflammatory markers) will be obtained from the electronic medical
      records. For the first 12 weeks, all subjects will be instructed to take one 20mg
      atorvastatin tablet daily; atorvastatin tablets will be dispensed by the research team in
      30-tablet increments every month to ensure compliance and prevent diversion. Subjects will
      undergo standard-of-care hemodialysis with routine hemoglobin monitoring and Epogen titration
      according to the dialysis center protocol. Every two weeks, they will be assessed by a
      research coordinator who will monitor for medication adverse effects (see attached patient
      survey) and medication compliance (pill counts) at alternating visits. After 12 weeks, lipid
      profile and inflammatory markers will be rechecked or obtained from the electronic medical
      record. For the subsequent 12 weeks (ie. weeks 12-24), subjects will be instructed to take
      two 20mg atorvastatin tablets (40mg total) daily. If the subject is unable to tolerate 40mg
      of atorvastatin daily due to medication adverse effects, they will continue to take 20mg
      atorvastatin daily for the remainder of the trial. Epogen will be titrated and subjects will
      be monitored as above. At the completion of the study, a lipid panel and inflammatory markers
      will be checked for a third time. Epogen usage and dialysis specific information will be
      recorded continuously throughout the study.
