    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of spinal anesthesia with
      isobaric ropivacaine, compared with hyperbaric bupivacaine in geriatric patients undergoing
      lower limb orthopedic surgery.

    <textblock>
      52 patients physical status II-III according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists
      classification aged 65 years and above of average height, and scheduled for total knee
      replacement under spinal anesthesia.

      Patients were randomly assigned into two equal groups of 26 patients each according to the
      type of local anesthetic injected in the subarachnoid space , Group I : patients who received
      an intrathecal injection of 12.5 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine , Group II: patients who
      received an intrathecal injection of 15 mg of 0.5% ropivacaine.

      The investigators compared both groups as regards the extent and duration of sensory and
      motor block and hemodynamics including heart rate (HR) , non invasive mean arterial blood
      pressure (MAP) and respiratory depression.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the extent and duration of sensory block</measure>
    <time_frame>within 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of sensory block to pinprick was performed at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 15 min after the intrathecal injection and then every 15 min until regression to L5. Results of the pinprick test were determined bilaterally at midclavicular level by using a short-beveled 27-gauge needle. Response to pain we determined by asking the patient whether or not he feels pain with the pinprick.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the extent and duration of motor block</measure>
    <time_frame>within 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Motor block in the lower limb was assessed by using a modified Bromage scale (0 = no paralysis , 1 = unable to raise extended leg , 2 = unable to flex knee , 3 = unable to flex ankle). These assessments were performed immediately after the assessments of sensory block until the return of normal motor function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>within 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>All patients of these 2 groups were assessed and monitored for Haemodynamics using ECG for heart rate (HR). Baseline values were defined as heart rate values before the preanesthetic infusion. The values were recorded before the induction and then every 5 min until discharge from the recovery room.</description>
