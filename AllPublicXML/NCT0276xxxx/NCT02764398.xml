  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Serious adverse cardio-respiratory events (SCRE) occur during super selective
      ophthalmic artery chemotherapy for retinoblastoma in children. SCRE mechanism remains unclear
      but may be attributed to an autonomic nervous reflex induced by catheterization of the
      ophthalmic artery. The investigators hypothesize that inadequacy between depth of anesthesia
      and catheter stimulation might be a support cause of these SCRE.

      Methods: Children requiring super selective ophthalmic artery chemotherapy for retinoblastoma
      are prospectively included in this observational study. Endovascular procedures are performed
      under standardized and deep general anesthesia with sevoflurane, sufentanil and rocuronium.
      SCRE are strictly pre-defined and included arterial hypotension, bradycardia and
      bronchospasm. SCRE are recorded and the factors influencing their occurrence are
      investigated.
