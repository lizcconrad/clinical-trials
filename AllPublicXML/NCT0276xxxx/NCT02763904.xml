  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protein-calorie malnutrition is a frequent comorbidity in hospitalized patients and there is
      evidence that the nutritional status may influence the response to drug treatment, mortality,
      susceptibility to infections, the patient's functional status, duration of hospital stay and,
      consequently, overall healthcare costs. The causes of malnutrition are manifold. The
      underlying disease may in fact lead to an increase in the patient's energy needs, whether or
      not associated with a reduction in caloric intake. The same therapeutic treatments can
      further worsen the energy balance without considering that the patient can be kept fasting
      for the execution of some diagnostic procedures. Therefore, a further deterioration of
      nutritional status during hospitalization could occur.

      International guidelines underline the utility to set a nutritional support whenever this is
      necessary, not only to prevent or treat malnutrition but also improve clinical outcomes. In
      this perspective, the improvement of oral diet and the use of oral nutritional supplements
      (ONS) represent the first-line strategy of intervention. Previous studies have shown that
      nutritional counseling, with or without the use of ONS, in patients with chronic disease is
      able to improve the calorie-protein intake, prevent deterioration of nutritional status, as
      well as to increase to a certain extent body weight. Particularly, energy-dense are more
      effective in increase energy intake. These data have highlighted the importance of a proper
      evaluation of the nutritional status of early detection of patients who could benefit of
      nutritional support. However, the independent role of the ONS in improving clinical outcome
      still needs to be established.
