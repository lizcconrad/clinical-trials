      This study will compare the effectiveness of two approaches for delivering smoking cessation
      advice in the primary care setting. Ask-Advise-Connect (AAC) is a strategy that uses the
      electronic health record (EHR) to prompt clinical staff to Ask if the patient smokes, Advise
      them to quit and, if they're interested, Connect them to Quitline (QL) counseling services.
      The connection occurs when a QL counselor is notified of the patient's interest, and then
      calls the patient to enroll in treatment. AAC has been shown to be very effective at
      enrolling patients, however, it was found that less than 42% of patients who agreed to be
      referred were successfully contacted by the QL after 5 call attempts. This indicates that
      many patients that are referred are not ready for cessation, but may feel obligated to accept
      the referral from their primary care team. This presents an opportunity to improve the
      patient centeredness of the referral process.

      To overcome these limitations, the investigators propose pairing it with a patient-centered
      smoking cessation approach called the Teachable Moments Communication Process (TMCP). The
      investigators' team developed this communication strategy, which incorporates patients'
      concerns into a partnership-oriented discussion about smoking cessation. The investigators
      propose that combining these two approaches could increase appropriate referrals to the QL,
      increase the likelihood of successful patient contact and enrollment, and increase the
      patient's rating of the value of the experience.

      The investigators specifically aim to:

        1. Improve delivery and documentation of smoking cessation advice and assistance to
           socially and economically disadvantaged patients using an AAC approach integrated into
           the EHR.

        2. Test the effect of combining the TMCP with AAC on process, Quitline referral and smoking
           outcomes.

        3. Examine the narratives of subgroups of individuals to better understand the referral
           experience and identify ways to improve it.

      The investigative research team will conduct a randomized trial to implement these strategies
      with 8 clinics serving more than 25,000 patients who smoke. The investigators use a stepped
      wedge design to first implement the AAC system change intervention and then to implement the
      TMCP in 8 clinics that are randomly assigned to a time point (step) for receiving the TMCP
      intervention. The investigators will collect data via patient survey, EHR and Quitline. The
      investigators also will conduct in-depth interviews with sub-groups of patients to inform
      ways to improve the referral process. With mounting demand for systems-based solutions for
      providing tobacco cessation assistance, it is urgent to understand how to use a systems
      approach like the AAC in a way that attends to the patient experience. The findings from this
      study will be useful to clinicians, patients, healthcare systems, and health insurance plans.
