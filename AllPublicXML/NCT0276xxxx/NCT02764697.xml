  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uveitis represents a heterogeneous group of diseases that results from ocular inflammatory
      reaction involving ocular tissue and vasculature. The inflammation usually causes pain,
      redness, photophobia and blurred vision. This inflammation, is typically treated with
      regional or systemic therapy. The regional therapy typically consists of topical
      corticosteroids or periocular or regional corticosteroids. Regional therapy can lead to a
      steroid response glaucoma, which is increased intraocular pressure.This pilot study aims to
      evaluate the possible effectiveness of H.P. Acthar in patients with active ocular
      inflammatory disease, and currently on treatment for glaucoma or have a history of glaucoma.

      Uveitis represents a heterogeneous group of diseases that results from ocular inflammatory
      reaction involving ocular tissue and vasculature. The inflammation usually causes pain,
      redness, photophobia and blurred vision.

      H.P Acthar Gel stimulate the adrenal cortex to secrete cortisol. Additionally H.P. Acthar gel
      is also reported to bind to melanocortin receptors. Melanocortin receptor activation has been
      shown to exert marked anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory effects in animal studies, by
      modulating pro inflammatory cytokines, followed by induction of anti- inflammatory mediators
      and subsequent leukocyte migration. Specifically melanocortins down regulate Tumor Necrosis
      Factor (TNF) alpha, Interleukin (IL) -2, Interferon gamma and T-cell proliferation and
      upregulates IL-10 and regulatory T cells. For this reason H.P. Acthar is an approved
      treatment for ocular inflammatory disease.

      Ocular inflammatory disease is typically treated with regional or systemic therapy. The
      regional therapy typically consists of topical corticosteroids or periocular or regional
      corticosteroids. Regional therapy can lead to a steroid response glaucoma, which is increased
      intraocular pressure.This pilot study aims to evaluate the possible effectiveness of H.P.
      Acthar in patients with active ocular inflammatory disease, and currently on treatment for
      glaucoma or have a history of glaucoma.

      Subjects will be treated with H P Acthar subcutaneous gel, 40 U/ml, given twice weekly x 8
      weeks, followed by once weekly x 4 weeks: a total 20 doses with the same cumulative units to
      be administered, using the approved route, with the option to do 4 additional doses if
      resolution is incomplete.

      This will be a prospective open-label, non-randomized pilot study: 12 week treatment for
      active non-infectious uveitis, endpoint assessment and safety assessment; additional 12 week
      assessment for uveitis activity/quiescence and safety assessment.

    <measure>Resolution of Inflammation: Anterior Uveitis</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>2 step decrease in inflammatory score or down to grade 0 (Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature, standardized and published for reporting clinical trials in uveitis:SUN criteria): Using the SUN criteria, inflammation can be graded on a scale from 0-4: subjects will be graded at baseline; resolution will graded as achieving the primary endpoint when the score decreases by 2 steps on the scale, or goes down to grade 0</description>

    <measure>Resolution of Inflammation: Retinal Vasculitis</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical improvement of vasculitis, corroborated by angiographic evaluation: subjects with retinal vasculitis will have a retinal angiogram called a fluorescein angiogram at baseline and week 12, this will document areas of retinal vascular inflammation: Resolution will be graded at 12 weeks based on retinal leakage resolution on the fluorescein angiogram</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Resolution of Inflammation:Intermediate Uveitis: Photographic haze reduced to grade 0 or down 2 steps documented with fundus photography</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will have fundus photography at baseline and 12 weeks. Intermediate uveitis is graded by haze; it is done using the photographic scale: grades 0-4, utilized by the SUN criteria, based on the Nussenblatt photographic vitreous haze scale</description>

    <measure>Resolution of Inflammation: Clinically Significant Uveitic Macular Edema: Clinical improvement of macular edema with optical coherence tomography (OCT), which measures retinal thickness; documentation of central foveal thickness &lt; 300 microns</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will have optical coherence tomography done at baseline and 12 weeks; decrease in foveal thickness to &lt; 300microns will be documented as resolution of clinically significant uveitic macular edema</description>

    <measure>Resolution of Inflammation: Scleritis: 2 step decrease or down to grade 0 improvement of with photographic documentation</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Resolution of scleritis inflammation will be assessed by comparing baseline graded photographs compared to graded photographs at 12 weeks, utilizing the published standardized Sen grading scale for scleritis.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Resolution of Inflammation: Resolution of retinal and choroidal infiltrate with photographic documentation</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will have photos at baseline and 12 weeks if they have posterior uveitis; the resolution of retinal and choroidal lesions will be documented by photographs</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in visual acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The visual acuity of subjects will be measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity chart. The ETDRS scores will be converted to a logarithmic scale, LogMar units, which will be utilized to calculate mean and median change in visual acuity score from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks</description>
