    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of verum acupuncture (VA) for the
      prevention of migraine without aura compared to non-penetrating sham acupuncture (SA) and
      usual care alone (UC). This study also aims to determine whether the intensity of deqi
      sensations and psychosocial factors (including patient expectations, patient personality
      traits, patient-doctor relationship, traditional Chinese medicine constitution, depression,
      anxiety, sleep quality, etc.) are associated with clinical outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trail consists of three periods: baseline period before treatment and randomization
      (week-4 to week 0), treatment period (week 1 to week 8), and follow-up period (week 9 to week
      20).A total of 150 participants will be randomly assigned to verum acupuncture(VA)group, sham
      acupuncture(SA)group, and usual care(UC) group in a ratio of 2:2:1. The primary outcome
      measures are the change of migraine days and migraine attacks in a cycle of 4 weeks compared
      to baseline. The secondary outcome measures are the proportion of responders, headache
      intensity, intake of acute medication, and the change of life quality and sleep quality. Deqi
      sensations will be measured by the Chinese version of the Massachusetts General Hospital
      Acupuncture Sensation Scale. Psychological outcome measures are Beck Depression Rating Scale,
      Beck Anxiety Inventory, NEO Five-Factor Inventory, Doctor-Patient Relationship Scale, and
      Difficult Doctor-Patients Relationship Scale. Participants will be asked to complete headache
      diaries from the baseline to follow-up period. The central randomization and data collection
      will be conducted by an electronic data management system.

    <description>Participants will receive verum acupuncture plus usual care. Participants will receive acupuncture treatment every other day to fulfill a 10-session treatment course, and another 10-session course will begin after a nine-day break, totally be treated with 20 sessions. Verum needles will be inserted into the skin and manipulated manually until deqi occurs. The needles are retained for 30 min in each session. During the treatment, the acupuncturist inquires the patient about deqi sensations every 10 min and manipulates the needles to maintain the intensity of deqi. Participants will receive the same usual care as those in the usual care group.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive sham acupuncture plus usual care. The Streitberger placebo needle will be placed at non-acupuncture points which are distant from the meridian parts and not located on the same neuromuscular segments as the prescribed points used in the VA group, so as to minimize any therapeutic and segmental effects. The same acupuncture schedule as that in the verum acupuncture group will be applied. The needles are retained for 30 min in each session. During the treatment, the acupuncturist inquires the patient about deqi sensations every 10 min and pretends to manipulate the needles but deqi is not sought. Participants will receive the same usual care as those in the usual care group.</description>

    <description>We use a non-insertive sham control produced by Asia-med Company in Germany—the streitberger placebo-needle. Sham points are described as follows: 1) Bilateral of midpoint between acupoint &quot;Jianjin&quot;(GB21) and &quot;Jugu&quot;(LI16); 2) 5 cun lateral to the seventh thoracic spine; 3) 5 cun lateral to the eighth thoracic spine; 4) 5 cun lateral to the ninth thoracic spine. Cun is a distance measure unit used in locating acupoints in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) acupuncture, and the width of patient's thumb interphalangeal joint is regarded as one cun.</description>
