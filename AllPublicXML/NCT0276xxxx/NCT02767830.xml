      A 12 month long program focused on making good food choices and exercise directed at 8-12
      year olds and their caregivers. The program will consist of monthly educational meetings each
      teaching a new nutritional and exercise concept. Children will be given weekly exercise
      schedules and their adherence to the program will be assessed. The study will culminate with
      an annual children's race in May.
