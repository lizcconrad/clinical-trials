  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 clinical trial, which tests two investigational drugs: TPIV200/huFR-1 (also
      called TPIV200), which is a vaccine consisting of proteins from the folate receptor alpha
      mixed with GM-CSF, and durvalumab (MEDI4736) , which is an antibody drug that help un-block
      parts of the immune system. The aim of this study is to find out whether these drugs, when
      given together are safe, and whether they are effective in treating cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have recurrent or persistent platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian,
             fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma with measureable disease (as defined
             by RECIST 1.1.) who have received at least one prior platinum-based therapy.

        Platinum-based therapy is defined as treatment with carboplatin, cisplatin or another
        organoplatinum compound.

        Platinum-resistant is defined as having had disease progression within 6 months or most
        recent platinum therapy, or having disease progression while receiving previous
        platinum-based chemotherapy.

        Histologic documentation of diagnosis of carcinoma is required and the following histologic
        subtypes are eligible: high grade serous, clear cell, endometrioid, carcinoma,
        adenocarcinoma, mixed (including above subtypes only).

             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) and
             has not been previously irradiated. Each lesion must be ≥ 10 mm when measured by CT,
             MRI or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or ≥ 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray.

                  1976) or by 24-hour urine collection for determination of creatinine clearance:

        Creatinine CL = Weight (kg) x (140 - Age) x 0.85 (mL/min) 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)

          -  Female subjects must either be of non-reproductive potential (ie, post-menopausal by
