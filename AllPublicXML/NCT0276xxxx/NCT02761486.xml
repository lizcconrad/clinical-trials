  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular use of aspirin may reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it is
      unclear through which mechanism aspirin exerts its effect, in whom it decreases CRC risk and
      in whom it causes side effects. Recently, the imbalanced gut microbiome was linked to
      inflammation and CRC risk. The main hypothesis for this study is that aspirin may decrease
      CRC risk via targeting the gut microbiome. The study will be a randomized placebo-controlled
      double-blinded design, recruiting 50 healthy subjects, 50-75 years old, from the PRospective
      Evaluation of SEPTin 9 (PRESEPT) cohort living in the greater Twin Cities area, who will
      receive either aspirin or placebo for 6 weeks.

      The pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of conducting a large randomized trial and
      estimate the effects of aspirin on the gut microbiome. The study will recruit 50 healthy
      subjects, 50-75 years old, from the PRospective Evaluation of SEPTin 9 (PRESEPT) cohort
      living in the greater Twin Cities area.

      The Primary Aim is to estimate the impact of a 3- and 6-week intake of once daily 325 mg
      aspirin on the composition of the gut microbiome using a randomized placebo-controlled
      double-blinded design, i.e. examine the change of microbiome over time within and between the
      subjects. The hypothesis for this aim is that in the aspirin arm versus the placebo arm, gut
      microbiome composition will shift towards a lower proportion of pro-inflammatory,
      CRC-predisposing bacteria (e.g. Fusobacteria) and higher proportion of anti-inflammatory,
      CRC-protective bacteria (e.g. butyrate-producing bacteria).

      The Secondary Aims are to examine the correlation between the aspirin-related changes in
      microbiome profile with the levels of circulating inflammatory biomarkers in urine and
      plasma. Within-individual and between-arm differences in microbiome composition will be
      compared after 3 and 6 weeks of aspirin intake. Also, the microbiome composition will be
      compared after 3-week and 6-week wash-out periods to test whether these periods are
      sufficient to restore gut microbiome composition to a pre-treatment level. This study will
      inform future crossover randomized studies focusing on CRC preventive interventions that will
      enable clinicians to identify optimal candidates for aspirin therapy for the purposes of CRC
      prevention using this accessible and cheap drug.
