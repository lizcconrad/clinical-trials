      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial. After a 2-week run-in
      period, eligible patients will be, based on the randomization codes kept in sealed envelopes,
      randomly assigned to receive usual care (mucolytics and/or chest physiotherapy) plus oxygen
      inahaltion (1 hr daily for 12 consecutive months) or hydrogen inhalation (1 hr daily for 12
      consecutive months) provided by the sponsor. At 3 months after the end-of-treatment, a
      follow-up visit will be scheduled for all patients.

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial. After 2-week run-in
      period, eligible patients will be, based on the randomization codes kept in sealed envelopes,
      randomly assigned to two groups.On the basis of usual care [ambroxool (30mg thrice daily), or
      N-acetylcysteine (0.2g thrice daily)/ serrapeptase (10mg thrice daily), or carbocisteine
      (500mg thrice daily) and/or chest physiotherapy (10 min, twice daily)], patients were
      randomized to receive either hydrogen (66.7%, 3L/min, 1 hr twice daily) inhalation or oxygen
      inhalation (3L/min, 1 hr twice daily) via nasal canula for 12 months. A follow-up visit at
      month 3 following end-of-treatment was also scheduled. The primary endpoint was the annual
      frequency of bronchiectasis exacerbations. Hospital visits were scheduled at baseline and
      months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15, respectively. At 3 months after the end-of-treatment, a
      follow-up visit will be scheduled for all patients.

    <description>The medical ultrasonic nebulizers with hydrogen/oxygen generating function (MUNHO) will be provided exclusively by the sponsor, Asclepius Meditec Inc (Shanghai, China). The MUNHO consists of a electrolytic tank which, by using direct current converted from alternating current (220 V), generates the hydrogen and oxygen gas from pure water (2:1 in volume). The MUNHO is also capable of nebulizing the water via ultrasounds with the hydrogen-oxygen mixture gas which is finally delivered to the patient's airways via the facial mask through a plastic tube. Typically, the volume of hydrogen-oxygen mixed gas is 3 liters per minute (3 L/min). Usual care referred to mucolytics (see below for details) alone or plus chest physiotherapy.</description>
