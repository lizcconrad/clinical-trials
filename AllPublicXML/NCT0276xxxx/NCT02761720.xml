    <textblock>
      The Mobile Mood Tracking App study is a small randomized trial of acceptability and usability
      of a mobile phone mood tracking application (mobile app) among women with depressed mood in
      pregnancy. The study will be assessing the perceived value and usability of this tool in
      pregnancy over eight weeks to test whether women using this app are more likely to receive
      assessments and treatments of depressed mood than women not using it.
