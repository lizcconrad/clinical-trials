      Background / rational:

      Obesity is associated with significant comorbidities including type 2 diabetes (insulin
      resistance), heart disease, stroke, hypertension, sleep apnea syndrome, dyslipidemia, cancer,
      hepatobiliary diseases, orthopedic complications and psychosocial impact 1 .

      Peripheral neuropathy is a known complication in the type I and II diabetes and glucose
      intolerance and metabolic syndrome in 2. Outside of diabetes (type I and II) that are
      associated with cardiovascular risk high vascular, presence of metabolic syndrome constitutes
      in itself a well demonstrated vascular risk factor. Its definition requires the presence of
      three elements from the following 5: abdominal obesity (high waist circumference), high blood
      pressure, high fasting blood sugar, high triglycerides and / low HDL-cholesterol 3.

      This peripheral neuropathy predominantly affects sensory fibers of small poorly myelinated
      diameter (Aδ fibers and C) and autonomous sensory fibers and is called small fiber neuropathy
      4. The cardinal sign of NAION is the presence of neuropathic pain but abnormalities in
      physical examination are often absent and conventional electromyography is faulted to make
      the diagnosis. These small fibers are also constituent of the autonomic nervous system and
      causes damage autonomic dysfunction that can manifest the cardiovascular system (hypotension,
      cardiac conduction disorders), digestive, sweat, sphincter. neuropathy of the diagnosis of
      small fibers is suggested clinically by the presence of neuropathic pain often contrasting
      with a normal clinical examination. The confirmation is based on electrophysiology with
      various techniques and quantification of intra-epidermal nerve fibers.

      Main objective / secondary:

      Primary objective :

      To determine the prevalence of a small fiber peripheral neuropathy in nondiabetic obese
      patients, by measuring skin conductance ion Chlorine (Sudoscan®) evaluating small fibers C
      autonomic

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Evaluation of the prevalence of occurrence of peripheral neuropathy by Sudoscan® during
           follow-up after treatment of obese patients with bariatric surgery (months) M1, 3, 6, 9,
           12.

        -  Correlation of results obtained Sudoscan® quantitative sensory testing (QST) Thermotest®
           evaluating small sensory fibers Aδ, among non-operated non-diabetic obese patients and
           in the postoperative follow-up (months) M1, 3, 6, 9, 12.

        -  Characterization of electromyographic parameters (motor and sensory conduction) in
           patients with a skin conductance measured by lowered Sudoscan® and / or a threshold of
           sensitivity to pain increased Thermotest®.

        -  Correlation between the presence of a small fiber neuropathy in non-diabetic obese
           subjects with clinical and biological parameters collected.

      Methodology Design: prospective, single-center Study duration: 24 months (estimate: 3-5
      patients included / week of 15 patients collected in central obesity / week) including 12
      months of inclusion.

      Number of topics to include: 100 over a period of one year to adjust to the rhythm of the
      inclusions.

      As mentioned, patients will be a measure of impedance of the skin to products chlorine ions
      by the sweat glands via the Sudoscan®, marketed and used among diabetic patients or not for
      the detection of violations neuropathic (cf. references and CE certificate attached to the
      dossier).

      The Thermotest® is also marketed and used in diabetic and non-diabetic patients (see
      references and CE certificate attached to the dossier).

      Our center has gained experience of these techniques for the detection of peripheral
      neuropathy in several patient populations (diabetes and cancer in particular); manipulators
      (doctors and technicians) are trained in these techniques.

             -  known history of peripheral neuropathy.

      Development of the study:

      If patients the eligibility criteria, it will be proposed at the first consultation in
      central obesity, participate in a clinical study to assess the prevalence of subclinical
      damage peripheral nerves by simple and painless rapid measurement of skin conductance on the
      palm of the feet with the Sudoscan® device during the consultation and a Thermotest®, as well
      as monitoring during the various follow-up consultation after any bariatric surgery or not.
      This monitoring will be done by the same neurophysiological tests.

        -  During the preoperative assessment that will be conducted in the planned hospital in
           Diabetology Service, written information will be given to patient and no objection will
           be drawn, then the following tests will be done:

        -  The measurement of skin conductance by Sudoscan® and the extent of the painful
           sensitivity to temperature Thermotest® will be made for all patients included in the
           study.

        -  If the records Sudoscan® skin conductance less than 60μS, we propose a
           Electroneuromyography the patient as usual on GHPSJ.

        -  Measurement of weight, height, waist circumference and hip circumference patient

        -  The DN4 scale and Uens clinical neuropathy score.

        -  A measurement of blood pressure will be

        -  A biological sample will be taken on an empty stomach.

        -  For patients with plantar skin conductance will be lowered &lt;60μSiemens and / or whose
           pain threshold will warm significantly elevated (Thermotest®), if necessary
           electromyogram will be realized in the second time (appointment given to the output
           consultation with the endocrinologist.

        -  During the postoperative follow-up usually expected for this type of surgery, 1, 3, 6, 9
           and 12 months will be made the same clinical examinations than those made during the
           preoperative assessment and the type of surgery performed. Laboratory tests will be
           carried out in the usual care for surgical patients.

      Methodology Design: prospective, single-center Study duration: 24 months (estimate: 3-5
