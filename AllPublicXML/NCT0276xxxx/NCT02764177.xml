  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whilst the effects of manipulating the macronutrient content of foods on appetite and energy
      intake has been relatively well studied at rest, little is known about these responses in a
      post-exercise context. The effect of post-exercise nutrition on recovery from or adaptation
      to exercise has been well studied. However, many exercisers do so for weight management and
      thus any post-exercise nutrition might impact on energy balance and might need to be
      carefully considered. This study will examine the impact of manipulating the composition of a
      recovery drink consumed after resistance exercise on subsequent appetite and energy intake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects perform a bout of lower body resistance exercise lasting ~50 min and immediately
      post-exercise they consume one of two recovery drinks over a 5 min period. Over the next 60
      min subjective appetite responses will be measured and then 60 min after drink ingestion,
      subjects will consume an ad-libitum meal.
