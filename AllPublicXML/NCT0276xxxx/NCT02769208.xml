  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether two different central air purification
      technologies reduce air pollutant exposure and beneficially influence health as evaluated
      with a suite of biological markers related to cardiovascular and respiratory disease risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will test two common types of central air handling unit filtration technologies,
      high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), to
      evaluate the impacts of these technologies on personal exposure to air pollutants and the
      associated cardiovascular and respiratory health outcomes. HEPA filters remove a high
      percentage of the particulate matter in the air, as do ESPs, but ESPs also generate ozone,
      which may have its own detrimental health effects. These air purification technologies will
      be placed in different combinations with a coarse pre-filter to protect the air exchange
      machinery (combinations: pre-filter only, pre-filter + HEPA, and pre-filter + HEPA + ESP) in
      both the residences and offices of study participants living on a factory campus in Changsha,
      Hunan Province, China. Large dormitories and office buildings with central air handling units
      are common in China and around the world, and so adding air purification into the central
      ducts represents a practical strategy to reducing personal exposure to air pollution and
      related health outcomes. The Changsha area commonly suffers from high air pollution, and the
      dormitories and offices on this workspace are already outfitted with both HEPA filters and
      ESPs. Therefore, testing these technologies in this environment presents a natural
      experimental condition to test the benefits of air purification. The study investigators
      hypothesize that both the pre-filter + HEPA and pre-filter + HEPA + ESP conditions will
      reduce particulate matter exposure and reduce biological markers of cardiovascular and
      respiratory disease compared to the pre-filter alone, but that the ESP will generate enough
      ozone to lead to lower health benefits than HEPA+pre-filter condition.

    <description>Subjects in Group A start with baseline conditions of pre-filter + HEPA + ESP in their offices and dorms. After a baseline biological measurement, they then receive a 5-week intervention in which both the HEPA and ESP are removed, leaving only a pre-filter.
