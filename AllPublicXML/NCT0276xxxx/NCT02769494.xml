      The study will include three phases: screening, treatment and follow-up.

      Screening: This phase will last a maximum of 7 days and subjects eligibility will be
      evaluated after informed consent signature.

      Treatment: Subjects are randomly assigned to treatment and will be treated for 7 days. Daily
      oral ulcer area and symptoms were recorded during the treatment period. A randomization visit
      will take place on day 0 and an end-of-treatment visit will take place between day 6 and 8.

      Follow-up: 28 days after the end of treatment. Efficacy of treatment was evaluated by the
      oral ulcer remission or decreasing.

    <description>The primary outcome is ulcer healing, oral ulcer area can be divided into 3 degrees: 1 degrees for a single ulcer, area ≤ 8mm; 2 degree for a single ulcer, 8mm ≤ area ≤ 15mm, or two ulcers, area of every ulcer ≤ 8mm; 3 degree for a single ulcer, area ≥ 15 mm, or 2 ulcers, every area between 8 to 15mm. Recovery refers oral ulcer is healing completely. The effective is the ulcer area decrease more than 1 degree. Invalid means the ulcer area is no change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>symptoms effective rates</measure>
    <time_frame>At the 7 Days of the treatment, and the 28 Days after the end of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom effective rate =（total score before treatment - total score after treatment）/total score before treatment x 100%. Total score = frequency + severity. Frequency score is calculated by all the frequency of oral pain, anorexia,and eating difficult. Severity is accumulated by the degree of symptoms described above,which is divided to 4 degree as 0 presenting none,and 3 presenting most severe.</description>
