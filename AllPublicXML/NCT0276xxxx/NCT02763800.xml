      The objectives as stated in the study protocol were as follows:

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of three multiple dose regimens of BIA 3-202
           (50 mg twice a day, 100 mg twice a day and 200 mg twice a day in healthy young male
           volunteers). Part A

        -  To characterise the steady state pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of BIA
           3-202 in healthy young males. Part A

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of a single multiple dose regimen (dose to be
           determined from Part A) of BIA 3-202, in healthy elderly volunteers. Part B

        -  To characterise the steady state pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of a single
           multiple dose regimen (dose to be determined from Part A) of BIA 3- 202 in healthy
           elderly volunteers. Part B

      This was designed as a single centre, phase I, double-blind, randomised, placebocontrolled
      study of three multiple rising doses in three sequential groups of 8 young male healthy
      volunteers (Part A) and a single group of healthy elderly volunteers (Part B).

      In Part B, 12 healthy elderly volunteers were to be enrolled. Ten were to be randomly
      allocated to BIA 3-202 and two to placebo.
