      The investigators intend to conduct multi-center randomized controlled study to find if Uncut
      Roux-en-Y anastomosis to the distal gastric cancer patients after radical D2 can reduce the
      long-term complications, affect the quality of life, and improve the prognosis, comparing to
      Billroth II anastomosis.

    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is still one of the most common malignant tumors, and gastric antrum cancer is
      still common. Radical surgery is the only way to treat gastric antrum cancer, surgical
      procedures and reconstruction are closely related with the prognosis and quality of life, the
      choice is crucial. Gastrojejunostomy after distal gastrectomy may affect the quality of
      radical surgery, and postoperative diet, nutritional status and quality of life. More and
      more centers tend to choose Billroth II anastomosis, but patients prone to have a variety of
      complications, including reflux gastritis and bile reflux, malnutrition, seriously affecting
      the quality of life and so on. According to preliminary pilot study found that, uncut
      Roux-en-Y anastomosis way can keep the continuity of nerve-muscle function of the
      reconstruction of digestive tract, and closes the input in order to reduce the incidence of
      reflux, for improving the nutritional status and reducing complications and improve quality
      of life. Therefore, the investigators intend to conduct multi-center randomized controlled
      study to find if Uncut Roux-en-Y anastomosis to the distal gastric cancer patients after
      radical D2 can reduce the long-term complications, affect the quality of life, and improve
      the prognosis.

    <description>After distal gastrectomy, duodenal stump closure, side to side anastomosis was underwent on the remnant stomach and jejunum,which was 25cm from Treitz ligament. Then underwent side to side anastomosis between jejunum about 35cm distance from gastrojejunostomy and jejunum about 5cm from Triez ligament . close the intestinal cavity on the input less than 5cm distance from the loop gastrojejunostomy anastomosis by using uncut Closure devices</description>

    <description>After distal gastrectomy, duodenal stump closure, the investigators first underwent remnant stomach and upper jejunum side anastomosis. Then choose the jejunum about 25cm from Treitz ligament, premenstrual colon using a disposable cutting closure (or tubular stapling) in the rear wall of the stomach and jejunum anastomosis, common opening was closed with the (barbed wire) hand-stitched. After that, steps were same with the group A.</description>
