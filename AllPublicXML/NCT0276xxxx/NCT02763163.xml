  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      These days many studies are conducted testing the symbiosis between the bacteria population
      to the human body's functioning. The research of the connection between the skin condition
      and the bacteria population is in its early stages. There is a characterization of different
      bacteria for different body areas depending on their composition, humidity etc. In addition,
      there are preliminary findings of biological receptors that react to the contact with
      bacteria on the surface of the skin and turn on the immune system, awakening it to cope with
      the new invader. Based on the above information, the investigators hypothesis is that there
      is a connection between the degrees of sun exposure of individuals to the growing of
      beneficial bacteria populations on the surface of the skin. The study will compare between
      the bacteria population on the skin of Israeli subjects, divided to two groups, one with an
      excessive exposure to the sun on a daily basis, (such as agricultural workers, lifeguards,
      construction, etc.), and the other of the office worker who spend most of the day in a closed
      shaded room.
