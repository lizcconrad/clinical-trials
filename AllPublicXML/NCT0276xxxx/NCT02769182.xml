  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this research is to develop and validate a technology-based solution
      that addresses the diminished mobility, increased fall risk and impaired cognitive function
      that are so common among older adults, enabling them to live longer successfully and
      independently.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A comprehensive system will be developed to promote mobility, enhance cognitive function,
      reduce sedentary behavior, increase independence and encourage social inclusion. This novel
      system will have two distinct yet complementary features: monitoring and treatment that will
      serve as an &quot;all in one system&quot;. The system will consist of wearable sensors and a
      proprietary developed application. The wearable inertial sensors will measure the
      acceleration and orientation of the feet during movement. The sensors will feed real-time
      data to the system, which will process this data using a set of proprietary algorithms
      enabling continuous monitoring of activity, gait and fall risk, and independence. In
      addition, designated applications for direct cognitive assessment and training of older
      adults in their home and community environment will also be used via the Smart phone or
      mobile tablet. The training, both physical and cognitive, will also include multi-user
      interactions .Data collected by the system will be processed and integrated to provide
      comprehensive feedback from multiple domains to the user, caregiver and clinician by way of
      recommendations and personalized treatment goals.

    <description>subjects and caregivers will be trained on using the system and receive a 'user manual' delineating all procedures and possible applications of the system, as well as operations for daily charging of the sensors and smart phone. They will then be fitted with the sensors. The clinician will set all necessary applications, including setting the cognitive games application and the 'network of users'. Users and care givers will be informed of the personalized recommendations system that will provide the user with daily feedback on activity and weekly recommendations and goals for duration of the study. A helpline will be provided in case technological problems occur or for routine support.</description>

    <description>Subjects in this group will not receive the system but will encouraged to continue with their daily living routine and provided with recommendations for stretching and strengthening exercises. The control group subjects will be assessed at the same three time points as those in the experimental group. Subjects in both groups will also receive written information about the importance of activity, cognitive enhancing tasks, avoidance of falls and home hazards. In Israel, this information combined with an exercise prescription is considered the 'standard of care' for community-dwelling older adults.</description>
