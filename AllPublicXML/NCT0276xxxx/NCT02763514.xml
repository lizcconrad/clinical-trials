    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of EPA- and DHA-enriched omega-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acid dietary supplements on cognitive function (episodic memory,
      attention, working memory, executive function), subjective mood, alertness and mental fatigue
      after 26 weeks daily supplementation.
