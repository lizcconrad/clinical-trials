      This will be a randomised, crossover, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled,

      This will be a randomised, crossover, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled,
      multicentre, phase II proof-of-concept study in PD patients with end-of-dose wearing-off
      (motor fluctuations).

      In a 2-period crossover design the subjects will receive ODM-104/levodopa/ carbidopa or
      Stalevo during the different study periods in a randomised order. There will be a screening
      period, 2 treatment periods and a post-treatment period, altogether 7 scheduled visits: a
      screening visit, a baseline visit, 4 visits during the treatment periods (i.e. 2 visits/each
      period), and an end-of-study visit. Unscheduled visits may be performed during the first 2
      weeks of each treatment period, if there is a need to adjust the levodopa strength. The total
      study duration will be 10-15 weeks for each subject.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent (IC) obtained.

          -  Male or female patients with idiopathic PD according to the UK brain bank criteria
             with end-of-dose wearing-off (motor fluctuations).

          -  Hoehn and Yahr stage 2-4 performed during the ON-state.

          -  At least 2 hours of OFF-time on each day (measured by the ON/OFF diary) on 3
             consecutive days at the end of the screening period just before the baseline visit
             (visit 1).

          -  Treatment with 4-8 daily doses of levodopa/AADC inhibitor, either combined with
             entacapone (levodopa/AADC inhibitor combined with Comtess/Comtan or as Stalevo) or
             without entacapone, with a total daily levodopa dose from &gt; 400 mg to ≤ 1200 mg with
             entacapone, or from &gt; 400 mg to ≤ 1400 mg without entacapone. One evening dose of

             antiparkinsonian medication (dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase [MAO] B inhibitor,
             amantadine and/or anticholinergics with doses recommended by the manufacturer), if
             any, for at least 4 weeks before the screening visit.

          -  Age of 30 years or above.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Secondary or atypical Parkinsonism.
