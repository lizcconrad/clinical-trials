  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilation of a bearded patient with the commonly used face mask has low efficiency because
      of difficulties to achieve a tight seal around the mouth and nose.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a novel bag valve guedel adaptor
      (BVGA) that enables the direct connection of a bag valve device to a guedel - eliminating the
      need for a face mask.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ventilating a patient using a bag valve and a face mask is not easy to perform, especially
      for a long period of time, and mandates experience and strength by the care giver. The need
      for a tight seal around the mouth and nose is a major challenge especially if the patient has
      a beard. Nevertheless, the face mask is the only approved respiratory support that medics and
      other basic care givers are allowed to use in the out-of-the-hospital setting, and only
      physicians and paramedics are allowed to use more advanced techniques, providing a definite
      airways. Thus, despite its lower effectiveness, the bag valve mask technique is the most
      commonly used in the field

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a novel bag valve guedel adaptor
      (BVGA) that enables the direct connection of a bag valve device to a guedel - eliminating the
      need for a face mask.

      Study Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled. The volunteers will be asked randomly
      assigned to breathe through the BVGA/Face mask followed by the same protocol with the
      Face-mask/BVGA: 5 minutes room air, 5 minutes 100% oxygen, and 5 minutes room air again. The
      BVGAs/face masks well be connected to a standard operating room ventilation machines, and
      cardiopulmonary parameters will be monitored and documented.
