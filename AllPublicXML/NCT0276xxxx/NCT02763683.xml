    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a brain imaging method called Pittsburgh B (PIB) Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET) and Vesicular Cholinergic Transport (VAT) PET to determine dementia
      subtypes in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). The ultimate goal of this project is to be
      able to identify individuals with PD who are at risk of developing dementia, and to
      distinguish the underlying cause of dementia.

      The purpose of this study is to use a brain imaging method called PIB PET and VAT PET to
      determine dementia subtypes in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). The ultimate goal of
      this project is to be able to identify individuals with PD who are at risk of developing
      dementia, and to distinguish the underlying cause of dementia. The investigators will be
      including both PD and normal subjects in this study. This a long term study and we are
      considering including a total of 320 participants in this protocol.

    <description>The investigators will perform memory/thinking testing, Lumbar puncture (LP), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and (PET) scans to help to determine the cause(s) of memory and thinking in Parkinson Disease.
The memory and thinking testing by phone on average at 1.5 years through study completion and then in person on average at 3 years through study completion, this will help monitor if there is any decline in memory and thinking.
The Lumbar Puncture is done on willing participants on average at 3 years through study completion to assess for any abnormal proteins and correlate these with any changes in memory and thinking.
The MRI is done on average at 3 years through study completion for any abnormal signs or changes in regards to dementia at 3 years.
The (PiB) &amp; (VAT) PET scans will be performed on average at 6 years through study completion, which will be analyzed to assess for changes in regards to abnormal proteins and signs of dementia.</description>
