    <textblock>
      The COCOA-BP Trial is designed to assess the impact of 50g daily dark chocolate intake on
      blood pressure and compare outcome data derived from wearable/digital health devices to data
      derived from standard methods. Additionally, the usability of the wearable technology will be
      evaluated.

      The COCOA-BP Trial is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, Boston Scientific volunteer
      trial, designed to assess the impact of 50g daily dark chocolate intake on blood pressure and
      compare outcome data derived from wearable/digital health devices to data derived from
      standard methods. Additionally, the usability of the wearable technology will be evaluated.
