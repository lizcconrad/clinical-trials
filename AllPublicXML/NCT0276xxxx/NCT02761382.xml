    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of psychological treatment on pain, quality of life and work
      ability among women with endometriosis related chronic pelvic pain in a three-armed,
      randomised study. One group will receive mindfulness-based psychological treatment, the
      second group will receive a non-specific general psychological treatment (a psychological
      placebo) and the third group will be a waiting list control (treatment as usual).
