  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the frequency of FGFR2 fusions in archived
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) or mixed hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CCA)
      tumor samples
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, observational study of archived human tissue samples; no
      surgical procedures will be required and no treatment will be provided as part of this study.
      Approximately 150 archived tissue samples obtained from patients with iCCA or mixed HCC-CCA
      will be analyzed for somatic alteration status and will include cholangiocarcinoma-specific
      FGFR2 fusion isoforms.

        One hundred and fifty archived tumor tissue samples from patients with iCCA or mixed
        HCC-CCA will be collected from five to fifteen research sites in the United States and
        Italy and/or from commercially available sources. No new surgical procedures will be
        required and no treatment will be provided as part of this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  If required by law or local regulations (i.e., the sample is from an identifiable
             subject), signed written informed consent should be granted prior to use of the sample
             in the study

          -  â‰¥ 18 years of age

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed iCCA or mixed HCC-CCA, who are/were eligible
             for systemic therapy (samples collected prior to initiation of the systemic therapy
             may be submitted for testing)

          -  Have one or more formalin fixed and paraffin embedded blocks available. If blocks are
             not evaluable, 7-10 unstained, non-baked slides with 5-micron thick sections with at
             least 20% tumor tissue should be available. (Potential participants who are scheduled
             to undergo surgical treatment may agree to provide surplus of tissues not required for
             diagnosis and have to provide informed consent prior to the surgery.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not applicable: Patients must meet all of the inclusion criteria.
