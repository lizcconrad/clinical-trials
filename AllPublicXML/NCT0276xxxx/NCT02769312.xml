  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate initial feasibility and efficacy of Theta
      Burst Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TBS) as an adjunct treatment for Veterans with PTSD.
      Primary outcomes measures include a feasibility of TBS procedures, with secondary outcome
      measures focusing on changes in PTSD symptom severity and quality of life and
      social/occupation functioning.

      The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the feasibility of theta burst transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (TBS) as an adjunct treatment for Veterans with PTSD. This project will
      result in development of methods needed to conduct an adequately powered, randomized
      controlled study of TBS for PTSD, which will assess the relationship between change in
      symptoms and quality of life. It will also lay the foundation for subsequent rehabilitation
      studies combining neuromodulation and psychotherapy in the longer term.

      TBS has several advantages compared to standard repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      (rTMS), including its ability to deliver large numbers of stimulation pulses in a shorter
      time period, and a stimulation pattern that may specifically affect key brain regions
      involved in PTSD. The significance of this research is the development of a novel,
      non-invasive brain stimulation approach for PTSD recovery. This project will provide the
      foundation for the development of methods needed to conduct an adequately powered, randomized
      controlled study of TBS for PTSD to ultimately develop brain stimulation techniques that can
      be combined with evidence-based psychotherapy, to develop a more powerful, individualized
      rehabilitation option for Veterans with PTSD.
