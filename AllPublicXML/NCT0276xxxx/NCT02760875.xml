  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a population of patients from another study, who was originally randomized to 2
      different types of nonoperative treatment after an acute achilles tendon rupture, the length
      of the achilles tendon is examined using ultrasound, and foot pressure mapping is performed,
      4-5 years after the injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 56 patients from an earlier study (see reference) on Achilles tendon rupture using
      nonoperative treatment with or without early weight bearing was invited for an additional
      follow up, where we examine the length of the Achilles tendon using ultrasound, as well as
      functional influence of the injury, using foot pressure mapping (FPM) during barefoot gait.
      Additionally the mobility of the ankle is measured with the Achilles Tendon Resting Angle
      (ATRA) as well as passive plantar- and dorsiflexion. Strength is measured using Heel Raise
      Work (height of lift, number of lifts and the total work), and supplemented with calf
      circumference.

    <time_frame>Test is performed once, 4-5 years after the initial injury</time_frame>
    <description>Using a pressure sensitive plate, the force excerted on the floor while walking is meassured for each part of the food (such as big toe, midfoot and heel), and data is presentred in the form of peak pressure, pressure/time integral, first contact (time) and last contact (time) for each region of the foot.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ATRA: Achilles Tendon Resting Angle</measure>
    <time_frame>Test is performed once, 4-5 years after the initial injury.</time_frame>
    <description>With the subject lying face down and the knee bent to 90 degrees, the angle between the longitudinal fibular axis and the axis of the 5. metatarsal is meassured in a relaxed state using a goniometer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Passive plantar- and dorsiflextion</measure>
    <time_frame>Test is performed once, 4-5 years after the initial injury</time_frame>
    <description>Using a goniometer, and performed with the patient lying face down, the maximal angle that the ankle can be pushed into, while the patient is relaxing is meassured, both in regard to plantar and dorsiflexion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>circumference of the calf</measure>
    <time_frame>Test is performed once, 4-5 years after the initial injury</time_frame>
    <description>With the patient sitting on the side of the bench, the circumference of the calf is meassured 13 cm below the distal part of the kneecap.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heel Raise Work</measure>
    <time_frame>Test is performed once, 4-5 years after the initial injury</time_frame>
    <description>The total work (joules), max height of lift (mm) and number of lifts is recorded. THe patient is placed standing on one leg on a platform tilted 10 degrees (heel below toes), and is asked to lift the heel (and thereby bodyweight) as high as possible, once every 2 seconds. When the patient can no longer maintain height or pace, the test is finished.</description>

    <description>Ankle immobilized with orthosis (DJO Nextep Contour 2 Walker) with 3 1.5 cm wedges in the heel, fixing the angle between 20-30 degrees. The orthosis was used for 8 weeks, gradually removing the wedges. Full weight bearing was allowed from day 1. The orthosis was worn 24 hours / day the first 2 weeks.
From week 2 controlled motion exercises and removal of the orthosis 5 times a day.</description>
