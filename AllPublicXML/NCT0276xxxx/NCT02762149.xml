  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia is commonly used for labor pain relief due to its safety and
      effectiveness. Despite a very high success rate, the epidural technique remains a somewhat
      blind technique and failures continue to occur. Unfortunately, there are no imaging
      techniques that can be used at the bedside to determine the proper positioning of the
      epidural catheter. The trans-catheter electric stimulation test (TCEST) has been successfully
      used for this purpose. This test is occasionally performed in situations where the immediate
      confirmation of the proper epidural catheter location is deemed necessary. The test helps to
      predict which epidurals might fail so that appropriate measures could be immediately
      implemented.

      There has been one duration of electrical stimulus (0.2 milliseconds) that has been used in
      the majority of studies and in clinical practice. With this duration of stimulation, the vast
      majority of cases show a unilateral motor response of the lower limbs during the TCEST.
      Studies on the stimulation of peripheral nerves (nerves in the arms and legs) have shown that
      an electrical stimulus with a longer duration is able to stimulate nerves which are farther
      away. Since nerves in the epidural space are similar in composition to peripheral nerves, the
      investigators expect to see a higher rate of bilateral response with the longer duration of
      stimulus. The investigators also hope to show that this bilateral response is predictive of a
      better functioning epidural.

      The investigators hypothesize that the incidence of a bilateral response to the TCEST will be
      higher with the 1.0 ms pulse width compared to 0.1 ms pulse width. Furthermore, the
      investigators hypothesize that a bilateral motor response associated with the 1.0 ms pulse
      width will be predictive of symmetry of sensory and motor block and of lower consumption of
      local anesthetic.

      This will be a randomized double-blind controlled study. After recruitment of the patient,
      epidural anesthesia will be performed in the standard fashion employed in the investigators'
      institution by a fellow or staff. Spinal ultrasound will be used prior to performing the
      epidural catheter insertion. The trans-catheter electric stimulation test (TCEST) will be
      performed at both a 0.1ms pulse width and a 1ms pulse width. The order in which the two pulse
      widths are applied will be randomly decided by computer. The test dose of local anesthetic
      will then be administered, and the TCEST will be repeated 5 minutes later. Again, both pulse
      widths (0.1ms, 1ms) will be used, and the order in which they are applied will be decided
      randomly.

      Following the second testing, a loading dose of the standard anesthetic solution will be
      administered. The sensory level to ice will be tested at 20 minutes following injection of
      the loading dose of bupivacaine and fentanyl. The sensory level will be assessed from the
      sacral to the thoracic levels, bilaterally. The motor response pattern will be recorded for
      all TCESTs performed, and any relationship between pulse width and response pattern will be
      determined.

    Analysis after 20 patients was convincing for a negative result for the primary outcome, so the

All patients will have the trans-catheter electric stimulation test (TCEST) performed with both a 1 ms pulse width and 0.1 ms pulse width and the order of administration will be randomized.</description>

    <description>The nerve stimulator (Stimpod NMS 450: Xavant technology (PTY) Ltd; Pretoria, South Africa or similar nerve stimulator) will be connected to the epidural catheter through an adapter (Johans ECG Adapter, Arrow International Inc., Reading). The epidural catheter and the adapter will be primed with a standard volume of 3 ml of sterile normal saline to allow for effective electrical conduction. Secured connections and avoidance of any air within in the system must be ensured to avoid high impedance in the circuit, which could result in false negatives. The cathode terminal of the stimulator will then be attached to the metal hub of the adapter and the anode terminal will be connected to the electrode placed over the deltoid muscle.</description>
