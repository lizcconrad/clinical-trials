  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with cognitive impairments after stroke sustain significant disability in their
      daily tasks, and account for a significant proportion of stroke-related healthcare costs.
      This loss of independence is costly because individuals with stroke-related cognitive
      impairments require more rehabilitation and more resources to support their living, whether
      in institutional or community settings. The proposed study examines the effects of directed
      and guided training on the recovery of independence with daily activities in adults with
      stroke-related cognitive impairments in acute rehabilitation. The investigators predict that
      patients in both groups will demonstrate significant improvement in independence with daily
      activities in the first 12 months after rehabilitation admission, but that patients who
      receive guided training will demonstrate significantly more improvements than patients who
      received directed training.

    <measure>Differences in Independence With Activities of Daily Living (Functional Independence Measure) Between Groups Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, rehab discharge, month 3, month 6, month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Differences between groups in mean independence scores (computed from Functional Independence Measure total scores) over time.
The Functional Independence Measure contains 18 items with a total score ranging from 18-126 is obtained (18=complete dependence/total assistance with basic self-care and mobility activities; 126=complete independence with basic self-care and mobility activities). Total scores were calculated for each participant at baseline, discharge, month 3, month 6, and month 12, and mean total scores for each group were calculated at each time point. Differences in mean scores were examined between groups over time with mixed model analyses.</description>

    <description>Guided training is a rehabilitation training approach that maximizes the expertise of the patient, by teaching patients to identify and prioritize activities, identify barriers to performing activities, generate their own strategies for addressing these barriers, and apply this process through iterative practice. Guided training equips patients with &quot;practical&quot; skills that have the potential to generalize beyond activities addressed during the intervention program to novel problematic activities that arise after the intervention program, thereby promoting long-term independence.</description>

    <description>Directed training is a rehabilitation approach that maximizes the expertise of the rehabilitation practitioner. Rehabilitation practitioners identify and prioritize problematic activities, identify barriers to performing these activities, generate strategies to address these barriers and instruct patients in these strategies, and repeat the process with a variety of problematic activities identified during the rehabilitation program. Directed training promotes independence with training activities, however the benefits of direct training are likely to be activity-specific (i.e., only promote improvement on the trained activity) and not generalizable to other daily activities. This therapist-directed approach is currently the method used most frequently in acute rehabilitation.</description>

The Functional Independence Measure contains 18 items with a total score ranging from 18-126 is obtained (18=complete dependence/total assistance with basic self-care and mobility activities; 126=complete independence with basic self-care and mobility activities). Total scores were calculated for each participant at baseline, discharge, month 3, month 6, and month 12, and mean total scores for each group were calculated at each time point. Differences in mean scores were examined between groups over time with mixed model analyses.</description>

            <title>Guided Training</title>
            <description>Guided training is a rehabilitation training approach that maximizes the expertise of the patient, by teaching patients to identify and prioritize activities, identify barriers to performing activities, generate their own strategies for addressing these barriers, and apply this process through iterative practice. Guided training equips patients with &quot;practical&quot; skills that have the potential to generalize beyond activities addressed during the intervention program to novel problematic activities that arise after the intervention program, thereby promoting long-term independence.

            <title>Directed Training</title>
            <description>Directed training is a rehabilitation approach that maximizes the expertise of the rehabilitation practitioner. Rehabilitation practitioners identify and prioritize problematic activities, identify barriers to performing these activities, generate strategies to address these barriers and instruct patients in these strategies, and repeat the process with a variety of problematic activities identified during the rehabilitation program. Directed training promotes independence with training activities, however the benefits of direct training are likely to be activity-specific (i.e., only promote improvement on the trained activity) and not generalizable to other daily activities. This therapist-directed approach is currently the method used most frequently in acute rehabilitation.
