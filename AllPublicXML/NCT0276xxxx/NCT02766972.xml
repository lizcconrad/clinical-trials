      Treatment of complex unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) remains challenging to date.
      Therefore, advanced techniques are required to achieve an optimal result in treating these
      patients safely. In this study, the safety and efficacy of rapid ventricular pacing (RVP) to
      facilitate microsurgical clip-reconstruction has been studied prospectively in a joined
      neurosurgical, anesthesiological and cardiological study.

      Treatment of complex unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) remains challenging to date.
      Therefore, advanced techniques are required to achieve an optimal result in treating these
      patients safely. In this study, the safety and efficacy of rapid ventricular pacing (RVP) to
      facilitate microsurgical clip-reconstruction has been studied prospectively in a joined
      neurosurgical, anesthesiological and cardiological study. Patients with complex UIA were
      prospectively enrolled and the safety and efficacy of RVP were evaluated recording
      cardiovascular events and outcome of the patients as well as the amount of aneurysm occlusion
      after the surgical clip-reconstruction procedure.
