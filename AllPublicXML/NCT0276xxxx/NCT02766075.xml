  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to establish whether a Supervised TAVR Exercise Program (STEP)
      can safely improve the frailty status in patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve
      stenosis prior to undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TAVR is an approved alternative therapy for patients with severe aortic valve stenosis who
      are deemed inoperable or high-risk for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Despite a
      very high procedural success rate (&gt;95%), mortality rates after TAVR at 1- and 2-year
      follow-up remain ≥25% and ≥34%, respectively. It is becoming increasingly evident that
      frailty, as a clinical syndrome, has a large impact on this long term mortality. In a study
      by Green, et al. frailty status was independently associated with increased 1-year mortality
      (OR=3.5) after TAVR. The investigators' own retrospective analysis showed that impaired
      mobility and malnutrition were significantly associated with a longer hospital length of stay
      (5 days vs. 3 days), and increased total cost (on average, an additional $10,000 per
      patient). Given the phenotype of frailty is characterized by reductions in muscle mass,
      strength, endurance and activity level, a STEP is ideally suited to counteract these
      impairments. This pilot study aims to establish whether a STEP can safely improve the frailty
      score in patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis prior to undergoing TAVR.

      This single-center pilot study will be conducted in partnership between Heart Care Midwest
      (HCMW), OSF St. Francis Medical Center (OSF SFMC), and University of Illinois College of
      Medicine at Peoria (UICOMP). UICOMP Center of Outcomes Research will provide analytical
      support. The study will be funded by an operational research grant from OSF SFMC.

    <description>Individualized exercise program designed and implemented by licensed physical therapy clinicians in three 60-minute sessions per week for four weeks. Upon randomization, subjects in the Intervention Group will undergo an initial Dynamic Gait &amp; Balance Assessment by a licensed physical therapy clinician. The physical therapy clinician will use this assessment to design and implement an individualized STEP in three 60-minute sessions per week for four weeks. Subjects will proceed with their pre-TAVR testing in conjunction with the STEP sessions.</description>
