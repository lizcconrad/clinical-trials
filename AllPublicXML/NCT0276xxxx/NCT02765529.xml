  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, an increase of inflammatory chronic diseases and/or tumors incidence has been
      reported in part due to the rising in life expectancy. For instance, exposure to air
      pollution, and in particularly to fine particles has been classified by the International
      Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a risk factor for cancer, being the elderly
      population particularly sensitive. However, no validated biomarkers have been identified to
      assess the exposure to fine particles maybe correlated to cancerogenesis.

      AEROTOX-2 is a prospective pilot study on the ex vivo effects of the atmospheric pollution
      exposure. The study aims to identity new biomarkers after an exposure of leukocytes to doses
      of fine particles.

      Secondly, the study aims to analyze, according to age, the leukocytes response to the urban
      pollution exposure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To estimate the influence of the atmospheric pollution on the whole adult population,
      subjects will be recruited in a wide range of age (20 - 80 years).

      Samples of atmospheric particles will be collected in Dunkerque (North of France), one of the
      most important industrial areas in France. This city is influenced by car traffic, urban and
      industrial activities, and the wide sea traffic of the North Sea. Therefore, Dunkerque is a
      reference site to study the atmospheric pollution and its impact on health.

      These markers will be searched in association with the different mechanisms involved in the
      toxicity of the fine particles such as: inflammatory response, genotoxicity, metabolic
      activity and epigenetic changes after exposure of leukocytes isolated from patients to doses
      of fine particles.

      The study of the correlation between biological observations and conditions of exposure to
      air particles will bring answers about the impact of the environmental pollution on the
      health of vulnerable populations.
