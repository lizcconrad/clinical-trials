  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the effect of 3 different skin temperature placement probe
      in the case room on the admission temperature to the NICU in preterm infants. The authors aim
      to evaluate which placement results in more preterm in the acceptable range (36.5-37 °C).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It's a prospective randomized trial conducted at Maisonneuve Rosemont Hospital, neonatal
      tertiary center located in Montreal with over 2600 annual deliveries. All pregnant women who
      are expecting to deliver a preterm infant with gestational between 28 and 35 6/7 weeks will
      be eligible to be enrolled into the study and informed consent is obtained.

      Simple randomization is accomplished by opening a sealed pre-set envelope with group
      assignment before delivery.

      Group 1: The probe is placed lateral from the spine, 1 cm above the intergluteal cleft, and
      in side position to the flank between the hips and the ribs.

      Group 2: The probe is placed on the chest, 1 cm above the left nipple. Group 3: The probe is
      placed deep in the left axilla

      At birth, all the preterm are immediately placed under a radiant warmer and resuscitated as
      per Neonatal resuscitation program (NRP) guidelines. Application of a skin temperature probe
      set at 36.5°C, for servo-controlled thermoregulation by 2 minutes of life. Probes will be
      fixed with an insulated reﬂective water-soluble gel probe.

      No changes are made to the routine delivery room management and resuscitation for this study.
      After initial delivery room management, babies are transported in a heated radiant warmer
      (Panda) to the NICU.

      In the delivery room, when the baby has a skin temperature servo-controlled stable at 36.5°
      C, the baby is ready to be transferred to NICU. All babies admitted to the NICU are routinely
      cared for by the attending neonatologist.

      Data collection:

      The temperature displaced on the servo controlled table is collected when the baby is the
      NICU just before transfer from the radiant table to the incubator.

      The right axillary temperature will be taken by a thermometer.
