    <textblock>
      The current study will assess the clinical Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international
      Society (ASAS) 20 response to Secukinumab and evaluate to which extent concomitant
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment can be reduced in patients treated with
      Secukinumab or placebo following an initial run-in phase of stable NSAID therapy. In case of
      a positive outcome concerning the NSAID reduction this study could trigger the development of
      a guidance concerning NSAID reduction applicable for all Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) patients
      starting a biologic treatment.

      The current study will assess the clinical Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international
      Society (ASAS) 20 response to Secukinumab and evaluate to which extent concomitant
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment can be reduced between Week 4 and Week
      12 in patients treated with Secukinumab 150 mg or placebo following an initial run-in phase
      of 4 weeks on stable NSAID therapy. Two different time points of NSAID tapering initiation
      will be evaluated in this study:

        1. a delayed tapering approach in which NSAID will be tapered following 4 weeks of
           Secukinumab treatment at stable NSAID therapy.

        2. an early tapering approach in which NSAID will be tapered immediately after initiation
           of Secukinumab treatment.

      These two approaches will be evaluated compared to placebo in order to assess whether the
      early or delayed NSAID tapering is superior to placebo in terms of clinical ASAS20 response
      and extent of reduction in NSAID intake.

      As a patient-reported outcome, pain is a major patient-relevant efficacy parameter in
      clinical practice in Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). This study will therefore monitor overall
      neck, back and hip pain on a continuous basis. It will be recommended that NSAID should be
      tapered if the patient reports an improvement in back pain or a level below a certain
      threshold. It is anticipated that the results of this study may provide guidance for the
      systematic adjustment of concomitant NSAID treatment in AS patients based on their initial
      response to Secukinumab, thereby leading to optimization of the therapeutic strategy with
      Secukinumab.
