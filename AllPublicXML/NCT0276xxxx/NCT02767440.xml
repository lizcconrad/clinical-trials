  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current models of outpatient childhood obesity treatment focus on the child's health habits,
      with limited efficacy. In part, this may be because childhood obesity is highly sensitive to
      parental lifestyle habits, who are often not a direct target of child obesity interventions.
      This study aims to target weight loss among overweight parents of 2-16 year old children with
      obesity enrolled in the Duke Healthy Lifestyles Program (HL) in order to augment child body
      mass index reduction. The intervention, &quot; Families on Track&quot; is a digital health intervention
      platform using the Interactive Obesity Treatment Approach (iOTA).

    <textblock>
      Parents in the program will receive the family-based treatment protocol provided by the
      Healthy Lifestyles clinic. First, families attend a half-day session at the clinic where
      child anthropometrics and labs are obtained, and nutrition and physical activity group
      counseling is provided. Height and weight of the primary adult caregiver are measured and BMI
      is calculated. Second, families return 2 weeks later to meet individually with a pediatric
      obesity medical provider and a registered dietitian. Thereafter, frequency of visits is
      determined based on the families needs with a final visit 1 year after starting treatment.
      The ideal is to have visits with the HL staff at intervals of 4-6 weeks for 5 more visits to
      complete the primary phase of the program over 6 months.

      Parents enrolled in the study will also receive the Track intervention. The investigators
      will use a modified version of the Track intervention, which utilized the Interactive Obesity
      Treatment Approach (iOTA). iOTA uses a computer algorithm to assign 3-4 personalized
      behavioral goals known to create an energy deficit to produce weight loss (e.g., sugary
      drinks, fast food consumption walk 10,000 steps/day, etc). The team at Duke Digital Health
      has shown that iOTA can be successfully delivered to adults on multiple modalities -- web,
      text messaging and interactive voice response phone calls. Each week, participants will
      receive a prompt from the Track intervention system in order to self-monitoring these
      behaviors goals. These prompts will be delivered either via interactive voice response or
      text message. Intervention participants will also receive an analog bathroom scale and a
      pedometer to self-monitor daily weights and steps.

    <description>Parents will receive the standard of care activities at the Healthy Lifestyles clinic at Duke University. They will also receive a modified version of the previously conducted Track intervention, a digital health weight loss intervention for adults in community health centers . The intervention will utilize the Interactive Obesity Treatment Approach (iOTA). iOTA uses a computer algorithm to assign 3 personalized behavioral goals known to create an energy deficit to produce weight loss (e.g., sugary drinks, fast food consumption walk 10,000 steps/day, etc). Participants will track these goals via interactive voice response (IVR) and text messaging technologies each week. They will receive immediate feedback based on self-monitoring data and skills training videos to learn how to make the behavioral changes necessary for weight loss. Intervention participants will also receive an analog bathroom scale and a pedometer to self-monitor daily weights and steps.</description>
