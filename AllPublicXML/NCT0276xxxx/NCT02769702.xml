  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uveitis is an acute or chronic inflammatory condition of unknown etiology. Although uveitis
      often responds adequately to topical corticosteroids, there are many patients for which this
      treatment is either inadequate or not tolerated. A patient with inadequate response to
      treatment would manifest uveitis activity by slit lamp examination determination of anterior
      chamber cellularity. Lack of tolerance of therapy commonly manifests as ocular hypertension
      (greater than 21 mmHg measured by tonometry)complicating chronic topical corticosteroid
      administration, leading to glaucoma and permanent visual loss. Moreover, systemic
      corticosteroids may be required at a dose unsafe for chronic administration. In these
      situations, an immunosuppressive medication is often added as a &quot;steroid-sparing&quot; agent. If
      and when there is clinical response to the added immunosuppressive, the oral and/or topical
      corticosteroid dose can be reduced or eliminated to avoid toxicity.

      There are several reasons for believing that Acthar might be beneficial in the treatment of
      uveitis patients. In addition to increasing adrenal production or cortisol, Acthar has
      another important mechanisms of action mediated by its binding of melanocortin receptors.
      Melanocortin down-regulates activity of B and T lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages. In
      animal studies, melanocortin peptides down-regulate T helper cells, up-regulate T Regulatory
      cells, and decrease B lymphocyte production of B Lymphocyte Stimulator. In macrophages, there
      is down-regulation of IL-1, IL-2, INF gamma, TNF alpha, nitric oxide and adhesion molecules.
      In other cells, in addition to IL-10 upregulation (monocytes), there is down-regulation of
      VACM and ECAM (endothelial cells), prostaglandins (fibroblasts) and MCP-1 and RANTES (renal
      tubules).CNS mediation of systemic inflammation may also be down-regulated by melanocortin
      receptor binding by Acthar.

      Patients eligible for the study will be identified by the investigators and given a copy of
      the consent form to read. Patients interested in enrolling will be screened and if eligible
      will be enrolled in the study. The screening visit and the baseline visit may occur on the
      same day. Patients enrolling will be instructed in self-administering Acthar 80 IU twice a
      week. Patients will keep an injection log which will be inspected at each visit (4, 8, and 12
      weeks). Ophthalmology data will be collected at each visit and recorded on the case report
      form by the ophthalmology technician working with the sub-investigator at the time of each
      visit. Patients will come to the Center for Clinical Studies each visit for blood draw, blood
      pressure recording, and recording of adverse events.
