  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study comparing two study drugs, Filgrastim Hospira and Neupogen®. Neupogen® is
      approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat low numbers of specific kinds
      of white blood cells (WBC) known as neutrophils. This type of white cell is important in
      fighting infections. A low neutrophil count is known as neutropenia. Both drugs work by
      increasing the number of neutrophils that are produced in the body.

      This is important for patients who have low neutrophils due to chemotherapy, other treatments
      such as bone marrow transplant or certain other conditions with symptoms/problems related to
      low neutrophil counts. The main aim of the study is to test how Filgrastim Hospira works in
      the body compared to Neupogen®.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, crossover study evaluating the
      pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics equivalence following SC administration of test and
      reference product in healthy volunteers. The study will be conducted at a single Phase 1
      unit. There will be 30 healthy subjects in each of the two sequences.

      After meeting the selection criteria, subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2
      treatment sequences:

        -  Filgrastim Hospira (US) in Period 1 followed by US-approved Neupogen® in Period 2.

        -  US-approved Neupogen® in Period 1 followed by Filgrastim Hospira (US) in Period 2.

      Subjects will receive one of each of the drugs once a day for 5 days in each of the treatment
      sequences.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be eligible for study participation if all of the following criteria are met
        at Screening:

          1. Provides written informed consent, approved by an Independent Ethics Committee
             (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to any study related activities

          2. Healthy male or female volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age (both inclusive)

          3. Body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 30 kg/m2, inclusive, and body weight of not &lt; 50
             kg or &gt; 100 kg

          4. Non smoker (defined as a subject who has not smoked and has not used nicotine
             containing products for at least 3 months prior to study drug administration and has a
             negative urine screen for cotinine) at Screening

          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects and their partners of
             childbearing potential, agree to pregnancy prevention throughout the duration of the
             study (through the Final Visit). Subjects and their partners must agree to use of an
             effective method of contraception, to avoid impregnation of females throughout the
             course of the study. Subjects using oral contraceptives must be on a stable regimen
             for at least 3 months prior to Screening. While the best way to avoid pregnancy is to
             abstain from sexual activity, adequate forms of contraception to be used include oral
             contraception, depot contraception, intrauterine device (IUD), and barrier
             contraceptive methods, such as condoms and barrier creams/contraceptive jellies, and
             spermicidals. Subjects and their partners who can become pregnant must use
             contraception while on study drug from admission to the Final Visit. Male subjects
             must also refrain from donating sperm from admission to the Final Visit

          6. Agrees to abstain from alcohol consumption throughout duration of the study and has a
             negative urine for alcohol at Screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject will NOT be eligible for study participation if any of the following criteria are
        met at Screening:

          1. Any active systemic or immunologic disease or condition, including but not limited to
             the following general categories: cardiovascular/pulmonary, hepatorenal, or systemic
             infection, or lactation

          2. Hematologic laboratory abnormalities including leukocytosis (defined as total
             leukocytes &gt; 11,000/µL), leukopenia (defined as total leukocytes &lt; 4000/μL), or
             neutropenia (defined as absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt; 1500/µL) or thrombocytopenia
             (defined as platelet count of &lt; 150/µL)

          3. Clinically significant, as judged by the Investigator, vital sign, chest X-ray, or
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality

          4. History of biological growth factor exposure, including but not limited to filgrastim
             and other granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSFs) in the context of treatment,
             prophylaxis, peripheral blood stem cell mobilization, or previous investigational
             study setting

          5. Drug sensitivity, allergic reaction to, or known hypersensitivity/idiosyncratic
             reaction to Escherichia coli-derived proteins, filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, other
             granulocyte colony-stimulating factors or any component of the product: Subjects with
             the rare heredity problem of fructose intolerance are excluded due to the excipient
             sorbitol

          6. History of splenic rupture (or subject who is asplenic), pulmonary infiltrate or
             pneumonia, sickle cell disorders, chronic neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or vasculitis
