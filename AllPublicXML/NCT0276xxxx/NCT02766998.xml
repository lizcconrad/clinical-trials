  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, safety and feasibility trial to evaluate the use of
      autologous umbilical vein as shunts or conduits in neonatal cardiac surgery. Subjects will be
      identified here at the Advanced Fetal Care Center (AFCC) following diagnosis of congenital
      heart disease (CHD) with single ventricle physiology of the fetus via fetal echocardiogram.
      At time of cesarean section or vaginal delivery, umbilical cord will be harvested in a
      sterile fashion and the umbilical vein will be dissected free and preserved until first
      clinically indicated Stage I palliative procedure between day 3 and 7 of life. Subjects will
      be followed until their Stage II palliative procedure.
