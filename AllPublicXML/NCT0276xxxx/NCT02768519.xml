    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the indicative bioavailability of a single oral
      dose of OTS167, and to evaluate the effects of food on OTS167 pharmacokinetics (PK) after
      oral dosing.

      Eleven male and female healthy participants aged 45 years and over will be entered into this
      phase 1, single-centre, double-blind, randomised, cross-over study. The trial is designed to
      evaluate the bioavailability of OTS167, and the effects of food on pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      OTS167 when administered by the oral route. Correlative studies include evaluation of safety
      endpoints and examinations, and adverse events. This study involves 3 cohorts to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of oral dosing from lower dose.

        Inclusion Criteria: Participants must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for
        participation in the study:

          1. Males or females aged 45 years or over.

          2. Female participants of non‐childbearing potential, meeting at least one of the
             following criteria:

               -  Amenorrhoeal for 12 months (menopause confirmed by Follicular Stimulating Hormone
                  (FSH) and Luteinising Hormone (LH) levels as defined by the established reference
                  ranges), or

               -  Surgically sterile (e.g. hysterectomy, oophorectomy, tubal ligation) for at least
                  the past 3 month.

          3. Able to communicate with site personnel and to understand and voluntarily sign the
             Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          4. Able and willing to comply with the protocol, including availability for all scheduled
             study visits.

          5. Body mass index (BMI) 18 kg/m2 to 30 kg/m2 (inclusive)

          6. No clinically significant abnormalities as determined by medical history, physical
             examination, blood chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and 12-lead electrocardiogram

             tubal ligation at least 3 months prior to Screening, or is postmenopausal [no
             menstrual period for at least 12 months prior to Screening]; if male, has undergone
             vasectomy at least 6 months prior to Screening). Male participants agree not to donate
             sperm for at least 90 days [3 months] after administration of the last dose of study

             pre-dose (Day 1).

          3. Greater than 2 standard drinks per day, on average, for men and women, or any history

             extracts within 14 days prior to the first dose.

          8. Positive results on illicit drug test or alcohol breath test at screening or at
             admission.

          9. Positive screening test for HIV antibodies, Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C
             antibody.
