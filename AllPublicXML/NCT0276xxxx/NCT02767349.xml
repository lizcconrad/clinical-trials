        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be male or nonpregnant, nonlactating females between 12 and 17 years of
             age (inclusive) at time of screening.

          2. Subject must have a minimum weight of 100 pounds (45 kg) at the time of screening and
             have a body mass index (BMI) &gt; 5% and &lt; 95% for their age at the time of screening.

          3. Subject must report having moderate or severe acute pain (as determined from the
             Numerical Pain Rating scale (NPRS) where 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain; subjects must
             have a level of 4 or more) after a pediatric surgical procedure (at baseline) that
             requires hospitalization. Sponsor will pre-approve a list of acceptable surgical
             procedures prior to study start for each site. Surgical procedures other than those on
             the pre-approved list may be acceptable on a case by case basis if approved by the
             medical monitor (MM) and sponsor.

          4. Subject, if female of child-bearing potential (defined as postmenarche), must agree to
             abstain from unprotected sexual activity during study participation and for 2 weeks
             after study exit/early termination.

          5. Subject, if male with reproductive potential, must agree to abstain from unprotected
             sexual activity during study participation and for 2 weeks after study exit/early
             termination.

          6. Subject, if female of childbearing potential, must have negative pregnancy test (serum
             or urine) results at screening and check-in.

          7. Subject's legally authorized representative (eg, parent, legal guardian) must
             voluntarily sign and date a parental permission/ Informed Consent that is approved by
             an Institutional Review Board (IRB), and the subject must sign an IRB approved assent,
             before undergoing any protocol specific procedures or assessments.

          8. Subject and the subject's parent or legal guardian must be able to read, understand,
             and be willing to follow the study procedures and requirements and communicate
             meaningfully in English with the investigator and investigator's staff (if the subject
             cannot read or communicate meaningfully, then the subject's legally authorized
             representative [eg, parent, legal guardian] must meet this criterion).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is from a vulnerable population (including mentally disabled children), other
             than a pediatric population, as defined by the Code of Federal Regulations Title 45,
             Part 46, Section 46.111(b), including but not limited to employees (temporary,
             part-time, full time, etc) or a family member of the research staff conducting the
             study, or of the sponsor, or of the clinical research organization, or of the IRB.

          2. Subject is expected to require a surgery that could influence the study outcome (eg,
             ventriculoperitoneal shunt repair in the setting of hydrocephalus).

          3. Subject has an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) unless the investigator determines the
             ECG abnormalities are not clinically significant.

          4. Subject has a screening pulse oximetry reading of &lt; 95% while awake.

          5. Subject has a history of laboratory test results obtained before screening that show
             the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen,
             hepatitis C antibody, or active hepatitis A immunoglobulin M.

          6. Subject has laboratory values that are greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal
             (with the exception of white blood cell [WBC] differential values). Enrollment of
             subjects with laboratory values that are between 1 and 2 times the upper limit of
             normal (ULN), or below the lower limit of normal, or white blood cells (WBC)
             differential &gt; 2 x ULN , will be left to the investigator's discretion (no increased
             risk of participation in study based upon judgment of the investigator).

          7. Subject has any history of renal disease that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would contraindicate study participation; or subject has significantly impaired renal
             function, in the opinion of the investigator as evidenced by an estimated glomerular
             filtration rate calculated using a pediatric appropriate formula such as the Schwartz
             Equation (Schwartz et al, 2009).

          8. Subject has a history or laboratory evidence of bleeding or clotting disorders or
             conditions.

          9. Subject has a known or suspected history of alcoholism, marijuana or illicit drug
             abuse or misuse within 2 years before screening as evidence from medical history or
             evidence of tolerance or physical dependence before the first dose of MNK-155.

         10. Subject has smoked or used nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to
             screening as evidenced by medical history.

         11. Subject has a history of psychiatric disorders, such as major depression disorder,
             anxiety disorders, or psychotic disorders requiring hospitalization and/or medication
             within 6 months prior to screening. A history of attention deficit hyperactivity
             disorder requiring medication is acceptable.

         12. Subject has a diagnosis of epilepsy or other seizure disorder (a history of febrile
             seizures is acceptable).

         13. Subject has had previous cardiothoracic surgery (subjects who have a history of patent
             ductus arteriosus ligations/surgery as infants are acceptable).

         14. Subject has a history of conditions which might be specifically contraindicated or
             require caution while using hydrocodone bitartrate (HB), acetaminophen (APAP), and/or
             ibuprofen (if used as rescue medication) per the Investigator's Brochure (IB) and
             product information per the appropriate package insert.

         15. Subject has a history of any drug allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance including
             HB, APAP, ibuprofen or excipients, or any opioid drug product which, in the opinion of
             the investigator, would place the subject at particular risk and compromise the safety
             of the subject in the study.

         16. Subject has donated or had significant loss of whole blood (480 mL or more) within 30
             days of screening (unless they have received a transfusion and have hematocrit and
             hemoglobin within the reference range at screening), or plans to donate blood or
             plasma during the course of the study.

         17. Subject has a documented history of any pathologic, iatrogenic or surgical conditions
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the subject's ability to
             swallow, absorb, metabolize, or excrete MNK-155, including (but not limited to)
             intractable nausea and/or vomiting, severe GI narrowing, perforation, obstruction,
             bleed, or gastric band surgery.

         18. Subject has a history of a GI event (eg, perforation, obstruction, bleed) within 6
             months prior to screening or any GI event greater than 6 months before screening that,
             in the opinion of the investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for study
             participation.

         19. Subject has received any investigational product or device within 30 days before
             screening, or is scheduled to receive an investigational device or another
             investigational drug (other than those in this study) during the course of this study.

         20. Subject has used any product containing hydrocodone or APAP within 48 hours prior to
             the first dose of MNK-155.

         21. Subject has a history of conditions which might be specifically contraindicated or
             require caution to be used during the administration of APAP or HB, including
             hypersensitivity to HB, or debilitated patients, those with severe impairment of
             hepatic, pulmonary, or renal function, myxedema or hypothyroidism, adrenocortical
             insufficiency (Addison's disease), central nervous system (CNS) depression or coma,
             toxic psychosis, urethral stricture, acute alcoholism, delirium tremens, severe
             kyphoscoliosis, or biliary tract dysfunction.

         22. Subject has any other medical condition, abnormal vital sign (blood pressure, pulse
             rate, respiratory rate), body temperature, pulse oximetry; or any physical examination
             or ECG finding at screening which, in the investigator's medical opinion, would
             preclude safe participation in a clinical study.
