    <textblock>
      Bilthoven Biologicals has developed a new bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) containing World
      Health Organization (WHO) approved Sabin strains of poliovirus type 1 and type 3. This study
      will assess non-inferiority of bOPV manufactured by BBio to that of licensed bOPV. This study
      will also assess lot-to-lot consistency among three lots of BBio bOPV.

    <textblock>
      Bilthoven Biologicals has developed a new bivalent OPV containing WHO approved Sabin strains
      of poliovirus type 1 and type 3. This phase III study will be conducted in two parts:

      Part 1 - 40 children of 60 to 83 months of age will be given single dose of BBio bOPV or
      licensed bOPV in 1:1 ratio. Primary objective is to assess safety of BBio bOPV.

      Part 2 - A total of 1080 infants of 42 to 56 days of age will be randomized to receive three
      doses of either BBio bOPV from one of the three lots or a licensed bOPV in 1:1:1:1 ratio as
      primary immunization series at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age.

      Primary objective of this study is to assess non-inferiority of bOPV manufactured by BBio to
      that of licensed bOPV in terms of seroconversion. This study also will assess lot-to-lot
      consistency among three lots of BBio bOPV.

             vaccines are not allowed during the study period).

         10. Blood or blood-derived products received in the past.

         11. Any vaccination one week preceding the trial vaccination.

         12. Presence of significant malnutrition (&lt; -3 standard deviation [SD] weight for length)
             or acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, endocrine, autoimmune,
             cardiovascular, metabolic, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by
             medical history, and physical examination, which in the opinion of the investigator,
             might interfere with the study objectives

         13. History of any neurological disorder or history of seizure (febrile or afebrile), or
             encephalopathy, encephalitis, hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode.

         14. Febrile illness or acute illness on the day of inclusion is temporary exclusion
             criterion.

         15. Participant with any other condition, which, in the opinion of the investigator would
             jeopardize the safety or rights of the participant participating in the study or
