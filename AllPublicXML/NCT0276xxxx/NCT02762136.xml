    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD), which is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders with
      high disease burden. Postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) is a common subtype of FD. Although
      the effectiveness of Chinese herbal formula of Xiang-sha-liu-jun granule (XSLJG) for
      alleviating PDS symptoms has been assessed in previous studies, more convinced evidence of
      randomized placebo-controlled study is needed.
