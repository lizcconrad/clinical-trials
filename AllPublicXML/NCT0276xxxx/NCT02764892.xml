      The main purpose of the study is to identify the best dose of V81444 to use in future trials
      in patients with Parkinson's disease. The study will also explore the effects of V81444 on
      brain activity and blood flow with tests of mental ability (&quot;cognitive function tests&quot;). It
      will also check how safe V81444 is and how well it is tolerated after dosing.

      In this Phase I, single-centre, open-label, adaptive, single-dose study at multiple dose
      levels, the relationship between dose and plasma concentration of orally administered V81444
      to brain A2A RO was investigated in 6 healthy male volunteers. In addition, the effects of
      V81444 on regional brain activity and perfusion during tests of cognitive function, and the
      safety and tolerability of V81444 were assessed. For each subject, the study consisted of a
      screening visit, a baseline visit, a treatment period, and a safety follow-up visit. The dose
      of V81444 and timing of scans performed were defined in the protocol for the first 2 subjects
      only. The dose, nature and timings of assessments for subsequent subjects were determined
      based on review of emerging receptor binding, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and
      safety information.

      In each treatment period, subjects were admitted to the unit on the day before dosing (Day
      -1), received a single oral dose of V81444 on Day 1 and, subject to satisfactory medical
      review, were discharged a minimum of 12 h after dosing. Overall, 3 doses of V81444 were
      assessed (250 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg), with 2 subjects included at each dose level. PD
      assessments were performed at baseline and after each dose of V81444 using PET (with the A2A
      radioligand, to measure brain A2A RO, as well as MRI techniques to investigate the effects of
      V81444 on regional brain activity and perfusion during cognitive function tests. PK
      parameters were assessed by assay of V81444 concentration in plasma. Safety and tolerability
      were assessed by monitoring physical examination findings, adverse events (AEs), vital signs,
      12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory safety tests.
