  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a single blind within-subject design, 16 patients with neurological disorders were
      randomly exposed to two different treatments: physical therapy and robotic assisted gait
      training. Both before and after the treatments, a self-report Mood Survey Scale (MSS) was
      used to assess the effects on the treatment on distinct affective states. The subscales of
      the MSS were tested for pre-post changes and different effects between treatments with
      non-parametric tests.

    <description>All participants were randomly exposed to two different treatments:
Conventional physical therapy (no specific device used)
Robotic assisted gait training (Lokomat, Hocoma AG, Switzerland)
We consider the study as observational, since the both interventions of the study (physical therapy, robotic assisted gait training) did not change in the patients' usual therapy plan, as they received both interventions daily.
We only added diagnostic interventions to assess the affective responses.</description>
