  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this post-market study is to confirm that the microprocessor controlled prosthetic
      knee components (C-Leg 3 and C-Leg 4) in comparison to mechanical knee joints can bring
      additional benefit to the users primarily on level walking and secondarily in safety, stair
      and hill mobility, activities of daily living, satisfaction and preference.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last two decades many microprocessor controlled knee joints (MPK) appeared on the
      market.The newly developed C-Leg 4 aims to provide improved standing function while in the
      same time offering technology of kneeÂ´s previous version (C-Leg 3). Since added functional
      benefit of a knee joint cannot be anticipated just due to the fact that the knee is
      controlled by the microprocessor, the aim of this post-market study is to evaluate the
      safety, functional mobility and satisfaction of the microprocessor controlled prosthetic knee
      components C-Leg 3 and C-Leg 4 in comparison to mechanical knee joints. Additional goal is to
      improve the methodological quality of research conducted in the field.
