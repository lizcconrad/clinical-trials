      This study evaluates whether noninvasive ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure
      affects tissue perfusion in patients after cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients submitted to open chest cardiac surgery will be enrolled after ICU admission. These
      patients will be submitted to noninvasive mechanical ventilation with continuous positive
      airway pressure right after extubation and tissue perfusion markers (central venous oxygen
      saturation (SVcO2) and lactate) will be obtained via central venous catheter.

      Noninvasive mechanical ventilation is a common resource in the ICU to reduce extubation
      failures and to improve clinical outcomes, whether it can influence tissue perfusion remains
      unclear.

      This study evaluates whether noninvasive ventilation affects tissue perfusion and whether
      tissue perfusion markers in the ICU are correlated with better clinical results for patients
      after heart surgery.

    <description>All patients will be admitted in ICU after surgery and will be submitted to four blood collections from the central venous catheter at different times to evaluate central venous oxygen saturation. Time 1: at ICU admission in mechanical ventilation. Time 2 : twenty minutes after extubation, before the noninvasive ventilation protocol, while breathing spontaneously with a 40% oxygen mask. Time 3: At 60 minutes of noninvasive ventilation protocol. Time 4: twenty minutes after noninvasive ventilation protocol complete while breathing spontaneously with a 40% oxygen mask. The results will be compared between then to assess if there are changes under influence of non invasive ventilation.</description>

    <description>Noninvasive mechanical ventilation is a resource used to treat respiratory failure or to reestablish respiratory comfort and function. It is commonly used in the ICU with a regular mechanical ventilator and is offered using an interface that connects the machine to the patient. The interface used for adults and in this study, was a silicon facial mask that covers the nose and mouth of the patient, allowing him or her to open the eyes.</description>

    <description>Twenty minutes after extubation all subjects will receive noninvasive ventilation delivered through a facial mask with an ICU ventilator with NIV option for 60 minutes. NIV associates pressure support ventilation (PSV: 5 to 15 cmH2O) and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP: 5 to 10 cmH2O).</description>
