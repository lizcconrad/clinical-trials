    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of triple combination therapy with an
      anti-integrin [vedolizumab intravenous (IV)], a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist
      [adalimumab subcutaneously (SC)], and an immunomodulator (oral methotrexate) on endoscopic
      remission in participants with newly-diagnosed Crohn's disease stratified at higher risk for
      complications.

      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to
      treat people who have Crohn's Disease. This study will look at the endoscopic remission and
      mucosal healing of gastrointestinal tract of people who take vedolizumab as triple
      combination therapy with adalimumab and methotrexate.

      The study will enroll approximately 60 participants. Participants will receive triple
      combination therapy which includes:

        -  Vedolizumab 300 mg (IV)

        -  Adalimumab 160/80/40 mg (SC)

        -  Methotrexate 15 mg (Oral)

      All participants will receive vedolizumab intravenous infusion on Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22
      along with adalimumab 160 mg, subcutaneous injection at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, then 40 mg
      once at Week 4 and every 2 weeks thereafter until Week 26 along with methotrexate tablets
      orally, once weekly from Weeks 0 up to Week 34. In monotherapy phase, all participants will
      receive vedolizumab intravenous infusion once at Weeks 30, 38, 46, 54, 62, 70, 78, 86, 94 and
      102.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States and Canada. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 128 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic,
      plus a final visit 18 weeks after last dose of study drug for a safety follow-up assessment.
      Participants will also participate in a long-term safety questionnaire, by phone, at 18 weeks
      and 26 weeks (6 months) from the last dose of study drug.

    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic remission is defined as simple endoscopic score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) scale score from 0-2. The SES-CD evaluates 4 endoscopic variables (ulcer size, proportion of the surface area that is ulcerated, proportion of the surface area affected, and stenosis in 5 colonic segments evaluated during ileocolonoscopy (ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, and rectum). The score for each endoscopic variable is sum of values obtained for each segment. The SES-CD total is the sum of the 4 endoscopic variable scores from 0 to 56, where higher scores indicate more severe disease.</description>
