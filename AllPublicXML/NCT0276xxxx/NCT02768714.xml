  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, randomised, assessor-blind, parallel group, multicentre trial. At least
      180 adult subjects with high-risk Stage II or Stage III / IV breast cancer will be randomised
      (1:1) to receive either Eurofarma's pegfilgrastim (n = 90) or Neulastim (n = 90) in 8 to 10
      sites in Brazil. Subjects will undergo a maximum of 4 cycles of myelosuppressive chemotherapy
      (21 days per cycle).
