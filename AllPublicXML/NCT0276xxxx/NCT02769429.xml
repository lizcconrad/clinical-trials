  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will answer the question whether there is a difference in the effects and
      complication rates of ultrasound guided continuous interscalene block (CISB) and nerve
      stimulation-guided continuous cervical paravertebral block (CCPVB). The aim of this study is
      to evaluate the differences in efficacy and side effects - if any.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized double-blinded study that will compare two commonly used
      approaches for the continuous blockade of the brachial plexus: the CCPVB, which focusses on
      the six cervical nerve root (C6 root), and CISB, which focuses on the upper trunk of the
      brachial plexus. Data of sensory testing, motor strength, shoulder pain, phrenic nerve
      function, recurrent laryngeal nerve (RNL) function, ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, block time
      and medication doses used for block placement, will be collected. All observations and
      measurements will be made by a member of the research team who is unaware of patient
      allocation to any particular group.
