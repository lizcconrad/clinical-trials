      This study, E-COMPASSII is a phase IV clinical trial designed as a multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. This study will enroll 80 subacute
      stroke patients with severe motor involvement. Primary objective is to demonstrate the
      efficacy of porcine brain peptide to improve motor recovery measured by the improvement ratio
      of Fugl-Meyer assessment ((score of FMA after 3 weeks - score of FMA at baseline) / score of
      FMA at baseline) in patients with subacute stroke. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the
      safety profile of cerebrolysin and to test the hypothesis that subacute stroke patients with
      severe motor involvement randomized to administration of Cerebrolysin combined with
      rehabilitation for 3 weeks show better outcome on global function (Korean version Modified
      Barthel Index, K-MBI), severity of stroke (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS),
      cognitive function (Korean Version of Mini-Mental State Exam, K-MMSE; Korean version Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment, K-MoCA), upper limb function (Action Research Arm Test, ARAT; Box and
      block test, B&amp;B) and neuroplasticity measure (resting-state functional MRI(rsfMRI), diffusion
      tensor image(DTI), and motor evoked potential(MEP)) at 3 months after stroke.
