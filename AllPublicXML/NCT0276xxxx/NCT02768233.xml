      The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of personality profiles in patients with
      MOH and to evaluate the effect of a custom-made educational programme as an add-on to
      standard treatment as compared to standard treatment alone in MOH patients using a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, two percent of the population suffers from medication-overuse headache (MOH), a
      paradox condition where the headache is caused by overuse of headache medication. Common
      treatment is withdrawal, but there is no consensus on what constitutes the best treatment.

      The study consists of a RCT with MOH patients randomized to standard treatment versus
      standard treatment + a 12-week, 6-session educational programme as add-on. The programme is
      based on theory of motivational interviewing, and patients can choose between individualized
      education or education in groups.

      Primary endpoint: Headache frequency measured by self-reported headache diary on number of
      days with headache pre-vious month. Secondary endpoints: NEO-FFI-3 personality test, coping
      strategies, pain intensity, bothersomeness, patient satis-faction and reported medication
      intake.
