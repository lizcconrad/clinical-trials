  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first major intervention a newborn infant is facing following birth is clamping of the
      umbilical cord. This means separation of the infant from the placenta, the newborn becomes an
      independent individual, especially from a cardio-circulatory perspective. Recent literature
      focused very much on the appropriate timing of the cord clamping (CC), distinguishing
      immediate cord clamping (ICC) from delayed cord clamping (DCC). Although potential benefits
      for DCC have been documented, especially for preterm infants, ICC still is the most widely
      used procedure. Although the reasons for this are unclear, a lack of understanding of the
      issues associated with umbilical cord clamping is thought to be a major underlying factor.

      In animal research with fetal lambs it has been shown, that aeration of the lung played a
      crucial role in undisturbed cardio-circulatory immediate neonatal transition. Thus a new
      concept of DCC was introduced, delaying cord clamping until ventilation/aeration of the lung
      was established, calling this &quot;Physiological-Based Cord Clamping&quot; (PBCC). It was shown, that
      PBCC improved not only cardiovascular function in preterm lambs, but systemic and cerebral
      oxygenation too. Systemic oxygenation was measured using pulseoximetry, and cerebral
      oxygenation was measured using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).

      Until now, human data for PBCC are lacking. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to
      investigate whether PBCC is able to improve systemic and cerebral oxygenation in term infants
      delivered vaginally.
