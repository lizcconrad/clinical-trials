  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the therapeutic effects between the axillary
      bilateral-breast approach (ABBA) and bilateral axillo-breast approach (BABA) for robotic
      thyroidectomy.To explore the efficacy, safety, cosmetic results and clinical value by the two
      approaches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although several reports on operative outcomes of the robotic technique have appeared, no
      prospective trials comparing the clinical results of between the axillary bilateral-breast
      approach (ABBA) and bilateral axillo-breast approach (BABA) for robotic thyroidectomy have
      been described. The investigators therefore designed a prospective trial comparing outcomes,
      including surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction, between patients undergoing robotic and
      conventional open thyroidectomy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of VAS pain scores for the first 24 hours</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour after the end of the operation investigators began to record 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale is utilized to assess the postoperative pain change for the first 24 hours.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cosmetic outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The satisfaction with cosmetic outcomes was analyzed quantitatively using a scoring system that ranged from 1 to 4(1, extremely; 2, fairly; 3, normal; 4: not at all) that was rated by patients at the outpatient clinic 3 months after the operation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective voice</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days before surgery and at 1 week and 3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Used the Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10), a validated, reliable self-assessment tool that measures patient assessment of voice quality and the effect of voice on quality-of-life, to determine the frequency of voice abnormalities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Swallowing evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days before surgery and at 1 week and 3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Swallowing difficulties were assessed using the Swallowing Impairment Index (SIS-6), a self-administered, six-item assessment of symptoms related to dysphagia that has been validated for diagnosis of impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The operating time</measure>
    <time_frame>From 5 minutes before skin incision to 5 minutes after skin closure</time_frame>
    <description>The operating time is recorded at the end of surgery.</description>
