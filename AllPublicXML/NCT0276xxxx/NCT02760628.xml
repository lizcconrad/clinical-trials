  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The First Twenty® (TF20) was recently developed as a not-for-profit, web-mobile program for
      firefighters (FFs) specifically focused on improving fitness and nutrition knowledge and
      practices. The program was designed by FFs with backgrounds in tactical fitness, marketing
      and program development professionals, and nutrition and exercise scientists. Preliminary
      data suggests the program is well-received by FFs and results in significant improvement in
      body composition and physical fitness. One innovative approach for the eventual dissemination
      of TF20 to VFFs is through their fitness-for duty medical exams. The synergy created by
      linking the TF20 intervention components, feedback to the VFFs from their medical exam, and
      health messages from their physician is predicted to maximize the impact of this much-needed
      intervention. The goal of the proposed project is to tailor TF20 for use in a clinic based
      setting (CB-TF20) for VFFs and to pilot test it in comparison to the American Heart
      Association's Life's Simple 7 (LS7), a web-based diet and physical activity
      knowledge/behavior and lifestyle program. The specific aims are to: 1) Conduct formative
      research with key stakeholders in the VFF community (e.g., physicians, department leadership,
      VFFs) to determine best practices for implementing a clinic-based, web-mobile health and
      wellness program with VFFs and medical providers; 2) Develop a clinic-based version of TF20
      (CB-TF20) and beta-test it with VFFs; and, 3) Conduct a 6 month, 2-arm, pilot cluster (i.e.,
      department) randomized clinical trial (PCRCT) to determine the comparative effectiveness of
      the revised CB-TF20 to LS7 on body composition, Framingham Risk Scores, and diet/physical
      activity knowledge and behaviors among VFF with BMI &gt;25.0kg/m2; and conduct an evaluation of
      the CB-TF20 materials and technology. This innovative R34 study is a critical step in
      providing a much needed intervention for VFFs and those providing their annual examinations.

    <textblock>
      The US fire service serves as the front line of defense against any domestic emergency and
      volunteer firefighters comprise the majority of firefighters, often with negative
      consequences for the health of personnel. While rates of overweight and obesity remain high
      among firefighters and cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of line of duty
      deaths, few resources tailored to the unique culture and needs of firefighters are available
      to help occupational medicine physicians who provide their fitness for duty examinations. By
      engaging firefighters and occupational medicine clinicians in tailoring an internet/mobile
      intervention and pilot testing the program with a sample of volunteer firefighters, the
      investigators will be poised to implement a full-scale clinical trial with the developed
      program.
