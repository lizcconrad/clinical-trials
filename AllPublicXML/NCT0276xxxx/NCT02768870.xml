  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Harpoon
      Medical device in patients with degenerative Mitral Regurgitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pairs of ePTFE chordae tendineae may be placed in the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve
      using the Harpoon Medical Transapical Device in order to establish effective coaptation of
      the mitral leaflets.
