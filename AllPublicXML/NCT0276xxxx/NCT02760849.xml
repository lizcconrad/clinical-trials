      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the changes in female sexual function
      between patients having interval salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy (ISDO) with those
      having risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) in women who carry genetic mutations.
      Researchers also want to learn how these surgeries affect your quality of life.

      RRSO is the standard surgery for patients with certain types of genetic mutations, where the
      fallopian tubes and ovaries are removed at the same time.

      ISDO is surgery to remove the fallopian tubes first, then the ovaries are removed during a
      second, later surgery. Most women with genetic mutations will be encouraged to remove the
      ovaries around the ages of 40 to 50. The decision in timing to remove your ovaries will be
      made with your doctor.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned a study arm
      based on the type of surgery you choose with your doctor. If you choose ISDO, you will be in
      Group 1. If you choose RRSO, you will be in Group 2.

      Group 1:

      Surgery #1: Interval Salpingectomy (IS):

      If you are in Group 1, the study doctor will discuss the salpingectomy surgery with you in
      detail, including the risks and possible benefits. You will be asked to sign a surgical
      consent form.

      Most patients have salpingectomy performed as an outpatient procedure. This means that you
      will likely go home the day of your surgery. If the study doctor plans to have you stay
      overnight in the hospital for any reason, it will be discussed with you.

      During the surgery, the inside of your abdomen will be looked at and both of your fallopian
      tubes will be removed. If the study doctor finds anything during the surgery that may be
      cancerous, a tissue sample or a complete ovary will be removed during surgery and tested. If
      cancer is found, a gynecologic oncologist would perform your cancer surgery.

      Post-Salpingectomy (IS) Follow-Up:

      One (1) month (+/- 1 month) after surgery:

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have a physical exam, including an exam of
           your surgical incisions (wounds) and a review of any complications you may have had from
           surgery. If you do not live near the hospital, this may be done by a local doctor. If
           you are unable to visit a your study doctor, you will be contacted by phone.

        -  The pathology (tissue) results from your surgery will be discussed with you by phone
           call or at the 1-month visit. If the results are benign (show no cancer), you will move
           to the ovarian cancer assessment period below. However, if the results show cancer, the
           study doctor will refer you to a gynecologic oncologist and you will move to the
           Follow-Up Phase.

      Six (6) months (+/- 3 months) after surgery:

      Â°You will complete the quality-of-life questionnaires.

      Ovarian Cancer Assessment Period:

      Every year (+/- 3 months) until delayed oophorectomy (DO) surgery:

      You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam. You will have a transvaginal
      ultrasound to look at your ovaries. Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for CA-125
      testing. You will complete the quality-of-life questionnaires. You will review and sign the
      Completion Oophorectomy Recommendation Form at least every other year with your study doctor.
      This form will be provided to make sure you understand the current age recommendations to
      have surgery to remove your ovaries (DO).

      The yearly test results will be discussed with you.

      If results are benign (no cancer), you will continue with the above yearly tests until you
      and your doctor decide to have the Delayed Oophorectomy (DO) surgery. When you and your
      doctor have decided for you to have DO surgery, you will have pre-oophorectomy tests.

      Pre-Oophorectomy (DO) Tests:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 tablespoon) may be drawn for CA-125
           testing.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have a transvaginal ultrasound to look at
           your ovaries.

        -  You will complete the quality-of-life questionnaires

        -  You will complete the medical questionnaires if you have not completed 1 in over 5
           years.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you may have other tests.

      The study doctor will discuss the pre-surgery test results with you.

      Surgery #2: Delayed Oophorectomy (DO):

      If your pre-oophorectomy testing is normal, the study doctor will discuss the planned surgery
      with you in detail, including the risks and possible benefits. You will be asked to sign a
      surgical consent form.

      Most patients have oophorectomy performed as an outpatient procedure. If the study doctor
      plans to have you stay overnight in the hospital for any reason, it will be discussed with
      you.

      During the surgery, the inside of your abdomen will be looked at and both of your ovaries
      will be removed. If the study doctor finds anything during the surgery that may be cancerous,
      a tissue sample will be removed during surgery and tested. If cancer is found, a gynecologic
      oncologist would perform your cancer surgery.

      Post-Oophorectomy (DO) Follow-Up:

      One (1) month (+/- 1 month) after surgery:

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have a physical exam, including an exam of
           your surgical incisions (wounds) and a review of any complications you may have had from
           surgery. If you do not live near the hospital, this may be done by a local doctor. If
           you are unable to visit your study doctor, you will be contacted by phone.

        -  The pathology results from your surgery will be discussed with you by phone call or at
           the 1-month visit. If the results are benign (show no cancer), you will move to the
           ovarian cancer assessment period below. However, if the results show cancer, the study
           doctor will refer you to a gynecologic oncologist and you will move to the Follow-Up
           Phase.

      At 6 months (+/- 3 months), 1 year (+/- 3 months), and 2 years (+/- 3 months) after surgery,
      you will complete the quality-of-life questionnaires.

      Group 2:

      Surgery: RRSO:

      If you are in Group 2, the study doctor will discuss the surgery with you in detail,
      including the risks and possible benefits. You will be asked to sign a surgical consent form.

      Most patients have RRSO performed as an outpatient procedure. If the study doctor plans to
      have you stay overnight in the hospital for any reason, it will be discussed with you.

      During the surgery, the inside of your abdomen will be looked at and both of your ovaries and
      fallopian tubes will be removed. If the study doctor finds anything during the surgery that
      may be cancerous, a tissue sample will be removed during surgery and tested. If cancer is
      found, a gynecologic oncologist would perform your cancer surgery.

      Post-Surgery (RRSO) Follow-Up:

      One (1) month (+/- 1 month) after surgery:

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have a physical exam, including an exam of
           your surgical incisions (wounds) and a review of any complications you may have had from
           surgery. If you do not live near the hospital, this may be done by a local doctor. If
           you are unable to visit your study doctor, you will be contacted by phone.

        -  The pathology results from your surgery will be discussed with you by phone call or at
           the 1-month visit. If the results are benign (show no cancer), you will move to the
           ovarian cancer assessment period below. However, if the results show cancer, the study
           doctor will refer you to a gynecologic oncologist and you will move to the Follow-Up
           Phase and complete a yearly questionnaire.

      At 6 months (+/- 3 months), 1 year (+/- 3 months), and 2 years (+/- 3 months) after surgery,
      you will complete the quality-of-life questionnaires.

      Length of Study:

      Your last study visit will be about 1 month after your ovaries are removed. You will continue
      to complete questionnaires for as long as possible. You will be taken off study early if you
      no longer want to participate or cancer is found before the IS or RRSO surgeries.

      Follow-Up Phase:

      You will be moved to the Follow-Up Phase if cancer is found after IS or RRSO surgery, or if
      you have completed all the necessary quality-of-life questionnaires. You will complete a
      yearly follow-up questionnaire for as long as possible.

      This is an investigational study. At this time, the only surgery known to lower your risk of
      ovarian cancer is RRSO. ISDO has not been previously studied and may not lower your ovarian
      cancer risk. Your decision for any of these surgeries will be made with your doctor. You will
      sign a separate consent form that will describe each of these surgeries and their risks in
      more detail. ISDO is currently being used for research purposes at MD Anderson.

      Up to 300 women will be enrolled in this multicenter study. Up to 45 may take part at MD
      Anderson.
