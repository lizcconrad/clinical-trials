    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  1. To evaluate the tolerability and safety of infusing reduced volume Factor Eight
           Inhibitor Bypassing Activity (FEIBA) at the standard infusion rate of 2 U/kg/min

        -  2. To evaluate the tolerability and safety of infusing reduced volume FEIBA at increased
           rates of 4 and 10 U/kg/min, in comparison to the standard rate of 2 U/kg/min at the
           regular volume

             vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, etc.

          7. Diagnosis of advanced atherosclerosis, malignancy, and/or other diseases that may
             increase the participant's risk of thromboembolic complications

          8. Participant is taking any immunomodulating drug (e.g., corticosteroid agents at a dose
             equivalent to hydrocortisone &gt; 10 mg/day, or α-interferon) within 30 days prior to

             product (IP) or investigational device within 30 days prior to enrollment or is
             scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an IP or investigational
             device during the course of this study

         11. Participant is a family member or employee of the investigator
