  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AMG 211 is a bispecific single-chain antibody construct of the bispecific T-cell engager
      (BiTE®) class that targets human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, CD66e) on (tumor) cells and
      cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) positive T-cells. AMG 211 is a potentially new targeted
      drug in the treatment of relapsed/refractory gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma, since those are
      CEA expressing tumors. A well-known challenge in current drug development using targeted
      therapies is the high level of heterogeneity of target expression that is present in specific
      tumor types. Radio-labeling of AMG 211 with the positron emission tomography (PET)
      radionuclide Zirconium-89 (89Zr) enables non-invasive imaging and quantification of AMG 211
      distribution in cancer patients. By performing a 89Zr-AMG211 PET scan prior to treatment with
      AMG 211, the uptake of the tracer in the primary and metastatic tumor lesions and normal
      organ distribution can be evaluated. By performing a 89Zr-AMG211 PET scan during AMG 211
      continuous intravenous (cIV) treatment the investigators will be able to evaluate the impact
      of prolonged steady state exposure of AMG 211 on tumor and tissue uptake. The 89Zr-AMG211 PET
      imaging study may help to identify patients more likely to benefit from AMG 211 therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject will or is also participating in the ongoing phase 1 study in which AMG 211 is
             administered via cIV. 89Zr-AMG211 PET imaging will be performed before and/or during
             treatment with AMG 211 cIV
