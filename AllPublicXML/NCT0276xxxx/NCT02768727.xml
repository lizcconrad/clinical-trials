      The dual objectives of this study are to determine if the phenomenon of neural inertia is
      present in humans and to determine whether the order of neurocognitive function is invariant
      among anesthetic agents. This study will enroll 24 healthy volunteers, ages 20-40 years, who
      will receive xenon gas (concentrations ranging from 0% to 60%) delivered via inhaled route
      through the ENHANCER 3000.

      This is a multimodal, nonrandomized study of healthy subjects. After meeting enrollment
      criteria, subjects will receive a baseline neurocognitive testing on a computer for 15
      minutes and will then receive a wrist watch actigraphy device to record their rest/activity
      patterns over 8-14 days. On the study day (roughly two weeks later), repeat baseline
      neurocognitive testing will be performed after subjects are fitted with a high density EEG
      head cap. The actual intervention (delivery of inhaled xenon gas in stepwise increasing
      followed by decreasing doses) should occur over 2 hours along with verbal tests to assess the
      presence/absence of consciousness at each xenon concentration. Xenon doses have been chosen
      specifically to evaluate the point at which individuals lose and then regain consciousness.
      Doses are escalated up through those used in human anesthesiology (75%) that permit surgery.
      After exposure, serial neurocognitive testing will occur every 30 minutes for 3 hours post
      emergence. Subjects are discharged from the study's intervention day to home only upon
      reaching standard post-anesthesia care unit criteria (modified Aldrete score â‰¥9). A
      post-procedure follow up phone call will occur within 24 hours of anesthetic exposure to
      ensure that the subject remains well. The individual's involvement is completed upon
      returning the Actigraphy watch 1 week after the exposure day. The expected duration of
      subject participation is 3 weeks.
