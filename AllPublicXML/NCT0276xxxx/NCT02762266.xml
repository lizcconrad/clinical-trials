  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) works
      compared to stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic ablative radiation
      therapy (SABR) in patients with liver cancer that remain after attempts to remove the cancer
      have been made (residual) or has come back (recurrent). TACE is a minimally invasive,
      image-guided treatment procedure that uses a catheter to deliver both chemotherapy medication
      and embolization materials into the blood vessels that lead to the tumors. SBRT or SABR may
      be able to send radiation directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal liver tissue.
      It is not yet known whether TACE is more effective than SBRT or SABR in treating patients
      with persistent or recurrent liver cancer who have undergone initial TACE.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the freedom from local progression (FFLP) of TACE versus (vs) SABR in
      patients with persistent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after TACE.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) of TACE vs SABR in patients with
      persistent HCC after initial TACE.

      II. To determine the overall survival (OS) of TACE vs SABR for persistent HCC. III. To
      determine the toxicities associated with TACE or SABR for persistent HCC.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients undergo TACE.

      ARM II: Beginning within 2 weeks of the radiation set-up scan and within 4 weeks of fiducial
      seed implantation (if applicable), patients undergo image guided SBRT 3 fractions within 1
      week or 5 fractions within 2 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1-2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, 12, and
      18 months, and every 6 months up to 3 years.
