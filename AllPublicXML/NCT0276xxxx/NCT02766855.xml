    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of topical cysteamine eye drops in the
      treatment of corneal cystine crystals deposits in patients with nephropathic cystinosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 26 patients with nephropathic cystinosis were included in this prospective study.
      Patients were evaluated for improvement of corneal cysteine deposits crystals and photophobia
      following treatment with topical 0.55% cysteamine eye drops.

    <measure>Number of participants with improvement of photophobia, corneal cystine crystals and visual acuity following treatment with topical cysteamine 0.55% eye drops in patients with nephropathic cystinosis.</measure>
    <time_frame>Photophobia, slit lamp assessment of corneal cystine crystals and visual acuity are recorded pretreatment, on each monthly visit up to 48 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients had a baseline ophthalmic examination before initiation of topical cysteamine 0.55% eye drops and subsequent monthly follow up exams. The following parameters were recorded pretreatment, on each monthly visit and post treatment at last follow up visit: photophobia, slit lamp assessment of corneal cystine crystals and visual acuity. Photophobia was classified as grade 0 (none) for no photophobia, grade 1 (mild) for photophobia in bright light, grade 2 (moderate) for photophobia in room light and grade 3 (severe) for photophobia in dim light. Corneal cystine crystals were graded as Grade 0 = None, Grade 1 = 1-10 crystals/mm, Grade 2 = 11- 50 crystals/mm, Grade 3 = more than 50 crystals/mm. The level of cystine in the corneal layers was recorded and the location whether peripheral or central was also identified. Visual acuity was measured by Snellen chart at 20 feet with best distance correction.</description>
