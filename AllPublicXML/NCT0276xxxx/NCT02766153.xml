      Myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) include chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (Ph +) and
      essential thrombocythemia (ET), the polycythemia vera (PV), myelofibrosis (MF) called SMP Ph.
      CML is the ultimate model of carcinogenesis. SMP is a characterized by a malignant monoclonal
      proliferation of a pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor determined by the presence of a
      balanced translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (Ph chromosome) which leads to major
      changes of a large number of cell functions. Investigators now believe that within the bone
      marrow exist two types of &quot;hematopoietic niches' niche osteoblastic / endosteal and vascular
      niche, controlling the maintenance and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cell pool. The
      endosteal niche, is a hypoxic region near the endosteal trabecular, which provides protection
      to deeply dormant stem cells. Data from the literature suggest that in the SMP, especially
      CML, the interaction of malignant stem cells with the microenvironment niche Endosteal could
      favor their survival and resistance to treatment. The therapeutic management of CML was upset
      by the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, despite these advances, even in
      situations of undetectable residual disease, it has been observed relapses of the disease
      stopped TKI leaving suggest that there is a resistance of leukemic stem cell to TKI.

      Work in the group Bipoa &quot;Bio Engineering and Pathophysiology Osteo-Articular&quot; helped develop
      a 3D model of ex vivo bone formation, which can mimic the endosteal niche. the goal is to
      apply this model to the SMP of hematopoiesis by referring to normal hematopoiesis. it will be
      tested the hypothesis that the endosteal ex vivo recess of the 3D modeling allows to
      highlight a special interaction can promote the persistence of the leukemia stem cell despite
      the use of effective therapies.

        The patients selected for this study, which will continue over a period of five years,
        corresponding to all newly diagnosed patients or SMP during TKI treatment in the clinical
        hematology department of Nice University Hospital and associated centers. The recruitment
        of three years should be 200 patients. Healthy donors are intra-family donor marrow taken
        to operating room under general anesthesia as part of their marrow donation. These healthy
        donors have also already signed a consent for their donation, including research referred
        to levies.
