  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to investigate the effect of capsaicin-induced neurogenic
      inflammation with three different intensities on itch subsequently induced by histamine and
      cowhage. The hypothesis is that capsaicin-induced pre-established neurogenic inflammation
      significantly increases susceptibility to itch provocations with cowhage and histamine.

    <measure>Itch intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed continuously at 0-10 minutes following itch provocation</time_frame>
    <description>Rating of the perceived itch intensity on a visual analogue scale (VAS) App (Aalborg University) as displayed on a tablet computer with a sample rate of 1 Hz.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurogenic inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed 11 minutes after itch provocation</time_frame>
    <description>Neurogenic inflammation in the treated area is assessed using full-field laser perfusion imaging (FLPI)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in sensitivity to touch-evoked itch</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed before, and at 12-15 minutes following itch provocation</time_frame>
    <description>Three von Frey filaments are applied to the test area before and after itch provocation. Subjects report three NRS scores ('0-10', 'No itch-Worst imaginable itch') for itch induced by von Frey stimulation. Change is calculated by subtracting baseline mean from post-provocation mean NRS scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wheal size</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at 10 minutes following itch provocation</time_frame>
    <description>Histamine wheal size is assessed by measuring the longest diameter of the wheal with a ruler, followed by measuring the orthogonal diameter. The mean of these diameters will represent the wheal size in diameter, reported in mm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed continuously at 0-10 minutes following itch provocation</time_frame>
    <description>Rating of the perceived pain intensity on a visual analogue scale (VAS) App (Aalborg University) as displayed on a tablet computer with a sample rate of 1 Hz.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain during capsaicin application</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours after first application of capsaicin patch</time_frame>
    <description>Peak and average numerical rating scale (NRS) scores ('0-10, 'no pain-worst imaginable pain') are reported by subjects for each patch.</description>
