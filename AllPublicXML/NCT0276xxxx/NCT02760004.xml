  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to develop, evaluate, and share a new low-cost program for
      Obstetrics/Gynecology (Ob/Gyn) practices which will help to improve depression treatment for
      women during pregnancy and after childbirth.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upwards of 1 in 5 women suffer from depression during pregnancy or within a year after giving
      birth. It has negative effects on birth outcomes, infant attachment, and children's
      behavior/development. Maternal suicide causes 20% of postpartum deaths in depressed women.
      Although the vast majority of perinatal women are amenable to being screened for depression,
      screening alone does not improve treatment rates or patient outcomes. Ob/Gyn practices need
      supports in place to adequately address depression in their patient populations. Thus, the
      Investigators developed and pilot tested the PRogram In Support of Moms (PRISM), to create a
      comprehensive intervention that is proactive, multifaceted, and practical. PRSIM aims to
      improve perinatal depression treatment and treatment response rates through: (1) access to
      immediate resource provision/referrals and psychiatric telephone consultation for Ob/Gyn
      providers; (2) clinic-specific implementation of stepped care, including training support and
      toolkits; and, (3) proactive treatment engagement, patient monitoring, and stepped treatment
      response to depression screening/assessment. PRISM builds on a low-cost and widely
      disseminated population-based model for delivering psychiatric care in primary care settings
      developed by our team. Because it uses existing infrastructure and resources, PRISM, has the
      potential to be feasible, sustainable and transportable to other practice settings. The
      Investigators will compare PRISM vs. enhanced usual care (access to resource
      provision/referrals and psychiatric telephone consultation) in a clinical trial in which
      Investigators will randomize 12 Ob/Gyn practices to either PRISM or enhanced usual care
      intervention. Provider and staff participants will participate in either PRISM or enhanced
      usual care, depending on what intervention their practice is assigned to. The Investigators
      will compare the effectiveness of PRISM vs. enhanced usual care to improve depression
      severity and treatment participation in pregnancy through 12 months postpartum among 300
      patients (n=150/group, 25 per clinic). The Investigators will also determine change in
      knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward depression screening and treatment in the PRISM
      group compared to enhanced usual care group.

    <measure>Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The change in EPDS scores from baseline (0 -20 weeks GA, 20-40 weeks GA or 0-12 weeks pp) to final assessment (11-13 months pp) will be compared between the 2 arms (enhanced usual care vs PRISM).</time_frame>
    <description>Depressed perinatal patients receiving care from practices enrolled in PRISM will experience more improvement in depression symptoms than patients receiving care from the enhanced usual care practices (2 point difference-of-difference in EPDS).</description>

    <measure>Mental Health Utilization Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>4-20 wks GA, 20-40 wks GA, 0-12 wks pp, 5-7 mos pp, 11-13 mos pp, Depending on when recruited the Mental Health Utilization Questionnaire will be administered 3 to 5 times throughout the study. Recruitment can happen in the first 3 time periods.</time_frame>
    <description>Depressed perinatal patients receiving care from practices enrolled in PRISM will have improved treatment initiation and sustainment (as measured by attendance and one initial mental health assessment or treatment visit and an average ≥1 mental health visit every 1 month until remission of symptoms or study assessment) as compared to women receiving care from practices enrolled in enhanced usual care.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Provider/staff fidelity to PRISM intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured by survey questionnaire at baseline 0-12 months pre-intervention, 0-12 months post intervention, 12-24 months post intervention and final assessment (study completion)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by longitudinal pre and post-intervention data through individual surveys to evaluate depression screening practices, acceptability of screening, perceived gaps in screening/referral supports, and attitudes and practices towards perinatal depression. The post-implementation interviews will measure acceptability of PRISM components.</description>
