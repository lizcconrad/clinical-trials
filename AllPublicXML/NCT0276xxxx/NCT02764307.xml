      Background: Nebulizers design influences efficiency of aerosol delivery. Performance of
      nebulizers is commonly tested by breathing simulators with static parameters. However,
      breathing patterns vary in adults.

      Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate drug deposition of different types of
      nebulizers testing with breathing patterns of healthy subjects.

      Material and Methods

      The study was approved by Chang Gung Memorial Foundation Institutional Review Broad. Ten
      healthy subjects, aged 20.6Â±0.5 years, were recruited. Four nebulizers:

        1. a constant jet nebulizer (Neb-easy, Galemed Corp., Taiwan);

        2. a breath enhanced nebulizer (Pari LC plus, Pari Inc., Germany);

        3. a manual-actuated nebulizer (A-T Neb, Atlantean Corporation, Taiwan); and

        4. a breath-actuated nebulizer (AeroElipes, Trudell Medical Inc, Canada) were evaluated.
