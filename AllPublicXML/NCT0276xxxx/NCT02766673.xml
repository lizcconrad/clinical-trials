  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently several dose schedules of Albuterol are administered via nebulization to infants in
      the neonatal and infant intensive care unit (N/IICU). As Albuterol is not FDA approved for
      this population (under 2 years) there is no standard recommended dose. Aerosolized Albuterol
      is one of the most widely used therapies that are utilized for infants with chronic lung
      disease. The common practice in the N/IICU is weight base dosing of all medications. This
      contradicts the aerosol science recommendations, which advise not to titrate doses by weight
      as the patient naturally self-regulates their dose according to the change in minute
      ventilation with age. In addition, the wide use of aerosolized Albuterol in the infant with
      Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) has little current evidence of efficacy in this disease.
      Understanding the appropriate dose for effective treatment as well as the indication for use
      in the BPD population would provide the clinician with useful guidelines.

      The investigators propose to analyze the safety and efficacy of aerosolized albuterol in
      infants with BPD comparing the recommended dose per aerosolization literature with the common
      dosing practices at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) as well as placebo.

      This is a randomized, blinded cross-over study of infants with a diagnosis of Severe BPD that
      are mechanically ventilated. Participants will receive 3 sets of treatment (2.5mg Albuterol,
      1.25mg Albuterol, 3ml normal saline placebo), in random order. Each treatment will be
      administered every 4 hours for 24 hours. After a 6 hour washout phase, the next group of
      interventions will be applied. Following another wash-out phase, the final group of
      intervention will be applied. Pulmonary mechanics from the ventilator (e.g. airway
      compliance, airway resistance, tidal volume, peak inspiratory pressure, Forced Expiratory
      Flow at 75% of forced vital capacity, etc.) and the patient short term response to therapy
      (heart rate, blood pressure, heart rhythm) will be assessed for the duration of the treatment
      period.
