      This is an open label, interventional, randomized phase II trial comparing StemRegenin-1
      (SR-1) cultured umbilical cord blood (experimental arm) to unmanipulated umbilical cord blood
      (standard of care arm) transplantation after a myeloablative CY/FLU/TBI conditioning. A 2:1
      randomization will be employed with a higher chance of being assigned to the experimental
      arm.

    <description>Unmanipulated UCB infusion given on Day 0. All patients will receive the same conditioning and immunoprophylaxis for the prevention of acute and chronic GVHD, previously demonstrated to offer the best outcomes in recipients of partially HLA matched UCB. Standard supportive care, including the use of Neupogen [G-CSF] and prophylactic anti-bacterial, protozoal, viral and fungal agents, will also be prescribed. Supportive care will be modified throughout the transplant course at the treating physician's judgement.</description>
