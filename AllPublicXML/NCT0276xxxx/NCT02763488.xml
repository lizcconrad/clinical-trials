    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate blood flow restriction training as a rehabilitation modalities
      following total knee arthroplasty in order to determine if patient reported outcomes and
      objective functional outcomes can be improved through post-operative rehabilitation compared
      to standard physical therapy modalities currently in use.

      Patients will be enrolled preoperatively in order to measure preoperative functional
      measures. They will then be followed at predetermined intervals post-operatively. All
      subjects will begin the study related physical therapy 6 weeks post-operatively and continue
      for 12 sessions. At the conclusion of 12 sessions, subjects will be retested to determine
      improvement. Subjects will then be followed for two years post-operative.
