    <textblock>
      Patients with BMI over 40 or with BMI over 35 and comorbidities are offered SADI-S with a
      variable limb length between 250 cm and 300 cm or gastric bypass.

      Results on weight loss, comorbidities resolution, complications, re-operations, need of
      supplements are registered.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Morbid obese patients and patients with an initial BMI over 35 with associated comorbidities
      - as diabetes mellitus - are evaluated for bariatric surgery. Candidates are offered a
      standard gastric bypass or a single anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy.
      Patients with higher BMI and those with worse metabolic condition are encouraged to accept
      the malabsorptive option.

      Gastric bypass is performed with a 150 cm alimentary limb and a calibrated pouch and
      anastomosis over a 14 mm bougie. SADI-S is performed with a sleeve gastrectomy over a 54
      French (18 mm) gastric bougie and a 250 cm common limb.

      Patients are managed equally during admission: 6 hours to initiate oral intake, 2 days to
      remove abdominal drain and 3 days to discharge unless contraindicated. Follow up is performed
      through visits every 3 months the first 2 postoperative years and every 6 months from the 3rd
      to the 5th year.
