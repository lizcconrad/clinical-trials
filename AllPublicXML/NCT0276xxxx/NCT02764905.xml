      This will be a feasibility study. Individuals that have undergone an evaluation day at the
      center for successful aging with diabetes with a Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) of &gt;=7.5 and a
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)&lt;26 will be approached and invited to participate. The
      participants will be divided into 2 groups: 1) information communication technology (ICT)
      group - an intervention based on weekly SMS that will remind the individual to implement his
      personal treatment plan and will raise the awareness to the importance of self-care in
      diabetes; 2) intensive cognitive-physical rehabilitation group that will include a 2 phase
      multi-disciplinary intervention. The 2 phases: a) Intensive phase: weekly 4 hour group
      meeting which will include computerized cognitive training, aerobic, balance and strength
      exercise and group discussion that will be dedicated to cognitive rehabilitation strategies
      development and implementation with emphasis on disease management and physical activity as
      well as psycho-education on various disease management aspects (medical and nutritional) b) a
      consolidation phase: monthly 2 hour group discussions on challenges of implementation and
      coping strategies. Outcomes will include change in A1C (primary), change in strength, aerobic
      capacity as well as quality of life and cognitive function (secondary). Additionally, team
      members and participants will fill out a structured questionnaire regarding their evaluation
      of the program aiming at refinement of the intervention.

      1. ICT intervention. A personalized SMS based patient communication feedback system
           (Microsoft). Utilizing the jointly decided upon follow-up parameters individuals will
           receive periodic SMS reminders. In cases of consistent non-adherence the system will
           alert the diabetes nurse educator who will contact the individual (in addition to the
           routine monthly call) in order to understand the difficulty and devise an alternate
           plan. The personalized SMS system is based on insights from a recent successful clinical
           trial conducted in people with diabetes. The system is based on a machine learning
           module and learns using the attributes of the participants (age, gender etc.) their
           activities as well as past experience to predict which SMS message would most
           incentivize each person to enhance conduction of the decided upon treatment plan (for
           example a certain type of physical activity). In this way the system achieves
           improvements which are superior to those achieved by generic feedback systems. Mobile
           health technology (mHealth). MHealth is the use of mobile phone technology to deliver
           health care. This innovation have been developed that address an array of issues such as
           monitoring chronic condition, medication adherence, improving patient provider
           communication, and disease and emergency tracking. Most widely adopted and least
           expensive technological feature of mHealth is the text messaging (SMS). SMS is suitable
           for behavior change interventions because it allows for in-the-moment, personally
           tailored health communication and reinforcement. Several studies have found that text
           messaging is a worthwhile investment for helping people with diabetes to improve their
           disease management.

        2. Intensive cognitive-physical rehabilitation intervention. The intervention will include
           two phases:

             1. Intensive phase: 12 weekly group meeting 4 hours each. Each meeting will be
                composed of:

                  -  2 hours guided by a neuropsychologist each dedicated to a different cognitive
                     domain for example memory, concentration, planning, information processing,
                     problem solving (with special emphasis on diabetes issues). Each session will
                     be composed of: 1) introduction- homework from previous session will be
                     checked and the cognitive domain that will be discussed on that day will be
                     introduced; 2) cognitive training using a computerized system (hour); 3) group
                     discussion on compensatory strategies and training to be conducted at home

                  -  2 hours guided by a certified physical trainer. These will include strength,
                     balance and aerobic elements conducted in a group but individualized according
                     to the capabilities and targets of the individual as assessed during the
                     evaluation day. These sessions will also include formulation of a plan for
                     exercise to be conducted by the individual on a daily basis. Additionally, 30
                     minutes of each session will be dedicated to psycho-education on various
                     disease management aspects guided by a diabetes nurse educator or a dietitian
                     (alternating).

             2. Consolidation phase: 9 months of monthly group meetings. The consolidation group
                sessions will include monthly 2 hour group discussions on challenges of
                implementation and coping strategies Medical surveillance will take place every 2
                months with monitoring of glucose, blood pressure lipid control as well as
                follow-up on other recommendations given during the feed-back sessions this will be
                conducted by the Diabetes nurse educator who will be work together with a diabetes
                specialist an Endocrinologist (study physician) on maximal risk factor reduction.
