      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) amplitude and electrode montage that is both safe and efficacious

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique
      that can modulate cortical excitability of targeted brain regions. Various studies have
      investigated tDCS use in stroke patients with motor impairments (cumulatively about 200
      cases). Although these studies are mostly &quot;proof of concept&quot; with small sample size, they do
      suggest that tDCS may improve motor function. However these two questions have not been
      addressed systematically:

        1. What is the optimal current for stroke patients?

        2. What is the optimal tDCS electrode montage for stimulation?

      This proposal lays the scientific foundation for systematic application of tDCS in stroke
      recovery research by progressively increasing tDCS currents and montages that are both safe
      and efficacious in population with stroke.

  <primary_outcome>

    <description>Major response is any of the following:
Second degree scalp burn at the site of electrode pad; or
Seizure; or
New lesion(s) on Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) sequence of MRI scan and the lesion(s) not explained by any other cause(s) or decreased Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) under the electrode stimulating motor cortex area;
Discontinuation of subject from the study due to any of above.
In a 3+3 design, 3 subjects are recruited for a given tDCS dose level. The trial is stopped if â‰¥2 of 3 subjects at a given tDCS dose level show major response. If only 1 of 3 subjects shows major response, 3 more subjects are recruited at a given tDCS dose level and a major response in any of them will stop the trial. Otherwise, same procedure is followed for the next tDCS dose level. Maximum tolerable dose will be the tDCS dose at the level before stopping of the trial.</description>

    <description>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) response immediately after tDCS on the same day is compared with the TMS response immediately before tDCS on the same day for evaluating efficacy of tDCS at a given current amplitude and montage.</description>

             of 66);

          -  Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP) is inducible on abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle on
             the affected side by TMS.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Bihemispheric ischemic strokes;

          -  History of prior stroke or old infarct demonstrated on the CT or MRI or documented in
             medical records;

          -  Other concomitant neurological disorders affecting upper extremity motor function;

          -  Documented history of dementia before or after stroke;

          -  Documented history of uncontrolled depression or psychiatric disorder either before or
             after stroke which could affect their ability to participate in the experiment;

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension despite treatment, specifically Systolic blood pressure
             (SBP)/ Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) &gt;= 180/100 mmHg at baseline;

          -  Presence of any MRI/tDCS/TMS risk factors: a) an electrically, magnetically or

             intracerebral vascular clips or any other electrically sensitive support system; b)
             non-fixed metal in any part of the body, including a previous metallic injury to eye;
             c) pregnancy, since the effect of tDCS on the fetus is unknown; d) history of seizure
