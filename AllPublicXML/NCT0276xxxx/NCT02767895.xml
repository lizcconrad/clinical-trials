  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing elective revascularization for their peripheral artery disease will be
      randomized to a &quot;prehabilitation&quot; program prior to their surgery or to usual care. The
      prehabilitation program is self-directed program designed to improve health and quality of
      life prior to surgery. The program is currently offered to general surgery patients; this
      study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of such a program in a different patient
      population.
