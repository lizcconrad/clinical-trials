      The data was gathered using retrospective and follow-up prospective study of a group of
      patients, consisting of adult women that underwent a breast reduction surgery at the Clinic
      of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery Faculty of Comenius University and at the
      University Hospital in Bratislava, Ružinov, during the time period between 2000 until May
      2014. The data concerning the quality of life of these patients was gathered by using the
      globally standardized questionnaire &quot;Breast Q questionnaire©&quot; with the separate software
      system evaluation tool &quot;QScore©&quot;. The statistical analysis was conducted using GraphpadPrism
      program v. 6.01. The total number of respondents consisted of 52 people who were followed-up
      for up to 12 years.
