    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled dose-escalation clinical trial to
      evaluate the safety and the immunogenicity of Adenoviral vector 5 HIV-1 vaccines in subjects
      receiving stable highly active antiretroviral therapy(HAART) .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients continue antiretroviral medications throughout the course of this study. Three
      groups of patients receive dose-escalation (2×10^9VP, 2×10^10VP or 2×10^11VP) injections of
      Adenovirus vector vaccine (Ad5-gag). Two weeks post immunization of lower dose, if the
      vaccine is safe and well tolerant, the next dose of immunization will begin. patients are
      monitored for safety 72 hours after each immunization. In addition, each patient records
      adverse events in a diary. Patients have regular physical exams, pregnancy tests, and blood
      drawn for virologic and immunologic assessments. The induction of HIV-specific responses will
      be measured.
