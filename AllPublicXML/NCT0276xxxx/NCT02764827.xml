      Pollen allergen extracts are prepared locally and checked for efficacy by comparison to
      imported allergens and specific IgE.

    <textblock>
      Skin prick test (SPT) and specific IgE (sIgE) are approved for evaluation of allergen
      sensitization. Local allergen extracts are cheaper and more available but need
      standardization. Pollen allergen extracts: Bermuda, Johnson and careless weed are locally
      prepared and compared mean wheal diameter of skin prick test to imported allergens and also
      to specific IgE.

        People 18-60 years of age who recently have positive skin prick test to grass pollen or
        careless weed are pricked with local and imported Bermuda grass, Johnson grass and careless
        weed allergen extracts. Specific IgE levels are also measured at the same day.
