      BACKGROUND:

      Sleep disturbances are often referred to as a hallmark of PTSD. In a sample of 734
      trauma-affected refugees undergoing psychiatric treatment at Competence Centre for
      Transcultural Psychiatry (CTP) in the period 2008-2012 99% reported sleep disturbances and
      nightmares.

      In trauma-affected populations untreated sleep disturbances can uphold and exacerbate both
      sleep-related and non-sleep-related PTSD symptoms. Sleep disturbances may also affect the
      efficacy of first-line PTSD treatment and constitute a risk factor for poor outcome of
      psychiatric treatment. It has been argued that effective treatment of sleep disturbances may
      accelerate recovery in PTSD. There is a lack of randomised clinical trials on this relation
      in trauma-affected refugees.

      The aim of this study is to examine sleep enhancing treatment in refugees with PTSD.

      MATERIALS AND METHOD:

      The study will include 230 refugees, diagnosed with PTSD, referred to CTP. Patients who give
      informed consent will be randomised to four treatment groups.

        1. Treatment as usual (TAU); pharmacological treatment according to algorithm and manual
           based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy

        2. TAU and add-on treatment with mianserin

        3. TAU and add-on treatment with Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (IRT)

        4. TAU and add-on treatment with mianserin and IRT

      RESULTS:

      This study is expected to bring forward new knowledge on both medical and therapeutic
      treatment of sleep disturbances in trauma-affected refugees.
