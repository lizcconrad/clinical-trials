    <textblock>
      Introduction: The increase in intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) can contribute to muscle
      weakness and consequently on progression of knee OA. The prescription of exercise protocols
      has been used as a treatment strategy to minimize some of the bouts. Circuit training (CT)
      involves the combination of strength training and aerobic in the same session and has shown
      benefits in body composition and physical function. But the literature is unclear with
      respect to the influences of CT in the concentration of IMAT in the population with knee OA.
      Objective: To investigate the influence of a 14-week CT protocol in body composition and
      thigh IMAT concentration as well as cartilage degradation indicators and systemic
      inflammation and its impact on quality of life in patients with knee OA.

      This study presents a randomized controlled trial design. They will be selected 40
      participants diagnosed with knee OA grades II and III, aged 40 and 65 years and BMI &lt;30 kg /
      m2 were randomly divided into two groups: participants underwent training (trained group -
      TG) and not subjected to training ( untrained group - NTG). The participants trained group
      will undergo a periodized CT protocol of 14 weeks load progression, 3 times a week, with
      sessions last 15 minutes in the first weeks and will arrive 35 minutes in final weeks, and
      added 10 minutes between heating and cooling down. All subjects will conduct pre and post CT
      variables: IMAT thigh (computed tomography); body composition (Dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry - DXA), inflammatory biomarker concentrations: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α,
      leptin and adiponectin and joint degradation biomarkers (uCTX-II and sCOMP), performance
      tests functional (six-minute walk, 30 seconds chair stand test and stair climb test), muscle
      strength (maximum voluntary isometric contraction - MVIC), WOMAC and KOOS questionnaires, and
      catastrophizing pain scale. During the training protocol, uCTX-II variables, sCOMP and MVIC
      will also be evaluated. To compare the groups will be applied the unpaired t-test. When found
      significant main effects, the Bonferroni test will be used to identify the statistically
      significant differences. To compare the collections times (pre, during and post TC) for
      uCTX-II variables, sCOMP and MVIC will be held repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc
      Bonferroni, and the WOMAC variables, KOOS, DXA, IMAT, functional testing and inflammatory
      cytokines (pre and post CT) will be held the paired t test. A significance level of 5% (p ≤
      0.05) will be adopted.

    <description>The concentration of intermuscular fat tissue will be measured by computed tomography. The images will be obtained through a CT scanner Multislice (Brilliance CT 16-slice, Phillips), located at the University Hospital of San Carlos. The examination will be conducted by experienced personnel under the supervision of a radiologist, developer of this study.
The suggested protocol will provide an image related to the mid-thigh area of both legs. Quantification of intermuscular fat quadriceps muscle will be carried out by a slice thickness of 10 mm corresponding to half the distance between the greater trochanter and the intercondylar notch of the femur. The analyzes of the areas will be manually performed using the software OsiriX., And the area of interest selected by a scan, in accordance with the density of tissue decay rates for quantification of adipose tissue present in cm2.</description>

    <description>For body composition analysis as it is used absorptiometry apparatus of X-ray Dual Energy (DXA, Hologic Discovery A, Benford, MA) using the three compartment model (lean mass, adipose tissue and body mineral density ), thus allowing to estimate the total body composition and body segment.
The participant will be placed in the supine position and should remain without moving during the examination. To obtain better image, the subject should not use any type of metal, either as accessories or clothing. The results are transmitted to a connected to the machine computer and the examination of the report will provide data expressed in grams and percentage, are used to analyze data related to adipose tissue (g) Lean Mass (g) of the total composition (g) and percentage arms of adipose tissue (right and left), trunk and legs (right and left), gynoid regions and android beyond the total body composition.</description>

    <description>To assess pain, stiffness and physical function will use the questionnaire WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities), a self-administered instrument that addresses the impact and restrictions specifically on the quality of life of patients with OA of the lower limbs. It is a questionnaire translated and validated for the Portuguese language. Composed of 24 reported auto issues, based on information in the 72 hours prior to their application, it is divided into three domains: pain, stiffness and physical function. Scoring is done using a Likert scale, wherein each question scored between 0 and 100, distributed as follows: 0 = none; 25 = little; Moderate = 50; = 75 intense and very intense = 100 59. The final score will be determined by the highest score in each area, causing pain, stiffness and physical function considered worse the higher the score achieved.</description>

    <description>The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a self reported specific joint measure developed to assess a broad spectrum of patients with knee injuries and OA, for pain and other symptoms, function in daily life, function in sports and recreation, and quality of knee-related life, being easy to use, evaluating the short- and long-term health problems related to the knee joint.
The KOOS contains 42 items covering five subscales: pain, other symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and leisure activities and quality of life. A score of 0 (extreme problems) 100 (smoothly) can be obtained separately for each sub-range.</description>

    <description>The Pain Scale Catastrophizing it is a self-administered scale, easy and fast application, which allows the identification of individuals with psychological traits to catastrophizing. This instrument consists of 13 items, which the patient should report the degree of thought or feeling described with respect to pain, always respecting a degree of 5 points. The total score is given by the sum of all items, ranging from 0 to 52 points. It asked patients to answer the questions according to the thoughts and feelings that develop when affected by pain, regardless of the time of the interview the patient is in pain or not.</description>
