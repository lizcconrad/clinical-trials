      Background and aim: Postoperative pain is an adverse effect of oral surgeries and may
      therefore be prevented or minimized. This study compares the efficacy of preemptive ibuprofen
      and dexamethasone protocols in pain prevention and control after surgical implant placement.

      Methods: For this prospective, double-masked, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomized
      clinical trial, 117 dental implants were placed. The groups received three different
      protocols 1 hour before surgery:

        1. 600 mg ibuprofen (and another 600 mg dose 6 hours after the first dose);

        2. 4 mg dexamethasone (and another 4 mg 6 hours after the first dose) or

        3. placebo.

      Rescue medication (1000 mg acetaminophen) was given to each patient who was instructed to
      take it if necessary. Pain intensity was evaluated by a 101-point numeric rate scale and
      visual analogue scale, additionally discomfort was evaluated using a four-point verbal rate
      scale, hourly for the first 8 hours after surgery and three times a day on the following 3
      days.
