  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of Engaging Men in Accountable Practice
      (EMAP) on the prevention of violence against women and girls in North and South Kivu (DRC).
      The study is conducted jointly by the World Bank's Africa Gender Innovation Lab and the
      International Rescue Committee (IRC). EMAP is a program developed and implemented by the IRC
      to engage men to reflect on how to reduce and prevent intimate partner violence through 16
      weekly group discussion sessions. The study is a cluster randomized control trial in which
      two groups of 25 self-selected men in 15 communities receive the EMAP intervention while in
      15 other communities, 50 self-selected men receive an alternative intervention. Key outcomes
      examined include: (i) Experience of past year physical, sexual and psychological violence
      reported by women whose partners are EMAP participants; (ii) Participant's gender attitudes
      and behaviors, conflict and hostility management skills; (iii) Power sharing and
      communication within the couple.

    <description>Engaging Men through Accountable Practice: 30 communities are matched into 15 pairs on a set of socio-demographic characteristic and within each pair, 15 treatment sites are randomly selected. Within each treatment community, all adult men (20+ years old) are eligible to participate in the EMAP intervention. A random draw of 50 participants determines who will participate in EMAP in case more than 50 eligible men express interest.</description>

    <description>Engaging Men through Accountable Practice aims to engage men as agents of change through structured, weekly discussions with committed groups of men. It aims to address entrenched views of gender roles and identify positive models of masculinity. The approach follows a structured series of discussions designed to explore existing understandings of masculinity and create more positive models of what it means to be a 'good' man, promoting self-reflection and pushing men to analyze and change their own power and privilege. This methodology begins with a series of discussions with women to inform men's dialogue groups, and includes continuous feedback loops with women throughout the process so that the work with men is grounded in, and accountable to, women's views and objectives.</description>
