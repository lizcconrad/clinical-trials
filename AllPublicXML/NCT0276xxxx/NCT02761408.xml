      -  One-site audit. The enrolled subject is confirmed by PIs

           ◦◦Source data is compared to external data sources medical records, either paper or
           electronic case report forms.

        -  NCI CTCAE v5.0 for AE records

        -  Patient recruitment according to inclusion criteria: 1. Newly diagnosed locally head and
           neck squamous cell carcinoma; 2. Apply for primary chemoradiation or adjuvant
           chemoradiation; 3. Signed informed consent

        -  Sample size assessment: 60 subjects will be included in one year for total 120 subjects

        -  Missing data to address situations where variables are reported as missing, unavailable,
           &quot;non-reported,&quot; uninterpretable, or considered missing because of data inconsistency or
           out-of-range results

        -  Fisher's exact test is for category comparison. Kaplan-Meier analysis is for survival
           analysis. AE grades will be analyzed according to NCI guideline. Two-side p &lt; 0.05 is
           suggested significant.
