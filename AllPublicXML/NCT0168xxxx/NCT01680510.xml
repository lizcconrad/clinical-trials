  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinitis pigmentosa is a genetically disease consisting of progressive retinal degeneration
      starting in the rods. Its prevalence is 1:4000 people and is the fourth most common blinding
      disease in Israel in 2004 [7% of all blindness]. The investigators treated a non-progressive
      form of the disease [Fundus Albipunctatus] by oral therapy of the food supplement made from
      alga Dunaliella Bardawil composed of approximately 50% 9-cis β-carotene. The alga Dunaliella
      Bardawil accumulates high concentration of β -carotene when grown under appropriate
      conditions. The β -carotene of the alga is composed of approximately 50% of all-trans - β
      carotene and 50% 9-cis β -carotene.

      The 9-cis β -carotene has been shown to be a precursor of 9-cis retinoic acid both in-vitro
      in human intestinal mucosa and in-vivo in a ferret, perfused with 9-cis b-carotene. The night
      vision, as measured objectively by electroretinography (ERG) more than doubled in six
      patients tested following treatment. The visual field was also improved significantly. In a
      more recent study the investigators treated 29 retinitis pigmentosa patients with the 9-cis b
      Carotene algae Dunaliella Bardawil in a double masked placebo control cross over trial.
      Significant improvement in retinal function was recorded in 34% of the patients.
