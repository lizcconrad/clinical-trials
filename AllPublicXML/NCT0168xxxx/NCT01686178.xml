    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to implement and evaluate interventions to decrease smoking among
      young adults attending bars and nightclubs. It is believed that the proportion of young adult
      current smokers during and after the intervention will be significantly less than the
      proportion of young adult smokers before the intervention in each of the study cities.

    <description>In prior research, a high risk subpopulation of young adults was identified in San Diego, CA: the &quot;hipster&quot; subculture. We developed a yearlong pilot social branding intervention to decrease smoking among this group, using social events and social leaders to promote a strong nonsmoking lifestyle. The intervention rationale is based on utilizing industry market research tools to define the target audience and directly countering tobacco industry lifestyle marketing strategies. We now propose to extend this intervention to three other cities (tailoring the intervention to a high-risk subpopulation of young adults in each city) and evaluate it in a multicenter quasi-experimental controlled trial.</description>

    <description>We will utilize industry market research tools to define the target audience (segment of community with high smoking prevalence and high social influence) and directly counter tobacco industry lifestyle marketing strategies through local promotion of a smokefree brand and branded bar and club events.</description>
