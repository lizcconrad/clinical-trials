    <textblock>
      The investigational new drug (FolateScan or Technetium Tc 99m EC20) is a folate-targeted
      diagnostic radiopharmaceutical agent designed to bind to the folate receptor. The folate
      receptor is a glycoprotein that is over-expressed in many types of cancer cells but it is
      only minimally distributed in normal tissues . Folate conjugates bind to the folate receptor
      with high affinity and are brought into the cell via endocytosis. In contrast, folic acid
      itself enters most normal cells via the reduced folate carrier, a pathway entirely
      inaccessible to folate conjugates. Therefore, these folate conjugates are specific to cancer
      cells.

      This is a phase 2, multi-center, open-label, single-treatment group, baseline-controlled
      study designed to verify product safety, gather data on the percentage of metastatic renal
      cell carcinoma patients with increased uptake of FolateScan in tumors, and to calculate
      sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value
      of FolateScan compared to immunohistochemical staining (IHC).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To be eligible for the study, patients must fulfill all of the following criteria:

               1. Patient must be 18 years of age or older.

               2. Patient must have suspected metastatic renal cell carcinoma with at least one
                  identifiable lesion &gt;2.0 cm as diagnosed by CT, MRI, or ultrasonography within 60
                  days prior to enrollment.

               3. Patient must have good kidney function defined as a serum creatinine â‰¤1.5 X ULN.

               4. Patient must provide written informed consent prior to enrollment.

               5. Patients must provide a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sample of either
                  the primary or metastatic or recurrent site(s) for IHC staining for the presence
                  of folate receptors from either a previous surgical/biopsy procedure or from a
                  surgery/biopsy scheduled within 30 days of FolateScan. A fine needle aspirate is
                  not acceptable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any of the following criteria will make the patient ineligible to participate in this
             study:

               1. Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.

               2. Patient is simultaneously participating in another investigational drug study,
                  excluding the follow-up phase.

               3. Patient has received an investigational agent or therapeutic chemotherapy within
                  7 days prior to enrollment.

               4. Patient is unable to tolerate conditions for radionuclide imaging.

               5. Patient has been administered another radiopharmaceutical that would interfere
                  with the assessment of Technetium Tc 99m EC20.
