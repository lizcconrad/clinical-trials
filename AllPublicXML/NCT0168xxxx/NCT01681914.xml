  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Utilizing funding through the President´s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) this
      project seeks to assess the effectiveness of a subset of the new Mozambican clinical
      guidelines for the diagnosis, initial management, and follow-up ( &gt;1 follow-up visit to
      determine response to initial and/or second-line therapy) of common signs and symptoms in
      HIV-infected adult patients as used under field conditions by Mozambique-based clinicians in
      MOH health facilities in Zambézia province, Mozambique. The operational feasibility of the
      new guidelines will be described; they will be compared to the previous standard of care for
      the problem(s) of interest, and the clinical importance of differences between guidelines
      designed for Mozambican non-physician clinicians and new guidelines (also issued in late
      2009) for Mozambican physicians will be described. The subset of guidelines to be addressed
      in the current phase of this 2-year project includes algorithms for diagnosis and management
      of acute fever, persistent fever, and anemia.

    <description>Ambulatory, HIV-infected adult patients with hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL will be evaluated and managed in accordance with Mozambique's new anemia guideline for non-physician clinicians. The basic steps recommended by the guideline are: screen for danger signs and stabilize or admit if indicated; perform rapid malaria antigen test (and/or peripheral blood smear) and treat if indicated; evaluate for adverse drug reactions and manage per Mozambican national guidelines; consider nutritional deficiencies and intestinal parasites; evaluate response to therapy at &lt;=1 month.</description>

    <description>Ambulatory, HIV-infected adult patients with measured axillary temperature &gt;=37.5 C or history of fever within the past 24 hours will be evaluated and managed in accordance with Mozambique's new fever guideline for non-physician clinicians. The basic steps of the fever guideline are: screen for danger signs and stabilize or admit if indicated; perform rapid malaria antigen test (and/or peripheral smear) and treat if indicated; treat any other cause of fever identified through history and physical examination; re-evaluate at next scheduled clinical visit (sooner if worse or if not improving within 48 hours of initiating treatment). Although blood cultures are seldom performed in Mozambican health centers, venipuncture specimens will also be cultured for bacterial pathogens at the first study visit.</description>

        The study population will consist of HIV-infected adult Mozambicans (age 18 years or over)
        who receive ambulatory care at the Centro de Saúde (Health Center) of the 3 participating
        health districts (Inhassunge, Namacurra and Maganja da Costa) in Zambézia Province. All 3
        health centers have been providing ART for more than three years.
