    <textblock>
      This study is being done to understand the effects of dietary omega-3 fats on insulin
      sensitivity in adult men and women.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), which include eicosapentaenoic acid
      (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from fish oil, prevent insulin resistance in rodents,
      but data in humans is ambiguous. No existing studies have systematically evaluated the
      influence of n-3 PUFAs on insulin sensitivity and beta cell function in insulin resistant,
      non-diabetic humans. The Investigators hypothesize that 6 months of oral supplementation of
      purified EPA/DHA (3.9g/day) will significantly improve hepatic and peripheral insulin
      sensitivity and beta cell responsiveness in insulin-resistant, non-diabetic individuals.
      Based on recent work in mice, the investigators also hypothesize that EPA/DHA will increase
      the content and function of mitochondria in skeletal muscle, measured using a combination of
      in vivo and in vitro methods. Overall, the investigators hypothesize that EPA+DHA
      supplementation will improve hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant
      humans, and this improvement will be associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and attenuated
      lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle and liver.

      A sub-study was added in which participants receiving dietary omega-3 fatty acids or placebo
      supplements underwent abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies to measure the content
      of total, pro- (M1) and anti- (M2) inflammatory macrophages (immunohistochemistry),
      crown-like structures (immunohistochemistry), and senescent cells (β-galactosidase staining),
      as well as a two-step euglycemic, pancreatic clamp with a stable-isotope labeled precursor
      ((U-13C)palmitate) infusion to determine the insulin concentration needed to suppress
      palmitate flux by 50% (IC50(palmitate)f).

    <measure>Insulin Sensitivity by Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic Clamp at Baseline and 6 Month Follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 6 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A 2-stage insulin clamp will be performed with titration of dextrose to maintain euglycemia. D2 glucose will be infused to evaluate hepatic glucose production at baseline and in response to insulin. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique: The plasma insulin concentration is acutely raised and maintained by a continuous infusion of insulin. Meanwhile, the plasma glucose concentration is held constant at basal levels by a variable glucose infusion. When the steady-state is achieved, the glucose infusion rate (GIR) equals glucose uptake by all the tissues in the body and is therefore a measure of tissue insulin sensitivity.</description>

    <measure>Beta Cell Function From Insulin Secretion Following Ingestion of a Mixed Meal at Baseline and 6 Month Follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after 6 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Following consumption of a mixed meal, beta cell function will be evaluated from serial measurements of C-peptide. C-peptide was measured using a two-side immunometric assay using electrochemiluminescence detection.</description>

    <time_frame>approximately after 6 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity of adipose tissue lipolysis to insulin suppression, was calculated as the insulin concentration needed to suppress palmitate appearance rates (ie, flux) by 50% (IC50(palmitate)f).</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immunohistochemistry Assessments of Macrophage Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately after 6 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>One week after the pancreatic clamp study, participants were provided a standardized meal before an overnight fast. The next morning an abdominal adipose tissue biopsy was collected, and the samples were analyzed for adipocyte size. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess macrophage burden (total (CD68), M1 (CD14) and M2 (CD206) macrophages per 100 adipocytes).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Macrophage Crown-like Structures</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately after 6 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Macrophages surrounding dying or dead adipocytes form crown-like structures (CLSs). One week after the pancreatic clamp study, participants were provided a standardized meal before an overnight fast. The next morning an abdominal adipose tissue biopsy was collected, and the samples were analyzed for adipocyte size. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the number of crown-like structures per 10 images.</description>

        <title>Insulin Sensitivity by Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic Clamp at Baseline and 6 Month Follow up</title>
        <description>A 2-stage insulin clamp will be performed with titration of dextrose to maintain euglycemia. D2 glucose will be infused to evaluate hepatic glucose production at baseline and in response to insulin. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique: The plasma insulin concentration is acutely raised and maintained by a continuous infusion of insulin. Meanwhile, the plasma glucose concentration is held constant at basal levels by a variable glucose infusion. When the steady-state is achieved, the glucose infusion rate (GIR) equals glucose uptake by all the tissues in the body and is therefore a measure of tissue insulin sensitivity.</description>
