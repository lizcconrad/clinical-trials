  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to find out whether the bioavailability of PT Dexa Medica's
      formulation of 4 mg perindopril tert-butylamine tablets was equivalent to that of the
      innovator's product (Prexum® 4 mg, Servier).

    <textblock>
      The participating subjects were required to have an overnight fast and in the next morning
      were given orally one tablet of the test drug (Perindopril 4 mg tablets of PT Dexa Medica) or
      one tablet of the reference drug (Prexum® 4 mg, Servier).

      Blood samples were drawn immediately before taking the drug (control), and at 20, 40 minutes,
      and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 96, 144, 192 hours after drug administration.

      Three weeks after the first drug administration (washout period), the procedure was repeated
      using the alternate drug.

      The pharmacokinetic parameters, including AUCt, AUCinf, Cmax, t max, and t1/2, were
      determined based on the concentrations of the perindopril parent compound and the metabolite
      perindoprilat, using high-performance liquid chromatography method with tandem mass
      spectrometry detector (LC-MS/MS).
