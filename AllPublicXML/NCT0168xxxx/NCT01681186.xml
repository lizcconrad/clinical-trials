    <textblock>
      This study involves 2 parts, Part A and Part B. The purpose of Part A is to evaluate the
      safety and side effects of LY2940680 in healthy people. Part A will involve two groups of
      participants, each taking up to two single doses of LY2940680 at different dose levels. There
      is a minimum 14 day washout period between each of the participant's doses. The purpose of
      Part B is to study how much of the study drug, in capsule or tablet form, gets into the
      bloodstream and how long the body takes to get rid of it. In addition, the effect of food and
      a proton pump inhibitor on LY2940680 will be studied. Part B will involve one group of
      participants who will take four single doses of 100 mg LY2940680. There is a minimum 7 day
      washout period between doses. Participants may only enroll in one part. Screening is required
      within 28 days prior to the start of the study.
