  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research work has directed especial attention toward a distinct group of uremic
      retension molecules, called &quot;protein-bound uremic toxins&quot;. The prototypes of this group of
      uremic toxins are indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol. These uremic toxins can promote production of
      free radical and impair antioxidant system and exerts direct toxicity on different cells and
      organs, including mesangial, tubular, endothelial cell and osteoblasts. Accumulation of these
      protein bound uremic toxins results in glomerular sclerosis and interstitial fibrosis of
      kidneys of uremic rats and confer skeletal resistance to parthyroid hormone in uremic
      patients. In hemodialysis, high serum p-cresol level is associated with higher cardiovascular
      mortality.

      AST-120 (Kremezin) is a carbonated oral absorbent extensively used in Japan and Korea. It has
      superior adsorption ability for certain small-molecular weight organic compounds known to
      accumulate in patients with CKD. In uremic rats and CKD patients, oral administration of
      AST-120 decreased the elevated pretreatment levels of serum indoxyl sulfate. In Japan, it was
      reported that AST-120 suppressed the increase in serum creatinine levels, prevented
      proteinuria, improved uremic symptoms, and, consequently, led to the postponement of dialysis
      therapy.

      Value of AST-120 on the outcome of late-stage CKD patients is still unknown. We hypothesized
      AST-120 through reduction of level of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol can improved the
      morbidity- mortality of CKD patients.

      The principal aim of this prospective cohort study is to investigate the effectiveness of
      AST-120 in incidence of dialysis and mortality of late-stage CKD patients. Determination of
      this relationship can help to establish new therapeutic strategy in the treatment of
      late-stage CKD patients.
