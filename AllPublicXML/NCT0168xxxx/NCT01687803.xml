  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to determine the health benefits associated with the 2005
      Dietary Guidelines physical activity prescription in healthy, peri-menopausal women. The 2005
      Dietary Guidelines specifically state that to avoid unhealthy weight gain, adults should
      participate in 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity on most days of
      the week.

      This study will be a randomized controlled trial conducted over a 6 to 7 month period.
      Subjects will be enrolled by cohorts and randomly assigned to one of two groups.

        -  Group 1 (PA): physical activity intervention that will consist of brisk walking or other
           aerobic-type activities (6 days per week), resistance exercise (using free weights,
           resistance bands or weight stacks for weight lifting, 3 days per week), and 'active
           lifestyle' activities such as gardening, dancing, participation in sporting activities.
           The total time spent in these activities will add up to ~60 min/day for 6 days/week
           (~360 minutes per week).

        -  Group 2 (CON): control group will maintain their usual level of physical activity and
           participate in testing protocols, record keeping, and interviews on the same schedule as
           PA. This group will be offered an opportunity to have a gym membership/access to the
           training facility after completion of the 6-month period of serving as controls.

      The specific aims of this pilot study are to:

        -  Assess each participant's level of compliance/adherence

        -  Assess the dietary habits of study participants as they become more physically active.

        -  Identify barriers to physical activity in this specific population.

        -  Measure changes in body composition, physical fitness and energy expenditure.

        -  Evaluate changes in chronic disease risk factors.

        -  Determine if regular physical activity reduces chronic stress.

    <description>The Actiheart (MiniMitter, Bend OR) physical activity and heart rate logger is a motion sensor and heart rate monitor worn by subjects 24 hours per day(excluding bathing and swimming) for one week to determine the level of physical activity. Subjects will also use a pedometer to record the number of steps taken during their walking sessions. The Stanford 7 day Physical Activity recall questionnaire will also be used to assess physical activity.</description>

    <time_frame>0, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 24-hour dietary recall will be used to assess usual dietary intake. Four recalls will be collected on non-consecutive days during the first and sixth months of the study. Additionally, the Healthy Eating Index for diet quality will be used to score the diets of subjects.</description>

    <measure>Change in Chronic Disease Risk Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Chronic Disease Risk Assessment includes blood pressure, fasting blood cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triacylglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, ApoAI, ApoAII, and ApoB, glucose, insulin. Insulin sensitivity will be assessed by the homeostatic model utilizing fasting insulin and glucose values (fasting plasma insulin (mU/ml) X fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)/22.5). High sensitivity C-Reactive Protein, inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-Î±, Oxylipins and other markers of oxidative stress such as oxygen radical absorptive capacity will be analyzed in plasma samples.</description>

    <time_frame>0, 3, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal aerobic capacity is measured using a walking graded treadmill test. Indirect calorimetry will be used to measure oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production continuously during the exercise test.</description>

    <time_frame>0, 3, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Peak strength and muscle endurance of the musculature of the knee and shoulder will be measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. A measure of the maximum weight that can be moved for a single repetition (1-RM) will be measured.</description>
