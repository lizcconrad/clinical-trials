  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with wet AMD, dry AMD, and age-matched controls will undergo routine occular
      measurements, will provide a blood and cheek cell sample, and will have macular pigment
      optical density (MPOD) measured to determine if there is an association between genetics,
      MPOD and the risk of progression to wet AMD.
