      Open-label, single-center, single-treatment group, baseline-controlled (for safety) study of
      the safety and biodistribution of Technetium Tc 99m EC20 in four normal subjects and four
      subjects with known or suspected ovarian cancer.

      This was a single-center, open-label evaluation of a single injection of Tc 99m EC20
      containing 0.1 mg EC20 labeled with 15 - 20 mCi of technetium-99m in normal volunteers and
      patients with known or suspected ovarian cancer. Two normal volunteers and two patients also
      were to receive an injection of 0.25 - 2.0 mg folic acid 1 to 2 minutes prior to the
      injection of Tc 99m EC20. Serial blood samples and urine were collected during the 24-hour
      period following each injection for pharmacokinetic evaluation. Serial whole body images were
      acquired during the 24-hour postdose period for dosimetry evaluations. Safety was monitored
      through predose and postdose physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs
      and clinical laboratory evaluations. Adverse events were monitored from the time of signing
      of Informed Consent to 24 hours postdose.

    <description>The study was designed as a single-center, open-label clinical study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, dosimetry and metabolism of Tc 99m EC20 in normal volunteers and in patients with known or suspected ovarian cancer.
Eight subjects were to be enrolled at one center: four normal subjects, four patients with ovarian cancer. Each subject was to receive a single injection of Tc 99m EC20 complex composed of 0.1 mg ligand (EC20) and 15 - 20 mCi of Tc 99m. Two (2) of the 4 normal subjects and 2 of the 4 patients were to receive an injection of 0.25-2.0 mg folic acid 1-2 minutes prior to the injection of Tc 99m EC20.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects were to be females 18 years of age or older who met the following
             criteria:

               1. The four normal subjects were to be normal, as established by medical history,
                  physical examination, and laboratory data, including CBC, serum chemistry, and
                  urinalysis.

               2. The two subjects with obvious advanced stage ovarian cancer were to have either
                  histopathologically proven stage 3 or 4 disease or clinically obvious disease
                  defined by 2 of the following 3 conditions: (1) pelvic mass (2) omental &quot;caking&quot;,
                  or (3) ascites.

               3. Subjects were to have newly diagnosed, treatment refractory, or recurrent
                  disease. Subjects were to be treatment na√Øve or at least 2 months since last
                  non-surgical treatment. Subjects were to have normal kidney and liver function.

               4. The two subjects with suspected ovarian cancer were to have a known mass.
                  Subjects were to have normal kidney and liver function.

               5. Subjects were to provide informed consent prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The following subjects were to be excluded:

               1. Subject was pregnant or breast-feeding.

               2. Subject was simultaneously participating in another investigative drug or device
                  study, or had completed follow-up phase of any previous study within 30 days
                  prior to enrollment in this study.

               3. Subject had a known history of chronic abuse of drugs or alcohol or had tested
                  positive in the pre-study urine drug abuse screen.

               4. Subject was currently taking folic acid supplements and could not stop taking the
                  supplements for a period of 3 days (2 days prior to the study and one day after
                  last imaging procedure).

               5. Subject had physical condition that was unsuitable for radionuclide imaging.

               6. Subject had been administered another radiopharmaceutical that would interfere
                  with the assessment of the biodistribution of Technetium Tc 99m EC20.
