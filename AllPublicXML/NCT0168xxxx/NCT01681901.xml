      This pilot clinical trial studies ultrasound in detecting lymph node metastasis in older
      patients with undergoing breast sonography. Diagnostic procedures, such as ultrasound, may
      help find breast cancer and find out how far the disease has spread

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop a reliable and consistent set of guidelines for utilizing diagnostic ultrasound
      to assess axillary lymph nodes for patient suspicious of breast cancer with possible nodal
      metastasis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether the data collected can be used for pathologic validation of metastatic
      disease.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo breast ultrasound.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of successful evaluations, defined as the consistent capture of the data for geometry, morphology, qualitative vascular information, and quantitative vascular information on 3 axillary lymph nodes</measure>
    <time_frame>at 15 minutes following breast sonogram</time_frame>
    <description>The proposed methodology will be considered unfeasible if the proportion of successful evaluations is =&lt; 0.7.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Accuracy of lymph node geometry, measured with a longitudinal and transverse ratio, to determine guidelines for characterizing micro metastases to the lymph nodes</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics, such as means, proportions and standard deviations, will be summarized. The longitudinal-transverse ratio will be investigated for cutoff points that yield high sensitivity and to see if results are consistent with prior studies suggesting a ratio of 1.5 or less is indicative of abnormality. The percent agreement between the resulting diagnostic criteria and the surgical/pathological results will be assessed.</description>
