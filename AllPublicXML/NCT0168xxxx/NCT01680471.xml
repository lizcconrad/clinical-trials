  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sevoflurane with its rapid induction and emergence, hemodynamic stability, and nonirritating
      airway properties, has acquired widespread acceptance in children. However, sevoflurane has
      been reported to be associated with emergence agitation in children, with a reported
      incidence of up to 80%.

      The purpose of this study is to verify that the prophylactic use of midazolam, which is a
      GABA A receptor inhibitor, given five minutes before the end of strabismus surgery reduces
      the incidence of emergence agitation after sevoflurane anesthesia in children.
      Simultaneously, this study aims to find out the proper dose of midazolam with minimum
      disturbance to patient's emergence time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sevoflurane is associated with a high incidence of emergence agitation in children. The
      etiology of emergence agitation is unclear. Some studies proposed that emergence agitation
      was related to a variable rate of neurologic recovery rate in different brain areas and
      immaturity of neurons. Inhalation anesthetics have been known to exert transient paradoxical
      excitatory effects in both animals and human patients, especially in children. The
      gamma(γ)-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor is the target depressant effect site of most
      anesthetic drugs including sevoflurane. Midazolam acts on the benzodiazepine binding site of
      GABAA receptors and results in inhibitory effects on the central nervous system. The effect
      of midazolam premedication, as well as midazolam administration at the end of surgery, on
      suppressing emergence agitation has been studied. However, the effect of midazolam on
      emergence agitation is still controversial. This study aims to figure out the effect of
      midazolam at the end of surgery on emergence agitation during the recovery period, and find
      out the proper dose of midazolam with minimum disturbance to patient's emergence time.
