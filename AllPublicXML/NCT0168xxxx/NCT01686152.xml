    <textblock>
      To determine the comparability of the safety and efficacy of Imiquimod Cream, 3.75% and
      Zyclara (imiquimod) Cream, 3.75% (the reference listed drug) in subjects with actinic
      keratosis (AK) of the face or balding scalp. It will also be determined whether the efficacy
      of each of the two active treatments is superior to that of the Vehicle cream.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent for the study

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Immunocompetent male or non-pregnant and non-lactating female. Each female subject of
             childbearing potential (excluding women who are surgically sterilized or
             postmenopausal for at least 2 years), in addition to having a negative urine pregnancy
             test at Visit 1/Day 1, must be willing to use an acceptable form of birth control
             during the study. For the purpose of this study, the following are considered
             acceptable methods of birth control: oral contraceptives, contraceptive patches,
             contraceptive implant, vaginal contraceptive, double-barrier methods (for example,
             condom and spermicide), contraceptive injection (Depo-Provera®), intrauterine device
             (IUD), hormonal IUD (Mirena®), and abstinence with a documented second acceptable
             method of birth control if the subject becomes sexually active. Subjects entering the
             study who are on hormonal contraceptives (oral contraceptives, patches and injection)
             must have been on this method for at least 3 months (90 days) prior to the study and
             continue the method for the duration of the study. Subjects who had used hormonal
             contraception (oral contraceptives, patches and injection) and stopped must have
             stopped no less than 3 months (90 days) prior to baseline. Subjects entering the study
             using contraceptive implants and intrauterine contraceptives must have been on this
             method for at least 6 months (180 days) and continue for the duration of the study and
             if they stopped must have stopped no less than 6 months (180 days) prior to baseline.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of AK, defined as ≥ 5 and ≤ 20 clinically typical, visible or

             either the face (excluding ears) or balding scalp, but not both face and scalp.

          -  In general good health and free from any clinically significant disease, other than
             AK, that might interfere with the study evaluations.

             treatment area of either the face or balding scalp.

          -  Clinically significant systemic disease (immunological deficiencies), unstable medical
             disorder, life-threatening disease, or current malignancies.

          -  Use on the face or balding scalp of chemical peel, dermabrasion, laser abrasion,
             psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy, and/or ultraviolet B (UVB) therapy in the
