      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of standard for our
      practice postoperative physical therapy (PT) program to a PT program that incorporates lower
      body positive pressure (LBPP) treadmill training for the patients after lumbar discectomy and
      fusion surgeries.

      A prospective, randomized, parallel group controlled clinical study is proposed. The patients
      will be divided into the two study groups according to the surgical procedure:

        1. patients undergoing one-level microdiscectomy for lumbar herniated disc

        2. patients undergoing one-level lumbar fusion for degenerative disc disease without
           notable spinal stenosis.

      Each group will consist of 60 patients (see sample size calculations below) who will be
      randomized into the two equal groups to undergo:

        1. Standard postoperative rehabilitation program

        2. Standard postoperative rehabilitation program with addition of lower body positive
           pressure (LBPP) treadmill training

    <description>All patients will begin an early postoperative rehabilitation program and standard PT no later than 4 weeks following surgery and continue for at least 6 weeks. The duration of standard PT program could be extended depending on the patient needs. The patients randomized to undergo (LBPP) treadmill training will have an additional 7-week 3 times a week training on the antigravity</description>
