  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Smoking cessation can largely improve cancer prognosis and quality of life among
      cancer patients. However, few patients are aware of the importance to quit at the stage, or
      they have difficulties to quit by self.

      Aim: to examine the effectiveness of a smoking cessation intervention using a risk
      communication approach

      Design: A randomized controlled trial

      Setting: Outpatient clinics of the Clinical Oncology Departments of five major hospitals in
      different regions of Hong Kong

      Subject: Smokers who attend medical follow-up visits at outpatient clinics of the Clinical
      Oncology Departments of five major hospitals in different regions of Hong Kong and who met
      the inclusion criteria were invited to participate.

      Intervention: At baseline, intervention group receives:

        1. a face-to-face individualized brief advice based on risk communication for 15-30 minutes
           from the nurse counselors;

        2. examination of exhale CO level; and

        3. a generic standard self-help smoking cessation booklet. They will receive a booster
           intervention at 1 week. Control group will receive standard care and a generic self-help
           smoking cessation booklet.

      Outcome: Primary outcome is the self-reported 7-day point prevalence quit rate at 6-month
      follow up. Secondary outcomes include:

        1. self-reported 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence at 12-month follow-up;

        2. biochemically validated quit rate at 6-month follow-up; and

        3. percentage of patients reduced smoking by at least 50% at 6- and 12-month follow-up
           compared to baseline.

      Significance: This study develops and validates practical smoking cessation interventions
      targeted to cancer patients to improve their cancer prognosis and in long-term.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking causes many types of cancer in general. Past studies have shown that current smokers
      have increased risk of cancer, and most lung cancers are attributable to smoking. Cancer
      (malignant neoplasm) is the number one killer in Hong Kong, which leads to nearly one-third
      of all deaths each year. Cancer patients who continue smoking would result in extra risks of
      all cause mortality, cancer recurrence and second primary cancer as well as reducing survival
      time (Chen et al., 2010). Smoking could also reduce the efficacy of clinical and medical
      treatment of cancer including radio- and chemo-therapies (Benninger et al., 1994; Browman et
      al., 1993) and increase the risk of treatment related side-effects (Rugg et al., 1990).

      Cancer patients may present an excellent &quot;teachable moment&quot; for smoking cessation
      interventions, as their current illness could largely be due to smoking. However, few smoking
      cessation programs target on this vulnerable group and only one-third of oncology nurses
      would assist cancer patients quit smoking. Healthcare professionals have the responsibility
      to assist this vulnerable group to quit smoking. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCT)
      suggested behavioral intervention may help cancer patients quit smoking, but they are limited
      by small sample size. No RCT study has ever been done in Hong Kong.

      This study can make an important contribution to evidence-based practice by testing the
      effectiveness of a smoking cessation intervention using a risk communication approach and
      targeting cancer patients. The results primarily serve the purpose to support the development
      of clinical practice guidelines and interventions to promote smoking cessation in cancer
      patients to improve their cancer prognosis and, in the long-run, increase their survival time
      and quality of life.
