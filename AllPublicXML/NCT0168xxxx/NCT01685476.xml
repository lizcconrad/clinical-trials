  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In clinical practice, intracranial pressure (ICP) represents a key parameter for diagnosing
      and treating several conditions. Physicians having to manage cases of head trauma, stroke and
      hydrocephalus need to assess the time course of ICP, yet they are often unwilling to
      implement invasive monitoring beyond the acute stage, on account of high septic risks.
      Standard techniques include direct ventricular manometry or measurement in the parenchyma
      with electronic or fiberoptic devices. Therefore, the design of non-invasive clinical methods
      for gaining access to pressure changes is an important challenge. Fluctuations of ICP are
      transmitted to the fluid spaces of the inner ear through the cochlear aqueduct. The
      Biophysics Laboratory (School of Medicine of Clermont-Ferrand) described that the
      intra-labyrinthic pressure modify the functional activities of the outer hair cells in the
      cochlea. Thereby, increases in ICP are transferred to increases in intra-cochlear pressure,
      which is detected as modifications in cochlear activities. Cochlear activities' recording are
      non-invasive and technically simple. A probe is gently inserted into the outer portion of the
      external ear canal.

      The objective of this study is to assess prospectively the accuracy and the precision of a
      new method for ICP monitoring (using cochlear activities) compared with invasive gold
      standard CSF pressure monitoring.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the evolution of the electrophysiological cochlear
      activity (cochlear microphonic potential, CMP), with a non invasive method, during invasive
      ICP monitoring. The data analysis will determine relationship between ICP variations and CMP
      variations.

      Continuous ICP monitoring has an important place in neuro-intensive care. ICP may be measured
      either within the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid or within the brain parenchyma.

      The purpose of this study is to assess prospectively the accuracy and the precision of a new
      method for indirect ICP monitoring (using electrophysiological cochlear activity) compared
      with an invasive gold standard ICP monitoring. The data analysis will determine relationship
      between ICP variations and CMP variations.

      Electrophysiological cochlear activities, so called electrocochleography (ECochG), are a non
      invasive and totally passive method used in routine in ENT department. The response measured
      in ECochG is the cochlear microphonic potential (CMP), generated by the outer hair cells
      following by presenting tone burst at 1kHz. CMP is recorded with the help of an Echodia®
      hand-held equipment.

      Technically, a simple, non-invasive detection of ICP changes and ICP monitoring can be
      afforded by CMP recordings.
