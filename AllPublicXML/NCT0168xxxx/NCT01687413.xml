  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the intensity of adjuvant (&quot;helper&quot;) therapy required in p16
      positive oropharynx cancer patients, who have had all known disease removed surgically by a
      minimally invasive approach, and who have extracapsular spread in their lymph nodes. Patients
      can consent to participate in either the randomized (physician chooses radiotherapy arm or
      radiotherapy &amp; cisplatin arm) or non-randomized (patient chooses radiotherapy arm or
      radiotherapy &amp; cisplatin arm) pathways. After the surgery, receive either radiation alone, or
      radiation and weekly cis-platinum during therapy. Patients are then followed for cancer,
      functional and quality of life outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have histologically confirmed p16 positive squamous cell carcinoma of the
             oropharynx (OPSCC).

          -  Patient must have undergone transoral resection of their T1-4a oropharynx primary to a
             negative margin, and a neck dissection(s).

          -  Patient's disease must be pathological N-stage positive.

          -  Patient's disease must show extracapsular spread (ECS) in their nodal metastasis

          -  Patients with synchronous primaries are included.

          -  Patients with unknown primaries are included if the diagnosis and resection of a
             primary site in the oropharynx is made from an endoscopic or robotic surgical
             procedure(s).

          -  Patients with recent excisional node biopsies/neck dissections are included if
             material is evaluable for extracapsular spread.

          -  Patient must be ≥ 21 years of age.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥60%).

             sequelae or myocardial infarction/ unstable angina within the preceding 3 months or
