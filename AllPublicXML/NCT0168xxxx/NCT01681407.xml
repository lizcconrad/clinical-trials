  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study of mapping the peripheral plasma micro-RNA and proteomics patterns in
      depressive patients, treated with SSRI medications. It is an observational clinical
      bio-markers laboratory controlled research with no device.

      The research includes two groups; one for patients diagnosed of having depression, and will
      get a standard SSRI medication regimen. Second group is for control subjects without
      depression. An option for a third group is planned to include first degree relatives of the
      depressed patients. After giving their informed consents, subjects and patients will go
      through standard clinical psychiatric interview, and routine clinical lab tests. Clinical
      standard, specific depression and anxiety questionnaires will be held at four follow-up
      meetings: at start; after 2 weeks; 4 weeks; and 10 weeks. Subjects and patients will be asked
      to give blood samples at these points of time for the lab processing: Complete plasma
      proteomics and specific micro-RNA levels.
