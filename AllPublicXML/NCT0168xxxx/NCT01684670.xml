      This research study is designed to investigate the feasibility and treatment effects of a
      behavioral speech treatment in adults and children with Down Syndrome (DS) and dysarthria.
      The speech sessions will provide an intensive, articulation-based intervention focused on
      increasing effort during speech production via use of &quot;clear speech.&quot; A single subject
      multiple baselines across subjects design will be employed in a total of six subjects divided
      into two groups of three. Changes in dependent measures will be determined by visual
      inspection, effect size determination, and time series analysis. The study follows accepted
      procedures in rehabilitation treatment and research and there are minimal foreseeable risks
      associated with participation.
