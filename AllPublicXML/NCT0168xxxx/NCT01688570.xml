      While baseline weakness is clearly an important factor that contributes to disability post
      stroke, neuromuscular fatigue (the acute reduction in force production) of the paretic
      musculature likely compounds strength deficits and further exacerbates disability. The
      proposed study aims to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of neuromuscular fatigue
      in people post stroke in order to optimize strength training. In healthy individuals, both
      central (neural) and peripheral (muscle) factors are determinants of neuromuscular fatigue,
      but preliminary data from our laboratory suggests a greater contribution of central
      components to neuromuscular fatigue in the paretic musculature. Although cortical pathways
      are clearly disrupted post stroke, it is likely that brainstem pathways, known to have
      neuromodulatory effects on spinal motor circuitry, are more involved in the sustaining of
      force in the paretic leg, compared to the non-paretic and control legs. Therefore, the
      purpose of this proposal is to examine the role of descending neuromodulatory pathways of the
      brainstem in neuromuscular fatigue post stroke (Aim 1) and to correlate brainstem-related
      changes in neuromuscular fatigue to walking function (Aim 2). The investigators propose that
      stroke survivors' decreased capability to sustain force overtime results from the diminished
      ability of spinal motoneurons to respond to brainstem neuromodulatory inputs (serotonin
      (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE)). Aim 1 will quantify stroke-related decreases in motor output
      sensitivity to a 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), serotonin antagonist, or placebo
      during sub-maximal intermittent fatiguing knee extension contractions. If motoneurons are
      desensitized to descending monoamines in chronic stroke patients, then they will be less
      sensitive to the effects of drugs that increase monoamine levels. The investigators predict
      that in response to the SNRI or serotonin antagonist, the paretic leg will show less change
      in time to task failure and a smaller reduction in strength as compared to the non-paretic
      and control legs. For Aim 2, the investigators predict that stroke subjects with the highest
      walking function will demonstrate the greatest fatigue-related changes in response to the
      SNRI. This proposal adopts an innovative model of motor impairment post stroke by including
      the role of subcortical structures in neuromuscular fatigue.
