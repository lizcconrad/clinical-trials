  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the hormonal/metabolic reponse to ingestion of sugar
      compared to consuming artificial sweetened drink, and to evalute macronutrient consumption 24
      hours post ingestion of the drinks.

      We hypothesize that artificially sweetened (AS) consumption will lead to a relatively similar
      hormonal/metabolic responses as glucose consumption and therefore to secondary rise of
      caloric intake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last two decades, the prevalence of overweight and obesity doubled. at the same
      time, individuals have increasingly turned to artificially sweetened (AS) foods and beverages
      in an attempt to lose weight, or control it.

      several studies have found that there may be a connection between artificially sweetened food
      and beverages consumption and paradoxical weight gain and increased incidence of metabolic
      syndrome. the causal relationship between AS use and weight gain haven't been proven yet.

      The participants will be invited to 2 meetings in which they will consume, in a randomized
      double blind way:

        1. A beverage containing 75 gram glucose

        2. A beverage containing 0.42 gram artificially sweetener (Aspartame, similar sweetness
           level)

      During each meeting, the participants will drink the sweetened drink followed by blood work,
      as done in oral glucose challenge or tolerance test (OGTT / GTT).

      Also, they will record their macronutrient\caloric consumption during the 24 hour following
      the test.
