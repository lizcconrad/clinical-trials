  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide a novel fertility preservation option for patients facing a fertility threatening
      cancer diagnosis or treatment regimen by establishing an ovarian tissue cryopreservation
      program. To determine if ovarian tissue cryopreservation provides women with a useful,
      successful option for fertility preservation

      The hypothesis is that ovarian tissue cryopreservation for fertility preservation provides an
      alternative option for fertility preservation.
