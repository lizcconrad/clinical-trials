  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to estimate the clinical and cost impact of RV vaccinations (both Rotateq®
      and Rotarix®) among children aged less than 5 years using insurance claims data from
      commercial plans and Medicaid low-income population. The impact of incomplete and complete RV
      vaccination will also be examined, overall and stratified by age (e.g., 6 weeks to 8 months,
      8 months and onwards ) and calendar time of RV vaccination (e.g., 2006 onward).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insurance claims data from the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database
      {MarketScan Commercial (2000-2011[Q2])} and the MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Database
      {Marketscan Medicaid (2002-2010)} will be analyzed separately; no merging of the databases
      will occur.

      The claims data extracts are fully de-identified and compliant with the Health Insurance
      Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (U.S.) (HIPAA).

      For children who received at least 1 RV vaccine dose within the Advisory Committee on
      Immunization Practices (ACIP)-specified vaccination window of 6 weeks to 8 months old, their
      observation time will be divided into three RV-vaccinated cohorts: any RV vaccination before
      8 months (i.e., during the vaccination window between 6 weeks and 8 months old); complete RV
      vaccination (i.e., after 8 months old); and incomplete RV vaccination (i.e., after 8 months
      old). For children who did not receive any RV vaccine dose within the vaccination window,
      their observation time will be divided into four control cohorts: historical (i.e., before RV
      vaccines were available) unvaccinated on/before 8 months old; contemporary (i.e., after RV
      vaccines were available) unvaccinated on/before 8 months old; historical unvaccinated after 8
      months old; and contemporary unvaccinated after 8 months old.

    <measure>Estimation of the clinical impact of complete and incomplete RV vaccination among children less than 5 years of age by determining the incidence of first RV episode.</measure>
    <time_frame>During the study period (from January 2000 up to June 2011), an expected average of 1 year and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Each RV episode will last from 14 days before the first RV-coded claim to 14 days after the last RV-coded claim, unless censored by birth at the start and/or by end of observation at the end. For each cohort, incidence rates will be calculated as the number of first RV episodes that occurred divided by the cohort's person-years of observation censored at the start of first RV episodes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Continuously enrolled from birth. (Note: Due to the absence of birth dates in
             insurance claims data, this inclusion criterion will be met if a child's year of first
             enrollment and year of birth are the same. If so, then the date of first enrollment
             will be used as proxy for date of birth.)

          -  Received both medical and pharmacy benefits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Enrolled in capitation-based health plans.

          -  For MarketScan Commercial, residence in states with universal vaccination programs
             that include the RV vaccine or where RV vaccine inclusion cannot be ascertained (i.e.,
             Alaska, Idaho, Massachusetts, Maine, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oregon,
             Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming).
