  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether AMG 334 is safe and well tolerated
      in healthy subjects and migraine patients. As part of the secondary objectives, this study
      will be conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of AMG 334 after single
      SC or IV doses in healthy subjects and migraine patients as well as to characterize the
      effect of AMG 334 on the capsaicin-induced increase in dermal blood flow after single SC or
      IV doses in healthy subjects and migraine patients.

      In this single-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential dose escalation study, a
      total of approximately 68 subjects will be randomized into 8 cohorts. Approximately 48
      healthy subjects will be randomized into 6 cohorts: (5 SC cohorts and 1 IV cohort). A total
      of 12 migraine patients will be enrolled into cohort 7 and an additional 8 migraine patients
      may be enrolled into the optional Cohort 8.
