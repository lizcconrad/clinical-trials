  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent decades have shown an alarming increase in obesity. Obesity is associated with high
      costs for both the individual and for society. It is therefore important to prevent and treat
      obesity. The investigators believe that if you add a self-help weightloss book and teach
      cooking skills to a standard dietary treatment, then it will result in greater weight loss
      than with dietary treatment alone. However, this has not yet been studied. Since it will
      require more resources, it is important to investigate whether it also works better before
      changing the current treatment.

      Hypothesis: Conventional dietary treatment supplemented with a self-help weightloss book and
      cooking classes are more effective than dietary treatment alone in changes in body weight and
      body composition in obese persons over a period of 12 months. There is no difference if the
      intervention are based on the national dietary guidelines or a relative low-gi and
      high-protein diet.

      Secondary to investigate the impact the interventions have; on diet quality and quantity, on
      markers of metabolic syndrome and on how many subjects complete the study.
