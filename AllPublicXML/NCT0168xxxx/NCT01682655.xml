  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past decades, obesity in children is much more prevalent in the world. Given the
      increasing prevalence of pediatric obesity worldwide, fatty liver incidence is on the rise.

      Genetic variant in apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) gene is associated with increased liver fat
      content in adults.

      The aim of this study is to find out whether APOC3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
      influence fatty liver in obese children and adolescent.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess the associations between to investigate the
      association of rs2854117 C &gt; T and rs2854116 T &gt; C SNPs of the APOC3 gene with liver
      steatosis, as measured by liver ultrasound.

      As a secondary aim, the investigators will examine the associations between APOC3 rs2854117 C
      &gt; T and rs2854116 T &gt; C SNPs and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST) levels. In addition, the investigators will further analyze the
      association with other biomarkers, such as body mass index, adiponectin and insulin
      resistance.
