  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical correction of congenital heart defects in children requires the utilization of
      cardiopulmonary bypass, a technique that temporarily substitutes heart and lung functions
      during surgery. During this process the patient´s circulation is controlled by a bypass
      machine which provides several functions:

        1. Controls the patient's blood flow by pumping of blood in the patient's body.

        2. Controls the correct oxygen levels in the patient's blood.

        3. Regulates the temperature and fluid level of the blood. This process triggers negative
           responses in the heart and throughout the whole body, potentially resulting in injury to
           the heart and other organs such as brain, kidneys and lungs.

      Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) describes a procedure that could potentially reduce
      the injury to heart muscle during cardiac surgery. The procedure consists of the inflation of
      a blood pressure cuff on the child's leg for three 5 minute cycles. This process acts by
      briefly reducing blood flow to the leg muscle, which will then activate the body´s own
      protective mechanisms and thereby reduce heart injury.

      Several animal studies have been used to help the understanding of the mechanisms behind this
      process, and trials in human adults have showed optimistic results; however evidence
      regarding the paediatric population is limited and necessary since children present different
      basal profiles, risks and requirements.

      The investigators propose a randomized clinical trial assessing the efficacy of RIPC to
      provide protection against injury to the heart and other organs in children going through
      cardiac surgery using CPB at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The research project will
      have a translational approach, integrating basic molecular mechanisms to clinical outcome.
      The investigators hope it will allow the understanding and utilisation of the patient´s own
      protective mechanisms, reducing CPB-related injury and ultimately improving patient outcome.
