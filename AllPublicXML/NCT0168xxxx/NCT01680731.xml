    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate of the differences in pelvic floor anatomy and
      function in women who have undergone a vacuum assisted vaginal delivery (VAVD) versus a
      forceps assisted vaginal delivery (FAVD) using three-dimensional ultrasound imaging. Women
      within 1-5 years after first delivery who did not have an internal delivery will be included.
      The total number of subjects is forty. This will include ten primiparous subjects who have
      undergone vacuum delivery, ten who have undergone forceps delivery, ten who had spontaneous
      vaginal delivery and ten who have undergone primary elective cesarean section.
