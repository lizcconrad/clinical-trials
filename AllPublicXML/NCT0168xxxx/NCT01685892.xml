  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, open-label, dose-finding study will evaluate the safety and
      pharmacokinetics as well as the preliminary efficacy of venetoclax (GDC-0199; ABT-199)
      administered in combination with obinutuzumab to participants with relapsed/refractory or
      previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The study is comprised of two stages
      for each participant population: a dose-finding stage and a safety-expansion stage. The
      dose-finding stage will explore multiple doses of venetoclax to be used in combination with a
      fixed dose of obinutuzumab. The dose-finding stage will also explore two schedules for drug
      administration, Schedule A (venetoclax introduced before obinutuzumab) and Schedule B
      (venetoclax introduced after obinutuzumab).
