  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this proposal is that in subjects with PAD, regular consumption of a high
      nitrate supplement which raises plasma nitrite, in conjunction with 12 weeks of supervised
      exercise training at the limb ischemic threshold (SET) will produce a greater clinical
      benefit (increases in COT and PWT) than placebo plus supervised exercise at the limb ischemic
      threshold (PET).

    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 Weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in Functional Ability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Six-Minute Walk test. This test simple and practical assessment of functional capacity. The test measures the distance that a patient can walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes. The test is self-paced and assesses the submaximal level of functional capacity. The subjects choose their own intensity and are allowed to stop and rest if necessary during the test.</description>

            <description>Subjects consume 70 ml of Beetroot Juice (Beet-It Stamina Shot; Placebo) to assess acute effects of beverage supplementation at the start (between Testing Visits 1 &amp; 2) and at the end of the trial (between Visits 3 &amp; 4). It also allows for comparisons of the combination of placebo beverage and chronic training effects (between Visits 2 &amp; 3) to when the subject has not consumed the beverage (Visits 1 &amp; 4). All subjects will consume Beet-It Stamina Shot (Placebo) 3 hours prior to all beverage tolerance visits, Testing Visits 2 &amp; 3 and for all supervised exercise training visits during the 12 week intervention.
Placebo Comparator Beverage (Beet-It Stamina Shot) &amp; Exercise Training: The beverage is identical in look and taste to Beet-It Stamina Shot but with active ingredient removed. It is also bottled and supplied by James White Drinks. This placebo supplement will be used in conjunction with supervised exercise training.</description>

          <title>BR Juice (Beet-It Stamina Shot) and Exercise Training</title>
          <description>Subjects consume 70 ml of Beetroot Juice (Beet-It Stamina Shot) to assess acute effects of beverage supplementation at the start (between Testing Visits 1 &amp; 2) and at the end of the trial (between Visits 3 &amp; 4). It also allows for comparisons of the combination of beetroot juice and chronic training effects (between Visits 2 &amp; 3) to when the subject has not consumed the beverage (Visits 1 &amp; 4). All subjects will consume Beet-It Stamina Shot 3 hours prior to all beverage tolerance visits, Testing Visits 2 &amp; 3 and for all supervised exercise training visits during the 12 week intervention.
Beetroot Juice (Beet-It Stamina Shot) &amp; Supervised Exercise Training: The beverage is high in inorganic nitrate and bottled and supplied by James White Drinks. This supplement will be used in conjunction with supervised exercise training.</description>

          <title>BR Juice Placebo and Exercise Training</title>
          <description>Subjects consume 70 ml of Beetroot Juice (Beet-It Stamina Shot; Placebo) to assess acute effects of beverage supplementation at the start (between Testing Visits 1 &amp; 2) and at the end of the trial (between Visits 3 &amp; 4). It also allows for comparisons of the combination of placebo beverage and chronic training effects (between Visits 2 &amp; 3) to when the subject has not consumed the beverage (Visits 1 &amp; 4). All subjects will consume Beet-It Stamina Shot (Placebo) 3 hours prior to all beverage tolerance visits, Testing Visits 2 &amp; 3 and for all supervised exercise training visits during the 12 week intervention.
Placebo Comparator Beverage (Beet-It Stamina Shot) &amp; Exercise Training: The beverage is identical in look and taste to Beet-It Stamina Shot but with active ingredient removed. It is also bottled and supplied by James White Drinks. This placebo supplement will be used in conjunction with supervised exercise training.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The largest limitation to the study was the evolving knowledge on conversion rates of oral inorganic nitrate to nitrite. We found a good deal of unexpected inter and intra-subject variation in conversion rates.</limitations_and_caveats>
