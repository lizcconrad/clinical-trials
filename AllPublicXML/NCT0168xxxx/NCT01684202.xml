  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OPC-41061 will be administered to patients with volume overload associated with cancer, first
      by dose-escalation and subsequently for 6 consecutive days at the fixed dose at which urine
      volume is increased to investigate efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic effects, and
      safety and to determine the effective initial and maintenance doses of OPC-41061.
