      The primary objectives of Part 1 are to (1) evaluate three dose levels of liposome
      bupivacaine versus placebo with respect to the magnitude and duration of the analgesic effect
      achieved following single dose injection femoral nerve block with liposome bupivacaine, and
      (2) select a single therapeutic dose of liposome bupivacaine from the three dose levels to be
      tested in Part 2.

      Part 2: The primary objective of Part 2 is to compare the magnitude and duration of the
      analgesic effect of single injection femoral nerve block of a single dose level of liposome
      bupivacaine (selected from Part 1) with placebo (preservative-free normal saline).

      This is a Phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in subjects undergoing primary unilateral total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA) under general or spinal anesthesia. Note: Bupivacaine cannot be used as
      the spinal anesthetic.

      Part 1 During Part 1 of the study, approximately 100 subjects (25 per treatment arm) will be
      randomized to receive a single dose injection femoral nerve block with either one of three
      doses of liposome bupivacaine (67, 133, or 266 mg) or placebo in 20 mL under ultrasound
      guidance. Preservative-free normal saline will be added to the 67 mg and 133 mg doses of
      study drug to achieve a volume of 20 mL.

      Part 2 In Part 2 of the study, approximately 180 subjects (randomized 1:1, resulting in
      approximately 90 liposome bupivacaine subjects and 90 placebo subjects) will receive a single
      dose injection femoral nerve block with the selected dose level of liposome bupivacaine
      (i.e., 67, 133, or 266 mg) or placebo in 20 mL under ultrasound guidance.

          -  Previous participation in a liposome bupivacaine study.

          -  History of, suspected, or known addiction to or abuse of illicit drug(s), prescription
