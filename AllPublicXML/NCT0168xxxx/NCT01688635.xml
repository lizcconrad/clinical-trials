    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      LY2963016 and US-approved Lantus速. The study involves four single injections; two doses of
      LY2963016 and two doses of US-approved Lantus速. The study will have 4 periods. In each
      period, a single injection will be administered before undergoing a euglycemic clamp that
      lasts for 24 hours. There will be at least a 7 day washout between each period. Side effects
      will be documented. Study participation is expected to last up to 14 weeks.

    <measure>Maximum Glucose Infusion Rate (Rmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes predose up to 24 hours postdose in all treatment periods</time_frame>
    <description>Rmax is the maximum infusion rate of glucose administered intravenously needed to maintain target blood glucose level and is used to measure the study drug action over time as measured by the euglycaemic clamp procedure. During the euglycaemic clamp procedure, blood glucose concentrations are held constant after the administration of LY2963016 or US-approved Lantus by adjusting the exogenous glucose infusion rate. Data presented were adjusted by the body weight.</description>

    <measure>Total Amount of Glucose Infused (Gtot) Over the Duration of Clamp Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes predose up to 24 hours postdose in all treatment periods</time_frame>
    <description>Gtot was the total glucose infusion over the clamp duration and was used to measure the study drug action over time as measured by the euglycaemic clamp procedure. During the euglycaemic clamp procedure, blood glucose concentrations were held constant after the administration of LY2963016 or US-approved Lantus by adjusting the exogenous glucose infusion rate.
