  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension in midlife is an independent risk factor of late life cognitive dysfunction or
      dementia. Chronic hypertension cause vascular damage and cerebral ischemia, which ultimately
      gives rise to the cognitive dysfunction or dementia.

      A recent study showed that high visit-to-visit variability in clinic systolic blood pressure
      (BP) was a strong independent predictor of stroke. This finding suggests that high clinic
      systolic BP variability itself as well as chronic hypertension may cause vascular damage and
      cerebral ischemia. Therefore, high clinic SBP variability may be also an independent risk
      factor of cognitive dysfunction or dementia.

      Vascular damage leads to the diminished autoregulatory capacities of cerebral arteries. The
      brain with the reduced autoregulatory capacity may be more vulnerable to BP fluctuation.
      Therefore, high BP variability may be more harmful in patients with damaged vessels (for
      example, in patients with cerebral small vessel disease).

      Previous data about BP variability and cognition revealed very controversial. Some studies
      showed poor cognition in patients with high BP variability, but others did not.

      The previous studies were mostly based on cross-sectional designs, and performed in
      small-sized heterogeneous population for primary prevention. The harmful effect of high BP
      variability may be clearer in the population with damaged vascular bed, such as cerebral
      small vessel disease. The previous studies usually used ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM).
      However, recent data suggested that variability in BP on ABPM may be a weaker predictor of
      vascular events than be visit-to-visit variability in clinic BP.

      The investigators sought to find whether high visit-to-visit variability in clinic BP is
      related with poor cognitive function in patients with cerebral small vessel disease.

      This is a retrospective cohort study.

      We include patients with cerebral small vessel disease, documented on MRI from Jan 2006 to
      Dec 2010, who have been regularly followed up.

      We evaluate the patients' cognitive function after written informed consent.

      We independently review patients' medical record and analyze MRI data. BP variability
      parameters include standard deviation(SD, primary measuring parameter), coefficient of
      variation, successive variation, average real variability (ARV), SD independent of
      mean(SDIM), SV independent of mean(SVIM), and ARV independent of mean (ARVIM). We will adjust
      following confounding variables: age, sex, level of education, vascular risk factors, mean
      SBP and DBP, NIHSS score, and white matter lesion burden on T2-weighted MRI.
