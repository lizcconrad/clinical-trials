  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, taking ipilimumab
      with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone has on the patient and the prostate cancer.
      Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone are drugs that lower testosterone (testosterone
      stimulates prostate cancer growth). Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone is a treatment for
      patients with prostate cancer.

      Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone has not been used together with ipilimumab before. This
      study will test how they work together. Each patient will receive abiraterone acetate,
      prednisone and ipilimumab.

    <description>PSA levels will be assessed every 4 weeks during the Lead in Therapy, every 3 weeks during the Combination Therapy and every 4 weeks during the Maintenance Therapy. Outcomes will be reported both by the percent change in PSA from baseline and Week 21 (or earlier for those who discontinue therapy) and the maximum decline in PSA using a waterfall plot.</description>

    <measure>Measurable disease when present</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Measurable disease in viscera (liver or lung) is defined as per PCWG2 modified RECIST 1.1 as a lesion ≥10 mm in its longest diameter as measured with conventional techniques (ie, CT or MRI). For a lymph node to be considered measurable, the minimum diameter must be ≥20 mm in long axis when assessed by CT scan. All other lesions (or sites of disease) will be considered nonmeasurable disease.</description>

    <measure>Evaluate changes in radionuclide bone scan</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Radionucleotide bone scan outcome should be recorded as either new lesions or no new lesions. On bone scan, progression of bone metastases is defined as the appearance of 2 or more new bone lesions compared to the baseline scan. In the case of the first Week 8 and Week 16 assessment scans a confirmatory scan performed 6 weeks later needs to shows 2 or more additional new lesions (for a total of at least 4 new lesions seen since baseline) for progression to be documented (the date of progression is always the date of the first scan showing the change).</description>

    <description>This multi-institution open label study has a Phase 1 and Phase 2 component. The Phase 1 dose escalation stage is to establish the tolerability of ipilimumab to be used in combination with the standard clinical dose of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in chemotherapy and immunotherapy-naïve patients with progressive metastatic CRPC. Due to the overlapping potential hepatic toxicity between abiraterone and ipilimumab, a Lead in Therapy with abiraterone plus prednisone for 2 cycles will assess for adverse events related to the abiraterone plus prednisone. Patients, who tolerate well the Lead in therapy as defined by Grade 1 or less AEs, will pursue Combination Therapy. Patients with AEs Grade ≥ 2 after Lead in Therapy will be excluded and replaced. The Phase 2 stage will assess efficacy and confirm an acceptable safety profile of the recommended dose.</description>

          -  History of progression of prostate cancer disease while receiving ketoconazole. Prior
             use or participation in a clinical trial of an investigational agent that blocks
             androgen synthesis (eg, abiraterone acetate, TAK-700, TAK-683, TAK-448), chemotherapy,
             or immunological agents (eg, immune modulators, cytokines, vaccines, or
