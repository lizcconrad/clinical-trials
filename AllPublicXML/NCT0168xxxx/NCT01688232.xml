      Medical and Scientific Background: Colorectal cancers (CRC) are the leading cancers in both
      genders. This cancer is of prognostic severity. The prognosis of this cancer has not been
      significantly improved. The treatment of colonic cancer is primarily based on surgery.
      Adjuvant chemotherapy is proposed for metastatic cancers (stages III and IV). However nearly
      30% of patients with localized cancer (stage II) will present a recurrence. Despite intense
      research efforts, no markers of sufficient prognostic value (independent of TNM) are
      available to identify this group of patients and justify intensified therapy. The natural
      history of cancer involves interactions between the tumor and the immune system of the host.
      The immune infiltration at the tumor site may be indicative of host response. We showed that
      the density of intratumor memory T cells (CD45RO) and cytotoxic T cells (CD8) in tumor
      regions (the core and the invasive margin) influenced the occurrence of early events of
      metastasis (tumor emboli) and was strongly associated with prognosis of patients with CRC
      (Pagès et al, NEJM-2005). This immune criterion was a better predictor of survival than the
      &quot;gold standard&quot; histoprognostic data of tumor invasion (T stage and N) and allowed to
      identify a group of patients at high risk of recurrence (*2). The availability of this immune
      criterion in clinical practice could improve the prognostic assessment of patients and better
      guide the therapeutic. A dedicated platform has been implemented in our hospital to speed up
      the transfer of this immune investigation into the clinic. The investigation takes into
      account the density of immune cell populations in tumor regions (the core and the invasive
      front of the tumor). This methodology has been validated for the markers CD45RO, CD3 and CD8
      and leads to the creation of an immune score (&quot;immunoscore&quot; ranging from IO to I4). We
      validated the prognostic impact of the immunoscore in a retrospective series of 250
      colorectal cancers. The main objective of this multicentric prospective clinical study is to
      assess in clinical practice the &quot;immunoscore&quot; and measure its prognostic value. The cohort
      study will include 400 patients with CRC stage I to IV (6 centers for inclusion; Paris-HEGP,
      Dijon, Bobigny-Avicenne, Besancon, Poitiers, Rouen). Two years of inclusion and a follow-up
      of 3 years for each patient will be performed (co-financing for data collection during the
      4th and 5th year planned). For each patient, the pathologist of the center will send to the
      immunomonitoring platform of HEGP tissue sections from a paraffin block containing the tumor
      regions. The investigations will combine a step of immunostaining for CD3, CD8, and CD45RO
      (Ventana automate) markers, high-resolution scanning of the stained slides and quantification
      of digital images by an imaging module developed by our group from the program of Developer
      XD of Définiens company. The immunoscore will be calculated and the score will be correlated
      to the clinical data for the relapse and the survival. The secondary objective of this
      program is to evaluate the prognostic performance of the immune infiltrate on the biopsies
      performed for diagnostic purposes. This study will be conducted on patients of the cohort
      whose biopsies were performed in the same hospital than surgery and whose samples are
      available in pathology laboratories involved (representing 50% of cases). For the same
      patients will be conducted a genetic investigation of the tumor to assess the MSI status, the
      presence of a K-Ras and BRAF mutations. This investigation will be performed on tumor
      sections from the same tumor block selected for the immunohistochemical analyses. The
      sections will be processed by the Department of Biology, Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou.
      The prognostic performance of the immune investigations performed on tumor sections and
      biopsies will be compared to that of genetic features of the tumor. Finally, a questionnaire
      will be sent every six months along the monitoring of the patients to obtain information
      concerning (i) the emergence of an immune disorder (such as allergy, autoimmunity,
      inflammatory process) and (ii) the psychological status of the patients. The potential impact
      of such parameters during the course of the disease on the prediction of the relapse and
      survival obtained with the immunoscore performed at the time of surgery will be evaluated.
      Expected results : This prospective study is an indispensable step for the clinical
      validation of the prognostic value of the immunoscore. The secondary objectives should help
      to precise the benefit of a concomitant analysis of the biopsy, the genetic features of the
      tumor. The questionnaire should help to identify the clinical parameters to track along the
      monitoring

      The main objective is to assess the impact of the immunoscore in the clinical practice. To
      this end, the immune parameter (CD3, CD8, CD45RO) of colorectal cancers (stage I-IV) will be
      evaluated prospectively through a large multicenter study. 400 patients with CRC stage I to
      IV will be included (6 centers for inclusion; Paris-HEGP, Dijon, Bobigny-Avicenne, Besancon,
      Poitiers, Rouen). The number of patients to be included has been calculated on the basis of
      an inclusion period of 24 months, a follow-up of 3 years (a collection of data during the 4th
      and 5th year is planned with a co-financing), an expected event rate of 20%, a prognostic
      value of the immune parameter similar to that observed in the retrospective study of 399
      patients with CRC (*1) and a power of the test of 90%. During both initial management and
      follow-up, all therapeutic procedures will be registered (surgery, radiotherapy,
      chemotherapy…). Data will be collected from clinical examination, radiological exams and
      biological tests that are usually performed during a hospitalization for colorectal cancer:
      Full clinical examination and questioning about the presence of personal and family history
      of CRC, adenomas and other cancers; Abdominal ultrasound, chest X-ray; Computed tomography
      (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) according to clinician's requirement; Standard
      laboratory tests and blood assay for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA); The Histopathologic
      study of the tumor containing the status of the surgical excision margins, the histological
      type of cancer, the level of parietal invasion, the number of lymph nodes examined and the
      number of metastatic lymph nodes, according to the TNM classification. Patients will be
      followed-up every 3 months during the first 2 years, and every 6 months for the rest of the
      follow-up period, as recommended. Each patient will be followed up to 5 years. Clinical,
      biological and radiological data will be registered into a specific CRF. Verification of
      inclusions and monitoring of data will be conducted by the HEGP Clinical Research Unit (URC
      HEGP) and the principal investigator. A plan for data-management will be built in line with
      the monitoring. A questionnaire will also be sent to the patients every six month for five
      years. This questionnaire was built by Pr F Pagès and by psychologists and psychiatrists to
      search for information concerning (i) the presence of an immune disorder (such as allergy,
      autoimmunity, inflammatory process) and (ii) the psychological status of the patients (eg.
      depression). After monitoring, all data will be stored using a double data entry system in a
      MS-Access database designed by the URC-HEGP and in the TME.dB database created by the team of
      the principal investigator. The 2 databases will be merged, and the final data base will be
      frozen for statistical analysis. Sample preparation: The pathologist of each center will
      choose a tumor block containing the core of the tumor and the invasive margin. This tumor
      block is part of the tumor samples routinely processed by the department of Pathology for
      diagnosis. three tissue sections of 4-microns will be made and deposit on a glass slide to
      perform the immunohistochemistry. Four tissue sections of 4-microns will be made and deposit
      on an Eppendorf safe lock tubes to perform the genetic analyses. Anonymous patient names on
      the slides and tubes will be provided by using a code number and initials of the patient. If
      biopsies for diagnostic purposes are available (i.e. those performed for the patients during
      their initial hospitalization (50% of cases), A tissue sections of each biopsy will be done.
      All slides and tubes will be sent by mail to the HEGP platform for analysis of the immune
      infiltrate and to the Biology department for the genetic analyses. The immunoscore will be
      determine using the following steps: Immunostainings for CD3, CD8, CD45RO on Benchmark XT
      automate; Scanning the immunostainings on Hamamatsu scanner: Quantification of the immune
      populations in specific tumor areas (the core and the invasive margin) with a dedicated image
      analysis module based on the recognition of histological structures adapted to colorectal
      cancer. This module has been developed by our group in connection with the Definiens company.
      A semi-automatic procedure allows the quantification of stained cells in each tumor region.
      Each region is divided into tiles of 800 microns side (500 to 700 tiles analyzed per tumor).
      The density of each marker is calculated using the mean density of the three tiles the most
      infiltrated in each tumor region. A categorization into high density (Hi) or low (Lo) for
      each marker in each tumor region of interest will be performed. This categorization is done
      by comparing the observed density with the optimal cut-off density (min p value approach) we
      previously determined for the DFS and OS in a retrospective study of 250 CRC. Genetic
      analyses: The tubes containing the sections for the genetic analyses of patients with inform
      consent signed for genetic investigation will be transfer to the Department of Biology,
      Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou. The % of tumor cells of each specimen will be determined
      by a pathologist (based on a H&amp;E evaluation; less than 10%, 10-20%, 20-50%, up to 50% tumor
      cells) and the DNA extraction will be performed. Genetic investigation will comprise the MSI
      status, the presence of a K-Ras and BRAF mutation
