  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Fluzone High Dose increases the immune
      response to the influenza antigens contained in the vaccine compared to standard-dose Fluzone
      in immunocompromised children and young adults. Safety and efficacy data will also be
      collected.

    <measure>Number of Episodes of Influenza and Influenza-Like-Illness Reported in High Dose and Standard Dose Vaccination Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 months after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Gathered data on influenza and influenza-like-illness during the influenza season for which the subject was vaccinated. Reported numbers of episodes of PCR-diagnosed influenza and rates of reported Influenza-Like-Illness (ILI) from Questionnaire #2 and also that were obtained from medical records. Data were categorized by the following:
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-proven diagnosis of influenza performed at Children's Hospital Colorado (CHC)
Diagnosis of influenza by non-PCR rapid-influenza test
Diagnosis of ILI (from questionnaire #2). [Centers for Disease Control (CDC) definition of ILI: Fever ≥ 100°F AND cough or sore throat in the absence of another known cause other than influenza for the illness.]</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Seroprotected at Timepoint 2 in High Dose and Standard Dose Vaccination Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>blood draw at 10-45 days post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Measure hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) on blood samples #2 for all subjects, which is the sample drawn at the &quot;peak&quot; of the immune response. Compare number of subjects who are seroprotected (reaching HAI ≥ 1:40) between the high-dose and standard-dose recipients..</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Adverse Events Definitely or Possibly Related to Vaccination Reported Within 14 Days of Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>0-14 days after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Number of adverse events reported within the 14 days after vaccination by each subject within each patient group. Data collected from that reported in safety questionnaires and in Safety Diary that spanned the 14 days post-vaccination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Seroconversion From T1 to T2 in the High Dose and Standard Dose Vaccine Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>10-45 days post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>HAI was measured on blood samples #1 and #2 for all subjects. Seroconversion is defined as a four-fold increase in antibody level between the high-dose and standard-dose recipients within each patient group was performed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Seroprotected at Timepoint 3 in High Dose and Standard Dose Vaccination Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>at least 5 months post vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Measure HAI on blood sample #3, drawn May-September following vaccination. Report number who still have HAI ≥ 1:40 in the high-dose and standard-dose groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Disease Status From Vaccination Through June of the Following Year</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 9 months post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate disease status changes reported by subject on Questionnaire #2 as well as changes reported in clinic notes over the course of the influenza season. Subjects considered &quot;worse&quot; had worsening function of transplanted organ or complications related to underlying condition (e.g. dialysis) or new diagnosis of disease considered serious by PI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Adverse Events Considered Definitely or Possibly Related to Vaccination Through Sept 30 of the Year Following Vaccination.</measure>
    <time_frame>(1) Date of vaccine through day 30 post-vaccine; (2) Day 31 post-vaccine through September 30 of the year following vaccine</time_frame>
    <description>Data gathered from the following
Safety data in 1st 14 days (safety surveys and safety diary)
Safety survey at day 30-45 regarding any unplanned health care visit or other AE during the 30 days after vaccine
On-going passive surveillance of adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs) throughout course of influenza season of enrollment
Chart review of each participant by PI through Sept 30 of the year following vaccine Data collection stopped in September following enrollment.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Additional Measures of Immunogenicity in High Dose and Standard Dose Vaccinations</measure>
    <time_frame>10-45 days post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary objective was included as exploratory and we plan to add additional analyses when funding is secured. There is no anticipated date when we will have this completed. (No immunogenicity studies have been done besides HAI.) For other immunogenicity: would compare results of blood draw #1 and #2 between the high-dose and standard-dose recipients for each patient group for any of the following: antibody avidity, microneutralization, T-cell interferon, T-cell IL-2, B-cell Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and B-cell Immunoglobulin A (IgA).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Numbers of Subjects Who Were Both Seroprotected and Who Seroconverted at T2 and T3 After Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>(1) T2 measured 14-45 days post-vaccination; (2) T3 measured June 1-Sept 30 post-vaccination (end-of season), following vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Seroprotection (HAI&gt;=1:40) and seroconversion (4-fold increase) together have been found to be a better predictor of vaccine effectiveness. Patients had to have both a 4-fold rise in HAI and have HAI&gt;=40 to be counted</description>

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-proven diagnosis of influenza performed at Children's Hospital Colorado (CHC)
Diagnosis of influenza by non-PCR rapid-influenza test
Diagnosis of ILI (from questionnaire #2). [Centers for Disease Control (CDC) definition of ILI: Fever ≥ 100°F AND cough or sore throat in the absence of another known cause other than influenza for the illness.]</description>

        <title>Additional Measures of Immunogenicity in High Dose and Standard Dose Vaccinations</title>
        <description>This secondary objective was included as exploratory and we plan to add additional analyses when funding is secured. There is no anticipated date when we will have this completed. (No immunogenicity studies have been done besides HAI.) For other immunogenicity: would compare results of blood draw #1 and #2 between the high-dose and standard-dose recipients for each patient group for any of the following: antibody avidity, microneutralization, T-cell interferon, T-cell IL-2, B-cell Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and B-cell Immunoglobulin A (IgA).</description>

        <description>Seroprotection (HAI&gt;=1:40) and seroconversion (4-fold increase) together have been found to be a better predictor of vaccine effectiveness. Patients had to have both a 4-fold rise in HAI and have HAI&gt;=40 to be counted</description>
        <time_frame>(1) T2 measured 14-45 days post-vaccination; (2) T3 measured June 1-Sept 30 post-vaccination (end-of season), following vaccination</time_frame>
        <population>For T3, only 4 participants in the high-dose group and 5 participants in the standard-dose group were analyzed due to loss-to-follow-up.</population>

      <time_frame>AE data were collected from the date of vaccination (T1) through September 30 of the following year. AE data were collected differently over the study. At day 2-7 after vaccination, subjects were called to ask about AEs. Subjects were given a &quot;Diary&quot; to fill out for day 0-14 after vaccination, and the Diary was collected at T2. At day 30-45, subjects were given a questionnaire (in-person at T2 visit or by phone) asking about AEs and any unplanned medical visits during day 0-30 post-vaccine.</time_frame>
      <desc>In May-June after vaccination, another questionnaire was collected by phone asking about influenza and influenza-like-illness, new health conditions, changes to underlying medical condition, or new immunosuppressive treatments since enrollment. Passive AE data were collected by providing participants with contact information for the study in order to report any concerns.</desc>
