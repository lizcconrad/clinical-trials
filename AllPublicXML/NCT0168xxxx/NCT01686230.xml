      This trail aims to evaluate the efficacy of acupoints on the specific meridian for chronic
      stable angina pectoris, compared with acupoints on the other meridian, sham acupoints and
      waiting-list. And to confirm the specificity of acupoints on meridian.

      The basis of acupuncture is the theory of meridians and acupoints. Meridian and collaterals
      internally pertain to viscera, and externally spread over the extremities. An acupoint is the
      place where the visceral qi and meridian qi distributed in. besides acupoints are the
      stimulus points and reactive points for acupuncture to treat the diseases. Selecting the
      acupoints on the specific meridian is the basic principle of acupuncture. Recently, as to the
      existence of specificity of acupoints on the meridian has been questioned by many
      researchers. This trial using chronic stable angina pectoris as a carrier, select the
      acupoints on the hand shao yin heart meridian and hand jue yin pericardium meridian to treat
      chronic stable angina pectoris. Compared with acupoints on the other meridian and
      non-acupoints ,aiming to evaluate the efficacy, furthermore ,to confirm the existence of the
      specificity of acupoints on meridian.
