    <textblock>
      This trial will investigate the administration of two new tuberculosis vaccines, called
      AERAS-402 and MVA85A. The purpose of this trial is to assess what happens when both of these
      vaccines are given one after the other. The trial will assess the safety of both vaccines and
      also their ability to stimulate an immune response within the body. It is hoped that when
      these two vaccines are given in sequence, the combined immune response is even better than
      when each vaccine is used individually.

          -  Resident in or near Oxford (for CCVTM) or Birmingham (for WTCRF; and able to travel to
             Oxford for vaccinations) for the duration of the trial period

          -  No relevant findings in medical history or on physical examination

          -  Confirmation of prior vaccination with BCG not less than 6 months prior to projected
             trial vaccination date (by visible BCG scar on examination or written documentation)

          -  Allow the Investigators to discuss the individual's medical history with their GP

          -  Use effective contraception for the duration of the trial period (females only)

          -  Refrain from blood donation during the trial

          -  Give written informed consent

          -  Allow the Investigator to register subject details with a confidential database to
