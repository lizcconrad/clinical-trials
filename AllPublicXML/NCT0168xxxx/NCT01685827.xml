      This clinical trial is designed to prove the efficacy and safety of Fexinidazole as an oral
      treatment for human african trypanosomiasis in advanced stage. The Fexinidazole is compared
      to reference treatment NECT. The trial will try to demonstrate that Fexinidazole is not
      inferior to NECT treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a life-threatening and neglected disease.

      Few treatment options are currently available for stage 2 (meningo-encephalitic stage) HAT,
      with NECT being the most commonly used one since 2010. Though NECT represents a significant
      improvement over current therapies, it is still far from ideal given the environment in which
      HAT patients live (remote, poor areas with little health infrastructure, if any, and
      difficult logistics). There is an urgent need for less toxic and more easily manageable
      compounds to treat this fatal disease.

      Fexinidazole is a 2-5-nitroimidazole, formulated for oral administration, which has been
      shown to possess in vitro and in vivo activity against both T. b. rhodesiense and T. b.
      gambiense parasites.

      Predicted CSF concentrations reached target levels after repeated dosing. Its efficacy and
      safety must now be tested in patients with stage 2 HAT.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the outcome (success or failure) at the test of cure (ToC) visit 18 months after the end of treatment (EOT) adapted from WHO criteria.
Success at 18 months is:
Either cure:
patient alive,
AND with no evidence of trypanosomes in any body fluid,
AND 20 or less WBC/µl CSF
Or Probable cure:
Patient with no parasitological evidence of relapse in blood and lymph
AND who refuses lumbar puncture OR whose CSF sample is haemorrhagic without trypanosomes
AND whose clinical condition is satisfactory (without clinical symptom or signs) OR whose clinical status is unlikely to be due to HAT</description>
