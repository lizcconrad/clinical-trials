    <textblock>
      Investigators aim to test the effectiveness of a text-message-based behaivoral intervention
      in reducing binge drinking among young adults.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol consumption, especially in the form of heavy episodic drinking (bingeing), is common
      among young adults. Despite high rates of illness and injury associated with heavy episodic
      drinking, many young adults are not aware of the risks, few seek help for their drinking and
      many at-risk are not exposed to prevention-based intervention. Opportunistic screening in
      hospital Emergency Departments (EDs) tied to behavioral interventions has the potential to
      prevent future alcohol-related harm among young adults, but efficacy across outcomes has been
      mixed and large-scale implementation of prevention programs is low. Given the rapidly growing
      use of cell phone text-messaging (SMS) as a primary form of communication among young adults,
      SMS could be used to deliver health prevention interventions. We will recruit young adults
      identified in the ED with hazardous drinking behavior in a 3-arm randomized controlled trial
      to test the hypothesis that exposure to a 12-week SMS program will result in immediate
      (3-month) and lasting (6-, and 9-month) decreases in alcohol consumption.
