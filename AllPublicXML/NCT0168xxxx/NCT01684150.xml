  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safe dose of EPZ-5676, to evaluate the safety
      of EPZ-5676 in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, and to conduct a preliminary
      assessment of the anti-leukemia activity of EPZ-5676 in patients with acute leukemias bearing
      rearrangements of the MLL gene.

      Currently this study is in the MLL-r restricted/expansion phase and is only enrolling
      patients with rearrangements involving the MLL gene, including 11q23 or partial tandem
      duplications (PTD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A subset of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
      harbor rearrangements of the MLL gene, which are detected either by cytogenetic or
      fluorescent in situ hybridization evaluation at the time of diagnosis. A protein called DOT1L
      plays an important role in the malignant process in these leukemias. EPZ-5676 is a molecule
      that blocks the activity of DOT1L, and is therefore being evaluated in the treatment of
      patients with MLL-rearranged leukemias.

      The dose escalation portion has been completed. Currently this study is in the expansion
      phase and patients with MLL-r and MLL-PTD will receive EPZ-5676 as a 28-day continuous
      intravenous infusion (CIV).
