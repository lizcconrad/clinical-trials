  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stingray injuries can be a hazard shared by many types of beachgoers. Stingrays often lie in
      the sand and when stepped on by the unsuspecting beachgoer their tail snaps foreword,
      resulting in a barbed stinger injecting venom into the victim. Little exists in the current
      literature on the natural history of stingray injuries. Most of the existing literature looks
      at the incidence of stings, and to a certain extent the demographic of people who seek care.
      To our knowledge no study has attempted to collect a more inclusive population of those
      people who are stung and follow them prospectively to determine the incidence of medical
      intervention, infection, etc.

      This study aims to describe and quantify the natural history of stingray injuries and to
      better understand their time course and medical requirements. The study setting will be Seal
      Beach, which reports some of the greatest number of annual stingray injuries for any single
      beach on the pacific coast. Participants will be identified by the Seal Beach lifeguards who
      are believed to treat the majority of stingray injuries suffered at the beach. Eligible
      persons will be consented for participation over the phone by research personnel. If enrolled
      in the study they will receive a phone call by research personnel one week and one month
      after the injury that will collect information about the symptoms they have experienced and
      the medical interventions they have received, if any. This study is strictly observational in
      nature and will not involve any interventions on the part of study personnel or alter the
      manner in which or types of medical assessments or treatments.

    <description>This study is descriptive in nature. The primary outcome of this study is the understanding of the natural history of stingray injuries and their treatment. This will be achieved using strictly descriptive statistics of the incidence and duration of particular symptoms, medical evaluations, and treatment. Means, proportions, and confidence intervals of these statistics will be calculated.</description>
