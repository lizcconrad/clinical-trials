  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the project is to gain insight in sensory deficits and recovery patterns
      in the upper limb post stroke and its association with brain lesion localisation.
      Furthermore, the investigators will identify associations of deficits in sensory modalities
      with upper limb impairments, activities and participation at different time points after
      stroke. Identification of the sensory deficits, along with further insights in their relation
      with objective neurophysiological and neuroanatomical measures will contribute to the
      amelioration of goal-setting for the rehabilitation of upper extremity function after stroke.
      These functions are indispensable during several daily activities as well in different sports
      and leisure activities. This project is an important step towards a better delineating of
      treatment interventions for the upper limb and to a better guiding of individual needs for
      post-stroke treatment in the future.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  first-ever stroke as defined by WHO

          -  ≤ 5 days post stroke

          -  motor impairment and/or a sensory impairment

          -  ≥ 18 years old

          -  sufficient cooperation to execute evaluations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  other neurological impairments such as previous stroke, head injury or multiple
             sclerosis (these might affect sensory ability independently of the stroke)

          -  stroke-like symptoms caused by subdural hematoma, tumour, encephalitis or trauma

          -  no informed consent

          -  pre-stroke Barthel Index &lt; 95 out of 100 points (to be able to distinguish between
             pre-existing disabilities and disabilities resulting from the stroke)
