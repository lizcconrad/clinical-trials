  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to determine the prevalence of device-recorded ST
      segment changes occurring before appropriate ICD therapies (ATP or Shock) and to define their
      temporal relationship to ventricular arrhythmias.

    <description>Group 1 uses Merlin.net for remote monitoring, i.e. scheduled follow ups every 6 months in clinic, collection of ST Segment, ATP and Shock Therapy delivered alerts via Merlin.net.</description>

    <description>Group 2 will not use Merlin.net, i.e. scheduled follow ups every 3 months in clinic for alert review during device interrogation.
The use of Merlin.net will be per physician's preference.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is implanted with an SJM ICD with ST Monitoring and ShockGuard™ features
             (and remote care feature in case Merlin.net will be used)

          -  The patient, in the opinion of the investigator, will not require ventricular pacing
             for more than 20% of the time.

          -  The patient, in the opinion of the investigator, has or is at high risk of CAD.

          -  The patient is ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  The patient is able to provide written Informed Consent prior to any investigational
             related procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has longstanding persistent AF/AFl or permanent AF/AFl

          -  The patient has documented complete heart block.

          -  The patient is known to have uncontrolled ventricular bigeminy or trigeminy (PVCs on
             regular basis).

          -  The patient has severe Left Ventricular Hypertrophy resulting in interventricular
             conduction defect (IVCD).

          -  The patient has intermittent bundle branch blocks (BBB).

          -  The patient is unable to comply with the follow up schedule.

          -  The patient is participating in another investigational device or drug investigation.

          -  The patient is pregnant or is planning to become pregnant during the duration of the
             investigation.
