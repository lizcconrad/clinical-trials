  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial was to develop the initial sections of a video/DVD cassette that
      provided guidance about mastering stressful situations for patients who had been informed
      that they need an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD). We adapted the existing
      LifeSkills video (which was already been shown effective in patients with heart diseases) to
      the specific needs of patients with AICD's. Before its development, we held separate focus
      groups with healthcare providers of AICD patients, pre-implantation patients, and
      post-implantation patients. After the video/accompanying workbook was produced, we held an
      additional focus group with patients who had received the video/workbook before receiving
      their AICD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who had received the video/workbook told the focus group leader that they wanted
      more information about their AICD and a clearer presentation about how stress management was
      related to living with their AICD.

    <description>The focus is evaluation of LifeSkills Video/Workbook for patients about to receive an AICD. Patients who now have received their AICD were given a video/workbook pre-implantation as an intervention to reduce their concerns/distress. After implantation, they will be asked what was and was not helpful about the materials they received.</description>

    <description>This exploratory intervention first met in a focus group with healthcare professionals and another focus group with patients who already had received an automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator to learn more about what video and accompanying workbook material it would be helpful for patients to receive pre-inplantation. Another focus group was held with post-implantation patients asking them what additional knowledge would have been helpful. Three sections of the video with accompanying workbook were then produced and given to pre-inplantation patients. A focus group was then held with these patients after their procedure to ask them what had and had not proved helpful.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (age&gt; 21 years old)

          -  For one of the initial focus groups and for the focus group of patients who had
             watched the produced modules: Patients who have received a recommendation for an AICD
             and have agreed to have it in the pre-implantation stage (do not already have the
             implant)

          -  For the other initial focus group: patients who already have an AICD.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are medically unstable [New York Heart Association class IV heart
             failure, recent (within 30 days) myocardial infarction or admission for unstable
             angina or worsening heart failure, in-patients, or patients who were admitted less
             than 1 month before potential enrollment will be excluded].

          -  Patients who are suffering from other medical illnesses: only the following categories
             will be exclusionary: Diseases that cause severe cognitive impairment that may lead to
             inability to understand or follow study procedures (i.e., severe dementia, identified
             by the patients' inability to repeat the study procedures and by a mini-mental status
             exam that will be done if dementia is suspected); Diseases that cause severe psychotic
             symptoms leading to disorientation (i.e., hepatic encephalopathy).

          -  Patients who are actively suicidal (suspected from the suicide question on the
             depression questionnaire

          -  Patients who cannot understand the study procedures due to cognitive or language
             barriers (provided an effort was made to offer translation).

          -  The process for dealing with individuals who indicate that they may be suicidal,
             depressed or anxious will be as follows: Immediately upon receipt of the completed
             questionnaires at the coordinating office, the Beck Depression Inventory and the
             Impact of Event Scale will be evaluated. If the responses indicate suicidal ideation
             the subject will be called and asked to contact his/her primary care provider for an
             immediate appointment. The primary care provider will be contacted that day to inform
             him/her of the finding. If the responses to the Impact of Event Scale or the BDI
             indicate stress or depression, a letter will be sent to the subject recommending that
             he/she contact the primary care provider. A copy of the letter will be forwarded to
             the PCP.
