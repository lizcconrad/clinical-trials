  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic diseases are at great risk of depression and anxiety.It is known that
      depression and anxiety are one of the most common comorbidities associated with chronic lung
      diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

      However,to date,little is known about the rates and risk factors of depression and anxiety
      symptoms in non-CF bronchiectasis;and no large-scale prospective studies have been performed
      to investigate the effect of depression and anxiety on the healthy outcomes(such as number of
      exacerbations and hospitalizations over the ensuing year).Our purpose is to fill these gaps.

      Non-CF bronchiectasis is a long-term condition which affects the lungs.It is characterized by
      chronic airway infection with periodic exacerbations which are associated with impaired lung
      function, reduced quality of life and increased healthcare costs.Depression and anxiety are
      common and are known to be associated with poor quality of life and exacerbations of other
      chronic respiratory diseases such as COPD.Studies in COPD have shown that psychological
      distress is increasingly elevated and common,with up to 55% of patients suffering from a
      clinical diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression;moreover,patients with anxiety and/or
      depression were at greater risk for COPD-related exacerbations.Unfortunately,there has been
      no systematic evaluation of symptoms of depression and anxiety in patients with non-CF
      bronchiectasis or their relationship to health outcomes.A study including 111 non-CF
      bronchiectasis patients,O'Leary and colleagues indentified that 34% of patients had elevated
      scores for anxiety, depression or both.In a recent study of 93 patients(including 43 with
      Cystic fibrosis)of bronchiectasis,20% patients had elevated depression-related scores and 38
      % had elevated anxiety-related scores,both depression and anxiety symptoms predicted
      signiﬁcantly worse health-related quality of life.

      To date,the studies of depression and anxiety symptoms in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis
      have been limited by small samples sizes;and no prospective studies have been conducted to
      investigate the impact of psychological distress on the health outcomes.Given the importance
      of identifying and treating these symptoms, and their implications for long-term health
      outcomes,we plan to determine the prevalence and risk factors of depression and anxiety in
      non-CF bronchiectasis.In addition,we investigate the effect of depression and anxiety on the
      risk of non-CF bronchiectasis exacerbations and hospitalizations.

    <description>Depression and anxiety are assessed at baseline using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale(HADS).Health-related quality of life(HRQL) is measured using St.George's Respiratory Questionnaire(SGRQ), Leicester cough questionnaire(LCQ) and COPD assessment test(CAT) at baseline and follow-up.In the ensuing year,patients are monitored monthly by telephnone for 12 months to document the occurrence and characteristics of non-CF bronchiectasis exacerbations and hospitalizations.Patients are also encouraged to report to their investigators and research nurses whenever they experience symptom worsening.An exacerbation was defined as persistent (&gt;24 hour) deterioration in at least three respiratory symptoms (including cough,dyspnoea, haemoptysis, increased sputum purulence or volume, and chest pain), with or without fever (&gt;37.5˚ C),radiographic deterioration, systemic disturbances, or deterioration in chest signs.</description>

    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with non-CF bronchiectasis will complete the HADS, a brief, reliable and valid screening measure for depression and anxiety with well-established clinical cut-off scores.The HADS consists of seven items for depression(HAD-D) and seven items for anxiety(HAD-A).The scores range from 0 to 21 for each subscale,with a score of 0-7 denoting a noncase,8-10 a possible case,and 11 or higher a probable case.</description>
