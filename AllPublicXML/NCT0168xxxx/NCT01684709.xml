  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the medical and psychological effects of telemonitoring plus intensified
      self-management support to those of usual care alone for patients with poorly controlled type
      2 diabetes mellitus (DM). If this intervention proves effective without increasing costs or
      clinician burden, then its implementation could yield major public health benefits,
      especially for vulnerable and underserved DM patients, and broader societal benefit may occur
      through increased helping behavior and strengthened social ties.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although in-home caregivers (ICGs) help improve diabetes mellitus (DM) outcomes, they may
      lack the resources needed to do this optimally, and are at risk for psychosocial decline and
      caregiver burnout. Complicating matters, millions of chronically-ill older Americans live
      alone and receive long-distance caregiving without any supporting structure or resources to
      ensure its effectiveness. In this study, diabetes patients with poor glycemic will be
      recruited from two clinical sites, and half will have an ICG. Patients will nominate a
      &quot;CarePartner&quot; (CP; adult relatives or friends from outside their home) to receive weekly
      email reports about their DM health and behavioral needs, and will be given resources to help
      them to provide self-management support. Patients will then be randomized to receive either
      one year of CP intervention or usual medical care. In the CP intervention arm, patients will
      provide weekly updates on their DM health and self-management through weekly automated
      telemonitoring. Summaries of this will be emailed to their CP along with guidance on helping
      the patient address reported problem(s), and their clinicians will be alerted about
      medically-urgent problems. We will assess the following outcomes in both arms before
      intervention and also after 6 and 12 months of intervention: glycemic control, DM-related
      distress, DM self-management, health-related quality of life, systolic blood pressure,
      caregiver burden, relationship quality, and cost of DM care.
