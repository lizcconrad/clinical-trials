      This study aims to assess postoperative blood loss and transfusion rates in total hip
      replacement after one-time administration of topical tranexamic acid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autologous (donor) blood transfusion is an expensive and common occurrence after total hip
      replacement. There have been many proposed adjunctive measures to decrease intraoperative and
      postoperative blood loss during such surgery. Most of these include thrombin inhibition,
      so-called &quot;minimally- invasive&quot; techniques or instrumentation, or other adjunctive drugs.
      Hitherto, tranexamic acid, a specific drug that promotes part of the clotting cascade, has
      been used extensively in multiple areas of surgery with multiple studies evaluating its
      efficacy in cardiac surgery, spinal procedures, and as a dental swishing solution after tooth
      extraction. There have been small studies evaluating intravenous tranexamic acid and its
      effect on total hip replacements, with some promising results. The topical form of TA has
      been evaluated in only one prospective, randomized clinical trial with a significant decrease
      in postoperative blood loss and a trend towards decreased autologous blood transfusion rates.
      This study proposes to further evaluate tranexamic acid as an inexpensive and viable option
      for use in total hip arthroplasty. The topical form of the drug has been shown to achieve
      these hemostatic effects without increasing the risk of blood clots after surgery. A rigorous
      analysis of the effects of tranexamic acid demand a more standardized approach. Such a
      regimen is practiced at Henry Ford Hospital as all patients on the Adult Reconstruction
      service are placed on an identical dose of enoxaparin (a subcutaneous blood thinner)
      postoperatively for two weeks.
