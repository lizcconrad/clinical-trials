    <measure>Child Behavior - ASD</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-baseline to 90 days post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>One primary aim of this study are to examine treatment effects demonstrating change in ASD behaviors as measured by the PDDST-II Stage 2, BITSEA, response to joint attention, and response to name from pre-baseline to 90 days post randomization.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatty Acid</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 90 days post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome measures in this trial involve an examination of change in fatty acids and OS response from the first study visit (Time 1) to the third/final study visit (Time 3).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-baseline to 90 days post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility of a future full-scale multi-site study is assessed by examining the number of children screened, the proportion of these children who screen positive for ASD, the number of children who agree to participate in the trial, the number of children who return for the second and third study visits, baseline differences in individual fatty acids between the intervention and comparison groups, and adherence to the assigned treatment.</description>
