  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a liver condition in which fat builds up in the
      liver not caused by alcohol. The liver is an organ that is not designed to build up fat.
      NAFLD is common in people who have too much body fat in their abdomen or who have diabetes
      (high blood sugar), but does not always exist with these conditions. NAFLD can also occur in
      thin people too. NAFLD can be harmful to the liver and may cause the liver to fail over time.
      NAFLD may also cause adult (or type 2) diabetes and also heart disease. In people who already
      have diabetes, NAFLD can cause glucose (sugar) levels to be too high.

      Our intestines (guts) contain healthy bacteria and some harmful bacteria (bugs). This balance
      of healthy and harmful bugs is essential for the normal workings of our intestine to digest
      food. Providing these bacteria do not leak out into the blood they do not cause harm. If the
      balance of healthy to harmful bugs is upset, the harmful can cause problems and leak out into
      the blood. Because the liver is connected to the intestine by blood vessels the harmful
      bacteria can get to the liver and cause problems. These bacteria can cause the liver and the
      body to build up too much fat and might cause NAFLD and obesity. In this study, we will test
      the effects of a supplement (synbiotic) taken during the day, that contains a mixture of
      'good' healthy bacteria (probiotic) and a sugar (prebiotic) that is not broken down and
      absorbed into the blood. We will test whether the synbiotic supplement has beneficial effects
      on the NAFLD liver condition and on factors linked to too much body fat, diabetes and heart
      disease.

      We will recruit people with NAFLD who have been diagnosed as part of their NHS care with
      having this condition. At present there is no treatment for this condition.

      Purpose and design:

      We are asking the research question: &quot;Does the modulation of gut microflora with a synbiotic
      improve non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and the related risk factors for heart disease and
      type 2 diabetes?&quot;

      Presently there is no treatment for this liver condition. Research evidence suggests that a
      synbiotic supplement might be beneficial for this condition.

      To address this research question we want to undertake a randomised double blind placebo
      controlled trial recruiting people who have been diagnosed with NAFLD.

             haemochromatosis).

          -  Alcohol consumption ≤ 14 units / week for women ≤ 21 units / week for men.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Alcohol consumption &gt; 15 units /week for women and &gt; 22 units /week for men.

          -  Decompensated acute or chronic liver disease.
