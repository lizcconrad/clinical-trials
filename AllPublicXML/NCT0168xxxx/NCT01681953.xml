        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject or subjects legally authorized guardian(s) must provide signed, informed
             consent prior to performing any trial-related activities

          -  The subject and his/her guardian(s) must have the ability to comply with the protocol

          -  The subject must have a confirmed diagnosis of alpha-Mannosidosis as defined by
             alpha-Mannosidase activity &lt; 10% of normal activity (historical data)

          -  The subject must have an age at the time of screening ≥ 5 years and ≤ 35 years

          -  The subject must have the ability to physically and mentally cooperate in the tests

          -  The subject must have an ECHO without abnormalities that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would preclude participation in the trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subjects diagnosis cannot be confirmed by alpha-Mannosidase activity &lt; 10% of
             normal activity

          -  The subject cannot walk without support

          -  Presence of known chromosomal abnormality and syndromes affecting psychomotor
             development, other than alpha-Mannosidosis

          -  History of BMT

          -  Presence of known clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary, or renal
             disease or other medical conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             preclude participation in the trial

             or not there is a need for contraception

          -  Psychosis; any psychotic disease, also in remission, is an exclusion criteria

          -  Planned major surgery that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude
             participation in the trial

          -  Participation in other interventional trials testing IMP (including Lamazym) within
             the last 3 months

          -  Adult patients who, in the opinion of the Investigator, would be unable to give
             consent, and who does not have any legal protection or guardianship

          -  Total IgE &gt;800 IU/ml

          -  Known allergy to the IMP or any excipients (Sodium-Phosphate, Glycine, Mannitol)
