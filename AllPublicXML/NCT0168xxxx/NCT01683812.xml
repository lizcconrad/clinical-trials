  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this descriptive study is to provide information on the feasibility of using
      the cranial cup, a new positioning device, in a small sample of prematurely born infants with
      elongated head shapes as a result of laying on their abdomens, during the convalescent phase
      of their hospitalizations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cranial cup is a non-invasive, non-restrictive, adjustable orthotic device that grows
      with the infant and maintains proper body alignment while promoting normal head shape
      development. While the cranial cup is not yet FDA approved, it is considered a
      non-significant medical device and it has successfully corrected asymmetric positional head
      shape deformities in hundreds of healthy newborns less than 4 months of age cared for by the
      Children's Hospital Boston outpatient plagiocephaly clinic. Additionally preliminary analysis
      of a prospective randomized controlled trial currently underway suggests that the cranial cup
      may be useful in prevention of positional head shape deformity in a cohort of hospitalized
      infants of varying gestational ages. However, the cranial cup has never been used for
      correction of the most common form of positional head shape deformity in hospitalized
      premature infants; namely dolichocephaly. Thus, the purpose of this descriptive study is to
      provide information on the feasibility of using the cranial cup in a small sample of
      prematurely born infants with dolichocephaly during the convalescent phase of their
      hospitalizations. Information obtained from this descriptive study will be used to determine
      if a larger investigation using the cranial cup is warranted in this specific patient
      population.

    <time_frame>Using head measurements obtained at timepoint 1 enrollment (baseline, day 1) and at timepoint 2 discharge (14-120 days)</time_frame>
    <description>To describe infant head shape, the study will use cranial measurements and laser head scans in a sample of prematurely born Neonatal Intensive Care (NICU) or Special Care Nursery (SCN) patients with dolichocephaly. Cranial measurement used is cranial index, an objective measure that quantifies head shape by dividing the head width (M-L) by length (A-P) then multiplying it by 100%. Measurements and scans will be taken directly following study enrollment and discharge to document head shape pre and post intervention. The discharge measure will be obtained at approximately 2 weeks-4 months of age at hospital discharge.</description>
