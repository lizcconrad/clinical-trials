  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases, a common complication,occur in 25-40% of patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). Whole-brain radiation therapy(WBRT) and Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) are
      important approaches to the treatment of brain metastases from NSCLC. Known to us, epidermal
      growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) can pass through the
      blood-brain barrier and show promising antitumor activity against brain metastases from
      NSCLC, especially for EGFR mutation patients. However, due to the lower concentration of
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the cerebrospinal fluid and its inevitable emergence of
      drug resistance, brain metastases will be refractory or resistant to standard-dose EGFR
      inhibitors. Icotinib is one agent of EGFR-TKIs. The previous studies have shown that the
      Icotinib conventional dose (125mg, TID) is far from reached its maximum tolerable dose. It is
      a challenge whether the further dose escalation of Icotinib will enhance its concentration in
      cerebrospinal fluid and thereby improve its therapeutic effect. Here the investigators
      examine the therapeutic effect and side-effect of double dose of Icitinib in treating
      patients with brain metastases from NSCLC who have suffered from the failure of conventional
      dose treatment.
