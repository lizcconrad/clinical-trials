  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of tracking breathing during sleep
      with non-contact sensors (for example, microphones or wireless movement sensors). The
      investigators will use the data collected with these sensors to develop algorithms for
      tracking breathing during sleep. The investigators will assess the performance of the
      algorithms by comparing automatic output against manually-generated labels.

      Subjects will be asked to place non-contact sensors (for example, ambient microphones,
      wireless movement sensors) in their home sleep environment. No sensors will be attached to or
      otherwise in contact with the subject's body. The subjects will start the data collection
      before they fall asleep, and stop the data collection the next morning when they wake. The
      subjects will then return the sensors to the investigator for analysis.

      The investigators will study the data and associated manual labeling. The investigators will
      develop algorithms that use statistical and machine-learning methods to train computer models
      designed to track breathing automatically. The investigators will compare the automatic
      output against manually generated labels to determine breath-tracking accuracy.
