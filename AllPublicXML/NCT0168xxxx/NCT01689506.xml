    <textblock>
      This clinical study compares two fluid resuscitation treatments in patients suffering from
      burns injury. The treatments are Volulyte® and Human Serum Albumin (HSA) which will be
      administered as infusion solutions. It will be evaluated whether Volulyte® is effective and
      safe, and provides any benefit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe burns injury presents a unique resuscitation problem due to simultaneous loss of
      electrolyte and protein-rich exudate from the burn wound itself and leakage of fluid and
      protein from the circulation into the interstitial compartment. In the post shock phase of
      burn resuscitation, patients frequently suffer oedema of unburned tissues and organs and a
      positive fluid balance of many litres. This pilot study will compare two burns fluid
      resuscitation regimes (supplementation with 6% HES 130/0.4 in an isotonic electrolyte
      solution, Volulyte 6%, versus supplementation with Human Serum Albumin, HSA 50g/L) on patient
      outcome with particular regard to fluid balance at 24 hours after burns injury (primary
      variable).
