  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of objective risk information about breast
      cancer and mammography outcomes using a randomized control trial. Women between the ages of
      35 and 49 will receive information about their personal risk for breast cancer and be
      randomly assigned to receive data about a woman who should be screened, data about the
      potential outcomes of screening, or data about breast cancer deaths. Two presentation formats
      will be tested and compared.

      This study will compare alternative strategies for the presentation of individualized
      information about the risks and benefits of mammography screening. The purpose of this study
      is to understand how objective risk information influences outcomes including behavioral
      intentions, attitudes about mammography, and emotional responses.

      After participants view objective risk information, a post-test survey will measure outcome
      variables including behavioral intentions, knowledge, and emotional responses.

      After reading information based on their condition, study participants will be asked to
      complete a series of questions to measure their reactions based on their condition.
      Specifically, the investigators will be measuring the following dependent variables (primary
      outcomes): behavioral intentions to receive mammograms, attitudes about mammography,
      subjective norms about mammography and breast cancer screening, knowledge about mammography
      outcomes and screening recommendations, and emotional responses to the material including
      psychological reactance. These outcomes will be measured using self-reported questionnaire
      items.

      In this project, the investigators will compare alternative communication strategies to
      determine which strategy or strategies result in the greatest level of understanding. The
      investigators also will examine if the various strategies differentially affect the primary
      outcomes listed above.

    <time_frame>immediately following intervention (time 0)</time_frame>

    <measure>Decisional satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately following intervention (time 0)</time_frame>
    <description>This variable assesses how satisfied participants feel about making a decision about mammography given the information they have been provided. Items include, &quot;The information in the decision aid made me feel the choice to get a mammogram is being taken away from me by the groups that make screening recommendations.&quot;</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Risk perception</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately before and after intervention (time 0)</time_frame>
    <description>This variable includes perceived severity and perceived susceptibility of breast cancer. Items include, &quot;What is the chance that an average 40-49 year old woman will develop breast cancer in the next 10 years? Please choose a number between 0 (no chance of breast cancer) and 100 (definitely will get breast cancer).&quot;</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately following intervention (time 0)</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome includes measures of psychological reactance, anger, and fear that may be possible reactions to the decision aid. Items include, &quot;How much do each of the following words (i.e., angry, worried) describe how you felt while reading the decision aid?&quot;</description>
