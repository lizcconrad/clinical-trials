    <textblock>
      Background: Current treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is symptomatic and can only
      temporarily slow down progression.

      Exercise has the potential to improve cognition, psychological symptoms, physical performance
      and quality of life, but evidence is scarce. Previous trials are short, often underpowered
      and involving home based light exercise programs. Most have included nursing homes residents
      with severe or undefined dementia. The aim of the ADEX trial is to establish whether exercise
      is effective in improving cognition, physical performance and quality of life as well as
      reducing the prevalence of psychological symptoms among AD patients.

      Methods: The ADEX Trial is a multicentre, single-blind, randomized clinical trial. Based on
      power calculations the investigators plan to recruit 192 home-dwelling patients aged 50-90
      years with mild to moderate AD. The participants will be randomly allocated into two groups:
      An intervention group attending 16 weeks of continuously supervised moderate aerobic exercise
      1 hour three times a week and a control group only receiving usual care. The hypothesis is
      that aerobic exercise will improve physical function, the cognitive and daily functioning and
      quality of life in people with mild to moderate AS.

      Blood sampling will be performed in all subjects to examine effects on biomarkers. A subgroup
      of the patients will also undergo MRI, PiB-PET and lumbar puncture to investigate structural
      changes and β-amyloid accumulation.

      Further, a health-economic analysis will be performed.

      Recruitment was started in January 2012. Last study visits are planned to be performed in
      January 2014 and results will be available in 2014. This RCT will contribute to evidence
      regarding the potential effects of a systematic program of physical exercise for patients
      with Alzheimer's disease.
