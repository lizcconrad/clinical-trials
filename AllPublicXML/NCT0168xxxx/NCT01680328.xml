      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to assess and describe the pain
      in relation to subcutaneous (under the skin) injection of different combinations of injection
      speed and volume with respect to acceptance of the injection pain and backflow.

    <description>Calculated as the least square mean estimate of the difference in injection pain on a VAS (mm) between different factor levels corresponding to injection region, injection volume and injection speed (pain was assessed using an electronic VAS consisting of a 100 mm line where 0 mm corresponded to no pain and 100 mm corresponded to worst pain.

    <measure>Estimated Mean Differences in the Volume of Backflow (uL) in the Abdomen After Different Injection Volumes and Speeds as Compared to Needle Insertion</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes (±30sec) after each injection</time_frame>
    <description>Backflow was measured after each injection by placing a filter paper over the injection site after the injection was given and until the liquid was absorbed. The size of the wet spot on the filter paper served as a measure of the backflow. The treatment effect on backflow was calculated as the least square mean estimate of the difference in backflow after injection in the abdomen at different volume and speed combinations.</description>

    <description>The study consists of 80 treatment arms in a cross-over design with 19 treatments and 19 periods. The 80 treatment arms will represent different orders of the 19 treatments and each treatment arm will be used for one subject.

    <description>Subjects will receive 19 injections in randomised order of which 13 will be in the abdomen and 6 in the thighs. Out of the 19 injections, 2 are needle insertions only. The remaining 17 injections represent different combinations of injection speed and volume of sodium chloride 0.9% solution for injection. The order of the injection speed and volume combinations will be blinded for the subject and the pain will be evaluated by the subject on a VAS (Visual Analogue Scale).</description>

          <title>Injection Pain (VAS mm)</title>
          <description>Calculated as the least square mean estimate of the difference in injection pain on a VAS (mm) between different factor levels corresponding to injection region, injection volume and injection speed (pain was assessed using an electronic VAS consisting of a 100 mm line where 0 mm corresponded to no pain and 100 mm corresponded to worst pain. After each injection, the subjects rated their pain perception at the electronic VAS by marking the 100 mm line).</description>
          <population>All randomised subjects receiving at least one injection (possibly needle insertion only) were included in the full analysis set. A total of 4 subjects did not contribute to the analysis due to missing injections (2) and missing VAS evaluation (2).</population>

        <title>Estimated Mean Differences in the Volume of Backflow (uL) in the Abdomen After Different Injection Volumes and Speeds as Compared to Needle Insertion</title>
        <description>Backflow was measured after each injection by placing a filter paper over the injection site after the injection was given and until the liquid was absorbed. The size of the wet spot on the filter paper served as a measure of the backflow. The treatment effect on backflow was calculated as the least square mean estimate of the difference in backflow after injection in the abdomen at different volume and speed combinations.</description>

        <population>All randomised subjects receiving at least one injection (possibly needle insertion only) were included in the full analysis set. One subject did not contribute to the analysis due to missing injection.</population>

        <title>Estimated Mean Differences in the Volume of Backflow (uL) in the Thighs After Different Injection Volumes and Speeds as Compared to Needle Insertion</title>
        <description>Backflow was measured after each injection by placing a filter paper over the injection site after the injection was given and until the liquid was absorbed. The size of the wet spot on the filter paper served as a measure of the backflow. The treatment effect on backflow was calculated as the least square mean estimate of the difference in backflow after injection in the abdomen at different volume and speed combinations.</description>
