  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of flexibly
      dosed paliperidone palmitate in patients with schizophrenia previously unsuccessfully treated
      by oral antipsychotics and with acute symptom of schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 13-week, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-arm
      (one group of patients), multicenter, prospective, interventional study in Chinese patients.
      In a prospective, interventional study, the patients identified receive a treatment during
      the course of the research study and are followed forward in time for the outcome of the
      study. In China, there is still insufficient information about effectiveness, tolerability,
      and dosage strategy for directly switching from previous oral antipsychotics (drugs that are
      helpful in the treatment of psychosis and have a capacity to ameliorate thought disorders) in
      patients with acute symptoms. Acute symptoms are quick and severe form of illness in its
      early stage. In addition, there is also lack of information about bridging acute phase to
      long-term treatment. In this study, patients with multiple types of acute schizophrenia will
      be recruited and will receive Sustenna (paliperidone palmitate) treatments for 13 weeks.
      After the acute treatment, the patients will continue to receive the prescribed medication
      and will be followed up for an additional 52 weeks to assess the outcomes related to
      long-term treatment.

    <measure>The percentage of patients with a 30% reduction from baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale (range 30-210) designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <measure>The change from baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7-point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a patient. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill patients&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change from baseline in Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The MSQ is a 7-point, Likert-type scale rated as follows: 1=Extremely Dissatisfied, 2=Very Dissatisfied, 3=Somewhat Dissatisfied, 4=Neither Satisfied or Dissatisfied, 5=Somewhat Satisfied, 6=Very Satisfied, 7=Extremely Satisfied. Worst value is 1 (Extremely Dissatisfied) and best value is 7 (Extremely Satisfied).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change from baseline in Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire (IEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The IEQ is a 31-item questionnaire that assesses the encouragement and care that the caregiver has to give to the patient, to personal problems between patient and caregiver, and to the caregiver's worries, coping and subjective burden. All items are scored on 5-point Likert scales (never, sometimes, regularly, often, always).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change from baseline in Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The MARS is a ten-item yes/no self-report measure of medication adherence in psychosis. Total scores range from 0 (low likelihood of medication adherence) to 10 (high likelihood of medication adherence).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change from baseline in Medication Preference Questionnaire (MPQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The MPQ is used to investigate which treatment (oral or injection) the patients prefer and why they prefer this treatment, and to investigate which injectable site (deltoid or gluteal) they prefer and why they prefer this treatment.</description>
