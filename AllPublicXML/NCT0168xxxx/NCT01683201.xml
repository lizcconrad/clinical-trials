    <textblock>
      The aim of this research project is to evaluate the efficacy of a specific functional
      exercise programme to improve pain, stiffness and physical function in patients post total
      hip replacement from week 12 to week 18 post surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single blind randomised controlled trial with two arms. 70 subjects post
      primary total hip replacement will be randomised either to a functional; exercise group
      (n=35) or to a control group following usual care (n=35).

      Blinded outcome assessments will be carried out on all subjects by the principal investigator
      using the Western Ontario and Mc Master arthritis index on day 5 , week 12 aand week 18.

      Secondary outcomes measurements will also be collated at week 12 and week 18 including SF 12,
      6 min walk test, Dynamometry, and a blinded radiologist will also measure glut med cross
      sectional area using real time ultrasound at week 12 and week 18.
