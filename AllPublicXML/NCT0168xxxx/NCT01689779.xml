    <textblock>
      A growing body of evidence suggests that robust postoperative immune function is associated
      with a lower risk of surgical site infections (SSIs). At the same time, vitamin D is
      increasingly recognized as a key regulator of the innate and adaptive immune systems. The
      investigators elected to conduct the current study in patients who will undergo colorectal
      surgery since these patients are historically at higher risk of developing SSIs and therefore
      would be ideal for future investigations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While vitamin D insufficiency [25(OH)D &lt;30 ng/mL] is common in the general population,
      hypovitaminosis D may affect 40-80% of patients in the perioperative setting. Recent evidence
      also suggests that surgical stress may be associated with a 40% reduction in circulating
      25(OH)D levels when compared to preoperative values. Moreover, the derangement in
      perioperative 25(OH)D levels may be sustained for up to 3 months after surgery. This finding
      has potential implications regarding modifiable risk factors for surgical site infections
      (SSIs), which account for nearly 40% of all nosocomial infections. On aggregate, SSIs result
      in 3.7 million extra hospital days per annum and an added burden of $1.6 billion in annual
      healthcare costs. A growing body of evidence suggests that robust postoperative immune
      function is associated with a lower risk of SSIs. At the same time, vitamin D is increasingly
      recognized as a key regulator of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Yet, optimization of
      perioperative vitamin D status remains grossly understudied. Although our overarching aim is
      to study the impact of vitamin D status on SSIs, the focus of the current investigation is to
      determine whether the administration of a &quot;bolus&quot; oral dose of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3)
      in the preoperative setting alters vitamin D status in the perioperative setting (compared to
      a placebo). The investigators elected to conduct the current study in patients who will
      undergo colorectal surgery since these patients are historically at higher risk of developing
      SSIs and therefore would be ideal for future investigations.

        <title>Percent (%) Change in 25(OH)D 5 Days Following Supplementation With 100,000 IU Cholecalciferol</title>
        <description>3-7 days before surgery, patients will receive 100,000 IU of cholecalciferol (vs. placebo) during their pre-op assessment. They will also have their baseline vitamin D status measured during this initial visit. The main study outcome is to determine if 100,000 IU cholecalciferol can be given preoperatively to safely boost vitamin D status. To assess vitamin D status, we will measure: 1) 25(OH)D and 2) LL37</description>
