    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies potential genetic markers which might be used to predict which
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes respond to decitabine. This
      study will contribute to the efforts to find effective and less toxic therapies to provide
      durable remissions in a significant proportion of elderly AML patients.
