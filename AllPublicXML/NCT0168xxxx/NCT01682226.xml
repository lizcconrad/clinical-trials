    <description>The day of neutrophil recovery is defined as the first of 3 consecutive days in which the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is &gt; 0.5. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery will be reported at day 45 post-transplant. Sustained neutrophil engraftment is neutrophil engraftment without secondary graft failure. This will be analyzed at 1 and 2 years post-transplant.</description>

        transplantation, hematopoietic cell transplant comorbidity index (HCT-CI)23, and CB TNC
        dose into those who are at standard risk (Arm A) or high risk (Arm B) for early
        post-transplant death for the purposes of applying stopping rules and outcome analysis.

        Age:

        o 2 - 70 years. Diagnosis of severe aplastic anemia: eligibility to be discussed with PI
        and Service Chief. Such patients will be assessed in Arm B.

        second or third CR, or relapse/refractory less than 10% blasts in bone marrow, or aplasia
        post-therapy. This includes de novo acute leukemia or acute leukemia that is therapy

             to acute leukemia.

          -  MDS or other myeloproliferative disorder with life-threatening cytopenia(s), and/or
             red blood cell or platelet transfusion dependence, or patients with aplasia, or

                  morphologic relapse or persistent disease ≥ 10% blasts in the BM, or doubling of

                  only 400 CGy of TBI on this protocol is permitted.

               -  Uncontrolled viral, bacteria or fungal infection at time of study enrollment.

               -  Sero-positive or NAT positive for HIV.

                  tests

        Cord Blood Grafts:

        Units will be selected based on the HLA-match to the patient and individual cell doses of
        the units according to current MSKCC unit selection criteria. HLA-testing will be done
        using molecular techniques. The standard cord blood graft for this protocol will consist of
        2 units as a double unit graft although single units are permitted. Each unit will be at
        least 4 of 6 HLA-A, -B antigen and -DRB1 allele matched with the recipient. Each unit of a
        double unit graft will have a cryopreserved dose of at least 1.5 x 10^7 TNC/recipient body
        weight (TNC/kg). In the occasional patient with a large well matched good quality single
        unit or the rare patient with only one unit of suitable match and dose characteristics the
        cord blood graft can consist of a single unit as described in section 6.1 .

        Haploidentical Donor Inclusion Criteria:

        A HLA-haploidentical related donor will be selected as available as per standard MSKCC
        Adult BMT guidelines. Mismatched family members who are matched at more than 5 of 10
        HLA-loci are permitted. Factors to be taken into account when selecting a haplo-identical
        donor will include donor age, weight, health status and comorbidities, compliance, venous
        access, recipent donor specific HLA-antibody status, and NK cell alloreactivity.

          -  The donor must meet criteria outlined in the FACT-approved SOP for &quot;DONOR EVALUATION
             AND SELECTION FOR ALLOGENEIC TRANSPLANTATION&quot; in the Blood and Marrow Transplant

             URL:(https://one.mskcc.org/sites/pub/corp/bmt/Documents/D2_SOP_Donor%20Selection%20and
             %20Evaluation_04_2015.pdf)

             must agree to placement of a central catheter.

          -  The donor must be &gt;25 kg in weight.

        Haploidentical Donor Exclusion Criteria:

        Evidence of active infection (including active urinary tract infection, or upper
        respiratory tract infection) or evidence of viral hepatitis exposure on screening unless
        only HbsAb+ and HBV DNA negative.

          -  Medical or physical reason which makes the donor unlikely to tolerate or cooperate
             with growth factor therapy and leukapheresis.

          -  Factors which place the donor at increased risk for complications from leukapheresis
             or G-CSF therapy (e.g., active autoimmune disease, sickle cell trait, symptomatic
             coronary artery disease requiring therapy).

          -  Pregnancy (positive serum or urine β-HCG) or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing age
             must avoid becoming pregnant while on the study.
