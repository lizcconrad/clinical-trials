      This is a phase II multicenter, non-comparative, open label study in older previously
      untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia patients, requiring therapy, aimed at defining the
      efficacy profile (ORR, CRR and TTP) of pentostatin and cyclophosphamide given in combination
      with Ofatumumab (PCO).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common of the chronic lymphoid leukemias,
      comprising 30% of all adult leukemias. The majority of CLL patients are of advanced age.
      Currently, immunochemotherapy with Rituximab, Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide (RFC) is the
      standard of care in previously untreated patients with CLL requiring treatment. The
      combination of Pentostatin and Cyclophosphamide has generated excellent clinical response
      rates in pretreated B-CLL patients. Early data on the use of Ofatumumab as a single agent in
      Fludarabine-refractory CLL patients have been reported. Given the reported efficacy of
      chemo-immunotherapy combinations in CLL and the promising activity and toxicity profile of
      Pentostatin combinations, we designed a trial of Pentostatin, Cyclophosphamide, and
      Ofatumumab for previously untreated older patients with CLL. The aim is improving efficacy,
      in Rituximab resistant CLL, and toxicity considering the good profile of tolerability showed
      using Ofatumumab as single agent.
