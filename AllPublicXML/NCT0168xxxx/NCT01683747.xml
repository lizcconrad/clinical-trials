  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The premise of this study is that enteral tranexamic acid will help to maintain small bowel
      integrity, which is often compromised by critical illness due to inadequate cardiovascular
      perfusion (i.e., shock), and that maintenance of small bowel integrity will decrease
      morbidity in critically ill patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to provide preliminary efficacy and safety data on the
      enteral administration of a one-time dose of tranexamic acid to critically ill patients for
      the reduction of morbidity at 28 days after enrollment in the study.

      Secondary objectives of this study are to determine the efficacy of administration of enteral
      tranexamic acid in reducing intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length-of-stay, as well
      and mortality and morbidity at 6 months.
