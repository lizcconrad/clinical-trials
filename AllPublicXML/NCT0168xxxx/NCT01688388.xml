  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted to find out the effects (good and bad) of giving the
      full radiation treatment for breast cancer as a single dose of radiation during surgery for
      breast cancer. This single fraction intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons will study the
      toxicity, local control and cosmetic outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with certain types of breast cancer, one standard treatment is breast conserving
      surgery or lumpectomy (surgery to remove abnormal tissue or cancer from the breast and a
      small amount of normal tissue around it) followed by breast radiation. The radiation
      treatment in this situation usually lasts 3 to 5 1/2 weeks followed by 5-8 daily localized
      irradiation (or boost) treatments at the site where the lump was removed. During this study,
      the single dose of electron irradiation given at the surgical site during the operation will
      replace the radiation given after surgery.

    <intervention_name>Intraoperative Radiotherapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is delivered after completion of the lumpectomy and sentinel node procedure. IORT is performed on mobile or fixed linacs with variable electron energies in the range of 6-12 MeV prescribed to a dose of 21 Gy, with the prescription dose covering at least 90% of the Planning Target Volume (PTV). PTV is defined as a 3D volume of 1-2 cm beyond the former macroscopic tumor edge (excluding skin, limit to anterior rib surface: 5 Gy). The choice of electron energy as well as the cone applicator size has to account for minimum PTV requirements. Tissue depth measurement will be documented by intraoperative sonography.</description>
