  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II study. Treatment with LDK378 750 mg qd
      continued until the patient experienced unacceptable toxicity that precluded further
      treatment, discontinued treatment at the discretion of the investigator or patient, started a
      new anti-cancer therapy and/or died. LDK378 could be continued beyond RECIST-defined
      progressive disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator if, in the judgment of the
      investigator, there was evidence of clinical benefit. In these patients tumor assessment
      would continue as per the schedule of assessments until treatment with LDK378 was permanently
      discontinued. Patients who discontinued the study medication in the absence of progression
      continued to be followed for tumor assessment until the time of PD as assessed by the
      investigator

    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR) to LDK378 Per Investigator Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 cycles of 28 days up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ORR per RECIST 1.1 calculated as the percentage of patients with a best overall confirmed response defined as complete response or partial response (CR+PR) as assessed by investigator. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm 1. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.</description>

    <description>ORR (CR+PR) by BIRC is calculated as the percentage of patients with a best overall confirmed response defined as complete response or partial response (CR+PR) as assessed by BIRC. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm 1.

    <description>DOR, calculated as the time from the date of the first confirmed CR or PR to the first documented progression or death due to any cause, by investigator. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm 1. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR) by BIRC</measure>
    <time_frame>6 cycles of 28 days up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DOR, calculated as the time from the date of the first documented CR or PR to the first documented progression or death due to underlying cancer, by BIRC (Blinded Imaging Review Committee). CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm 1. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 cycles of 28 days up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DCR was calculated as the percentage of patients with best overall response of CR, PR, SD, or non-CR non-PD (NCRNPD), per RECIST 1.1 by investigator. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm 1. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or CR nor an increase in lesions which would qualify for PD. Non-CR/Non-PD (NCRNPD): refers to best overall responses that are neither CR nor PD per RECIST 1.1 criteria for patients with non-measurable disease only at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Time to Response (TTR) Per Investigator</measure>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>6 cycles of 28 days up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PFS, defined as the time from date of start of treatment to the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient had no event or when the patient received any further anticancer therapy in the absence of disease progression, progression-free survival was censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment.</description>

        <description>ORR (CR+PR) by BIRC is calculated as the percentage of patients with a best overall confirmed response defined as complete response or partial response (CR+PR) as assessed by BIRC. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm 1. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.</description>

        <title>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</title>
        <description>DCR was calculated as the percentage of patients with best overall response of CR, PR, SD, or non-CR non-PD (NCRNPD), per RECIST 1.1 by investigator. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm 1. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or CR nor an increase in lesions which would qualify for PD. Non-CR/Non-PD (NCRNPD): refers to best overall responses that are neither CR nor PD per RECIST 1.1 criteria for patients with non-measurable disease only at baseline.</description>
