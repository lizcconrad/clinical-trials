  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight patients with type 2 diabetes are often being treated with an intensified insulin
      therapy. However, in many cases, even a high insulin dosage (&gt; 100 U per day) does not
      achieve satisfying metabolic control. A new therapy option is necessary that makes it
      possible to lower the daily insulin requirement and to improve metabolic control. The aim of
      this study was to investigate whether a protein-rich meal replacement is suitable to lower
      the daily insulin requirement and to reduce HbA1c and body weight.

      The pilot study included patients with type 2 diabetes (n=22), that injected &gt;100 U insulin
      daily. During the first week, all three main meals were replaced with 50 g of a protein-rich
      meal replacement (Almased) (=1100 kcal per day). During weeks 2-4, only two meals were
      replaced and a protein-rich lunch was allowed. During weeks 5-12, only dinner was replaced.
      Clinical parameters were determined at the beginning of the study, after 4, 8 and 12 weeks as
      well as after 1.5 years of follow-up. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for the
      intention-to-treat analysis and Mann-Whitney test for subgroup analyses.
