  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of single ascending IV doses of a Factor
      IX (FIX) Gene Therapy in up to 16 Adults with Hemophilia B.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia B is a genetic X-linked bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in blood-clotting
      Factor IX (FIX) activity. FIX is synthesized in the liver and circulates in the blood as a
      proenzyme. Current treatment for hemophilia B is based on replacement of the deficient FIX
      with IV injections of recombinant FIX protein prophylactically or as needed to treat bleeding
      episodes. This clinical program will test a gene transfer approach involving the use of a
      gene delivery vector carrying a FIX gene. This first-in-humans study is intended to evaluate
      the safety, kinetics, and if possible, the dose of AskBio009 required to achieve stable
      plasma FIX activity between 10% and 40% of normal activity.

          -  Males age 18-75 years, inclusive

          -  Established hemophilia B with ≥3 hemorrhages per year requiring treatment with
             exogenous FIX OR use of FIX prophylaxis because of history of frequent bleeding
             episodes

          -  Plasma FIX activity ≤2% (&lt;1% for first cohort; then per protocol)

          -  Negative for active Hepatitis C virus (HCV), defined as Hepatitis C virus antibody

             acid (RNA) OR if Hepatitis C virus antibody positive must have ≥2 consecutive negative
             (undetectable) PCR tests for plasma HCV RNA at least 3 months apart, and negative at
             screening

        Exclusion Criteria:
