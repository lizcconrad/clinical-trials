      The purpose of the study is to investigate the possible benefits of giving the anti-HIV drug
      maraviroc to people who are taking darunavir/ritonavir alone for their HIV treatment. Many
      people successfully take only darunavir/ritonavir treatment for their HIV. However, there are
      some concerns that this treatment may not reach some areas of the body, such as the brain and
      spinal cord (central nervous system or CNS), as effectively as it does the bloodstream.

      There is already a large clinical study looking at any differences between 'conventional' HIV
      treatment with 3 drugs and single drug treatment with a protease inhibitor, also called PI
      monotherapy, such as darunavir/ritonavir. This includes differences in the effects on the
      CNS. However, this study will only be finished in 2013.

      The investigators know that maraviroc can reach the CNS very effectively. The investigators
      in this study will investigate the effect of adding maraviroc to darunavir/ritonavir
      monotherapy by looking at levels of inflammation within the fluid that surrounds the CNS,
      called cerebrospinal fluid or CSF.

      Maraviroc is a licensed drug for the treatment of HIV treatment.. It showed good results in 2
      clinical studies when it was taken by people whose HIV virus had developed resistance to
      previous HIV treatments.

      This study will also investigate safety as well as monitor effectiveness when patients take
      maraviroc is taken on top of normal treatment of darunavir/ritonavir monotherapy.

      Maraviroc has been shown to be present in the fluid that surrounds the brain in people taking
      Maraviroc. It is not known if whether the presence of Maraviroc has any impact on brain
      function. Therefore this study will also investigate brain (neurocognitive) functioning with
      a computer test and some written tests.

          3. has signed the Informed Consent Form voluntarily

          4. is willing to comply with the protocol requirements

          5. has an HIV-plasma viral load at screening &lt;40 copies/mL (one off retesting for blips

          6. has a CD4 cell count at Screening &gt;200 cells/mm3

          7. has been on a stable darunavir/ritonavir regimen 800/100 once daily alone for at least
             12 weeks at Screening, and willing to remain on this;

          8. estimated glomerular filtration rate (by MDRD or CG methods) &gt;60 ml/min at screening
