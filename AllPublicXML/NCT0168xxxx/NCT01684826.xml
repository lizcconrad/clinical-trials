    <textblock>
      ClarityIQ is a novel X-ray imaging technology, that combines advanced real-time image noise
      reduction algorithms, with state-of-the-art hardware to reduce patient entrance dose
      significantly. This is realized by anatomy-specific optimization of the full acquisition
      chain (grid switch, beam filtering, pulse width, spot size, detector and image processing
      engine) for every clinical task individually. Furthermore, smaller focal spot sizes and
      shorter pulses are used, which are known to positively influence image quality . The final
      effect on the clinical image quality is investigated in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluoroscopically guided procedures are associated with a risk of radiation injury to the
      skin, caused by high peak skin dose. The increasingly complex nature of many of the
      interventions performed requires the use of significant amounts of radiation for their
      completion. Of particular relevance to dose reduction concerns are obese patients, for whom
      additional radiation is often necessary to obtained sufficient diagnostic quality, as well as
      patients suffering from chronic total coronary occlusions (CTO), for whom long procedures
      with extended radiation time and contrast usage are common.

      In order to introduce a dose reduction technology the most important aspect is to validate
      the diagnostic image information. Philips has developed a new algorithm that is capable to
      process images with similar image quality but acquired at lower dose.

    <description>Overall proportion where diagnostic image quality of ClarityIQ is scored equal or better compared to AlluraXper by the blinded readers. Reading is performed by simultaneous visual comparison of the image quality of AlluraXper and ClarityIQ by multiple blinded reviewers.The images are presented in a randomized order.
The hypothesis is that the overall proportion where diagnostic image quality of ClarityIQ is scored equal or better is â‰¥ than 0.80. Combined for all raters, the lower bound of the one-sided 95% CI (lower bound of the two-sided 90% CI)is used.</description>
