  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the Stretta procedure and the Sham procedure efficiency
      6months post-procedure in reflux uncontrolled by intake of Inhibitors of Protons Pump (IPP)
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is over a period of 1 year. After checking eligibility, the patient will be
      randomised in double blind : stretta procedure /sham procedure. Control visits will take
      place after 4 weeks (on site), 8 weeks (by phone), 12 weeks (by phone), 18 weeks(on site) and
      24 weeks(on site).During the 24 weeks visit, the therapeutic success will be evaluated.

      In case of success, endoscopic control will be performed and the patient will come back on
      site at week 36 and 48 (end of study). In case of therapeutic failure, the stretta procedure
      will be proposed to the patient without breaking the blind for the 1st procedure. The
      procedure will be scheduled between week 24 and week 27. The patient will come back for a
      visit on site at weeks 31, 36 and 48 (end of visit)
