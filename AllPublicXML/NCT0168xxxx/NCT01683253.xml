      The purpose of this study is to see whether the ICDs(Impulse Control Disorder) are improved
      and neuropsychiatric traits related to ICD are changed or not when switching dopamine agonist
      to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinson's disease who have been treated with
      dopaminergic medications.

      -  PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To evaluate the improvement of mMIDI(modified version of Minnesota
           Impulsive Disorders Interview,Korean version) score from the baseline to 12 weeks or
           LOCF(Last Observation Carried Forward)

        -  SECONDARY OBJECTIVE i) To evaluate the improvement of neuropsychiatric profiles from the
           baseline to 12 weeks or LOCF ii) To evaluate the improvement of UPDRS(Unified
           Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale)Score from the baseline to 12 weeks or LOCF
