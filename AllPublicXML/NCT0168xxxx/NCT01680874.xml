  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a probiotic, when used together with
      standard treatment, is effective in reducing duration of symptoms and preventing recurrence
      of infection in older adults with a first episode of C. difficile infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics are live microorganisms that are available over the counter, widely used as
      dietary supplements or nutritional foods, and represent a low-cost, well tolerated, safe,
      non-antibiotic based strategy that may have efficacy as adjunctive treatment of infections
      without the attendant risks of promoting antimicrobial resistance. Certain probiotics have
      demonstrated inhibition of adherence of pathogenic bacteria and stimulation of systemic
      immune functions, possibly enhancing the body's ability to eradicate C. difficile in the
      gastrointestinal tract. However, limited data is available on the efficacy of probiotics for
      ameliorating C. difficile symptoms and reducing recurrence of C. difficile infection (CDI).
      The investigators propose a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial
      in older adult inpatients with a first episode of CDI to evaluate the efficacy of a probiotic
      combination, in conjunction with standard treatment, for reducing duration of diarrhea and
      recurrence of CDI.

    <description>The intervention will consist of the subject taking the study medication once a day for 4 weeks. During hospitalization, patients will be followed daily for diarrhea history, record of concomitant medications, adverse effects (AEs), and their response to treatment using a stool diary. Upon discharge from the hospital, patients will be contacted through weekly phone calls to assess diarrhea history, record of concomitant medications, adverse effects (AEs), and their response to treatment using a stool diary. At weeks 4 and 8, a stool sample will be collected, and the stool diary will be reviewed.</description>
