      The purpose of this study is to evaluate serial changes of neointimal coverage after
      everolimus-eluting stent implantation at 3-, 6- and 12-months by OCT examination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Late and very late stent thrombosis is current main issue after introduction of drug-eluting
      stents .Possible causes of these stent thromboses include thrombus formation resulting from
      delayed neointimal coverage, spasms occurring at the distal end of the stent implantation
      site, positive remodeling of coronary arteries caused by local immune reaction to paclitaxel
      or rapamycin, and vascular endothelial damage induced by the polymer. For BMS, neointimal
      coverage begins within the first one month after stent implantation and almost completes in
      three months. For DES, sirolimus eluting stents (SES) for example, neointimal coverage is
      markedly delayed after stent implantation and the exposed stent struts may be largely
      attributable to the occurrence of late stent thrombosis.

      On the other hand, everolimus eluting stents (EES), which have a thinner stent strut layer
      and improved polymer biocompatibility, it has been reported that earlier and more normal
      neointimal coverage can be achieved compared with other first-generation DESs, SES and
      paclitaxel eluting stents (PES). These findings suggest that coverage with vascular
      endothelium differs among different DES platforms. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has a
      resolution of 15 to 20 μm, which is approximately 10 times higher than that of intravascular
      ultrasound (IVUS). It is therefore necessary to use OCT to accurately evaluate
      cross-sectional images of the stent struts covered with vascular endothelium. However, no
      studies have reported the results of continuous observation and evaluation of EES covered
      with endothelium.

      Therefore, the investigators investigate time course of neointimal coverage of EES through
      detailed evaluation by OCT of neointimal coverage at 3, 6, and 12 months after stent
      implantation.
