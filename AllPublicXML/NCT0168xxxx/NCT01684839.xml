  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroma excision and digital nerve reconstruction remain the best option for the treatment of
      Painful Digital Neuroma (PDN). When the distal nerve end is preserved, conventional
      nonvascularized nerve grafting is the primary option to bridge the defect. The investigators
      hypothesize the pedicled nerve flap taken from the dorsal branch of the homolateral digital
      nerve is better than conventional methods for reconstruction of the digital nerve defect
      after painful neuroma resection.

      This study reports treatment of painful digital neuroma using a pedicled nerve flap taken
      from the dorsal branch of homolateral digital nerve. From May 2007 to March 2010, the
      patients had previous nerve injuries with or without nerve repair. The mechanisms of injury
      include sharp cut, avulsion and crush. The defects were between the middle of the distal
      phalanx and the palmar digital crease.

      Our selection criteria in this study included a patient with PDN in a scarred wound bed or
      poor coverage, a PDN located between the middle of the distal phalanx and the palmar digital
      crease, and a defect of the digital nerve after neuroma resection equal to or less than 3 cm
      in length. The exclusion criteria included a PDN in healthy soft tissue, a digital nerve
      defect longer than 3 cm, injury to the course of the pedicle or the donor nerve, and a thumb
      neuroma. A finger with a small distal end of the digital nerve was also excluded, because
      neurorrhaphy was extremely difficult in this situation.

    <measure>Static 2-point Discrimination Test</measure>
    <time_frame>20-26 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The Static 2-point Discrimination Test determined the minimal distance at which a subject can sense the presence of two needles. The modified American Society for Surgery of the Hand guidelines was used to stratify the 2PD measurements (excellent &lt;6 mm; good 6-10 mm; fair 11-15 mm; poor &gt;15 mm). The test points were at the center of the radial or ulnar portion of the finger pulp (i.e., injury side). Each area was tested 3 times with a discriminator (Ali Med, Dedham, MA). Two out of 3 correct answers were considered proof of perception before proceeding to another lower value. We stopped at 4mm as a limit of 2PD and consider this normal. The measurements were performed at a single time point at the final follow up.</description>
