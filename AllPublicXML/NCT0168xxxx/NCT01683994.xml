      Background:

      - Cabozantinib is a drug that slows the growth of blood vessels that feed tumors. It is
      approved for medullary thyroid cancer. However, studies have shown that prostate tumors
      respond to it. Docetaxel and prednisone are standard treatments for advanced prostate cancer.
      Researchers want see if adding cabozantinib to these two drugs can be a safe and effective
      treatment for this type of cancer.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of cabozantinib with standard treatments for advanced
      prostate cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced prostate cancer that has not
      responded to standard treatments.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. Imaging studies will also be performed.

        -  Participants will receive the cancer drugs over 21-day cycles of treatment. They will
           take docetaxel and cabozantinib on day 1 of each cycle. Each docetaxel infusion will
           take about 1 hour. They will also take prednisone by mouth twice each day.

        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.

        -  Participants will continue to take the study drugs for as long as their cancer does not
           worsen and side effects are not too severe.

      Background:

        -  Docetaxel is established as first-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic castrate
           resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However; it is increasingly recognized that combining
           docetaxel with other agents of clinical activities without overlapping toxicities could
           simultaneously target different cellular signaling pathways vital for tumor survival,
           producing either additive or synergistic activities.

        -  Inhibition of angiogenesis, either as a stand-alone approach or in combination with
           chemotherapy, has demonstrable antitumor efficacy against CRPC and there are several
           antiangiogenic agents that are now in clinical trials in this population of patients.

        -  Cabozantinib (XL184) was developed as an inhibitor of both angiogenesis and of its
           resistance mechanism. It is an inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases including
           c-Met, VEGFR2 and RET.

        -  In single agent clinical studies, cabozantinib demonstrated, broad anti-tumor activities
           across many solid tumor types.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety profile of cabozantinib in combination with docetaxel and
           prednisone, and to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) as recommended phase II
           dose in combination with docetaxel.

        -  To determine the relative efficacy (in terms of PFS) of docetaxel and cabozantinib
           compared to docetaxel alone

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have progressive metastatic CRPC. There must be radiographic evidence of
           disease after primary treatment with surgery or radiotherapy. If patients had been on
           flutamide, they must have disease progression at least 4 weeks after withdrawal.
           Patients on bicalutamide or nilutamide must have progression at least 6 weeks after
           withdrawal. Withdrawal criteria apply only to patients on the above anti-androgens for
           at least the prior 6 months.

        -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age and able to give informed consent.

        -  Patients in the Phase II portion of the study must have progressed on abiraterone or
           enzalutamide

      Design:

        -  The initial phase I portion of this study will test fixed dose docetaxel and prednisone
           in combination with cabozantinib at three escalating doses. Using a standard 3 + 3
           design, three patients will initially be treated at each dose level until MTD has been
           defined.

        -  An expansion cohort will then be enrolled at the MTD to further characterize safety,
           toxicity and pharmacokinetic data and to obtain preliminary information on the efficacy
           of the combination treatment.

        -  In Phase II, patients will be enrolled to a randomized two-arm cohort comparing
           docetaxel in combination with cabozantinib to docetaxel alone with a primary endpoint of
           PFS.

        -  The accrual ceiling for the study, including the Phase I dose escalation and the
           expansion phases as well as the Phase II randomized phase, is set at 81.

        use both a barrier method and a second method of birth control during the course of the
        study and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s). Should a woman become pregnant
        or suspect she is pregnant while her partner is participating in this study, she should
        inform her treating physician immediately.

        -Patients enrolled on the randomized portion of the study must have had disease progression
        on arbiraterone or enzalutamide.

                         -  gastrointestinal perforation

                         -  bowel obstruction or gastric outlet obstruction

                         -  intra-abdominal abscess. Note: Complete resolution of an
                            intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed prior to initiating treatment
                            with cabozantinib even if the abscess occurred more than 6 months ago.

               -  Other disorders associated with a high risk of fistula formation including PEG
                  tube placement within 3 months before the first dose of study therapy or
                  concurrent evidence of intraluminal tumor involving the trachea and esophagus.

                    -  Other clinically significant disorders such as:

                         -  active infection requiring intravenous treatment within 10 days of
                            starting protocol

                         -  serious non-healing wound/ulcer/bone fracture within 28 days before the
                            first dose of study treatment

                         -  history of organ transplant

                         -  concurrent uncompensated hypothyroidism or thyroid dysfunction within 7
                            days before the first dose of study treatment

                         -  history of major surgery as follows:

                              -  Major surgery within 3 months of the first dose of cabozantinib if
                                 there were no wound healing complications or within 6 months of
                                 the first dose of cabozantinib if there were wound complications

                              -  Minor surgery within 1 months of the first dose of cabozantinib if
                                 therewere no wound healing complications or within 3 months of the
                                 first dose of cabozantinib if there were wound complications.

        In addition, complete wound healing from prior surgery must be confirmed at least 28 days
        before the first dose of cabozantinib irrespective of the time from surgery

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with the study agents. In addition,
             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Patients who require taking drugs that are strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 and
             cannot be switched to an alternative medication.

        Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly
        consult a frequently-updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/;
        medical reference texts such as the Physicians Desk Reference may also provide this
        information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be
        counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications
        need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-thecounter medicine or
        herbal product.

          -  Patients with greater than or equal to grade 2 peripheral neuropathy at baseline.

          -  The subject has had treatment with docetaxel for the treatment of metastatic
             castratesensitive prostate cancer within 6 months before the first dose of study
             treatment.

          -  The subject has had progression of prostate cancer during 6 cycles of prior docetaxel
             treatment for castrate sensitive disease.

          -  The subject has received chemotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.
