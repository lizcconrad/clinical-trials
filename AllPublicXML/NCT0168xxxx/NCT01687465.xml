  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lasers are important therapy in glaucoma. They are a pivotal point in treatment between
      medical and surgical care. Over the last 10 years a new laser has emerged as the usual laser
      treatment: Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT). SLT works as well as the older laser used:
      argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT). However SLT has many theoretical benefits over ALT
      including causing less damage to the tissue it affects. One of the potential patient centered
      benefits of this laser is that it may be repeatable. It is even possible that the old laser
      ALT may be useable after an SLT treatment. This study aims to uncover whether repeat laser is
      possible after SLT and if so which laser is more effective (ALT vs SLT). The potential of
      repeating laser therapies may delay surgical treatment and its complications. Also
      understanding which laser to use will help eye doctors know how to treat their patients at
      this point of the disease.

    <description>Up to the year 2005, the vast majority of ophthalmologists used Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) as the mode of laser therapy. ALT is effective but its most significant problem is that its effectiveness decreases with re-treatment since the tissue it targets (the trabecular meshwork) is changed by the laser rendering repeat treatments less effective.</description>

    <description>Post 2005, a newer mode of laser therapy, selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) has emerged as the standard of care laser. There are many potential advantages to SLT but to date these advantages are only theoretical. The most important potential clinical advantage of SLT is that it causes less damage to the tissue it targets.</description>

    <description>With Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT), thermal energy is used directed towards the Trabecular Meshwork (the site of aqueous drainage from the eye),which causes focal scarring of trabecular meshwork, thus enable fluid drainage more effectively. However, this procedure may not be repeatable since it causes too much damage to the trabecular meshwork.</description>

    <description>Selective laser trabeculoplasty is a relatively newer technology that uses a Nd:YAG laser to target specific cells within the trabecular meshwork. SLT does not cause coagulative damage to the trabecular meshwork, and thus has the advantage of being repeatable.</description>
