    <textblock>
      The folate receptor is overexpressed in many types of cancer, including ovarian and
      endometrial cancer, and the level of folate receptor expression increases with the stage of
      the disease. Technetium Tc 99m EC20 (99mTc-EC20; FolateScan), a folate-targeted diagnostic
      radiopharmaceutical, is designed to bind to the folate receptor. Thus, FolateScan may provide
      an effective method to determine folate receptor-positive (FR+) target tumors, thereby
      assisting in the identification of those patients who may benefit from folate-targeted
      therapy.

      This phase 2, two-center, open-label, single-treatment group, within-patient-controlled study
      was conducted to:

        -  Expand the safety database and gather data on the percentage of patients with known or
           suspected ovarian carcinoma or recurrent endometrial carcinoma who show increased uptake
           of FolateScan in tumors (primary objective).

        -  Calculate the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and
           negative predictive value of FolateScan compared with immunohistochemical (IHC) staining
           (secondary objective).

    <description>Patients received 2 intravenous (IV) injections: 1 mg of folic acid (to reduce the uptake of FolateScan in normal tissues), followed 1 to 3 minutes later by 0.1 mg of EC20 labeled with 15 to 25 mCi of technetium-99m (99mTc) over 30 seconds in a total injection volume of 1 to 2 mL.2 Each injection was given as a slow IV push via a free-flowing indwelling IV catheter in an upper extremity vein (i.e., in the antecubital fossa).</description>
