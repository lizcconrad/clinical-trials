  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study investigates effects of EEG-based low frequency, low emission magnetic
      cortical stimulation in comparison to a sham treatment in subjects with moderate to severe
      depressive disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with functional impairment and disability, and
      results in a significant burden on the affected individual, his or her family, and society in
      general. Psychopharmacological therapy has been shown to be effective, but may be accompanied
      by significant side effects. The investigators propose an alternative model, based on the
      relationship between symptoms, brain metabolism, and neural activity as recorded with
      electroencephalography (EEG). Subjects with MDD often have decreased brain metabolism,
      accompanied by increased EEG activity in the alpha band. The investigators hypothesis is that
      a gentle, non-significant risk, sinusoidal magnetic field above the subject's scalp, which
      oscillates at precisely his or her Intrinsic Alpha Frequency (IAF) can take advantage of this
      relationship to reduce symptoms without the significant side effects associated with
      pharmaceuticals. The investigators propose a 4-week, sham controlled, randomized,
      double-blind multi-center feasibility study to determine the efficacy of synchronized low
      energy magnetic fields delivered at the subject's IAF to treat MDD. Treatment will be given
      concomitant to the subject's existing medication, and will occur 5 days per week at the
      clinical site. Target enrollment is 45 adult subjects diagnosed with MDD.

    <description>Outcome measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and calculated as percent change in severity score from baseline until the end of the 4th week of treatment.
The HAMD-17 scale ranges between 0-54, with higher numbers indicating more severe symptoms. 0-7 is generally accepted to be within the normal range (or in clinical remission), while a score of 20 or higher indicates moderate to severe depression.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) at Baseline and the End of Week 4 of Treatment.</title>
        <description>Outcome measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and calculated as percent change in severity score from baseline until the end of the 4th week of treatment.
The HAMD-17 scale ranges between 0-54, with higher numbers indicating more severe symptoms. 0-7 is generally accepted to be within the normal range (or in clinical remission), while a score of 20 or higher indicates moderate to severe depression.</description>

        <population>52 subjects were randomized into the study. Of those, 7 dropped in the first week due to difficulties driving to the study site. An intent-to-treat analysis was performed on the remaining 45 subjects.</population>
