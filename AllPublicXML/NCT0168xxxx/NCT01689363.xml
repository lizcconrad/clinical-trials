    <measure>Positive Allergic Reaction to Amphadase® in the Per-Protocol Population (PPP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 minutes after the final study drug injection</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects received intradermal injections at 4 injection sites following a randomized configuration of study medications. Injection sites were monitored for any characteristic immediate reactions after the study drug injections. A positive reaction consisted of: a) reaction appearing within 30 minutes of drug placement; b) wheal (&gt;8 mm) with or without pseudopods; c) reaction accompanying erythema; and d) reaction accompanying localized itching.</description>
