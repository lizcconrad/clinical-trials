  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most premature babies have difficulty breathing at birth and need help (what we call
      resuscitation). The treatment for this is to gently inflate their lungs with a resuscitation
      device and a facemask. The device commonly used is a T-Piece infant resuscitator (which we
      call the T-Piece) and is used at The Royal Alexandra Hospital and all round the world.

      To gentle inflate an infants lung the clinical team put a face mask around your baby's mouth
      and nose. The clinical team tries to achieve a good seal between the face and the mask. A
      problem of mask ventilation is that air can escape between the mask and the face (what we
      call mask leak). Currently, two different types of facemasks (&quot;Laerdal mask&quot; or &quot;Fisher &amp;
      Paykel mask&quot;) are routinely used in the delivery room at The Royal Alexandra Hospital.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if one facemask is leaking less between the face and
      the mask.

      We will use a Laerdal round mask (Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway) compared to a Fisher &amp; Paykel
      (FP) (Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Zealand) 'round' neonatal resuscitation mask.
      The two point top hold for Laerdal 'round' mask and the rim hold for the Fisher &amp; Paykel
      mask.

      A Respiratory Function Monitor will be placed between the face mask and the ventilation
      device. It uses a small (dead space 1 mL) flow sensor to measure gas flow in and out of a
      face mask. This signal is automatically integrated to provide inspired and expired tidal
      volume. The difference equals the leak from the face mask. It also calculates respiratory
      rate and minute ventilation, measures spontaneous inspirations and ventilation pressures. The
      signals of airway flow, tidal volumes, airway pressure, inspired oxygen concentration,
      temperature, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate will be digitised and recorded at
      200Hz using the Spectra physiological recording program (a customised neonatal respiratory
      physiology program).

      We will compare the % of mask leak within the two face masks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Preterm infants &lt;32 weeks gestation born at The Royal Alexandra Hospital who require
             resuscitation in the delivery room will be recorded.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants will be excluded from final analysis if they have a congenital abnormality or
             condition that might have an adverse effect on breathing or ventilation, including:
             Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia. Infants will also be excluded if their parents refuse
             to give consent to this study.

        Participants will be included in the first minutes after birth if they require mask
        ventilation for poor respiratory effort. Data will be collected from the Hospital chart
        until discharge at around 40 weeks gestation.
