  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of the medication paroxetine on symptoms
      of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the brain in women with a history of PTSD related
      to childhood abuse. The hypothesis is that paroxetine will result in an improvement in PTSD
      symptoms accompanied by changes in brain functional response to reminders of childhood
      trauma.

      The main purpose of this study was to look at the effects of paroxetine on PTSD symptoms and
      brain function in women with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to childhood abuse.
      Participants underwent baseline assessment with of PTSD symptoms measured with the Clinician
      Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and brain function during exposure to traumatic scripts of
      childhood abuse. Participants then were treated in a randomized double-blind fashion with
      paroxetine or placebo for three months, followed by a repeat of these assessments.

      Specific Aims of this proposal were therefore to:

        -  Assess the effects of paroxetine on PTSD symptoms

        -  Assess the effects of paroxetine on brain function in conjunction with exposure to
           traumatic scripts using positron emission tomography (PET) with O-15 water

    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Study (Up to 52 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS is a 30-item questionnaire of PTSD symptomatology that provides continuous measures of symptom severity and frequency. CAPS-IV total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the 17 DSM-IV PTSD symptoms. Each symptom is rated for severity based on frequency and intensity on a scale of 0-4 for a total possible severity score per symptom of 8. Criterion E (items 18-19) is duration of symptoms (minimum of one month to make the diagnosis). Items 20-30 are optional. CAPS score is based on items 1-17, CAPS score has a potential range of 0-136, with higher scores indicating greater severity of PTSD symptoms. CAPS was performed before and after treatment with paroxetine or placebo in PTSD patients.</description>

    <measure>Change in Brain Blood Flow Assessed by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 Months Post Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were exposed to traumatic scripts versus neutral scripts before and after treatment with paroxetine or placebo. Brain blood flow was measured using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) which analyzes brain imaging data sequences. Statistical Parametric Mapping software is only capable of producing a single z-score for each Arm/Group. Data for each participant can not be generated using this software and therefore are not available to summarize in the data table below. Regional blood flow was compared for stress and neutral conditions and before and after treatment with paroxetine or placebo. Higher z-scores indicate an increase in regional blood flow to the medial prefrontal cortex under stress conditions for the 3 month time point relative to baseline. Statistical Parametric Mapping software is only capable of producing a single z-score for each Arm/Group.</description>

        <title>Mean Clinical Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS) Score</title>
        <description>The CAPS is a 30-item questionnaire of PTSD symptomatology that provides continuous measures of symptom severity and frequency. CAPS-IV total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the 17 DSM-IV PTSD symptoms. Each symptom is rated for severity based on frequency and intensity on a scale of 0-4 for a total possible severity score per symptom of 8. Criterion E (items 18-19) is duration of symptoms (minimum of one month to make the diagnosis). Items 20-30 are optional. CAPS score is based on items 1-17, CAPS score has a potential range of 0-136, with higher scores indicating greater severity of PTSD symptoms. CAPS was performed before and after treatment with paroxetine or placebo in PTSD patients.</description>

        <title>Change in Brain Blood Flow Assessed by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)</title>
        <description>Participants were exposed to traumatic scripts versus neutral scripts before and after treatment with paroxetine or placebo. Brain blood flow was measured using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) which analyzes brain imaging data sequences. Statistical Parametric Mapping software is only capable of producing a single z-score for each Arm/Group. Data for each participant can not be generated using this software and therefore are not available to summarize in the data table below. Regional blood flow was compared for stress and neutral conditions and before and after treatment with paroxetine or placebo. Higher z-scores indicate an increase in regional blood flow to the medial prefrontal cortex under stress conditions for the 3 month time point relative to baseline. Statistical Parametric Mapping software is only capable of producing a single z-score for each Arm/Group.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, 3 Months Post Treatment</time_frame>
        <population>Statistical analyses yielded image data sets in which the values assigned to individual voxels correspond to the t-statistic of the difference in brain blood flow between conditions. Statistical images were displayed with values of z score units.</population>
