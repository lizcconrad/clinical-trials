  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, open-label study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of vanucizumab as a single agent or in combination
      with atezolizumab in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Cohorts
      of participants will receive escalating doses of vanucizumab, fixed dose of vanucizumab (MTD
      and/or recommended phase two dose [RP2D]), and fixed dose of vanucizumab in combination with
      atezolizumab, intravenously every 2 weeks.
