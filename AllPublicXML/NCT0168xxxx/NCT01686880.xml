        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  Cirrhotic liver demonstrated by typical liver dysmorphy on imaging and/or liver
             biopsy.

          -  HCC with at least one lesion measuring more than 1 cm in diameter with a single
             dynamic imaging technique (CT or MRI), showing intense arterial uptake followed by
             washout of contrast in the venous-delayed phases, or diagnosed by biopsy.

          -  Borderline resectable disease eligible for surgical resection or radiofrequency
             destruction.

          -  No extra-hepatic dissemination.

          -  ECOG Performance status &lt; 2.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Signed written informed consent (approved by an Independent Ethics Committee) obtained
             prior to any study specific baseline procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Decompensated cirrhosis (Child Pugh B, C).

          -  Extra-hepatic tumour spread.

          -  Previous or concomitant malignancies within five years other than basal cell carcinoma
             of the skin.

          -  Pregnancy, lactation or refusal to use adequate contraceptive measures (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control, abstinence).

          -  Pre-existing other hepatic disease (liver abscess, hepatic sarcoidosis or
             tuberculosis, sclerosing cholangitis, …).

          -  Previous trans-arterial radioembolization (TARE).

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition of the administered materials.

          -  Bleeding diathesis, history of cardiovascular ischemic disease or cerebrovascular
             incident within the last six months.

          -  Major surgery within four weeks.

          -  Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Uncontrolled Diabetes.
