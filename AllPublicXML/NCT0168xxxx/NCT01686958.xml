      This study is to evaluate that the MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound therapy system is safe
      and feasible to ablate prostate tissue in men with localized prostate cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Profound Medical Inc. has developed a novel technology called the MRI-guided transurethral
      ultrasound therapy system. The technology is developed for patients with organ confined
      prostate cancer. The therapeutic endpoint of this technology is thermal coagulation of
      prostate tissue.

      The treatment is conducted completely within an MRI suite, which enables real-time
      temperature images of the heated region to be acquired as the ultrasonic treatment is
      delivered. Using MRI thermometry during treatment, dynamic temperature feedback control over
      the intensity of the ultrasound beams and rotation of the Ultrasound Applicator can shape the
      pattern of thermal coagulation accurately and precisely in the prostate gland, thereby
      reducing the risk of possible damage to important surrounding anatomy such as the rectum,
      urinary sphincters, neurovascular bundles and pelvic bone. This coagulation method,
      therefore, has the potential to have lower complication rates than conventional therapies.

    <measure>Evaluate the frequency and severity of device / treatment related adverse events associated with the use of the investigational system to coagulate prostate tissue.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months from the Treatment Date</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of adverse events per patient will be evaluated and reported in accordance with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) standard published by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the effectiveness of the investigation system to thermally coagulate prostate tissue conforming to the target volume with a high degree of accuracy and precision.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months from the Treatment Date</time_frame>
    <description>• Conformal thermal coagulation of prostate tissue will be determined quantitatively using two measures of targeting accuracy: i. Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC - unitless from 0 to 1), is a statistical validation metric to measure the degree of spatial overlap between two regions.
ii. Over- and under-targeted volumes (outside the target volume ± ½ voxel margin), representing the amount of tissue ≥ target temperature (55°C) outside the target volume and &lt; target temperature (55°C) inside the target volume, respectively. The over- and under-targeted volumes are expressed as a % of the target volume.
• Coagulation of prostate tissue will be confirmed by measurement of the peripheral region of enhancement surrounding the Non-Perfused Volume (NPV) determined from Contrast-Enhanced MR images (CE-MRI) acquired immediately after treatment and at 12 months after treatment.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>In addition to patient safety and treatment feasibility, initial efficacy of using the investigation system to achieve adequate tumor control for their localized prostate cancer will also be evaluated.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months from the treatment date</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the initial effectiveness of the treatment to achieve disease control at 6 months based on biopsy results.
Characterize the pattern of PSA response in the first 12 months following treatment.
Evaluate quality of life using the UCLA-PCI-SF &amp; SF-12 v2, IPSS and IIEF standardized questionnaires in the first 12 months following treatment.</description>
