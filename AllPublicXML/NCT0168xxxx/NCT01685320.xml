  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forces applied on soft upper tissues by different laryngoscope blades during direct
      laryngoscopy and intubation are considered to be major stimuli to cause serious damages to
      the patients. The aim of this study is to compare the force and pressure applied to soft
      tissue in order to achieve the same glottis view comparing direct laryngoscopy and
      videolaryngoscopy in vivo.

      Forces applied on soft upper tissues by different laryngoscope blades during direct
      laryngoscopy and intubation are considered to be major stimuli to cause serious damages to
      the patients, such as local injures to incisors, larynx and spinal column, or hemodynamic
      changes in heart rate and/or blood pressure due to autonomic nervous system stimulation.

      In order to reduce risk of such injures, indirect videolaryngoscopy provides the advantage of
      an easier laryngeal visualization with less need for the mouth-pharyngeal-laryngeal axes
      alignment, thereby reducing the detrimental effects above mentioned.

      The aim of this study is to measure the minimal force exertion to achieve not only glottis
      view but also a successful intubation, comparing GlideScope and Macintosh laryngoscope, in
      patients with normal airway conditions. Furthermore, The investigators measured the following
      parameters: pressure distribution upon the blade; time required to visualize the glottis;
      time required to complete oro-tracheal intubation.

        <description>Since the time needed for laryngoscopy and intubation could represent one of the major contributors to the stress response during these procedures, times to achieve the glottis visualization and to perform the entire intubation were recorded.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Patients studied were classified with “normal airways”, while difficult intubations were not considered.
We excluded patients with CL grade 2 or greater.
