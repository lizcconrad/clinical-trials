    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinic trial is to testify the efficacy of using new and noninvasive therapy,
      called simultaneous &quot;Magnetic and Oxygen Treatment along Meridians and Collaterals&quot; (MOMC),
      to treat Bell's Palsy.

    <textblock>
      Between June 1998 and January 2005, a total of 3002 subjects with BP were evaluated, 882
      patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and entered the study.

      Patients were randomly assigned to either the prednisone-valacyclovir group(group 1) or the
      magnetic-oxygen group(group 2) . Among the 882 patients completing the study,825 patients in
      group 1 received prednisone, given as a single dose of 40 mg daily for 5 days; the dose will
      then be reduced by 10 mg per 5 day, with a total treatment time of 20 days.while taking
      valacyclovir 400 mg in three doses daily for 10 days. 57 patients in group 2 received
      magnetic-oxygen treatment:MOMC treatment was given as daily 20 min section for 10 days with
      2~3 days of intermission between;Oxygen therapy was given simultaneously at a flow rate of
      2~3.0 L / min for the same duration during all acupuncture sections.

      Clinical evaluation for the severity of paralysis was performed immediately before and after
      the treatment using the facial nerve grading (FNG) scores of House and Brackmann system.
