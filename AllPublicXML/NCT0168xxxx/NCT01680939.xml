  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year thousands of young children with obstructive sleep apnea undergo surgery which
      requires them to be prescribed pain medication. The current standard in North America is
      administration of opioids, mainly codeine or morphine; however in many areas of the world
      including Canada, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen are used. Some
      North American surgeons are uncertain regarding the potential of ibuprofen to increase
      bleeding following surgery. The results of research studies have been inconclusive overall.
      Due to recent codeine fatalities in children following adenotonsillectomy, codeine has been
      removed from the formulary at many Pediatric institutions. Some surgeons have begun to use
      oral morphine as an alternate to codeine, which necessitates the need to find safe
      alternative analgesics in this treatment group.

      The primary objectives of this study is to assess the safety(1) and efficacy (2) of morphine
      and ibuprofen in children with sleep apnea.

      An interim analysis will be conducted after recruitment of 70 patients, to monitor both
      safety and efficacy
