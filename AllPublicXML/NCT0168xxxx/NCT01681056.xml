  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to analyze the efficacy of autosuggestion for geriatric patients's quality
      of life and its impact to psycho-neuro-endocrine-immune pathways. The primary outcome is
      quality of life.

      The hypothesis of this study is that autosuggestion will increase geriatric patient's quality
      of life based on its impact to psycho-neuro-endocrine-immune pathways.

      Geriatric patients diagnosed with multipathology after getting information and signing
      informed consent will be included in this trial. Autosuggestion was created by patients
      according to their preferences, modified by researcher to accomplish autosuggestion
      principles, recorded in a tape to be heard by walkman daily for 30 days. Intervention and
      control groups received usual standard medical therapy.

      Baseline data were collected within one week after admission. Then the subject will be
      followed up for 30 days. Primary outcome was quality of life measured by COOP chart, analyze
      using on treatment analysis. Secondary outcomes were serum cortisol, interleukin-2,
      interleukin-6, IFN-ϒ (Interferon gamma), and N Acetyl Aspartat/ creatine ratio in limbic and
      paralimbic system by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.
