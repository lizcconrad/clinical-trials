      This is a pilot study utilizing trans-abdominal ECG and Doppler Ultrasounds to assess the
      feasibility of extracting fECGs in a volunteer population.

    <measure>Beat-to-beat fetal heart rate will be compared to the Doppler result.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Beat-to-beat fetal heart rate will be compared to the Doppler result using Pearson Correlation. Timing of PR, QT, and QS, if visible, will be compared with published normative values from the neonatology literature as these values are not otherwise obtainable in an ongoing pregnancy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the presence of other fECG intervals.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The fECG Separation Algorithm used in this research incorporates the filtering of noise of very high level as compared with the signal to be retrieved , in combination with employment of SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) methods.</description>

          -  Subjects must be pregnant women at least 18 years of age.

          -  Subject's fetus must be between the gestational ages of 16 weeks and term.

          -  Subjects must be able to tolerate 20 minutes (per fetus for which trans-abdominal ECG
             and Doppler ultrasounds will be performed) in the supine position.

          -  Subjects are willing to provide informed consent and are willing to participate in all
             procedures necessary to complete the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:
