  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Workers exposed to asbestos are at high risk of lung cancer. Medical follow-up of this
      population relies on repeated CT-scans which are more accurate for detection of peripheral
      lesions, and expose to X-rays and to risk of false-positives. Analysis of sputum using
      automate cytometry may be of interest in this population, alone or in combination with
      CT-scan.

      An ancillary study will evaluate the interest of blood predictive biomarkers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  High professional asbestos exposure

          -  Member of a former cohort recruited between 2000 and 2006 in Caen, Rouen and Le Havre
             (inclusion criteria: 50-75 years at the time of initial recruitment, high intermittent
             asbestos exposure &gt;= 1 year, or high discontinuous asbestos exposure &gt;=10 years). All
             the living members of the cohort will be contacted: a maximum of 1000 subjects is
             expected, probably less.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Personal history of lung cancer

          -  Refusal of the study protocol

          -  Uncontrolled asthma or lung failure
