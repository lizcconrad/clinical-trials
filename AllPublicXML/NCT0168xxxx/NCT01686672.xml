      This study will demonstrate feasibility and collect pilot data via a pilot randomized trial
      of 20 participants on the effectiveness of a web-based delivery system of behavioral plus
      nutrition intervention for parents of children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) ages 4 to 9 years of
      age that has been found to be efficacious in face to face delivery.

    <textblock>
      Optimizing nutritional status and growth improves health outcomes and survival in children
      with cystic fibrosis (CF). Better pulmonary function, as measured by forced expiratory rate
      in 1 second (FEV1), is associated with body mass index (BMI) above the 50th percentile for
      age and gender for children with CF1. Evidence based practice guidelines recommend that
      nutritional treatment for children with CF ages 2 to 20 years should aim to achieve and
      maintain a BMI &gt; 50th percentile, however across 117 CF centers in the United States 57% of
      girls and 56% of boys failed to meet this recommendation1. The investigators have developed a
      highly effective behavioral plus nutrition intervention (BE IN CHARGE) and demonstrated its
      efficacy when delivered face-to-face to produce weight gain and its superiority over
      nutrition education alone. Although endorsed by the CF Foundation as an evidence-based
      treatment, it is not available to most CF Centers or families due to lack of trained
      personnel, cost, and distance issues. With funding from the CF Foundation the investigators
      developed a web-based delivery system of their efficacious behavioral plus nutrition
      intervention for parents of children with CF ages 4 to 9 years of age. Using a Place Outcomes
      Award the investigators have conducted beta testing of the web-intervention and made
      appropriate modifications. The current study represents the next steps in refining and
      testing our web-based intervention. This study will demonstrate feasibility and collect pilot
      data on the effectiveness of the intervention in a pilot randomized trial of 20 treatment
      na√Øve participants.

    <description>BeInCharge has two components: an electronic diet tracker and a 7 session intervention. The 7 treatment sessions are designed to be completed over a 7 to 10 week period. Each treatment module includes both a nutrition education and child behavior management component. Treatment sessions should be completed every 7 to 10 days, while the electronic diet tracker requires daily input.</description>
