  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people with intellectual disability have challenging behaviour which often has serious
      consequences such as the prescription of long term medication, in-patient admissions and
      disruption of normal daily activities. Community intellectual disability services may have
      difficulties in helping people with challenging behavior. Available research suggests that
      Positive Behavior Support (PBS), a training system that teaches staff how to manage these
      situations, can benefit service users who may show improvements in challenging behavior and
      quality of life. The investigators do not know of any study so far that has examined the
      clinical and cost effectiveness of PBS that is provided by staff in routine clinical practice
      in community intellectual disability services. If PBS proved to be better than treatment as
      usual, it would have important implications for the management of a very vulnerable group of
      service users. In this trial, health staff will receive accredited training in PBS available
      in a manual written by PBS experts. It will give details of how to understand challenging
      behavior and develop a management plan and how to implement it and monitor whether it has
      achieved its goals. Twenty community intellectual disability services and 260 service users
      with mild to severe intellectual disability and challenging behavior will be invited to take
      part in the study. The sample size calculations are based on our pilot study and allow for
      non participation of 10% and inflation due to the number of community intellectual disability
      teams and staff that will take part. The teams will be randomly allocated into one of two
      conditions. Half will be in the PBS arm (but will also have treatment as usual) and half will
      be in the treatment as usual only group. The investigators will carry out assessments of
      challenging behavior, use of services, quality of life, mental health, aggression and family
      and paid carer burden at six and 12 months. The investigators will monitor treatment fidelity
      and the investigators will talk to a sample of paid and family carers, service users, staff
      and managers about what they think of the treatment and how best the investigators can
      deliver it in routine care. The main outcome is reduction in challenging behavior at one year
      after the randomization. The investigators will also carry out a health economic evaluation
      to examine the costs and consequences of staff training in PBS.

    <description>Most community intellectual disability services provide a range of health interventions that include but are not limited to psychiatric assessment and management, nursing support, psychology, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and counselling. There may be some variation in resources but service users with challenging behaviour are likely to receive a range of broadly defined behavioural management and pharmacological interventions. Staff is routinely supervised by their clinical managers weekly.</description>
