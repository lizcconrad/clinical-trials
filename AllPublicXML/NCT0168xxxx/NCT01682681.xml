  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term retention rate of topiramate in
      participants with epilepsy (seizure disorder).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (a medical research study in which participants and researchers are
      told which treatments the participants are receiving, &quot;unblinded&quot;), single-arm, prospective
      (study following participants forward in time), observational (a clinical study in which
      participants identified as belonging to study groups are assessed for biomedical or health
      outcomes) and multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study) study of topiramte in participants with epilesy. The study population
      will be all the epilepsy participants visiting outpatient study center over a period of two
      months. Topiramate will be administered as per Investigator's discretion for 52 weeks.
      Participants will visit the trial site for evaluation of endpoint at Baseline, Week 12, Week
      26, and Week 52. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by percentage of participants which
      will be retained to topiramate treatment uptil Week 52. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
