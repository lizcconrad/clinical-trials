  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to develop and test a simple community-based diagnostic
      algorithm for omphalitis in sub-Saharan Africa. To date, there has been no validated
      community-based algorithms developed and tested in the sub-Saharan context where the
      manifestations of omphalitis presentation may vary and diagnosis could be potentially more
      challenging in infants with darker skin color. Given the current attention to cord care at
      the global and national policy level, validated community-based algorithms will be needed to
      allow primary health workers to identify cord infections and reduce associated morbidity.

      After obtaining guardian informed consent, newborns aged 1-10 days presenting to the health
      facility for routine or sick visits will undergo two independent, parallel evaluations;
      first, by a community level worker and second, by a Zambian medical doctor (gold standard). A
      third independent assessment of a photo of the cord will be performed remotely by a
      board-certified pediatrician. Using the on-site clinician as the gold standard, the
      community-based algorithm and the photo assessment will be tested for concordance and the
      sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm will be generated. Likewise, the remote
      pictorial assessment will be compared to the gold standard to determine reliability of
      diagnosis from photographs alone.

    <description>The primary outcome of the study is a measure of validity (concordance) of the the omphalitis algorithm generated by inter-observer kappa statistics to evaluate diagnostic concordance between the field monitors and the gold standard cord health expert on specific algorithmic questions. Questions that demonstrate high concordance will be selected for inclusion in the final algorithm. Sensitivity and specificity of the final algorithm will be generated.</description>

    <description>After obtaining guardian informed written consent, newborns aged 1-10 days presenting to the health facility for routine or sick visits would undergo 2 independent, parallel evaluations; first, by a ZamCAT Field Monitor (community level worker from our existing study) and the second by a Zambian medical doctor (gold standard). A US board of pediatrics-certified pediatrician will perform a third independent assessment of a photo of the cord remotely. Using the on-site clinician as the gold standard, the community-based algorithm and the photo assessment will be tested for concordance and the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm will be generated. Likewise, the remote pictorial assessment will be compared to the gold standard to determine reliability of diagnosis from photographs alone.</description>
