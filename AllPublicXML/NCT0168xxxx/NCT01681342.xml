  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervix carcinoma is a common malignancy. Radiation therapy still remains a major treatment
      for patients with carcinoma cervix. Conventional treatment with radiation therapy includes a
      combination of external beam radiation therapy and intracavitary treatment. Low dose rate
      intracavitary brachytherapy treatment is already well studied. But high dose rate
      brachytherapy is a relatively new alternative.

      In brachytherapy, major developments have been made in the integration of 3D imaging and
      computerized 3D treatment planning. Medical imaging improvements allowed for better
      definition of tumoral volumes and organs at risk.

      The GYN GEC-ESTRO published recommendations on the 3D imaging for better characterization of
      these volumes. Improvements in CT-SCan and lately in RMN had lead to a better definition of
      volums of interest (tumor and his extensions and organs at risk : bladder, rectum, sigmoidis,
      small bowels). RMN is the imaging standard in the evaluation of tumoral extension in cervix
      cancer. However its use is not easy in many brachytherapy departments.

      This study will evaluate the feasibility and sparing of organs at risk for high dose rate
      brachytherapy if volume delineation is done at each of the two sessions performed with 3D
      RMN.

      After 60 Gy are delivered with Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), the
      brachytherapy in high dose rate will deliver 15 Gy to the CTVhr (high risk CTV) in two
      sessions.

      A clinical examination and an RMN are performed at the end of the external radiation to
      evaluate the residual tumoral volume. Two HDR brachytherapy sessions are then performed.

      During the first session, a CT-Scan and an RMN will be performed after the fletcher
      application. A second CT-Scan will be performed during the second treatment session to create
      new volumes and to improve organs at risk sparing.
