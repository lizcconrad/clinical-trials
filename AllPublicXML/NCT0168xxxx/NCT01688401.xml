  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to determine if intra-arterial (IA) chemotherapy is safe in
      the treatment of progressive diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG). IA administration of
      the chemotherapeutic agent enhances the regional distribution of the drug, thereby increasing
      the local delivered dose while minimizing systemic toxicity. It also provides a treatment
      option for these patients at the time of tumor recurrence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delivering the chemotherapeutic agent directly to the tumor via the arterial system avoids
      the complications and adverse events associated with toxicity from systemic chemotherapy.

    <description>In this feasibility study, we are going to perform a qualitative evaluation of whether or not we can safely deliver IA chemotherapy to patients with progressive DIPG.
Assessment of non-hematologic toxicity will include grading according to the Nervous system disorder CTCAE, specifically grades 3-5 intracranial hemorrhage and grades 3-5 stroke. Note will be made if the patient requires a blood transfusion.</description>
