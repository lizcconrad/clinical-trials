      The purposes of this study are to observe if oral tetrahydrouridine and decitabine can
      increase fetal hemoglobin levels and improve the symptoms of sickle cell disease, and to
      monitor how patient's bodies react to oral tetrahydrouridine and decitabine.

      The purposes of this study are to observe if oral tetrahydrouridine and decitabine can
      increase fetal hemoglobin levels and improve the symptoms of sickle cell disease, and to
      monitor how patient's bodies react to oral tetrahydrouridine and decitabine. The overall
      purpose is to develop disease modifying treatment for sickle cell disease that is less
      cytotoxic than the current standard of care, and which can directly and more efficiently
      reactivate fetal hemoglobin levels. The hypothesis is that patients treated with oral
      tetrahydrouridine and decitabine will have the same chance of severe non-hematologic
      toxicities as the placebo group. The primary end-point is ≥ grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity.
      The investigators' hypothesis is that patients in the treatment groups receiving oral
      THU-decitabine 2X/week over 8 weeks (n=15) will be equivalent to placebo group (n=10) with
      regards to the chance of ≥ grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity.

          -  Written, informed consent provided by the subject before study entry.

          -  Confirmed Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) (SS, S-b0-thalassemia, S-b+-thalassemia or SC on
             hemoglobin electrophoresis).

          -  Symptomatic SCD while on 6 months of HU OR symptomatic SCD and intolerant of HU
             (unable or unwilling to take HU due to hematological or other toxicities). Symptomatic
             SCD is defined as having one of following:

               -  Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) &lt;5%, OR

               -  3 or more pain episodes per year requiring parenteral narcotics, OR

               -  1 or more acute chest syndrome episodes, OR

               -  Hemoglobin &lt;9 g/dL and absolute reticulocyte count &lt;250,000/mm3.

          -  Subject is in his/her steady state and not amidst any acute complication due to SCD
             (i.e., hospitalization, acute pain, or acute chest syndrome in the past 14 days).

          -  Regular compliance with comprehensive care and previous therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:
