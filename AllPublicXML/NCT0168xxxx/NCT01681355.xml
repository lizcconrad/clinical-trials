        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy, well-nourished, term, Asian infants (gestational age ≥ 37 1/7 and ≤ 41 6/7
             weeks)

          -  The mother had unequivocally decided not to exclusively breast-feed

          -  Formula fed for at least one week, receiving at least two formula feedings per day

          -  Birth weight appropriate for gestational age (AGA), 2500-4000g

          -  Written informed consent from parent(s) and/or legal guardian, aged ≥ 18 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 17 weeks

          -  Infants known to have current or previous illnesses/conditions or intervention which
             could interfere with the study (impacting tolerance and/or growth), such as
             gastrointestinal malformations, chronic diarrhoea, malabsorptive syndrome,
             malnutrition, congenital immunodeficiency, or major surgery, as per investigator's
             clinical judgement

          -  Infants who suffered from gastroenteritis or diarrhoea in the last 4 weeks preceding
             study start.

          -  Infants who used any medication or nutritional supplements (except for vitamin
             supplementation to complement breastfeeding) in the 4 weeks preceding study start.

          -  Infants who have medical conditions for which a special diet other than standard (non
             hydrolysed) cow's milk-based infant formula is required (such as cow's milk allergy,
             soy protein allergy, fish protein allergy, egg protein allergy, lactose intolerance,
             galactosemia).

          -  Infants with any history of or current participation in any other study involving
             investigational or marketed products.

          -  Investigator's uncertainty about the willingness or ability of the parents to comply
             with the protocol requirements.
