      This is a multi-center cluster-randomized trial with the following Specific Aims:

        -  To evaluate if continuous noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring will reduce the RBC
           transfusions in patients undergoing surgeries associated with a significant risk of
           bleeding.

        -  To evaluate if patients monitored with continuous noninvasive hemoglobin experience less
           frequent complications and shorter hospital stay compared with patients who are not
           being monitored with continuous noninvasive hemoglobin.

      Accordingly, the study hypotheses are defined as follows:

        -  The primary null hypothesis is that continuous noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring will
           not reduce the RBC transfusions in patients undergoing surgeries associated with a
           significant risk of bleeding.

        -  The secondary hypothesis is that in patients monitored with continuous noninvasive
           hemoglobin, there will be earlier warning of critical drops in hemoglobin, and thus,
           there will be less frequent complications compared with patients who are not being
           monitored with continuous noninvasive hemoglobin.

      This is a matched-pair cluster-randomized controlled trial. At each participating centers,
      consenting eligible Anesthesiologists will be grouped into matched pairs based on their
      practice characteristics and experience (namely, their main surgical service/procedures and
      their years of experience working as a clinician responsible for making transfusion
      decisions). From each pair, Anesthesiologists will be randomly allocated to either treat
      their patients while having access to data from a continuous noninvasive hemoglobin
      monitoring device (total hemoglobin [SpHb] and Pleth Variability Index [PVI]) (SpHb group) or
      without access to SpHb/PVI data, under standard of care (control group). Regardless of
      randomization, all patients will be monitored with the device but the data will be blinded
      and not be available to the Anesthesiologist to be used in the management of the control
      group. Only in the SpHb group, the SpHb/PVI data will be provided live to the
      Anesthesiologist, to be used during management of the patients.
