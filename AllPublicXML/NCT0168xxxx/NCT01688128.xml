  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of the Ubiquitous Spaced Retrieval-based
      Memory Advancement and Rehabilitation Training (U-SMART) in the elderly individuals with mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI) by an open-label, controlled, crossover Trial.

    <textblock>
      The Spaced Retrieval-based Memory Advancement and Rehabilitation Training (SMART) which
      consisted of 24 one-hour face-to-face sessions (Lee, Park et al. 2009) was developed based on
      the spaced retrieval training (SRT), which was effective in improving memory retention span
      of very mild to mild Alzheimer's disease patients. The Ubiquitous SMART (U-SMART) by
      transforming the current SMART to a self-administered program using an application working on
      IPAD was developed, and showed its feasibility and efficacy in the elderly individuals with
      mild cognitive impairment in the preliminary study. (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01628653) To
      validate the efficacy of the U-SMART, an open-label, controlled, crossover design of clinical
      trial were planned in this study.
