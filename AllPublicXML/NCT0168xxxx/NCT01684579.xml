  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that some behavioral factors such as physical activity and exercise
      may improve quality of life and outcome in patients with breast cancer as well as decrease
      body fat, increase lean mass and reduce cancer-promoting hormones. None of these studies have
      been performed in African-American women with breast cancer. The medical field needs to
      understand how exercise may benefit cancer patients, particularly African Americans, and how
      to optimize these benefits to improve the quality of life, prognosis and survival.

      All exercise training will take place at the Gathering Place, Beachwood OH, in the new
      Wellness Center that is equipped with state-of-the-art aerobic and resistance training
      apparati. All exercise will be performed under the supervision of the Gathering Place trained
      and certified staff. The patient group will perform a 20 week aerobic and resistance exercise
      training program to evaluate (compared to baseline) changes: in body composition (fat, lean
      tissue and bone mass); cytokines including insulin, leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, and TNFα;
      oxidative stress including urine isoprostane; cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max); upper and
      lower body strength (assessed using a dynamometer); sleep (assessed using the Pittsburgh
      Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]); fatigue and quality of life (Qol) (assessed using the SF-36,
      FACIT instruments). Patients will be evaluated before and after a 20 week intervention and a
      10 week post-intervention period. Participants also will be evaluated for motivation barriers
      and compliance. These feasibility parameters will provide the basis and guidance for an NCI
      grant application to focus on mechanisms and extend our evaluation to larger cohorts of
      African-American patients.

    <description>Ascertain if a graded program to increase aerobic and resistance exercise activities along with psychosocial counseling can be used in African-American women at the completion of initial therapy for breast cancer to improve circulating levels of known cancer promoting cytokines, adipokines and hormones and other measurements of fitness and well-being.</description>

    <description>Patients will participate in a psychosocial counseling session, 1 day/week for 20 weeks. Patients will be invited to participate in a progressive aerobic and resistance exercise program designed to achieve moderate and then vigorous levels of exercise, 5 days/week for 20 weeks.</description>

    <intervention_name>Resistance Exercise</intervention_name>
    <description>Resistance exercise will be performed 2 days per week for 18 weeks. The resistance training protocol will follow the Resistance Training Strategies for Individuals With Cancer (RTSFIC). The goals will be to keep intensity levels low at the outset (having lighter weights and more reps) and progress slowly and safely. Training prescriptions will be modified based on the training level of the patients and their progress.</description>

    <description>A 20-week aerobic walking exercise program will be developed for each participant based on results of initial exercise testing and prescribed to be done 5 or more days per week designed to progress from moderate exercise intensity, (50-70% maximum heart rate), to vigorous exercise intensity (75-85% maximum heart rate). Maximum heart rate (HR max) will be determined as the peak heart rate achieved during initial cardiopulmonary exercise screening. Heart rate during exercise will be monitored by participants using wrist monitors, already available through TREC Program. Patient progress will also be evaluated using a six minute walk test (6MWT), which will be conducted at TGP at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 weeks and, after completion of the intervention.</description>
