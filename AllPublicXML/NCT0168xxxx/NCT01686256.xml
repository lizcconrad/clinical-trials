      A Multi-Center Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of FolateScan (Technetium
      Tc 99m EC20) in Women with Suspected Ovarian or Endometrial Cancer.

      Phase I - The proposed indication for FolateScan is disease or pathological assessment of
      ovarian or endometrial masses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to verify product safety, determine optimal imaging time, gather
      efficacy data for the radioactive drug product (Technetium Tc 99m EC20), and assay masses for
      presence of folate receptors, in women with suspected ovarian or endometrial cancer. Twelve
      subjects will be enrolled, with a minimum of five malignant cases, as determined by
      histopathological evaluation.

      Women with a suspected ovarian or endometrial mass who either 1) have fixed, paraffin
      embedded tissue sample(s) available for immunohistochemical staining obtained from a previous
      pathological evaluation or 2) are scheduled for a procedure to obtain tissue for pathological
      evaluation that can be fixed and paraffin embedded for immunohistochemical staining are
      eligible for this study. The ovarian mass may be either an initial finding, e.g., found at a
      routine pelvic examination or to investigate symptoms, or the ovarian or endometrial mass may
      be a finding suspicious of recurrent or residual tumor at follow-up examination after
      surgical resection of confirmed ovarian or endometrial cancer. Patients may not be pregnant
      or breastfeeding at enrollment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must meet the following eligibility requirements to be enrolled in the study.

               1. Subjects must be female, 18 years of age or older.

               2. Subjects must have suspected ovarian cancer or metastatic or recurrent ovarian or
                  endometrial cancer with a known pelvic mass as diagnosed by ultrasound, MRI, or
                  CT.

               3. Subjects either are scheduled to undergo a procedure to obtain tissue for
                  pathological evaluation that can be fixed and paraffin embedded for
                  immunohistochemical staining or have sufficient amounts of fixed, paraffin
                  embedded tissue sample(s) available for immunohistochemical staining obtained
                  from a previous pathological evaluation.

               4. Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to enrollment.

               5. Subjects must have kidney function with a creatinine value &lt;2.0 mg/dL (within the
                  previous 30 days).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be excluded if any of the following conditions are present:

               1. Subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.

               2. Subject is simultaneously participating in another investigative drug study.

               3. Subject has completed the follow-up phase of any previous study less than 30 days
                  prior to enrollment in this study.

               4. Subject is unable to tolerate conditions for radionuclide imaging.

               5. Subject has been administered another radiopharmaceutical that would interfere
                  with the assessment of Technetium Tc 99m EC20.
