  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare Dysport treatment results after current clinical practice
      injection technique and high-concentration dilution to the neuromuscular junction targeted
      injection technique and low-concentration dilution in the elbow joint assessed by Modified
      Ashworth Scale 4 weeks post treatment. The hypothesis is that one high volume injection
      centrally located in the area/band of the NMJ zones will be as effective as the technique
      used today in current medical practice.
