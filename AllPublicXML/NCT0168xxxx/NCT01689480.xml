  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is now accepted that physical activity is not deleterious in myopathies, including
      muscular dystrophies. In patients suffering from facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD),
      aerobic training has been reported to be associated with physiological and functional
      positive effects without alteration in quality of life. Van der Kooi et al. (2005) and Cup et
      al. (2007) studies suggest that the combination of endurance and strength trainings is even
      more relevant. However, only a few controlled and randomized studies have been conducted on
      this topic and the impact of such training programs on skeletal muscle regenerative
      capacities has not been addressed yet. Moreover, due to the fact that training programs are
      mainly performed on short-term supervised periods, there is a lack of knowledge regarding
      long-term effects, patient's autonomy and whether or not practice of regular exercise can be
      maintained in patient's daily life. Also, only a few experiments report an integrative view
      of potential benefits of such programs on functional, biological and quality of life.

      The present project is the second phase of a study for which the first phase currently
      financed by AFM is in progress and aims to establish a program of adapted physical training
      performed at the patient's home under supervision. This program was developed in order to try
      to meet the two following requirements: 1) to be compatible with the daily
      professional/social activity of patients so it can be integrated in their life routine; 2) to
      be intense enough so functional benefits can be induced. The first phase is a controlled and
      randomized study where patients with FSHD participate in a 6-months supervised training
      program combining aerobic and strength training sessions on an ergocycle.

      This second phase of our research project aims to evaluate whether a long-term integration of
      this adapted training program into patients' lifestyle is possible. The same tools, same
      method and same measurements of training program will be used with remote monitoring, less
      frequent as it was in the first phase, over a period of 24 months. This second experimental
      work will also be based on multi-factorial evaluations, i.e. biological, physiological,
      functional, and quality of life questionnaires and remains collaboration between Universities
      of Saint Etienne (L. Féasson), Grenoble (B Wuyam) and Örebro (F Kadi) within the Rhône-Alpes
      Reference Centre for Rare Neuromuscular Diseases (JC Antoine).

    <description>Number of adapted physical activity sessions conducted over 2 years in patients with FSHD based on a theoretical program of three weekly sessions. A session will be considered valid based on the collection 1) time physical activity actually performed and 2) its intensity, both recorded from the cycle ergometer and a heart rate record.</description>

    <description>The training will consist in 3 sessions of 35 min of training per week at home on an ergocycle. The training will be divided in (i) 2 sessions of 30 min aerobic exercises at a constant but moderate (60% of maximal aerobic power, MAP) intensity followed with 5 sets of 10 revolutions at near-maximal intensity and (ii) an interval-training session. This latter session will consist in 5 min warm-up at 40% MAP followed by 5 times 1 min at 80% MAP (recovery = 4 min at 40% MAP) followed by 5 min of active recovery. A systematic supervision of the sessions by the coach will be performed by phone, by using the heart rate recordings and values of Analogic Visual Scale for pain and fatigue.</description>
