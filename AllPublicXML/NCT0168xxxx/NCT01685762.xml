      The purpose of this study is to see if metformin will be effective in making endometrial
      hyperplasia without atypia better by returning the tissue to a normal state.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-institutional pilot clinical trial designed to estimate the response rate and
      safety of metformin for the treatment of simple and complex endometrial hyperplasia (EH)
      without atypia. Enrollment of patients will occur at UNC-Chapel Hill and Southern Pines
      Women's Health Center. Fifteen patients will be enrolled over the course of 1 year. Metformin
      will be initiated at 850 mg orally once daily, and titrated up to twice daily over a minimum
      of 1 months time. Treatment will last 12 weeks and then patients will undergo repeat
      endometrial biopsy to assess for regression or persistence of EH.
