  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, single-blind, active-controlled, two-period crossover study in
      adult volunteers to compare the duration and depth of anesthesia between Synera® and
      Lidoderm® patches when applied for 30 minutes and 4 hours. The study will include a Screening
      Visit, two Treatment Periods, and a Follow-Up Phone Contact.

             each Treatment Period.

          7. Subject is willing to be blindfolded during the study and agrees to abide by all study
             restrictions and comply with all study procedures.

          8. Able to fluently speak and understand English and be able to provide meaningful
             written informed consent for the study.

             breath test at the Screening Visit or check-in to Treatment Visit 1.

          7. Subject has active dermatological disease of any origin that may interfere with the
             ability to participate.

          8. Subject has denuded or broken skin on either forearm.
