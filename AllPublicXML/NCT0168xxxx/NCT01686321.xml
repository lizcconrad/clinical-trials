  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bendamustine is a well tolerable and very active agent in the treatment of Non Hodgkin's
      lymphoma. However, in particular in aggressive B-cell lymphoma, only very few, small studies
      have investigated the role of bendamustine in the treatment algorithm. The aim of the current
      B-R-ENDA trial is to investigate efficacy and toxicity of the combination treatment of
      bendamustine and subcutaneous rituximab in old patients or in elderly patients with high
      comorbidity who do not qualify for a CHOP like treatment. The results of this study will form
      the basis of a larger, prospective randomized phase III trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histology: Diagnosis of aggressive CD20+, confirmed by an excisional biopsy of a lymph
             node or by a sufficiently extensive biopsy of an extranodal involvement if there is no
             lymph node involvement. It will be possible to treat the following entities in this
             study as defined by the new WHO classification of 2008: B-NHL, Follicular lymphoma
             grade IIIb,DLBCL, not otherwise specified (NOS),common morphologic variants:
             centroblastic,immunoblastic,anaplastic,rare morphologic variants.DLBCL
             subtypes/entities:T cell/histiocyte rich large B-cell lymphoma, primary cutaneous
             DLBCL, leg type, EBV-positive DLBCL of the elderly, DLBCL associated with chronic
             inflammation, primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma, intravascular large

          -  Acute or chronic active hepatitis

          -  CNS involvement of lymphoma (intracerebral, meningeal, intraspinal)

          -  Active serious infections not controlled by oral or intravenous antibiotics or
             anti-fungal
