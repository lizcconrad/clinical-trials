    <textblock>
      Patient suffering a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or stroke are subsequently at high risk
      of a new stroke, however, poor adherence to secondary prevention medications occurs
      frequently within this patient group. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a
      complex tailored pharmacist intervention will lead to increased adherence to secondary stroke
      prevention medications and less new stroke events when compared to a usual care group.
      Interventions focus on motivational interviewing, medication review and telephone follow up.
