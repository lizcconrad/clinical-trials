    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multicenter, non‐randomized trial of a stand‐alone procedure for
      left atrial appendage exclusion in patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for embolic
      events who are contraindicated for or intolerant of oral anticoagulation therapy. This study
      will enroll 100 participant, who will receive the LAA ligation study treatment. The objective
      of this registry is to assess the effectiveness of permanent exclusion of the LAA using the
      LARIAT Suture Delivery Device and Accessories in patients unable to be treated with standard
      anticoagulation therapy. The results of the study will be used to assess outcomes within the
      first year, post‐treatment.
