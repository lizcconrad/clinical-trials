  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular stenosis as a result of neointimal hyperplasia is a major clinical problem that has
      an impact on multiple and diverse disciplines, including cardiology (coronary restenosis),
      cardiothoracic and vascular surgery (saphenous vein and polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] graft
      failure), neurology (carotid stenosis), nephrology (dialysis access dysfunction), and
      transplant medicine (chronic allograft rejection in hearts and kidneys). [1] In marked
      contrast to the deleterious effects of smooth muscle progenitor cells on neointimal
      hyperplasia, circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are believed to play an
      important role in vascular repair and in the inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia. [2]
      Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) circulate in adult peripheral blood and contribute to
      neovascularization. Satoshi et al. have demonstrated that lineage-committed EPCs and
      CD34-positive mononuclear cells, their putative precursors, are mobilized during an acute
      ischemic event in humans. [3] Reduced levels of circulating EPCs independently predict
      atherosclerotic disease progression, thus supporting an important role for endogenous
      vascular repair to modulate the clinical course of coronary artery disease. [4] These
      observations prompt the hypothesis that circulating EPCs may provide an endogenous repair
      mechanism to counteract surgery-induced endothelial cell injury and to replace dysfunctional
      endothelium perioperatively. Therefore, the investigators examined whether levels of
      circulating EPCs correlate with time course and outcomes of coronary artery bypass surgery to
      establish a clinical role of endogenous endothelial repair mediated by circulating EPCs.
