  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this trial is that the test drug (Human Recombiant Epoetin - Blau)
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters are similar to the comparator drug (Eprex ®
      - Janssen-Cilag) in healthy subjects following administration of multiple intravenous dose.
      The objective of this randomized, parallel, clinical trial is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic profile of the test drug Human Reconbiant Epoetin produced by Blau
      Farmacêutica, compared to the comparator drug Eprex®, produced by Janssen-Cilag, by assessing
      plasma concentration of the drug and the reticulocyte count following a multiple intravenous
      administration during 4 weeks of 100 IU/kg in healthy subjects.
