      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of Opti-Free® PureMoist®
      Multi-Purpose Disinfecting Solution (MPDS) compared to Biotrue™ Multipurpose Solution (MPS)
      in silicone hydrogel contact lens wearers.

      In this 2-period crossover study, eligible participants were randomized to either Opti-Free®
      PureMoist® Multi-Purpose Disinfecting Solution or Biotrue™ Multipurpose Solution in Period 1
      for use with their habitual contact lenses, after which they switched to the alternate
      solution in Period 2. Each period was 30 days in length. A 2-day washout period during which
      participants refrained from using a multi-purpose contact lens solution preceded Period 1 and
      Period 2.

    <description>Corneal staining in both eyes was assessed during slit lamp examination using flourescein dye. Each of five corneal regions (central, nasal, temporal, inferior, and superior) was graded on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (patch). The corneal fluorescein staining score was calculated as the total of the five regions. The score ranged from 0 (no staining in any region) to 20 (patch staining in all five regions). The corneal staining of the worse eye was analyzed.</description>

        <description>Corneal staining in both eyes was assessed during slit lamp examination using flourescein dye. Each of five corneal regions (central, nasal, temporal, inferior, and superior) was graded on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (patch). The corneal fluorescein staining score was calculated as the total of the five regions. The score ranged from 0 (no staining in any region) to 20 (patch staining in all five regions). The corneal staining of the worse eye was analyzed.</description>

          <title>Corneal Staining</title>
          <description>Corneal staining in both eyes was assessed during slit lamp examination using flourescein dye. Each of five corneal regions (central, nasal, temporal, inferior, and superior) was graded on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (patch). The corneal fluorescein staining score was calculated as the total of the five regions. The score ranged from 0 (no staining in any region) to 20 (patch staining in all five regions). The corneal staining of the worse eye was analyzed.</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse events (AE) were collected for the duration of the study (4 months). AEs were elicited by non-direct questioning of the participant and spontaneous reporting by the participant. AEs were recorded at every visit.</time_frame>
      <desc>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the medical device.
