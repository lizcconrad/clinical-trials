      The purpose of this study is to address the gap in knowledge regarding the relationship
      between eating frequency and weight loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little intervention research has been conducted to examine the influence of eating frequency
      (EF) on weight loss. It has been hypothesized an increased EF improves appetite control,
      assisting with better regulation of energy intake, thus decreasing body mass index.
      Unfortunately, outcomes have not shown greater appetite control with increased EF. Instead,
      trends favor a lower EF reducing energy intake thereby producing greater weight loss than a
      higher eating frequency. Thus, a lower eating frequency may lower energy intake via
      behavioral mechanisms. At thit time no research has examined the behavioral mechanisms that
      may mediate the relationship between a lower eating frequency and superior adherence to an
      energy-restricted diet.

    <description>Thirty adults will be provided an 8-week standard lifestyle intervention, that includes a 1200-1500 kcal/day, &lt; 30% energy from fat dietary prescription, and a physical activity goal of 200 minutes/week. Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions differing in EF using a prescription we have tested previously. One condition will limit the number of eating bouts/day to three (Three Meal), while the second condition will consume at least 100 kcal every 2 to 3 hours which should lead to approximately 6 eating bouts/day (Grazing).</description>
