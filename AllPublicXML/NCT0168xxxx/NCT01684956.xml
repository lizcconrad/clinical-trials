  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this research study to find out if the type of needle used to
      administer them affects the speed with which insulin and glucagon get into the blood. The
      investigators will compare a traditional insulin needle to an injection device, called the
      MicronJet, that uses microneedles to deliver medication into the top layer of your skin.
