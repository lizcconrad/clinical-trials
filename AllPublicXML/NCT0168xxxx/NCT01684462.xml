      In this clinical study, the efficacy and safety of ALbumin is to be evaluated for the
      patients occurred within 12 hours of acute ischemic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the statistics of the cause of death in 2008 by the Statistics Korea, the stroke
      was accounted for a large proportion of cause of death among adults, as well as higher
      mortality, severe sequelae. These stroke in acute phase showed neurological deterioration
      over 50% of the patients after beginning of treatment and the sequelae resulting in that the
      nervous tissue was not regenerated is regarded as irreversible changes.

      The test group administered 20% albumin based on 1.25g/kg (up to 100g (500ml) over 80kg body
      weight) to the patients occurred within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms and equal amount of
      placebo (saline solution (0.9% normal saline)) administered to the control group will be
      compared to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALbumin for the patients with acute ischemic
      stroke.
