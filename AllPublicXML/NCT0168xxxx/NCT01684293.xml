      This study integrates a model of occupational-therapy based cognitive rehabilitation as part
      of a comprehensive treatment plan for cocaine abusers. We hypothesize that cognitive
      impairment and quality of life would improve and that cocaine use would decrease in those
      participants receiving occupational-therapy based cognitive rehabilitation.
