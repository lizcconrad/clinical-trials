    <textblock>
      GLYX-13 is a NMDA receptor glycine site partial agonist being studied in subjects with major
      depressive disorder (depression) who have responded inadequately to another antidepressant
      drug during the current episode. This trial will assess the effects of GLYX-13 on depression
      when added to another antidepressant drug that the patient is already taking.

      To evaluate the mean difference in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 (HDRS-17) score for
      the combined GLYX-13 mean change versus the placebo group mean change at the end of a 6 week
      randomized withdrawal phase (predose baseline score - score at end of randomized withdrawal
      period).
