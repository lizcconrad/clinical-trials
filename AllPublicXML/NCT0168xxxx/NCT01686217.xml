      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles of three different
      strengths of ASP015K extended release formulation and an immediate release formulation and to
      evaluate food effect on extended release strengths in healthy volunteers.

      Study involves 3 parallel groups. Subjects in each group will receive 3 single-dose
      treatments with a washout period of at least 7 days separating the dosing between two
      consecutive treatments. Dosing conditions include both fed and fasted conditions.
