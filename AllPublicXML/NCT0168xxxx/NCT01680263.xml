      The aim of this study was to determine the effects of kinesiotaping in comparison to NSAIDs
      and physical therapy in treatment of pes anserinus tendino-bursitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of pes anserinus tendino-bursitis includes refraining from aggravating
      activities, local modalities such as heat, ice, ultrasound (US), iontophoresis,
      phonophoresis, electrical stimulation (ES), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
      injections with either corticosteroids or local anesthetics. Another treatment that seems to
      have a significant effect on the improvement of the disease is kinesiotaping. Kinesiotaping
      is a cotton strip with an acrylic adhesive that is used for treating athletic injuries and a
      variety of physical conditions. The therapeutic effects of the tape is to relax the overused
      muscles and in rehabilitation to facilitate the underused muscles. Advocates claim that the
      wave pattern found on the kinesiotaping has a lifting effect on the skin which can diminish
      swelling and inflammation via improving circulation and reduce pain by removing pressure from
      pain receptors.
