    <description>Device:Tivoli® DES The Tivoli® DES drug eluting stent(Tivoli® DES) is an open cell balloon expandable cobalt chromium stent coated with a bio-gradable polymer (PLGA) containing rapamycin at a dose of 8 micrograms per millimeter of stent length. In vitro assays have shown that about 50% of the drug releasing in 1 week and approximately 80% releasing in 28 days. The polymer may be degraded in 3 to 6 months in human body. This stent is supplied pre-mounted on a delivery catheter and is available in the following sizes: lengths of 10、15、18、21、25、30、35 mm and diameters of 2.5、2.75、3.0、3.5、4.0 mm.</description>
