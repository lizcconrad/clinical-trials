  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the transplant community, there is debate regarding the most appropriate food services for
      stem cell transplant patients. Recommendations regarding the use of low bacterial diets have
      been based on theoretical concepts of reducing the risk of contracting infections from
      pathogens found in food sources rather than clinical trials. The evidence for the use of a
      neutropenic diet is weak. To date, there have been little to no randomized controlled studies
      addressing the question whether a neutropenic diet in addition to prophylactic antibiotics is
      necessary as infection prevention in myeloablative stem cell transplant patients. For this
      reason, our research is aimed at providing data to substantiate the use of neutropenic diets
      in preventing infections in recipients of myeloablative stem cell transplants.

      In the proposed pilot study, a randomized design will be used to address the primary and
      secondary aims. Subjects will be randomized to either the experimental group receiving a
      non-neutropenic diet without restriction, or to the control group receiving the standard
      neutropenic diet. While randomization will occur prior to, or on the day of their inpatient
      admission and the subjects will begin study procedures upon admission to the Adult Stem Cell
      Transplant Inpatient Unit at Duke University Medical Center.

      The diet will continue until 1) the subject is no longer neutropenic, and/or 2) discharged
      from the inpatient unit to continue their care in the Adult Stem Cell Transplant Outpatient
      Clinic. By limiting the study to the time of care on the inpatient unit, we will minimize the
      opportunity for deviation from the assigned diet. Absence of neutropenia will be defined as
      an absolute neutrophil count of greater than 500/uL (manual differential) and a total white
      blood cell count of 1000/uL for three consecutive days.

      All subjects enrolled will follow the standard prophylactic antibiotic regimen. Other
      supportive care will also be consistent in the two groups.
