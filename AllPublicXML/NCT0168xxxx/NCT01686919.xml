  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Innlandet Hospital in Gj√∏vik is a center for patients suffering from morbid obesity in
      Hedmark og Oppland, Norway. Patients with either BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 or with BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 and
      complications who opt for &quot;gastric bypass&quot; surgery, go through a standard program including a
      thorough clinical examination and information on the operation, followed by a learning and
      coping program that consists of standard dietary advise for weight loss and includes weekly
      visits during 8 weeks.

      This research project concerns a subgroup in the patient population described above: morbidly
      obese patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In this group it will be investigated how
      an 8 week preoperative milk-free diet affects digestive functions and weight loss. It is
      known that milk may cause stomach complaints and may make it more difficult to loose weight.
