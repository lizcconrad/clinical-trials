  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Greater time spent in sedentary behaviors, independent of physical activity level, can
      increase risk of morbidity and mortality. Objective assessments indicate that bariatric
      surgery patients spend large amounts of time in sedentary behaviors. The present study is the
      first to test whether a mobile health (mHealth) approach that employs widely adopted
      smartphone technology to monitor and modify sedentary behaviors as they occur is a feasible
      and acceptable method of reducing sedentary time in these patients and other obese
      populations.

    <description>The overall goals of the intervention are to decrease overall sedentary time and to increase the number of breaks in sedentary time. The intervention approach combines an advanced smartphone device with an on-board accelerometer and a sophisticated smartphone application to: 1) monitor participants sedentary behavior in real time in their natural environment; and 2) use monitored data to deliver immediate, individually-tailored, goal-driven prompts and feedback to encourage substitute of sedentary behaviors with physical activity.</description>
