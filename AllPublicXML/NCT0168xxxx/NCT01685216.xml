    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme
      glucocerebrosidase (GCB). Gaucher disease has been classified into 3 clinical subtypes based
      on the presence or absence of neurological symptoms and the severity of these neurological
      symptoms. Patients with type 2 Gaucher disease present with acute neurological deterioration,
      and those with type 3 disease typically display a more sub acute neurological course. Type 1
      Gaucher disease, the most common form accounting for more than 90% of all Gaucher disease
      cases, does not involve the central nervous system.

      The purpose of this clinical research study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of
      velaglucerase alfa in patients with type 3 Gaucher disease.

    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme
      glucocerebrosidase (GCB). Due to the deficiency of functional GCB, glucocerebroside
      accumulates within the macrophages leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly, and organ
      system dysfunction. Gaucher disease has been classified into 3 clinical subtypes based on the
      presence or absence of neurological symptoms and severity of neurological symptoms. Patients
      with type 2 Gaucher disease present with acute neurological deterioration, and those with
      type 3 Gaucher disease typically display a more sub acute neurological course; type 1 Gaucher
      disease, the most common form accounting for more than 90% of all cases, does not involve the
      central nervous system.

      Velaglucerase alfa is an approved enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for pediatric and adult
      patients with type 1 Gaucher disease. ERTs have been proven to reduce organomegaly, improve
      hematological parameters and positively impact health-related quality of life; ERTs have not
      been shown to cross the blood brain barrier and as a result have shown limited ability to
      improve the neurological (Central Nervous System; CNS) manifestations associated with Gaucher
      disease.

      This study will provide a basis for exploring the efficacy and safety of velaglucerase alfa
      in patients with type 3 Gaucher disease.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 12 Months (Week 53) in Hemoglobin Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 53 or end of study</time_frame>
    <description>Hemoglobin concentration was measured as part of the hematology panel or measured separately when the hematology panel was not scheduled. Samples were measured by a central laboratory. Baseline is the modified baseline hemoglobin concentration, the average of the values from screening, baseline, and Week 1/Day 1. A positive change from baseline indicates that hemoglobin concentration increased.</description>

    <description>Platelet count was measured at a central laboratory as part of the hematology panel. Baseline is the modified baseline platelet count, the average of the values from screening, baseline and Week 1/Day 1. A positive change from baseline indicates that platelet count increased.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline to 12 Months (Week 51) in Normalized Liver Volume Measured Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 51 or end of study</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative abdominal MRI was used to measure liver volume. If sedation was necessary to perform an MRI and the investigator deemed that this would be an unwarranted risk to the participant, liver volume could have been measured by ultrasound. Organ volume was measured by a single independent reviewer who was blinded to the participant identification and time point. The liver size relative to body weight was determined using the corresponding body weight measured at the same visit. Change in liver volume is presented as the normalized percentage of body weight. A negative change from baseline indicates that liver volume decreased.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline to 12 Months (Week 51) in Normalized Spleen Volume Measured Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 51</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative abdominal MRI was used to measure spleen volume. If sedation was necessary to perform an MRI and the investigator deemed that this would be an unwarranted risk to the participant, spleen volume could have been measured by ultrasound. Organ volume was measured by a single independent reviewer who was blinded to the participant identification and time point. The spleen size relative to body weight was determined using the corresponding body weight measured at the same visit. Change in spleen volume is presented as the normalized percentage of body weight. A negative change from baseline indicates that spleen volume decreased.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Abnormal Neurological Status During The Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 13, 25, 37, and 53 or end of study</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological symptoms were evaluated at regular intervals during the study and assessed on an individualized basis by a limited, age- and developmental stage-appropriate neurological examination adapted to suit the status of each participant. It was preferred that each neurological examination be performed by a neurologist with experience in assessment of neurological symptoms in patients with Gaucher disease and, if possible, the same neurologist (or designee) who evaluated a given participant at baseline performed the neurological examinations scheduled for that participant during the treatment phase and at the end of study visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced a Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>57 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) were monitored continuously throughout the study from the time the participant or participants parent/legal guardian signed the informed consent/assent (if applicable) until 30 days after the participant's last dose of study drug or at the end of study visit and/or until the event resolved or stabilized, or an outcome had been reached, whichever came first. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs which occurred on or after the time of the first infusion until 30 days after the participant's last study infusion. An infusion-related reaction is defined as an AE that 1) began either during or within 12 hours after the start of the infusion, and 2) was judged as possibly or probably related to study medication.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Developed Anti-Velaglucerase Alfa Antibodies During The Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 13, 25, 37 and 53</time_frame>
    <description>Participants provided blood samples for measurement of anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies in serum at baseline and approximately every 12 weeks during the treatment phase. Blood samples collected during the treatment phase were to be drawn prior to infusions. Analysis of anti-velaglucerase antibodies used a validated 3-tier immunoassay method (screening, confirmatory, and titer).</description>

        <description>Quantitative abdominal MRI was used to measure liver volume. If sedation was necessary to perform an MRI and the investigator deemed that this would be an unwarranted risk to the participant, liver volume could have been measured by ultrasound. Organ volume was measured by a single independent reviewer who was blinded to the participant identification and time point. The liver size relative to body weight was determined using the corresponding body weight measured at the same visit. Change in liver volume is presented as the normalized percentage of body weight. A negative change from baseline indicates that liver volume decreased.</description>
