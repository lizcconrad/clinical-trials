    <textblock>
      A higher percentage of radical resection is reported in studies using neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy followed by surgery versus surgery alone for esophageal cancer. And neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy may improve overall survival after surgical resection. Nimotuzumab is a
      humanized monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The concurrent
      trial is a clinical phase II trial designed to assess the efficacy of the combination of
      Nimotuzumab administered concurrently with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with
      resectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma, and to further investigate its side-effect and
      toxicity

    <textblock>
      A surgical resection is currently the preferred treatment for esophageal cancer if the tumor
      is considered to be resectable without evidence of distant metastases. A higher percentage of
      radical resection is reported in studies using neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery
      versus surgery alone. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy may improve overall survival. Neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy with administrations of paclitaxel combined with cisplatin or carboplatin has
      shown effectively. Nimotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR). The clinical phase I study of the combination of Nimotuzumab
      administered concurrently with chemo-irradiation in patients with local advanced esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma has shown the safety and the potential efficacy of Nimotuzumab. The
      concurrent trial is a clinical phase II trial designed to assess the efficacy of the
      combination of Nimotuzumab administered concurrently with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in
      patients with resectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma, and to further investigate its
      side-effect and toxicity.
