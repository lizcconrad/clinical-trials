  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability of spermatozoa to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been respected since
      the 1940's. Oxidative stress limits the functional competence of mammalian spermatozoa via
      lipid peroxidation, the induction of oxidative DNA damage and the formation of protein
      adducts. Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical generated from the oxidation of L-arginine to
      L-citrulline by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent NO
      synthases. Several studies suggest that the overproduction of this free radical and the
      subsequent excessive exposure to oxidative conditions have a potential pathogenetic
      implication, which due to the reduction of sperm motility. The present study was conducted to
      study the effect of Zn supplementation on the levels of NO synthase and arginase in semen of
      patients with asthenozoospmia.

      Previous studies suggest that high concentrations of NO play an injurious consequence on
      spermatozoa kinetic characteristics. These studies reported that NO may react with superoxide
      or hydrogen peroxide, resulting in the production of peroxinitrite, hydroxyl radical, or
      singlet oxygen, which cause oxidation of sperm membrane lipids and thiol proteins. NO also
      may inhibit cellular respiration by nitro-sylation of heme in mitochondrial enzymes,
      aconitase, and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, leading to a reduction of adenosine
      triphosphate and that is due to loss of motility of spermatozoa.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  the presence of asthenozoospermia in the semen sample.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  the absence of endocrinopathy,

          -  varicocele, and

          -  female factor infertility. Smokers and alcoholic men were excluded from the study
             because of their recognized high seminal ROS levels and decreased antioxidant levels
