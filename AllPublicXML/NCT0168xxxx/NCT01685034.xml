  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a disease that has increased in incidence over the past
      decade that affects males predominantly, and in adults, is characterized by heartburn,
      dysphagia, strictures and food impactions. These symptoms may require emergent endoscopic
      removal of foods and esophageal dilations due to remodeling causing significant impairment in
      quality of life. Treatment options are limited and often not well tolerated or effective.
      There is poor understanding of the natural history and long term prognosis. It has been
      associated with allergic sensitization; a high percentage of affected individuals having
      associated atopy and current literature demonstrates a seasonal distribution of incidence and
      severity of symptoms. Allergy immunotherapy (AIT) is a well established and effective
      treatment for allergic rhinitis and asthma which can induce tolerance to environmental
      allergens.

      Given the efficacy of AIT and the association of aeroallergen sensitization and even seasonal
      variation of EoE symptoms, we hypothesized that AIT may be a treatment option for patients
      with EoE.

      Purpose: To evaluate the role of allergy AIT in the management of EoE.

      Research design: Patients with EoE and aeroallergen sensitization will be offered AIT as a
      treatment modality for EoE. They will be evaluated by questionnaire, laboratory tests,
      endoscopy and biopsy before and after treatment to determine if there is clinical,
      laboratory, endoscopic and histologic changes in their EoE.

    <description>Subjects will be started on allergy immunotherapy. We will compare before and after pathology - changes in eosinophils per high power field in esophageal biopsy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptomatic changes</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom questionaire will be assessed before intervention and after (about 1 year after being on allergy immunotherapy)</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Endoscopic changes</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>In addition to above, we will score their endoscopic findings before and after the intervention. The categories scored will include: 1. Pallor and diminished vascular markings 2. Furrowing 3. White plaques 4. Concentric rings or strictures. If 1 esophageal site is involved, 1 point will be given. If more than 1 site, 2 points allocated. If entire esophagus is involved, 3 points allocated and maximum score will be 12.</description>

    <measure>Eosinophilia change</measure>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Any adverse events will be collected during the first year. Allergy immunotherapy has been used clinically for over 100 years. Local site reactions are common and expected, but we will monitor systemic reaction rates in this specific population and compare to known rates of reactions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible for care at Naval Medical Center San Diego

          -  Diagnosis of EoE (with or without GERD)

          -  Positive skin test to aeroallergen(s)

          -  Able to provide written informed consent prior to the conduct of any study related
             procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All excluding conditions for Allergy immunotherapy (AIT) - pregnancy, severe asthma,
             uncontrolled asthma, taking a beta blocker, history of coronary artery disease. (Note:
             age is not typically an exclusion criteria for AIT, however this will be an adult only
             study).

          -  History of significant esophageal disease other than EoE (such as esophageal cancer,
             surgeries…)

          -  History of other systemic eosinophilic conditions (such as …)

          -  Subjects with controlled asthma on inhaled steroids at the time of diagnosis of EoE
             may be included , however if a subject develops new asthma or worsening asthma during
             the study requiring new initiation of inhaled steroids, they may be discontinued to
             avoid possible swallowing of the medication and &quot;treatment&quot; of their EoE.

          -  If subject is judged by the investigator as unlikely to understand the scope of the
             study and/or is unlikely to comply with the study procedures and visits.

          -  Is currently or has recently been on AIT (within the past year)
