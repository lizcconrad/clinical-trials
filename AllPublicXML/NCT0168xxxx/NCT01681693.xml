  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is part of a large multi-investigator grant to look at the pharmacogenetics
      of a number of membrane transporters. The investigators will study individuals with
      particular genotypes of the human organic cation transporter, (hOCT3), and the multidrug and
      toxin extrusion transporter, MATE1 to test the hypothesis that genetic variation in hOCT3 and
      hMATE1 are associated with variation in the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of the
      antidiabetic agent, metformin.

    <textblock>
      To investigate the potential association of polymorphic genetic variants MATE1 and OCT3 with
      altered response to metformin, a genotype to phenotype strategy is employed. Specifically,
      the investigators will evaluate this hypothesis in African-Americans, a population which has
      a high incidence of type 2 diabetes and which has high variant allele frequencies (44.5% for
      MATE1-66T&gt;C and 11.3% in OCT3-81G&gt;delGA) relative to other ethic groups. To assess the
      effects of these variants on metformin response, the investigators will measure metformin
      renal clearance (pharmacokinetics of metformin), and plasma glucose and insulin levels
      (pharmacodynamic response) in healthy and diabetic patients who carry either the reference or
      variant alleles.
