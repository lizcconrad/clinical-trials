  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sirukumab as a single
      therapy in Japanese patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who
      have not responded to treatment with methotrexate (MTX) or sulfasalazine (SSZ).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (patients will be assigned to treatment by chance), double-blind (study
      personnel and patients will not know what treatments are being given), multicenter study. The
      expected duration of the study is 68 weeks. This will include 52 weeks of treatment with
      study agent with dosing every 2 weeks and 16 weeks of safety follow-up after the last dose.
      Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including MTX and SSZ, are not permitted from
      4 weeks before the first dosing with study agent until Week 24. The use of DMARDs is
      discouraged at or any time after Week 24; however, patients who have less than 20%
      improvement from baseline in both swollen and tender joint counts at Week 24 will be allowed
      to take DMARDs. At or any time after Week 16, the initiation and/or adjustment of oral
      corticosteroids will be allowed for patients who have less than 20% improvement from baseline
      in both swollen and tender joint counts at Week 16.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 24 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI consisted of 20-question in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living), each scored from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (inability to perform a task in that area). Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty. AUC of change from baseline in HAQ-DI score is the AUC of change from baseline in HAQ-DI score versus the time. AUC was calculated based on the measurement (i.e., observed HAQ-DI score change from baseline) at scheduled visits using the trapezoidal rule. Functional status was determined as a cumulative measure of HAQ-DI over 1 year by using the AUC of the change from baseline in HAQ-DI score through week 52. Decreases in AUC of change from baseline in HAQ-DI indicate a greater average improvement in physical function over time.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 16, 24 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a survey of participant health. It consists of 8 individual domains, which are weighted sums of the questions in their section. The 8 domains are: vitality (VT), physical functioning (PF), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), Role-Physical (RP), Role-Emotional (RE), social functioning (SF) and mental health (MH). Each of these 8 scales (domains) is scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health. Based on the scale scores, the summary mental component score (MCS) is derived. Scales contributing most to the scoring of the SF-36 MCS include the VT, SF, RE and MH. Other domains not noted contribute to the scoring but to a lesser degree. The scoring is derived based on an algorithm that has been developed in a software provided by the developer. The summary MCS score is also scaled from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health.</description>

             previous B-cell depletion therapy; has used any other biologic therapy for the
             treatment of RA within 3 months of first study agent dosing; has a history of
             sirukumab use

          -  Has received intra-articular (IA), intramuscular (IM), or intravenous (IV)
             corticosteroids for RA, including adrenocorticotrophic hormone during the 4 weeks

        <description>The HAQ-DI is a 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 to 3 (0=no difficulty and 3=inability to perform a task in that area). Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty. Here, ‘n’ signifies those participants who were evaluable for the specific timepoint.</description>

        <description>Major clinical response is achieving ACR 70 for 6 continuous months. The ACR 70 Response is defined as &gt;=70 percent improvement in swollen joint count (66 joints) and tender joint count (68 joints) and &gt;=70 percent improvement in 3 of following 5 assessments: patient's assessment of pain using VAS (0-10 mm, 0 mm=no pain and 10 mm=worst possible pain), patient's global assessment of disease activity by using VAS, (The scale ranges from 0 mm to 100 mm, [0 mm=no pain to 100 mm=worst possible pain]), physician's global assessment of disease activity using VAS, participant's assessment of physical function measured by HAQ-DI and CRP. Achievement of major clinical response reflects an enhanced level of therapeutic efficacy and sustained reduction of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</description>

        <description>The HAQ-DI is a 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a participant has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living), each scored from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (inability to perform a task in that area). Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI consisted of 20-question in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living), each scored from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (inability to perform a task in that area). Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty. AUC of change from baseline in HAQ-DI score is the AUC of change from baseline in HAQ-DI score versus the time. AUC was calculated based on the measurement (i.e., observed HAQ-DI score change from baseline) at scheduled visits using the trapezoidal rule. Functional status was determined as a cumulative measure of HAQ-DI over 1 year by using the AUC of the change from baseline in HAQ-DI score through week 52. Decreases in AUC of change from baseline in HAQ-DI indicate a greater average improvement in physical function over time.</description>

The 8 domains are: vitality (VT), physical functioning (PF), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), Role-Physical (RP), Role-Emotional (RE), social functioning (SF) and mental health (MH). Each of these 8 scales (domains) is scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health. Based on the scale scores, the summary mental component score (MCS) is derived. Scales contributing most to the scoring of the SF-36 MCS include the VT, SF, RE and MH. Other domains not noted contribute to the scoring but to a lesser degree. The scoring is derived based on an algorithm that has been developed in a software provided by the developer. The summary MCS score is also scaled from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health.</description>
