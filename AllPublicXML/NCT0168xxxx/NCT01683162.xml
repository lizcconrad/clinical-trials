  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have suggested that olive oil-based emulsion is safe and well tolerated in
      preterm infants, a showed efficacy and a good clinical and biological safety profile. The
      objective of this study was to assess the effects of a new olive-oil based lipid emulsion
      compared with the traditional lipid emulsions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For a number of years, lipid emulsions have been used in the nutritional support of surgical
      and critically ill patients, with the aim of supplying substrates to meet energy demands and
      providing building blocks for wound healing and tissue repair. Two types of lipid emulsions
      are currently used for adult as well as pediatric patients: one lipid emulsions prepared from
      soybean oil that are composed of long-chain triacylglycerols (LCTs), 62% of which are
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and the other lipid emulsions composed of 50%
      medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCTs) and 50% LCT soybean oil. A new lipid emulsion prepared
      from a mixture of soybean oil and olive oil contains only LCTs and has a lower proportion
      (20%) of PUFAs and 60% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). There are so many investigations
      with olive oil-based emulsion including in-vitro studies, animal studies, and infusion
      studies in healthy subjects and in various patient groups. In-vitro and animal studies
      demonstrate that the impairment of immune function, especially of T cell responses, that
      occurs with soybean oil-based emulsions is avoided with ClinOleic. Studies in infants and
      adults have consistently shown that olive oil-based emulsion increases the oleic acid content
      of blood lipids and that it avoids the depletion of long chain n-6 PUFA derivatives of
      linoleic acid that is seen with soybean oil-based emulsion. The less unsaturated nature of
      olive oil-based emulsion compared will possibly decrease oxidative stress. Further studies
      are required to test their beneficial effect from olive oil consumption in preterm infants.

      The investigators designed a double-blind, randomized clinical trial to performed the effect
      of lipometabolism, oxidative stress and clinical outcomes of olive oil , MCY/LCT and LCT
      lipid emulsions.
