    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe and the United States of America (USA).

      The aim of the trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of two different titration
      algorithms for insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDeg/IAsp) in subjects with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus previously treated with insulin glargine.

        <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Nocturnal (00:01-05:59) Confirmed Hypoglycaemic Episodes</title>
        <description>Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes consisted of episodes of severe hypoglycaemia and minor hypoglycaemic episodes. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as requiring assistance to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Minor hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose below 3.1 mmol/L. Nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as occurring between 00:01 and 05:59 am.</description>

            <description>Insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) was injected subcutaneously (s.c.) in either abdomen, upper arm (deltoid area) or thigh. A pre-filled pen injector (PDS290) was used to administer IDegAsp.

In the IDegAsp twice daily (BID) simple titration algorithm arm, self-titration was performed twice weekly at intervals of 3-4 days and based upon a single pre-breakfast and pre-dinner self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) value.</description>
