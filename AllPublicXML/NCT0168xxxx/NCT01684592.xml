    <textblock>
      Smoking is a leading cause of death and other negative health outcomes. While a high
      percentage of women quit smoking during pregnancy, the majority relapse in the first 6 months
      postpartum. We propose developing and pilot testing a phone-based postpartum continuing care
      (PPCC) protocol based on existing evidence-based approaches to increase smoking cessation,
      reduce relapse, increase early re-intervention, and reduce infant exposure to environmental
      tobacco smoke in the postpartum period.

    <textblock>
      The large majority of women who quit smoking during pregnancy relapse in the first six months
      postpartum, highlighting a need for effective postpartum continuing care that supports women
      through the challenging postpartum period when stress is high and motivation to stay quit may
      decline. Existing relapse prevention interventions (typically delivered during pregnancy)
      have been found to be of little benefit during the postpartum period, suggesting the need for
      a more formal continuing care approach. Phone-based protocols for smoking cessation have been
      widely disseminated and effective because they address the need for flexible access, but are
      passive and not typically utilized by women in the postpartum period.

      The proposed pilot study will develop and test a Phone-based Postpartum Continuing Care
      (PPCC) model that draws from existing evidence-based protocols--the 5 A's and Recovery
      Management Checkups (RMC)-- shown to be effective with other populations. The experimental
      PPCC will reinforce the importance of abstinence, relapse prevention, and reduced smoking
      through proactive re-intervention (i.e., RMC) with the 5 A's at times when postpartum women
      are more likely to relapse, and provide education and monitoring of the infant's direct and
      indirect exposure to nicotine through breastfeeding and secondhand smoke. We will evaluate
      PPCC's effectiveness relative to a passive referral to a 24/7 hotline, which is current
      standard care.

      Approximately one hundred thirty women in their first or second trimester of pregnancy who
      were nicotine-dependent in the past year, currently smoke, or quit within the past 90 days
      will be recruited at their first prenatal appointment at the Maryland Women's Center (MWC) in
      Baltimore, Maryland. All women will receive the clinic's standard of care for smoking
      cessation--the 5 A's --during pregnancy from their physician. Half will be randomly assigned
      to an experimental group getting PPCC for 6 months postpartum and half to a control group
      receiving only a referral to a passive 24/7 state quit line postpartum. It is expected that
      in the 6 months following childbirth women in the experimental PPCC (relative to those in the
      control group) will: a) smoke fewer cigarettes, b) smoke fewer days, c) go longer before
      postpartum relapse, d) have less time between relapse and talking to a health professional
      about smoking, e) have less time between relapse and resumption of abstinence , f) smoke
      fewer times while breastfeeding, g) smoke fewer times while in the same room as the infant,
      and h) reduce their infant's cotinine levels.

      The aims of this pilot project are to develop PPCC from existing evidence-based approaches,
      demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the PPCC intervention with at least 80%
      compliance and at least 80% follow-up at each wave, and evaluate the effect size associated
      with receiving standard care vs. standard care + PPCC in order to understand the promise of
      and appropriate power required for a larger clinical trial.

    <description>Infant urine was collected at 6 months postpartum using the &quot;cotton roll&quot; method of urine collection. Cotinine was measured with NicCheck I Test Strips that determine the urinary concentration of nicotine and its metabolites based on a colorimetric reaction. The test strip is dipped into participant's urine and changes color (varying shades of pink) in the presence of cotinine. Cotinine level is determined by matching the test strip with a color chart provided by the manufacturer. The intensity of color on the strip at the end of 15 minutes may be compared to those on the color chart, to differentiate between &quot;low&quot; (score 1-6) versus &quot;high&quot; (score 7-14) nicotine consumption. Absence of a color is considered a negative result (score 0). Based on comparison with gas chromatography urine cotinine values, individuals with cotinine values of 200 ng/mL and above are classified as smokers.</description>

Standard care: All women will receive the standard of care approach (5 A’s and referral to a 24/7 quit line postpartum) from MWC during pregnancy. The 5 A’s brief intervention was modified by ACOG for use with pregnant women and is recommended to help pregnant women quit smoking.

Phone-based postpartum continuing care: PPCC Counselors will make initial contact with participants in the experimental group at 36 weeks gestation (i.e., one week prior to full-term), will call again within one week after the baby’s birth, and eight additional times over the course of the first six months postpartum. The PPCC protocol will be developed based on the 5 A's (standard of care during pregnancy) and the Recovery Management Checkup model where relapse is expected and efforts are made to take a more proactive approach to identify women who are having cravings or have relapsed and re-intervene with them as soon as possible to assist them in regaining smoking abstinence. Women in the experimental group will also have the option of calling the PPCC line 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</description>

Standard care: All women will receive the standard of care approach (5 A’s and referral to a 24/7 quit line postpartum) from MWC during pregnancy. The 5 A’s brief intervention was modified by ACOG for use with pregnant women and is recommended to help pregnant women quit smoking. It includes the following steps: Ask about tobacco use, Advise to quit, Assess willingness to make a quit attempt, Assist in quit attempt, and Arrange follow-up.</description>

Phone-based postpartum continuing care: PPCC Counselors will make initial contact with participants in the experimental group at 36 weeks gestation (i.e., one week prior to full-term), will call again within one week after the baby’s birth, and eight additional times over the course of the first six months postpartum. The PPCC protocol will be developed based on the 5 A's (standard of care during pregnancy) and the Recovery Management Checkup model where relapse is expected and efforts are made to take a more proactive approach to identify women who are having cravings or have relapsed and re-intervene with them as soon as possible to assist them in regaining smoking abstinence. Women in the experimental group will also have the option of calling the PPCC line 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</description>

        <title>NicCheck Test Results for Cotinine Level From Infant Urine</title>
        <description>Infant urine was collected at 6 months postpartum using the “cotton roll” method of urine collection. Cotinine was measured with NicCheck I Test Strips that determine the urinary concentration of nicotine and its metabolites based on a colorimetric reaction. The test strip is dipped into participant’s urine and changes color (varying shades of pink) in the presence of cotinine. Cotinine level is determined by matching the test strip with a color chart provided by the manufacturer. The intensity of color on the strip at the end of 15 minutes may be compared to those on the color chart, to differentiate between “low” (score 1-6) versus “high” (score 7-14) nicotine consumption. Absence of a color is considered a negative result (score 0). Based on comparison with gas chromatography urine cotinine values, individuals with cotinine values of 200 ng/mL and above are classified as smokers.</description>
