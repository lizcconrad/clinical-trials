  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-Anastomosis Duodeno-Ileal bypass with a 250 cm common/alimentary loop is a
      modification of standard duodenal switch in which a Roux-en-Y duodeno-ileal anastomosis is
      performed at 250 cm from the cecum and a 60 cm to 100 cm common channel is build up.
      Hypothesis of the study is that Single-Anastomosis Duodeno-Ileal bypass behaves at least
      equally to standard duodenal switch as a second step after sleeve gastrectomy in the
      super-morbid patient. Secondary aims are to demonstrate that single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal
      bypass is simpler to perform, quicker and has less postoperative short, mid and long-term
      complications.

    <textblock>
      Sleeve gastrectomy is a restrictive operation for morbid obesity which has a 60% success rate
      in solving both morbid obesity and related co-morbidities, mainly diabetes mellitus. When the
      sleeve is not enough for the patient, due to alimentary habits or to an excessive initial BMI
      before surgery (usually over 50 - 55), a second-step operation should be performed to
      increase effectiveness. Some patients are submitted to a second restrictive operation, i.e.:
      a re-sleeve, a gastric plication or sleeve banding. Other group are offered a gastric bypass.
      And, finally, a subset of patients, generally those with higher initial BMI, are offered a
      malabsorptive operation. While re-sleeve is adequate for many patients, gastric bypass is not
      offering a greater weight loss rate, and it is a complex operation requiring sectioning of
      the sleeve and two anastomoses. We support the performance of malabsorptive operations which
      warrant a better weight loss result for &quot;resistant&quot; patients needing a second-step. As
      Single-Anastomosis Duodeno-Ileal bypass with Sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) has behaved as a
      good primary operation for morbid obesity, we decided to test this one-loop reconstruction as
      a second step operation. Results will be compared to those obtained with a Roux-en-Y duodenal
      switch performed as a second step after a &quot;failed&quot; sleeve.
