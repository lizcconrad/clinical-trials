  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pazopanib hydrochloride and
      bevacizumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with previously untreated
      kidney cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Pazopanib
      hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Pazopanib hydrochloride may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      blood flow to the tumor. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can prevent tumor growth
      by blocking the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving pazopanib hydrochloride
      together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safe phase II dose of this novel regimen. (Phase I) II. To determine the
      median progression free survival (PFS) from this novel regimen. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of the proposed regimen. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the
      response rate. (Phase I) III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of pazopanib (pazopanib
      hydrochloride). (Phase I) IV. To evaluate the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      levels and myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC) levels at various time points and correlate
      with response. (Phase I) V. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of this new regimen. (Phase
      II) VI. To evaluate the VEGF levels, interleukin (IL)-8 levels and MDSC levels at various
      time points and correlate with outcome. (Phase II) VII. To evaluate the PFS rate at 12
      months. (Phase II) VIII. To evaluate overall survival. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) on days 1-28, and bevacizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 36 and 50. Courses repeat every 70 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
