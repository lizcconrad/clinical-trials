  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of chronic heart failure requires multidisciplinary approaches with a recognized
      role for cardiac rehabilitation. Rehabilitation helps to improve patient's functional,
      decrease morbidity and mortality, decrease rehospitalization rate, thereby reducing costs of
      this disease. After recovery from the acute phase of cardiac infarction, patients admitted to
      the rehabilitation center will follow the usual rehabilitation program during the
      hospitalization period. This step precludes outpatient follow-up period in our day hospital,
      in accordance with their physicians and cardiologists who manage the monitoring. The study
      INCARD (Insuffisance Cardiaque en Readaptation Durable) will be developed to evaluate the
      benefits of a sustainable rehabilitation heart failure on patients treated optimally and
      educated during a follow-up period of 24 months. The main objective of the study will be to
      compare the benefits of rehabilitation between coronary (C) and non-coronary (NC) patients
      for each evaluation time point, periodically recorded

      We will undertake a prospective follow-up study of 150 rehabilitated patients with heart
      failure (75 C; 75 NC). The main objective will be to compare the benefits of rehabilitation
      between coronary and non-coronary patients based on functional improvement i.e. improvements
      of VO2max, LVEF (ultrasound method and/or isotopic), 6-min walk test, Minnesota index of
      quality of life. In addition, clinical outcomes (HR, SBP, DBP, BMI) and paraclinical data
      (creatinine clearance) will be measured as patients' standard clinical follow-up .

      Clinical data of the patients admitted to the cardiac rehabilitation, including heart failure
      patients (LVEF &lt;40), will be recorded after collection of their signed informed consent
      agreement. Patients will be addressed from heart failure intensive care units for coronary
      (USIC) or acute cardiac services to the rehabilitation department. Patients will be admitted
      in the rehabilitation department when there are clinically stable (at least three weeks after
      the acute episode). Etiology of the heart failure will be assessed and patients stratified as
      C or NC patients.

      Expected Results We will estimate the mean duration of inpatient rehabilitation (H period).
      Then, we will follow patients' cardiac evaluation parameters recorded from an outpatient
      follow-up, first 3 months after inclusion and then every 6 months over the 24 months of
      outpatient follow-up.

      These data will allow for comparison of the benefits of rehabilitation between coronary (C)
      and non-coronary (NC) patients for each evaluation time point and will give information on
      the clinical improvement of each group of patients.
