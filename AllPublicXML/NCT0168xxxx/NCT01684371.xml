    <textblock>
      The treatment of osteoarthritis, a disease that eventually affects the majority of the older
      population, involves the alleviation of symptoms such as pain and stiffness, and the
      reduction of inflammation. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study will be
      performed to examine the effect of topical application of Elmore Oil, a herbal remedy
      (containing Eucalyptus oil, Tea tree oil, Olive oil and Vanilla), which has recently been
      reported to have anti-inflammatory properties, on the symptoms of osteoarthritis.

      Sixty patients were randomly selected and approved for the study, 30 patients with even
      numbers received the blue dotted Elmore oil and 30 patients with odd numbers got the orange
      dotted Elmore and were advised to apply 3x daily on the affected knees respectively for four
      weeks. On the fifth week, they stopped application for 7 days as flush out period. Then on
      the 6th week a cross over was done on the patients - the blue dotted patients, this time
      received the orange dotted Elmore Oil and vice-versa and did the application three times
      daily for another 4 weeks. All throughout the usage, they filled out their diaries (noting
      the degree of pain, feeling of well being (improved sleep, mobility, ability to do their
      daily activities at home or at work). A pre-application base line laboratory tests were done,
      after 4 weeks and after 8 weeks.
