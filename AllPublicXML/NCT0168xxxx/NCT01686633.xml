  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, stratified, parallel-group study
      with three active comparators in subjects with moderate to severe persistent asthma. The
      study consists of a run-in period of 4 weeks, followed by a treatment period of 12 weeks, and
      a follow up contact period of one week. The total duration of the study is 17 weeks. 990
      subjects will be randomized to one of three treatments (FF/VI Inhalation Powder 200/25 mcg
      once daily in the evening; FF/VI Inhalation Powder 100/25 mcg once daily in the evening; FF
      100 Inhalation Powder once daily in the evening) for 12 weeks. In addition, all subjects will
      be supplied albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol at Visit 1 to use as needed for acute
      asthma symptoms throughout the entire study. Subjects will attend four on-treatment visits at
      Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 (Visits 4 through 7).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Over 0 to 24 Hours Post-dose at the End of the 12-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The weighted mean was calculated from the pre-dose FEV1 (within 30 minutes prior to dosing) and post-dose FEV1 measurements at 5, 15, and 30 minutes and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 16, 20, 23, and 24 hours on Day 84/Week 12. At each time point, the highest of three technically acceptable measurements was recorded. Change from Baseline was calculated as the weighted mean of the 24-hour serial FEV1 measures on Day 84/Week 12 minus the Baseline value. Baseline was the pre-dose FEV1 measurement value obtained at Visit 3. The analysis was performed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with covariates of Baseline FEV1, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinic Visit Trough FEV1 at the End of the 12-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is defined as a pre-dose FEV1 measurement taken at a clinic visit while still on-treatment. Change from Baseline in trough FEV1 at the end of the 12-week treatment period was defined using the 24-hour post-dose serial FEV1 measurement taken at the Week 12 clinic visit. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 12 trough FEV1 value minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of Baseline trough FEV1, region, sex, age, and treatment. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement at scheduled clinic visits was used to impute the missing measurements.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Rescue-free 24-hour (hr) Periods During the 12-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1-12</time_frame>
    <description>The number of inhalations of rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol used during the day and night was recorded by the participants in a daily electronic diary (eDiary). A 24-hour (hr) period in which a participant's responses to both the morning and evening assessments indicated no use of rescue medication was considered to be rescue free. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily eDiary prior to the randomization of the participant. Change from Baseline was calculated as the averaged value during the 12-week treatment period minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Symptom-free 24-hour (hr) Periods During the 12-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1-12</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma symptoms were recorded in a daily eDairy by the participants every day in the morning and evening before taking any rescue or study medication and before the peak expiratory flow measurement. A 24-hour (hr) period in which a participant's responses to both the morning and evening assessments indicated no symptoms was considered to be symptom free. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily eDiary prior to the randomization of the participant. Change from Baseline was calculated as the averaged value during the 12-week treatment period minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Daily Morning (AM) Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Averaged Over the 12-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1-12</time_frame>
    <description>Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. PEF was measured by the participants using a hand-held electronic peak flow meter each evening prior to the dose of study medication and any rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol use and each morning. The best of three measurements was recorded. Change from Baseline (defined as the last 7 days prior to randomization of the participants) was calculated as the value of the averaged daily AM PEF over the 12-week treatment period minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants meeting eligibility criteria at the Screening visit entered a 4-week Run-in Period for Baseline safety evaluations and measures of asthma status. Participants were then randomized to a 12-week Treatment Period. A total of 2019 participants were screened; 1039 were randomized and received &gt;=1 dose of study treatment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>One participant was determined to have been randomized at each of two United States sites. Upon discovery of the duplicate enrollment, the participant was withdrawn. To account for only one randomization by this participant, a total randomized population of 1039 was used as the basis for the study analysis.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Over 0 to 24 Hours Post-dose at the End of the 12-week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The weighted mean was calculated from the pre-dose FEV1 (within 30 minutes prior to dosing) and post-dose FEV1 measurements at 5, 15, and 30 minutes and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 16, 20, 23, and 24 hours on Day 84/Week 12. At each time point, the highest of three technically acceptable measurements was recorded. Change from Baseline was calculated as the weighted mean of the 24-hour serial FEV1 measures on Day 84/Week 12 minus the Baseline value. Baseline was the pre-dose FEV1 measurement value obtained at Visit 3. The analysis was performed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with covariates of Baseline FEV1, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinic Visit Trough FEV1 at the End of the 12-week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is defined as a pre-dose FEV1 measurement taken at a clinic visit while still on-treatment. Change from Baseline in trough FEV1 at the end of the 12-week treatment period was defined using the 24-hour post-dose serial FEV1 measurement taken at the Week 12 clinic visit. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 12 trough FEV1 value minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of Baseline trough FEV1, region, sex, age, and treatment. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement at scheduled clinic visits was used to impute the missing measurements.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Daily Morning (AM) Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Averaged Over the 12-week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. PEF was measured by the participants using a hand-held electronic peak flow meter each evening prior to the dose of study medication and any rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol use and each morning. The best of three measurements was recorded. Change from Baseline (defined as the last 7 days prior to randomization of the participants) was calculated as the value of the averaged daily AM PEF over the 12-week treatment period minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>
