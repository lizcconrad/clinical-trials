  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of lipids as risk factors for cardiovascular events is well-documented, although
      events studied have largely been broad classes without specific detail. This study will
      examine a more refined set of endpoints.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) as risk factors for cardiovascular events
      is well-documented. The Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration found approximately log-linear
      adjusted associations of cholesterol concentrations with risks of first-time non-fatal
      myocardial infarction; coronary heart disease (CHD) death; ischaemic, haemorrhagic and
      unclassified stroke. They also found that triglycerides concentration was not independently
      related with CHD risk after controlling for HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, and other
      standard risk factors. The Prospective Studies Collaboration found that Higher HDL-C and
      lower non-HDL-C levels were approximately independently associated with lower ischaemic heart
      disease mortality. By focusing on broad outcomes these large meta-analyses conflate the
      association between development of the different cardiovascular disease (CVD) phenotypes,
      disease progression and mortality from cardiovascular causes.

      With linked electronic health records, we have the potential for a cohort with sufficient
      size and clinical detail to investigate the association between lipid concentrations and
      initial presentation of a range of CVD phenotypes across cerebral, coronary, abdominal and
      peripheral arterial circulations.

        The cohort used in the present analysis was drawn from patients registered with 225 GPRD
        general practices in England which consented to data linkage, covering approximately 5% of
        the UK population. We used an open cohort design, where participants joined the cohort when
        they met the inclusion criteria at any point between 1st January 2001 and 25th March 2010,
        the date of the last GPRD data submission. Patients were included in cohort if, prior to
        study entry, they were aged 30 to 100, had at least one year of electronic health record
        data which meet General Practice Research Database data quality standards, and had no
        record indicating any cardiovascular disease phenotypes. Patients were followed up until
        the date of an initial presentation of one of our cardiovascular endpoints or were censored
        on the date of leaving the practice or the date of last data submission from their
        practice.
