          5. Willingness to receive EXPERIMENTAL treatment

          6. Informed consent agreement signed by the subject

          7. Willingness to follow the treatment schedule and post treatment care requirements

          8. Willingness to not use topical or systemic retinoids or antibiotics during the course

          2. Subject has an infection or other dermatologic condition (aside from acne) in the area
             to be treated

          3. Subject has known cold sensitivity disorders including Raynaud's phenomena, cold
             urticaria, cryoglobulinemia, and cold induced hemoglobinuria

          4. Presence of suntan in the area to be treated

          9. Subject is currently enrolled in a clinical study of any other unapproved
             investigational drug or device.

         10. Any other condition or laboratory value that would, in the professional opinion of the
             investigator, potentially affect the subject's response or the integrity of the data
             or would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject.
