    <textblock>
      This proposal hypothesizes that oral supplementation with sodium nitrite or nitrate will
      result in in vivo conversion of nitrate to nitrite and nitrite to nitric oxide with limited
      toxicity in the doses proposed in healthy adult normal volunteers. We utilize a powerful in
      vivo technique (pharmacokinetic testing) and are the first to design inorganic nitrate and
      nitrite capsules for cardiovascular disease.

      Preclinical and clinical research over the last decade has revealed the important
      vasoprotective effects of nitrates and nitrites with regards to reduction in blood pressure,
      vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. New findings suggest an effect of nitrate
      and nitrite therapy in the regulation of glucose-insulin homeostasis. Development of an oral
      formulation of nitrate and nitrite salts is attractive, whereby nitrite would ensure rapid
      acting effects upon absorption, while the nitrate would continuously provide a slow formation
      of nitrite over a prolonged period of time via the enterosalivary circulation pathway.

      For this reason, development of an oral formulation of nitrate and nitrite salts is
      attractive, whereby nitrite would ensure rapid acting effects upon absorption, while the
      nitrate would continuously provide a slow formation of nitrite over a prolonged period of
      time via the enterosalivary circulation pathway. This study aims to establish the
      pharmacokinetics, metabolism and interconversion of nitrate to nitrite and nitrite to nitric
      oxide in vivo in healthy adult normal volunteers.
