  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, observational study will evaluate the treatment patterns in clinical
      practice, efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
      who have had an inadequate response (or were intolerant to) treatment with non-biological
      disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or with one biological agent. Data will be
      collected from each eligible participant initiated on tocilizumab treatment by their treating
      physician according to approved label for 6 months from start of treatment.

        <title>Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Scores at Baseline</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI is a questionnaire that measures functional status (disability) and health-related quality of life. It measures the participant's ability to perform everyday tasks. The index consists of 20 questions regarding the function of the upper and lower extremities. These questions are summarized in 8 categories: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common activities over past week. Each question is evaluated according to the degree of severity on a 4-point scale. Total score for HAQ-DI is the average of all questions and ranges from 0 = without any difficulty to 3 = unable to do.</description>

        <description>Morning stiffness was defined by the time elapsed between the time of usual awakening (even if not in the morning) and the time the participant was able to resume normal activities without stiffness. The participant assessed morning stiffness based on the following criteria:
Presence of participant's joints stiff when woke up that day, measured as yes or no
Duration of morning stiffness, measured using a ruler on a 100 mm VAS by 1 of the six categories: &lt; 30 minutes, between 30 and 240 minutes, &gt; 240 minutes, and the whole day.
Severity of morning stiffness measured using a ruler on a 100 mm VAS where the responses were on a continuous range from 0 = no stiffness to 100 = maximum stiffness.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 score is a measurement of RA activity on a 0 to 10 scale, with higher scores representing higher disease activity, and calculated as DAS28 = 0.56 x √TJC28 + 0.28 x √SJC28 + 0.70 x natural logarithm (ln) (CRP + 1) + 0.014 x PGH + 0.96, where TJC28 = tender joint count on 28 units, SJC28 = swollen joint count on 28 units, CRP = serum concentration of c-reactive protein (after converting units to mg/dL), PGH = patient global assessment of disease activity, which was measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 = managing very well and 100 = managing very poorly. A score of less than 2.6 represents clinical remission, a score of greater than or equal to 2.6 and less than or equal to 3.2 represents low disease activity, a score of greater than 3.2 and less than or equal to 5.1 represents moderate disease activity, and a score of greater than 5.1 represents high (or severe) disease.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Good European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response at Month 3 and Month 6</title>
        <description>Clinical response was assessed according to EULAR criteria that classified the participant according to individual changes in DAS28 score as good, moderate, or no response. The DAS28 score is a measurement of RA activity on a 0 to 10 scale, with higher scores represent higher disease activity, and calculated as DAS28 = 0.56 x √TJC28 + 0.28 x √SJC28 + 0.36 x ln(CRP + 1) + 0.014 x PGH + 0.96, where TJC28 = tender joint count on 28 units, SJC28 = swollen joint count on 28 units, CRP = serum concentration of c­reactive protein (after converting units to mg/dL), PGH = patient's global assessment of disease activity, which was measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 = managing very well and 100 = managing very poorly. Good responders experienced a change from baseline of greater than 1.2 with a DAS28 score less than or equal to 3.2.</description>

        <description>The CDAI is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA and calculated as CDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + PGH (in centimeters) + PhGH (in centimeters), where TJC28 = tender joint count on 28 units, SJC28 = swollen joint count on 28 units, PGH = patient's global assessment of disease activity, assessed on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 = managing very well and 100 = managing very poorly, and PhGH = physician global assessment of disease activity, assessed on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 = no arthritis activity and 100 = extremely active arthritis; with a total score ranged from 0-76. Higher scores indicate greater disease activity. CDAI score of less than or equal to 2.8 represents clinical remission, score of less than or equal to 10.0 represents low disease activity, score of less than or equal to 22.0 represents moderate disease activity, and score of greater than 22.0 represents high (or severe) disease.</description>

        <description>The SDAI is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA and calculated as SDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + PGH (in centimeters) + PhGH (in centimeters) + CRP (in mg/dL), where TJC28 = tender joint count on 28 units, SJC28 = swollen joint count on 28 units, PGH = patient's global assessment of disease activity, assessed on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 = managing very well and 100 = managing very poorly, PhGH = physician global assessment of disease activity, assessed on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 = no arthritis activity and 100 = extremely active arthritis, CRP = serum concentration of c-reactive protein; with a total SDAI score ranged from 0-86. Higher scores indicate greater disease activity. SDAI scores of less than or equal to 3.3 represents clinical remission, less than or equal to 11.0 represents low disease activity, less than or equal to 26.0 represents moderate disease activity, and greater than 26.0 represents high (or severe) disease.</description>

TJC and SJC, based on 28-joint assessments. Number of tender joints and swollen joints were recorded on the joint assessment form at baseline, no tenderness = 0 and tenderness = 1, no swelling = 0 and swelling =1, respectively. HAQ measures functional status (disability) and health-related quality of life with 20 questions, summarized in 8 categories: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common activities over past week, 0=without difficulty to 3=unable to do. Patient's assessment of pain assessed using a VAS; 0=no pain, 100=unbearable pain; PGA and PhGA, assessed using VAS ; 0= no disease activity, 100=maximum disease activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI Score at Months 3 and 6</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI is a questionnaire that measures functional status (disability) and health-related quality of life. It measures the participant's ability to perform everyday tasks. The index consists of 20 questions regarding the function of the upper and lower extremities. These questions are summarized in 8 categories: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common activities over past week. Each question was evaluated according to the degree of severity on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 = without any difficulty to 3 = unable to do. Total score is the sum of each question, which ranges from 0 to 60, where higher scores represent higher disease activity. The change from baseline in HAQ-DI score at Month 3 and Month 6 was calculated as the difference between HAQ­D1 score reported at baseline and the HAQ­D1 score reported at Month 3 and Month 6.</description>
