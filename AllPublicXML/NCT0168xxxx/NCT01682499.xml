    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study evaluating the feasibility of intravenous calcium and magnesium (Ca/Mg)
      infusion for prevention of taxane induced neuropathy in patients with early stage breast
      cancer receiving adjuvant or neo-adjuvant paclitaxel, either given every 2 weeks for 4 cycles
      or every week for 12 weeks.

    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a major dose limiting side effect of
      many cytotoxic chemotherapy, and can be extremely disabling, causing significant loss of
      functional abilities. Calcium and magnesium infusions were shown to decreased the incidence
      and intensity of neuropathy symptoms related to oxaliplatin.

      There are currently no effective drugs or treatment modalities for the prevention or
      treatment of taxane related neuropathy. Given the morbidity of taxane induced neuropathy and
      the safety of Ca/Mg infusion, it is reasonable to assess the feasibility of this intervention
      in woman with stage I-III breast cancer receiving adjuvant or neo-adjuvant paclitaxel
      treatment, either given every 2 weeks for 4 cycles or every week for 12 weeks. Calcium
      gluconate and magnesium sulfate, 1 g of each agent in 100 ml D5W will be infused over 30
      minutes, immediately before and after each dose of paclitaxel. The Ca/Mg infusion will be
      given through the same line used for giving chemotherapy.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess paclitaxel-related neuropathy (grade 2 or greater)
      as measured by NCI Common Terminology Criteria Version 3 in patients receiving Ca/Mg infusion
      during paclitaxel chemotherapy and compare it with historical controls. Secondary endpoints
      will include other measures of neuropathy and quality of life such as the FACT-Tax score,
      taxane-related neuropathy pain as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF),
      and measure of cognitive impairment using FACT-cog score.
