    <textblock>
      This study proposes to balance supply and demand of male circumcision through a systematic
      scale-up of coordinated biomedical surgical and behavioral counseling services. The study
      will compare the combined biobehavioral sexual risk reduction intervention to the standard of
      care, which focuses exclusively on the provision of circumcision services alone, with the
      goal of optimizing both local and national HIV prevention efforts.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Average of 1 month post-baseline, 6 month and 12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Readiness to undergo male circumcision will be assessed using the stages of change model (pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance). Intervention and attention control conditions will be compared at baseline, immediately following intervention, and 6 and 12 months post-intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Uptake of male circumcision</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of study enrollment to the date male circumcision is performed or study completion.</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if participants in the sexual risk reduction/MC promotion intervention (experimental condition) will be more likely to shift to the &quot;Action&quot; stage (undergo circumcision), in comparison with participants having identical MC services available plus usual care (attention control condition).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Male and female condom use post male circumcision</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after undergoing male circumcision</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether MC will significantly affect the maintenance of safer sexual practices (&quot;risk compensation&quot;) in the experimental group as compared to the attention control group</description>

    <description>Male participants in the standard of care control condition CHCs will receive counseling per the VCT protocol guidelines. Participants will attend four video-based time-equivalent &quot;attention-control&quot; group sessions on endemic disease prevention strategies (e.g., TB, malaria, cholera, waterborne diseases). Female partners will be invited to participate in a similar four session program devoted to endemic disease risk reduction.</description>

          -  Able to understand and sign informed consent in English, Bemba, or Nyanja

          -  Have not requested male circumcision services at the time of or following VCT

          -  Female partners of enrolled males are invited to participate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Men seeking circumcision services are not eligible for this study

          -  Men with genital abnormalities requiring MC, e.g. balanitis (inflammation of the
             preputial skin), posthitis (inflammation of the glans penis; common in patients with
             diabetes), phimosis (scarring of the distal margins of the foreskin) resulting from
             chronic balanitis, paraphimosis (the inability to pull the retracted foreskin back
             over the glans) or diseases of the foreskin, including localized carcinoma are not
             eligible for this study

          -  Men with congenital or acquired penile abnormalities that require the preputial skin
             for generative repair, such as hypospadias (urethra exits from underside of penis) are
             not eligible to participate

          -  Participants unable to provide informed consent will not be eligible.
