      Specific Primary Aims include:

      Aim # 1. The investigators explore the feasibility of using the TMS to investigate the
      cortical excitability and to inhibit meth cue craving in meth dependent population. The
      investigators anticipate that meth elevates cortical excitability measured by motor
      threshold, causes changes of cortical silent period, and RC. The investigators also
      anticipate that paired pulse measures (short-interval intracortical inhibition,
      short-interval intracortical facilitation and long-interval intracortical inhibition) will be
      different from healthy control, which are more directly linked to glutamatergic cortical
      facilitation and GABAergic inhibition, respectively.

      Aim # 2. Given the change of the cortical excitability in meth users, the investigators will
      use inhibiting TMS (1 Hz) over medial prefrontal cortex to study whether TMS can be used to
      reduce cue craving. The investigators hypothesize that repetitive TMS reduce meth cue craving
      in meth dependent population compared with sham rTMS.

             not have received substance abuse treatment within the previous 30 days.

          2. Be male or female of any race or ethnic group, between the ages of 18 and 50 years.

          3. Meet DSM IV criteria for meth dependence as determined by the MINI International
             Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).

          4. Currently be using meth by smoked, oral, or intravenous routes of administration, used
             meth for a minimum of 2 years and a minimum of an average of 3 times a week in the 30
