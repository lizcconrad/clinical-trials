    <textblock>
      This study is comprised of two portions: a Phase 1 portion and a Phase 2 portion. The Phase 1
      portion is a single-country, non-randomized, open label, clinical trial which will evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and PK profile of PD-0332991 as a single
      agent in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors, and PD-0332991 in combination with
      letrozole in the first-line treatment of Japanese patients with ER(+) HER2(-) ABC. The Phase
      2 portion is a single-country, non-randomized, open-label, single-cohort, multi-center
      clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-0332991 in combination with
      letrozole for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal Japanese patients with ER(+) HER2(-)
      ABC.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Disease Control (DC): Phase 2</measure>
    <time_frame>From initiation of treatment up to disease progression (up to 21 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control was defined as CR, PR or stable disease for &gt;=24 weeks according to the RECIST version 1.1 recorded in the time period between first dose of study treatment and disease progression or death to any cause. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease. All target nodes reduced to normal size (short axis &lt;10 millimeter [mm]). PR was defined as &gt;=30 percent decrease in sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions. Stable disease was defined as not achieving an objective response with confirmed CR or PR according to RECIST version 1.1, as determined by the investigators, relative to the response evaluable population, but remained stable for at least 24 weeks after first dose, then the best overall response for such a participant was considered as stable disease. Percentage of participants with disease control were reported.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS): Phase 2</measure>
    <time_frame>From initiation of treatment up to follow-up period (up to 21 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival was defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to date of death due to any cause. In the absence of confirmation of death, survival time was censored to last date the participant was known to be alive. OS was estimated with Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <description>The functional assessment of cancer therapy (FACT) is a modular approach to assess participant's health-related quality of life. FACT-B total score was derived from the sum of these 5 sub-scale scores: physical well-being, social/family well-being and functional well-being (all 3 sub-scales consisting of 7 items ranging from 0 to 28, where higher scores indicating better quality of life), emotional well-being (consists of 6 items and ranging from 0 to 24, where higher scores indicating better quality of life, and a breast cancer subscale (consists of 9 items and ranging from 0 to 36, where higher scores indicating better quality of life). Each individual item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (not at all good) to 4 (very well), where higher scores indicating better quality of life. FACT-B total score range was of 0 (not at all good) to 144 (very well), where higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) By Severity: Part 2 Phase 1</title>
        <description>AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An AE was considered treatment emergent if occurred for the first time after the start of study treatment or occurred prior to the start of treatment but increased in National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE grade during study treatment period. AE severity was defined to be the maximum toxicity grade of the TEAEs experienced by the participants during the study. AE was assessed according to severity as: Grade 1 (mild AE), Grade 2 (moderate AE), Grade 3 (severe AE), Grade 4 (life-threatening consequences) and Grade 5 (death related to AE).</description>

        <description>PFS was defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to the date of the first documentation of objective progression of disease (PD) or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD, whichever occurs first. PD was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.1-year PFS was defined as the percentage of participants without PFS events (PD or death due to any cause) at 12 months based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate. Percentage of participants with 1-year PFS with 90% confidence interval (CI) were reported.</description>

        <description>Vz/F is apparent volume of distribution estimated from terminal phase, which is calculated as CL/F/kel. Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. It was calculated by dividing the given oral dose by area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity which is calculated by log-linear trapezoidal method (AUCinf). kel is the terminal phase rate constant calculated by a linear regression of the log-linear concentration-time curve.</description>

        <description>Disease control was defined as CR, PR or stable disease for &gt;=24 weeks according to the RECIST version 1.1 recorded in the time period between first dose of study treatment and disease progression or death to any cause. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease. All target nodes reduced to normal size (short axis &lt;10 millimeter [mm]). PR was defined as &gt;=30 percent decrease in sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions. Stable disease was defined as not achieving an objective response with confirmed CR or PR according to RECIST version 1.1, as determined by the investigators, relative to the response evaluable population, but remained stable for at least 24 weeks after first dose, then the best overall response for such a participant was considered as stable disease.

        <description>The functional assessment of cancer therapy (FACT) is a modular approach to assess participant’s health-related quality of life. FACT-B total score was derived from the sum of these 5 sub-scale scores: physical well-being, social/family well-being and functional well-being (all 3 sub-scales consisting of 7 items ranging from 0 to 28, where higher scores indicating better quality of life), emotional well-being (consists of 6 items and ranging from 0 to 24, where higher scores indicating better quality of life, and a breast cancer subscale (consists of 9 items and ranging from 0 to 36, where higher scores indicating better quality of life). Each individual item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (not at all good) to 4 (very well), where higher scores indicating better quality of life. FACT-B total score range was of 0 (not at all good) to 144 (very well), where higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

        <description>FACT is a modular approach to assess participant’s health-related quality of life. FACT-G total score was derived from the sum of these 4 sub-scale scores: physical well-being, social/family well-being and functional well-being (all 3 sub-scales consisting of 7 items ranging from 0 to 28, where higher scores indicating better quality of life), emotional well-being (consists of 6 items and ranging from 0 to 24, where higher scores indicating better quality of life. Each individual item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (not at all good) to 4 (very well), where higher scores indicating better quality of life. FACT-G total score range was of 0 (not at all good) to 108 (very well), where higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>
