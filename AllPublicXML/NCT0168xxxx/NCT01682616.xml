  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and tolerability of
      ABT-199 in combination with rituximab in up to 50 subjects with Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic
      Leukemia and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma. The primary objectives of this study are to assess
      the safety profile, to determine the maximum tolerated dose and establish the Recommended
      Phase Two Dose of ABT-199 when administered in combination with rituximab. The dose
      escalation portion of the study will include approximately 30 subjects. Once the recommended
      phase two dose and schedule have been determined, up to 20 additional subjects will be
      enrolled in an expanded safety portion of the study. Subjects who meet criteria for CR, CRi,
      or MRD-negative PR during the study may discontinue ABT 199. If disease progression occurs,
      as defined by iwCLL NCI/WG criteria for tumor response, subjects may re-initiate ABT-199.
