  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study, national, unicentric, double-blind, to be conducted at the
      Institute for Teaching and Research of the Hospital Sírio-Libanês in order to detect possible
      autonomic responses resulting from Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields of Low Energy (EEFLE)
      in healthy subjects and in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma or in patients
      with advanced breast carcinoma. Autonomic responses have been described in patients with
      cancer during the exposure of EEFLE. This autonomic response, or biofeedback, due to exposure
      to EEFLE seems to be associated with a specific set of modulation frequencies when applied to
      patients with malignancies. Moreover, healthy individuals exposed to modulated EEFLE a
      specific set of frequency do not appear to autonomic response. Biofeedback is defined by a
      change in amplitude of the radial pulse during exposure to EEFLE, modulated according to a
      set of specific frequencies. This phenomenon is not yet fully elucidated. In exploratory
      survey of one patient was observed a change of the pressure pulse immediately after the start
      of and during exposure to EEFLE, modulated according to a set of specific frequencies
      recorded by digital photoplethysmography. This study aims to evaluate an autonomic response
      in individuals exposed in a single moment, by electromagnetic fields. This study does not
      intend to study a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. For this reason, evolutive clinical
      data will not be considered during and after the study.

          -  Patients should not be suffering from active malignancy or history of malignancy in
             the past.

          -  Must be over 18 years.

          -  Must have ability to understand and provide a written informed consent.
