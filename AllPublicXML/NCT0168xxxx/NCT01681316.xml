    <measure>The proportion of patients in each treatment group who had clinically significant change as defined by the angina-frequency score on the Seattle Angina Questionnaire at day 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Seattle Angina Questionnaire, a 19-item questionnaire that quantifies physical limitations due to angina, any recent change in the severity of angina, the frequency of angina, satisfaction with treatment, and quality of life. Scores range from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate better health status.With a score of 20 or more on the angina-frequency scale indicating that the patient was clinically significant change.</description>

    <description>The symptoms questionnaire of TCM consists of 6 symptoms that described in traditional Chinese medicine, including chest pain, chest distress, palpitation, dark-purple lip, dark-purple tongue and unsmooth pulse. Each symptom was assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale（VAS），where a higher score meant higher severity.</description>

    <description>We defined clinical significant changes as a difference of 8 points or more on the physical-limitation scale, 25 or more on the angina-stability scale, 12 or more on the treatment-satisfaction scale, or 16 or more on the quality-of-life scale.</description>
