  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed leukemia often develop resistance to chemotherapy. For this reason, we
      are attempting to use a patient's own T cells, which can be genetically modified to expresses
      a chimeric antigen receptor(CAR). The CAR enables the T cell to recognize and kill the
      leukemic cells though the recognition of CD19, a protein expressed on the surface of the
      majority of pediatric ALL. This is a phase I study designed to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose of the CAR+ T cells and define the toxicity of the treatment. As a secondary
      aim, we will be looking at the efficacy of the T cells on eradicating the patient's leukemic
      cells.

      Upon meeting the eligibility requirements and enrolling on study, subjects will undergo a
      blood draw to obtain the T cells for the generation of the CD19 CAR+ T cells. The T cells are
      isolated from the blood, transduced with a lentivirus to express the CD19 CAR, and expanded
      in culture over a three week period. During the process of cell generation, subjects will
      continue to be cared for by their primary oncologist and may undergo additional treatment
      directed at the leukemia during this time.

      After the CAR+ T cells have been generated, the subject undergoes a disease assessment and
      will be admitted to the hospital to receive 2 days of cyclophosphamide for lymphodepletion
      and reduction of disease burden. Several days later, the subject will receive an infusion of
      the CAR+ T cells.

      Following treatment with the CAR+ T cells, subjects will be intensely followed for 6 weeks
      with serial blood testing and re-evaluation of disease status with bone marrow aspirates.
      After 6 weeks, the subjects clinical care will be resumed by their primary oncologist, and it
      is possible that they would receive additionally chemotherapy or a stem cell transplant.

      Upon completion of the study, subjects will be followed at least annually with a either a
      medical history, physical exam and blood tests or a phone call/questionnaire for 15 years.
      This follow up will help to determine if the subject develops any long-term health problems
      related to the CAR+ T cells including a new cancer.
