  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common combat
      related problems and may be associated with a greater risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The
      purpose of this study is to examine the possible connections between TBI and PTSD, and the
      signs and symptoms of AD on Veterans as they age.

      The information collected will help to learn more about how these injuries may affect
      Veterans of the Vietnam War as they grow older, as well as Veterans of the current wars in
      Iraq and Afghanistan, who also have these types of combat related injuries.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall long-term goal of this project is to prevent AD, which affects almost 50% of the
      US population over 85 years of age, and is the most common cause of dementia. Clinical signs
      and symptoms of AD include cognitive impairments, especially memory and emotional
      disturbances. In order to accomplish this goal of prevention, a population at risk must be
      identified. Evidence suggests that both TBI and PTSD increase risk for cognitive decline, AD,
      and dementia.

      TBI and PTSD are common problems resulting from military service. Thus far, there have been
      no prospective studies using imaging and biomarkers, which directly measure changes in the
      brain and AD pathology to study the effects of TBI and PTSD. This proposed study will provide
      novel data to test these hypotheses. The results will have major implications for
      identifying, subjects at increased risk for AD, a possible need for early detection of AD in
      military Veterans with histories of TBI and PTSD, and a possible need to employ prevention
      and treatment measures to avoid accelerated development of AD in US military Veterans. This
      study is a first step toward a larger, more comprehensive study of dementia risk factors in
      Veterans. The results will lead to a design and statistical powering of a prevention trial.
      Therefore, this project could be the first step toward the prevention of AD in Veterans, and
      in the general population.

          -  Documented or self report history of mild/moderate severe TBI;
