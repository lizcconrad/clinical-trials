    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of first-line
      rituximab maintenance therapy in participants with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
      Participants initiated on rituximab maintenance therapy according to the standard of care and
      in line with the current summary of product characteristics will be followed for a maximum of
      3 years or until disease progression occurs.
