  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving abiraterone acetate and prednisone with or
      without dasatinib works in treating patients with metastatic, hormone-resistant prostate
      cancer. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such as
      abiraterone acetate, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Dasatinib may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not
      yet known whether abiraterone acetate and prednisone is more effective than abiraterone
      acetate, prednisone, and dasatinib in treating prostate cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the progression-free survival of men with metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer treated with abiraterone (abiraterone acetate) plus dasatinib to that of men
      treated with abiraterone alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicity profile of the combination, as well as the rate of
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, objective responses, and changes in circulating
      tumor cell (CTC) numbers.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients receive
      abiraterone acetate 1000 mg orally (PO) once daily (QD) and prednisone 5 mg PO twice daily
      (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive abiraterone acetate and prednisone as patients in arm A. Patients
      also receive dasatinib 100 mg PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
