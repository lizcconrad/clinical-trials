  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sprifermin (AS902330) (recombinant human fibroblast
      growth factor-18 [rhFGF-18]) as an adjunct treatment to subjects following microfracture
      (MFx) surgery for cartilage injury of the knee.

      Primary Objectives

        -  To evaluate the effect of Sprifermin (AS902330) intra-articular knee injections as
           adjunct to microfracture (MFx) surgery on the composition of the refilled cartilage in
           the target knee, as measured by gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of
           cartilage (dGEMRIC) time constant 1 (T1) relaxation time at 6 months after MFx surgery

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of Sprifermin (AS902330) when administered
           intra-articular into the knee as adjunct to MFx surgery in subjects with cartilage
           injury of the knee

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To further support the efficacy and safety of Sprifermin (AS902330) as an adjunct to MFx
           for cartilage injury repair through symptomatic outcomes and quantitative MRI
           measurement

    <measure>Composition of the Refilled Cartilage Measured by Delayed Gadolinium-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Cartilage (dGEMRIC) Using T1 Relaxation Time at Month 6 Post-MFx Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-MFx surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The dGEMRIC is an imaging technique that estimates the proteoglycan (and glycosaminoglycan) content of joint cartilage using spin-lattice relaxation time T1 after penetration of gadolinium contrast agent. Composition of the refilled cartilage was to be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Composition of the Refilled Cartilage Measured by dGEMRIC Using T1 Relaxation Time Beyond Month 6 Post-MFx Surgery</measure>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Participant-reported Outcome Measure: Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Sub-scores for Pain and Activities of Daily Living (ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 months up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS Version LK1.0 is a knee-specific self-administered questionnaire used to assess pain, function, quality of life, and ADL. It consists of 42 items grouped into 5 subscales: pain, other symptoms (including swelling, restricted range of motion, and mechanical symptoms), function in ADL, function in sport and recreation (FSR), and impact on quality of life (QOL) (knee-related QOL, including awareness of the knee condition and changes in lifestyle). The subscales are scored separately; each yields a score between 0 and 100, with 0 representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing absence of problems. Total KOOS score is the average of all 5 subscale scores; ranging from 0 to 100; where 0 represents extreme knee problems and 100 represents absence of knee problems. Change from baseline in pain and ADL sub-scores was to be calculated by the respective scores at the specific time point minus the scores at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Participant-reported Outcome Measure: Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 months up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Knee pain was to be rated by the participant using an 11-point NRS of pain intensity. The NRS is scaled from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Change from baseline in NRS score was to be calculated by the score at the specific time point minus the score at baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Every 6 months up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The LEAS is an 18-level single-question self-administered scale that has been validated as a clinical outcome measure for the assessment of participants' actual activity levels. The LEAS is scaled from 1 to 18, with 18 indicating levels of highest activity. Change from baseline in LEAS score was to be calculated by the score at the specific time point minus the score at baseline.</description>

It is scaled from 0 to 100 with higher scores representing better function. Change from baseline in Lysholm knee scale score was to be calculated by the score at the specific time point minus the score at baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Participant-reported Outcome Measure: Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Sub-scores for Pain and Activities of Daily Living (ADL)</title>
        <description>The KOOS Version LK1.0 is a knee-specific self-administered questionnaire used to assess pain, function, quality of life, and ADL. It consists of 42 items grouped into 5 subscales: pain, other symptoms (including swelling, restricted range of motion, and mechanical symptoms), function in ADL, function in sport and recreation (FSR), and impact on quality of life (QOL) (knee-related QOL, including awareness of the knee condition and changes in lifestyle). The subscales are scored separately; each yields a score between 0 and 100, with 0 representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing absence of problems. Total KOOS score is the average of all 5 subscale scores; ranging from 0 to 100; where 0 represents extreme knee problems and 100 represents absence of knee problems. Change from baseline in pain and ADL sub-scores was to be calculated by the respective scores at the specific time point minus the scores at baseline.</description>
