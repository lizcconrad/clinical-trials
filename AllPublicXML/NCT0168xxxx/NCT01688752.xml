    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study assessing measures of cardiometabolic status, body
      composition, IR and GH response to stimulation after therapy in children (age 7-21 years)
      treated for ALL. Patients and sibling controls will be recruited from the Pediatric
      Hematology-Oncology Clinic at the University of Minnesota Amplatz Children's Hospital.

      This is a prospective cohort study with two groups: survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
      (ALL) who have recently completed therapy (cases) and healthy siblings (controls) frequency
      matched by age and sex. Subjects in each group will have two visits. For cases, the first
      visit will be approximately 6 months after completion of treatment for ALL; for their
      siblings, the first visit occur at approximately the same time. For both cases and controls,
      the second visit will be 2 to 2.5 years after the first visit.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiometabolic Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2.5-3 Years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the cardiometabolic profile (as measured by a single score based on adiposity, serum lipids, and vascular function) shortly after therapy (6 months after completion of therapy [Visit 1]) and again 2.5-3 yrs after completion of therapy (Visit 2) in 300 ALL patients, and compare with 200 sibling controls.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prevalence of Blunted Stimulated Growth Hormone Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Between 2.5 and 3 Years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the prevalence of blunted stimulated GH response suggesting GH deficiency (peak GH &lt;7mcg/L) in ALL survivors and controls: GH level will be obtained at baseline, then +30, +60, +90 and +120 minutes after clonidine (5 mcg/kg up to 200 mcg by mouth), followed by infusion of arginine (0.5 grams/kg up to 30 grams) with a series of GH levels at +140, +160, +180, +210, and +240 minutes. Blunted response to GH stimulation will be defined as peak GH level&lt;7 mcg/L.</description>

        Study entry is open to patients regardless of gender or ethnic background. While there will
        be every effort to seek out and include females and minority patients, the patient
        population is expected to be no different than the general pediatric oncology population
        seen at the participating institutions.
