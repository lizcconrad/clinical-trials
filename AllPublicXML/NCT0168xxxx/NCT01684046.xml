      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of Opti-Free® PureMoist®
      Multi-purpose Disinfecting Solution (MPDS) compared to AMO RevitaLens OcuTec® MPDS (US brand
      name)/COMPLETE RevitaLens (Europe brand name) in silicone hydrogel contact lens wearers.

      In this 2-period crossover study, eligible participants were randomized to either Opti-Free®
      PureMoist MPDS or RevitaLens MPDS in Period 1 for use with their habitual contact lenses,
      after which they switched to the alternate solution in Period 2. Each period was 30 days in
      length. A 2-day washout period during which participants refrained from using a multi-purpose
      contact lens solution preceded Period 1 and Period 2.
