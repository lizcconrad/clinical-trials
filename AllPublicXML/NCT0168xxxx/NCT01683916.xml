    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) reduces anesthetic requirements and stress hormonal responses.
      Anesthetic requirements and stress hormone response are compared in SCI patients undergoing
      anesthesia with sevoflurane supplemented with clinically equivalent doses of either N2O or
      remifentanil.

      Nitrous oxide (N2O) is often used for anesthetic adjuvant, but may be associated with side
      effects and toxicities. Remifentanil shares characteristics with N2O, including
      anesthetic-reducing and antinociceptive effects and a rapid recovery. Anesthetic requirements
      and stress hormone response in SCI patients undergoing anesthesia with sevoflurane
      supplemented with clinically equivalent doses of either N2O or remifentanil. Forty-five SCI
      patients scheduled to undergo pressor sore surgery below the level of the injury are randomly
      allocated to receive either sevoflurane alone (control, n=15), or combined with 67% N2O
      (n=15) or target-controlled infusions of 1.37 ng/mL remifentanil (n=15). Sevoflurane
      concentration is titrated to maintain a Bispectral Index (BIS) value of 40-50. Measurements
      include end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate
      (HR), and plasma catecholamine and cortisol concentrations.
