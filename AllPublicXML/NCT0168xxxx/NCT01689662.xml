  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The folate receptor (FR) is overexpressed by many different cancer types, including renal
      cell carcinoma. Besides helping in the diagnosis of cancer, a folate-targeted imaging agent
      could provide an effective method to identify folate receptor-positive (FR+) cancer patients
      that may benefit from folate-targeted therapy. Up to 40 subjects, with known or strongly
      suspected metastatic renal cell carcinoma with at least one target lesion detected by a
      diagnostic imaging procedure (e.g. ultrasonography, CT, or MRI), will be enrolled in this
      study.

      The investigational new drug (FolateScan or Technetium Tc 99m EC20) is a folate-targeted
      diagnostic radiopharmaceutical designed to bind to the folate receptor. The folate receptor
      is a glycoprotein that is over-expressed in many types of cancer cells but it is only
      minimally distributed in normal tissues. Folate conjugates bind to the folate receptor with
      high affinity and are brought into the cell via endocytosis. In contrast, folic acid itself
      enters most normal cells via the reduced folate carrier, a pathway entirely inaccessible to
      folate conjugates. Therefore, these folate conjugates are specific to cancer cells.

      Endocyte's folate-targeted delivery system was applied towards the targeting of a diagnostic
      imaging agent (111In-DTPA-Folate) to ovarian cancer tumors. This proof-of-principle study was
      designed to demonstrate the ability of folate to target drugs to folate-receptor-positive
      (FR+) cancer tissue.
