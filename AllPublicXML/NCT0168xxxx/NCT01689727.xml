  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many types of cancers overexpress a receptor for the vitamin folate (Folate Receptor). This
      Phase 2 study will utilize a standard imaging radionuclide, technetium-99m, conjugated to a
      ligand (EC20) designed to bind to the folate receptor. The study is designed as an
      open-label, baseline-controlled study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 open-label, single-treatment group, baseline-controlled study designed to
      verify product safety, gather data on the percentage of subjects with pituitary tumors with
      increased uptake of FolateScan in tumors and correlate the immunohistochemical staining
      findings with the FolateScan images, in subjects with pituitary tumors.
