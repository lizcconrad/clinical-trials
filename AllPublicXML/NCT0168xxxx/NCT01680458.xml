    <time_frame>MAX 13 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment-related adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to fluconazole in a participant who received fluconazole. A treatment-related serious adverse event was a treatment-related adverse event resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Relatedness to fluconazole was assessed by the investigator and sponsor (Pfizer Japan Inc.).</description>

    <description>A treatment-related adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to fluconazole in a participant who received fluconazole. Expectedness of the adverse event was determined according to the Japanese package insert. Relatedness to fluconazole was assessed by the investigator and sponsor (Pfizer Japan Inc.).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Efficacy Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>MAX 13 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical effect of treatment was evaluated based on the clinical course excluding mycological effect as follows: (1) effective, (2) ineffective, or (3) unevaluable. Clinical efficacy rate was calculated as follows and presented along with the corresponding exact 2-sided 95% CI. Clinical efficacy rate (%) = (Number of responders in evaluation of clinical effect) / (Number of participants available for clinical efficacy evaluation) x 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fungi Eradication Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>MAX 13 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mycological effect of treatment was evaluated as follows: (1) eradicated; the causative fungi detected from the lesion before treatment became undetectable, (2) presumably eradicated; the lesion was improved and sampling of causative fungi became impossible, (3) decreased; the causative fungi were decreased, (4) unchanged; no change was observed in the causative fungi, (5) increased; the causative fungi were increased (including microbial substitution), and (6) indeterminate; the clinical follow-up was inadequate, causative fungi were undetectable, or mycological test was not performed. Fungi eradication rate was calculated as follows. Fungi eradication rate (%) = (Number of participants evaluated as &quot;eradicated&quot; or &quot;presumably eradicated&quot;) / (Number of participants available for mycological efficacy evaluation) x 100</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Onset Rate of Deep Mycosis</measure>
    <time_frame>MAX 13 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy of deep mycosis prophylaxis was evaluated by the presence or absence of deep mycosis onset during the observation period. Onset rate of deep mycosis was calculated as follows and presented along with the corresponding exact 2-sided 95% CI. Onset rate of deep mycosis (%) = (Number of participants with deep mycosis onset by target fungi) / (Number of participants available for prophylactic efficacy evaluation) x 100.</description>
