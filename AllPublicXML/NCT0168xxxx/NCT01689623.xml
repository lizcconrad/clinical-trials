    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effects of steady-state concentrations (constant
      concentration of medication in the blood) of TMC435 on the single dose pharmacokinetics (what
      the body does to the medication) of atorvastatin, the active metabolites ortho- and
      parahydroxylated atorvastatin, simvastatin and the active metabolite simvastatin acid. Plasma
      hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitory activity after a single
      dose of atorvastatin or simvastatin, either alone or in combination with TMC435 will be also
      evaluated.

      This is a Phase I, 2-panel, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention)
      study in healthy participants to investigate the pharmacokinetic interaction between TMC435
      and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin and simvastatin. The study consists of a
      screening period (21 days prior to the first intake of study medication), a 17-day treatment
      period and a 5-7 days follow-up period. Approximately thirty six healthy participants will be
      equally divided to 2 panels (n=18 per panel). Within each panel all participants will receive
      the same treatments in the same order. In Panel 1, each participant will be administered a
      single oral 40-mg atorvastatin dose on Day 1 and Day 13. The participants will receive TMC435
      at a dose of 150 mg once daily from Day 4 until Day 15. In Panel 2, each participant will be
      administered a single oral 40-mg simvastatin dose on Day 1 and Day 13. TMC435 at a dose of
      150 mg will be administered once daily from Day 4 until Day 15. Treatment duration (including
      Day -1) will be 17 days for both panels (Panel 1 and Panel 2). Safety and tolerability will
      be evaluated throughout the study.
