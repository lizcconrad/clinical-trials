      Hypothesis

      The use of Isolite® system does not produce upper airway obstruction in the pediatric
      population during dental treatment with conscious sedation.

      Purpose:

      Report the changes in airway patency and pediatric patient's behavior when Isolite® system is
      used for dental treatment with conscious sedation.

      Objectives:

        1. Determine changes in pulse rate

        2. Determine changes in SpO2

        3. Recognize breath sound's changes possibly associated with airway blockage

        4. Evaluate if the isolite® system is well tolerate by the pediatric population for dental
           treatment under conscious sedation

        5. Relate the use of Isolite® with the frequency of head reposition to open the airway.

    <description>In this study all patients were Mallampati 1 and Brodsky 2. The device comes in 4 sizes: pedo, small, medium and large. The most commonly used was pedo 65% (13) and small 35% (7). Eighty percent (16) of sedations had a satisfactory experience with Isolite ®, Twenty percent (4) had unsatisfactory outcome due to disruptive behavior. Of these 4 cases 2 patients were medicated with meperidine + hydroxyzine and the other 2 with midazolam.
Fifty percent (8) of the patients successfully treated with Isolite ® experienced snoring and head reposition was performed to open airway. The level of sedation according to the AAPD guidelines was moderate in these events in which snoring occurred. The concentration of nitrous oxide-oxygen was adjusted so that more oxygen was given and the patient would be more alert. No significant changes in SpO2 (mean 99.8) or pulse were observed (mean 90.6).</description>

    <time_frame>120 minutes (sedation appointment)</time_frame>
    <description>Finally, it is important to recognize that this is a pilot study with limitations, including:
A small number of participants
No group control
Therefore, this study's findings need to be tempered by implications contained within these limitations and further research seems indicated.
Conclusions:
The results of this pilot study suggest the following conclusions:
Isolite ® may be safely used during pediatric dental treatment under conscious sedation.
The successful use of Isolite ® is related to the patient's behavior. The weakness aspect of Isolite ® is the soft bite block that allows the youngest patients to chew on it.
Therefore, this study's findings need to be tempered by implications contained within these limitations and further research seems indicated.</description>
