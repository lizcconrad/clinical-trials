  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body), and
      pharmacodynamics (the effect of the investigated drug on the body) of multiple doses of a
      long-acting GLP-1 analogue (oral semaglutide) and a carrier in healthy male subjects and male
      subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subject, who is considered to be generally healthy, based on the medical history,
             physical examination, and the results of vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) and
             laboratory safety tests performed during the screening visit, as judged by the
             investigator. This also applies to subjects with T2D, except for the underlying
             diabetes with or without associated hyperlipidaemia and/or hypertension

          -  Body mass index (BMI): a) Healthy subjects: above or equal to 20 and below 30 kg/m^2.
             b) Subjects with T2D: BMI above or equal to 20 and below or equal to 37 kg/m^2

          -  Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c): a) Healthy subjects: below 6.0%. b) Subjects with
             T2D: between 6.5 and 9.0% (both inclusive)

          -  Additional inclusion criterion only for subjects with T2D: Male subjects with T2D

        Exclusion Criteria:

             metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastro-intestinal (GI), endocrinological (except diabetes
             in subjects with T2D), haematological, dermatological, venereal, neurological,
             psychiatric diseases or other major disorders, as judged by the investigator

          -  Blood pressure in supine position at the screening examination above: a) 140 mmHg
             systolic and/or above 90 mmHg diastolic for healthy subjects. b) 160 mmHg systolic
             and/or above 95 mmHg diastolic for subjects with T2D

             acetylsalicylic acid is permitted. a. For subjects with T2D: Any other current
             diabetes treatment apart from metformin (e.g. treatment with incretin mimetics,
             Dipeptidyl Peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors, insulin secretagogues, insulin or
             thiazolidinediones (TZDs)). Use of blood lipidregulating agents, as well as blood
             pressure regulating, and thrombo-embolic agents is allowed

          -  Exclusion criteria only for subjects with T2D:

          -  Proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring acute treatment as determined by
             funduscopy/fundus photography and judged by the investigator. If subject presents a
             medical certificate for funduscopy/fundus photography performed within last 3 months
             this can substitute the funduscopy/fundus photography at screening

          -  Nephropathy stages 3 to 5, i.e. estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60.
             The eGFRshould be determined using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
             4-variable method encompassing creatinine, age, gender, and race

          -  Diabetic peripheral neuropathy using the 10 g Semmes-Weinstein monofilament
             examination at the great toe or plantar aspect of the fifth metatarsal

          -  Clinically significant active cardiovascular disease including history of myocardial
             infarction and/or heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III and IV1)
             at the discretion of the investigator
