  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this research study to compare the pharmacokinetics (rate of
      absorption) of insulin lispro (Humalog), insulin aspart (Novolog), and insulin glulisine
      (Apidra) within individual subjects.

      Additionally, the investigators will perform a preliminary feasibility evaluation of a
      minimally invasive continuous insulin monitoring (CIM) device and its use to derive PK
      parameters in human subjects.

    <measure>For Continuous Insulin Monitoring: Agreement between plots of insulin concentration in the blood and plots of insulin concentration in the microdialysate vs. time by both the CIM lab-on-a-chip and by immunoassays performed on fractions of microdialysate</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multiplex PK: Correlation between HbA1c at study entry and use of insulin analog with most favorable PK as an outpatient for subjects with a difference in tmax between analogs.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects with a difference in tmax between analogs will be catagorized as follows: using insulin with best PK for them, using insulin with worst PK for them, or using insulin with intermediate PK for them. Whether there is a difference between the median A1c between these three groups will be tested with the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance test. In addition whether there is a difference in the fraction of subjects in these groups meeting their A1c goal of less than or equal to 7% (i.e. whether the analog choice and meeting the A1c target are independent) will be determined with the chi-square test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multiplex PK: Correlation between HbA1c at study entry and use of insulin analog with tmax &lt; 60 minutes as an outpatient vs. use of an insulin analog with tmax &gt; 60 minutes as an outpatient.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects with a difference in tmax between analogs will be catagorized as follows: using insulin with tmax less than or equal to 60 minutes or using insulin with tmax &gt; 60 minutes. Whether there is a difference between the median A1c between these two groups will be tested with the heteroskedastic Student's t test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multiplex PK: Correlation between number of monthly self-reported or meter recorded incidents of hypoglycemia at study entry and use of insulin analog with best PK kinetics.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects with a difference in tmax between analogs will be catagorized as follows: using insulin with best PK for them, using insulin with worst PK for them, or using insulin with intermediate PK for them. Whether there is a difference between the number of hypoglycemic episodes per month between these three groups will be tested with the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance test. In addition whether there is a difference in the fraction of subjects in these groups with less than or equal to two episodes of hypoglycemia a week (i.e. whether the analog choice and the frequency of hypoglycemia are independent) will be determined with the chi-square test.</description>
