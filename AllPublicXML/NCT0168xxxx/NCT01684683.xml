  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Theophylline was well recommended in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) and asthma. However, there is no supporting evidence for their efficacy in the
      treatment of bronchiectasis. Our hypothesis is that theophylline will play a role in
      bronchiectasis. Our purpose is to examine the efficacy and safety of 24 weeks treatment with
      theophylline in subjects with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the reasons of lack of sufficient clinical trial evidences, there are no standard therapy
      recommendations for bronchiectasis. Currently the treatments for bronchiectasis are mostly
      based on experience gained from the treatment of COPD and cystic fibrosis(CF). The aims of
      treatment for bronchiectasis are to improve the health-related quality of life, to slow down
      the decrease of lung function, to reduce the exacerbation frequence and the mortality. The
      mechanism of treatment are including: treating the underlying disease; improving drainage of
      sputum; anti-infection; anti-inflammation; treating airway obstruction. A review written by
      Peter J. Barnes describes that as a bronchodilator in COPD, theophylline may relax human
      airways smooth muscle, have an anti-inflammation rols, and have an additional effect on
      mucociliary clearance. Besides, theophylline can improve the activity of histone deacetylase,
      which will reverse the resistant of corticosteroids. We hypothesis that theophylline will
      have the same effect in subjects with NCF-bronchiectasis as in subjects with COPD. Our trial
      may give an evidence of using theophylline in treatment of bronchiectasis.
