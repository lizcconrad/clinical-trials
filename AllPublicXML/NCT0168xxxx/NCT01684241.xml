      Clinical first-in-human dose escalation study evaluating the safety and tolerability of
      intranodal administration of an RNA-based cancer vaccine targeting two tumor-associated
      antigens in patients with advanced melanoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RBL001/RBL002 are naked ribonucleic acid (RNA) based recombinant vaccines that were optimized
      to induce antigen specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against malignant melanoma target
      antigens.

      The Targeted antigens are well characterized antigens in melanoma that have been previously
      utilized with excellent safety and proven immunogenicity as vaccine targets in a number of
      independent clinical trials.

      The overall rationale of the study is to determine safety of the novel RNA based vaccine
      approach and determine vaccine target antigen directed immune responses as early biomarkers
      for clinical mode of action.

      The RBL001/RBL002 vaccine is expected to lead to several effects contributing to its
      immunological (therapeutic) effect. First, ultrasound guided administration of naked RNA drug
      product into lymph nodes is expected to result in rapid uptake of naked RNA by lymph node
      resident professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Incorporated RNA is known to
      translocate to the cytoplasm leading to its translation by the host ribosome complex into the
      respective protein antigens. The recombinant vaccine is optimized for immunogenicity and
      enables presentation of diverse antigenic epitopes on both HLA-class I as well as HLA-class
      II molecules. Consecutively, antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses will be
      triggered by HLA-peptide complexes on the surface of antigen presenting cells. In addition,
      RNA administration will also lead to transient activation (change of surface marker
      expression and cytokine secretion) of APCs in the targeted lymph nodes particularly via
      signaling of TLR 7 and 8 leading to an adjuvant effect, supporting the induction of
      target-specific T cell responses with systemic anti-tumor activity.
