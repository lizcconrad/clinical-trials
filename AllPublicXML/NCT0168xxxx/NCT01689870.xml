    <textblock>
      This is an open label, two-phase study combining a dose escalation Phase 1 with a
      proof-of-concept Phase 2 in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, for whom
      treatment with ipilimumab is indicated.

      The purpose of the Phase 1 is to determine the Anti-OX40 Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the
      secondary objectives are anti-OX40 pharmacokinetics, biological activity and the tumor
      response assessed by the Immune-related Response Criteria.

      The purpose of Phase 2 is to determine tumor response (by irRC) and the secondary objectives
      are anti-OX40 pharmacokinetics, biological activity and Safety/Tolerability.

Characterizing circulating T-cell subsets by flow cytometry
Assessing antigen specific immune responses by ELISA
