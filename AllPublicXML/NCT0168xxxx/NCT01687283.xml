    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, randomized, single-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group phase III
      local registration study for a treatment period of 12 weeks. This study aims to assess the
      effectiveness and safety of fluticasone propionate 1mg via nebulizer BID in treatment of
      Chinese adult and adolescent patients with severe persistent asthma for a treatment period of
      12 weeks versus budesonide 2mg via nebulizer BID. The steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics of
      fluticasone propionate inhalation solution will also be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male or female subjects between 17 to 70 (inclusive) years of age with severe persistent
      asthma meeting the inclusion criteria and having completed the screening period of 2 weeks
      will, in a proportion of 1:1, randomly receive fluticasone propionate 1mg via nebulizer BID
      or budesonide 2mg via nebulizer BID for a treatment period of 12 weeks. The clinic visit will
      be arranged at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks during study treatment. If the subjects
      meet the criteria of pre-defined asthma control at treatment 4 weeks or 8 weeks, they will
      have one chance to be treated with the half dose of study drug. 2 weeks after completion of
      study treatment or after early withdrawal from study, the follow-up visit will be performed
      to assess the post-treatment adverse events. The primary endpoint is the mean change from
      baseline in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) over the 12 week treatment period. Safety
      assessments include adverse events, vital signs, oral and oropharyngeal candidiasis,
      hematological, biochemical tests), 24-hour urinary cortisol and 12-lead ECG. The steady-state
      plasma pharmacokinetics of fluticasone propionate inhalation solution will also be assessed.

    <measure>Mean Change in Percentage of Symptom-free 24-hour Periods From Baseline Over 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 2) and over 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>While calculating symptom-free 24-hour periods, a given 24-hour period was set to be &quot;symptom free&quot; only if the participant's responses to both the morning and evening assessments indicated no symptoms. The Baseline value was Visit 2 assessment and was derived from the last 7 days of the daily diary prior to the randomization. Change from Baseline was calculated as the difference between the value of the endpoint at the time point of interest and the baseline value. The value provided in outcome measure data is a consolidated value over Weeks 1 to 12.</description>

    <time_frame>Over 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded day-time symptom score every day in the morning and evening at bedtime before taking any rescue or study medication and before PEF measurement, using 6 point scale on Diary Card indicating 0 = No symptoms during the day and 5 =Symptoms so severe that participant could not go to work or perform normal daily activities. Night time symptoms were scored while waking in the morning on a scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (severe). The value provided in outcome measure data is a consolidated value over Weeks 1 to 12.</description>

If there were symptoms in either the morning or the evening then that 24-hour period was set to as &quot;not symptom free&quot;. Similarly, if there was rescue medication use in either the morning or the evening, then that 24-hour period was set to as &quot;not rescue free&quot;. The Baseline value was Visit 2 assessment and was derived from the last 7 days of the daily diary prior to the randomization.

    <description>Participants recorded the number of inhalations of rescue salbutamol inhalation aerosol used during the day and night. The baseline value was Visit 2 assessment and was derived from the last 7 days of the daily diary prior to the randomization. The analysis only included participants who had at least 2 days of non-missing numbers of times rescue medication (including zero) after randomization.</description>

The highest of three technically acceptable measurements was recorded. FEV1 was measured prior to study drug administration and any rescue salbutamol use. Baseline value was the assessment at Visit 2.Change from baseline was calculated as the value at the specific time point minus baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Day 1 of Treatment Period/Visit 2) in Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (AM PEF) Over 12 Weeks in Intent-to-treat Population</title>
        <description>The peak expiratory flow (PEF) is a person's maximum speed of expiration, A peak flow meter was issued to participants at Visit 1 to measure the morning PEF prior to study drug and rescue medication. The best of three attempts was recorded by the participants in the diary cards. Baseline value was the assessment at Visit 2. The raw and change from baseline in daily AM PEF averaged over the 12-week treatment period The mean value was considered missing if less than 4 days were recorded in the baseline week prior to randomization or if less than 4 days are recorded after randomization. Analysis was performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. Abbreviations used in statistical analysis section: standard deviation (SD) and significance (sig)</description>

Change from Baseline was calculated as the difference between the value of the endpoint at the time point of interest and the baseline value.

        <title>Mean Change in Percentage of Rescue-free 24-hour Periods From Baseline Over 12 Weeks</title>
        <description>While calculating rescue-free 24-hour periods, the 24-hour period was only set to be “rescue free” if responses to both the morning and evening, assessments indicated no use of rescue medication. If there were symptoms in either the morning or the evening then that 24-hour period was set to as “not symptom free”. Similarly, if there was rescue medication use in either the morning or the evening, then that 24-hour period was set to as “not rescue free”. The Baseline value was Visit 2 assessment and was derived from the last 7 days of the daily diary prior to the randomization. The value provided in outcome measure data is a consolidated value over Weeks 1 to 12.</description>

        <description>FEV1 as a measure of lung function assessment was measured at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12. FEV1 measures were performed electronically by spirometry. The highest of three technically acceptable measurements was recorded. FEV1 was measured prior to study drug administration and any rescue salbutamol use. Baseline value was the assessment at Visit 2.Change from baseline was calculated as the value at the specific time point minus baseline value.</description>
