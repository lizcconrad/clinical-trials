  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study intends to establish the efficacy of 2 different doses of epidural morphine
      for pain management after perineal trauma when using multimodal analgesia as well as the
      feasibility of conducting a larger randomized clinical trial. Women with traumatic vaginal
      delivery will be randomized into 3 groups with 10 patients each and receive 2.5 mg epidural
      morphine, 1.25 mg epidural morphine, or epidural saline. The primary outcome is total opioid
      consumption for breakthrough pain in the first 24 hours.
