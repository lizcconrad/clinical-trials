    <textblock>
      This multi-center, open-label, single-arm study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety
      of obinutuzumab in participants with cluster of differentiation (CD) 20 positive (+)

PD requires the following: 1) ≥50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously identified abnormal node for PRs or nonresponders. 2) Appearance of any new lesion during or at the end of therapy.

    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (Day 1), Cycle 4 (Day 1), 4-week follow-up, 3 and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>For the detection of HAHA, serum samples were initially analyzed using a validated enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method (screening assay, tier 1). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) in undiluted serum was 18.4 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). The precision ranged from 4.85 percent (%) to 16.0%. In serum samples found positive, the presence of specific anti-obinutuzumab antibodies was confirmed or excluded using the same ELISA method with an appropriate immunocompetition step (addition of excess obinutuzumab, confirmation assay, tier 2). Samples were confirmed as containing specific anti-obinutuzumab antibodies if there was a signal reduction ≥85.7% in the presence of obinutuzumab.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), and Progressive Disease (PD) at End of Treatment (1 Month After Cycle 8) in NHL Participants (DLBCL and FL Participants) Per Cheson 1999 Criteria</title>
        <description>PR: 1) ≥50% decrease in SPD of the 6 largest dominant nodes/nodal masses. These nodes or masses selected according to the following features: a) clearly measurable in ≥2 perpendicular dimensions, b) from as disparate regions of the body as possible, and c) included mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease. 2) No increase in size of other nodes (liver/spleen). 3) Splenic and hepatic nodules regressed by ≥50% in SPD. 4) With exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs was considered assessable and not measurable disease. 5) BM assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR because it was assessable and not measurable disease; however, if positive, the cell type was specified. 6) No new sites of disease. PD requires the following: 1) ≥50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously identified abnormal node for PRs or nonresponders. 2) Appearance of any new lesion during or at the end of therapy. SD is defined as less than a PR but not PD.</description>

The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) in undiluted serum was 18.4 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). The precision ranged from 4.85 percent (%) to 16.0%. In serum samples found positive, the presence of specific anti-obinutuzumab antibodies was confirmed or excluded using the same ELISA method with an appropriate immunocompetition step (addition of excess obinutuzumab, confirmation assay, tier 2).
