  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate end of shelf-life potency in terms of the
      immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals' trivalent MMR vaccine, by comparing it to Merck
      &amp; Co., Inc.'s MMR vaccine, which is approved for use in the United States (US).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a Phase IIIA, randomized, observer-blind, controlled, multi-center,
      multi-country study with four parallel groups. This study will evaluate the immunogenicity
      and safety of GSK Biologicals' trivalent investigational MMR vaccine (referred to as Inv_MMR
      vaccine, throughout this document) in contrast to the US standard of care comparator vaccine
      (M M R®II, Merck and Co., Inc., referred to as Com_MMR throughout this document) in children
      during their second year of life. The first dose of this two-dose study is designed to
      establish the end of shelf-life potency of Inv_MMR vaccine. The Inv_MMR vaccine will be given
      as one of two lots; one of a minimum potency, designated Inv_MMR_Min; and the other at a
      mid-range or medium potency designated Inv_MMR_Med to two groups. The second dose for both of
      these Inv_MMR groups will have a potency within the release range of the marketed vaccine.
      The Com_MMR vaccine will consist of two lots designated Com_MMR_L1 and Com_MMR_L2 and will be
      analyzed as pooled lots within the study. The first MMR vaccine dose will be co-administered
      with Varivax, Havrix and (in the US sub-cohort only) Prevnar 13 which are routinely
      administered to children of this age in the US.

             virus.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination.

          -  A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccines, including hypersensitivity to neomycin, latex or gelatin.

          -  Blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms
             affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic systems.

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrollment. Acute disease is defined as the presence of a
             moderate or severe illness with or without fever. Fever is defined as temperature
             ≥38°C/100.4°F by any age appropriate route. All vaccines can be administered to
             persons with a minor illness such as diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection
             without fever.

          -  Active untreated tuberculosis based on medical history.
