  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to test whether the use of small electrical currents to
      stimulate proprioceptors of the upper limb has potential for improving robot-assisted
      upper-limb rehabilitation in stroke survivors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants will be instructed to perform upper-limb movements using a system designed
      for upper-limb rehabilitation (Armeo Spring by Hocoma AG). The system provides subjects with
      unloading of the stroke-affected arm thus facilitating the performance of upper-limb
      movements. The system will be used to track the movements of the stroke-affected arm.
      Simultaneously, a custom-designed system (a prototype developed by the investigators) will be
      used to deliver small electrical currents to the arm. We hypothesize that the currents
      delivered to the arm will improve the accuracy of the movements performed by study
      participants.

      To assess if delivering small currents to the arm has an effect on the accuracy of the
      movements performed by the study participants, they will receive actual stimulation for some
      trials and sham stimulation for other trials. Because the investigators will deliver very
      small currents, study participants will be unable to perceive such currents and hence tell if
      they are performing the movements while receiving actual or sham stimulation. By comparing
      trials performed while subjects receive actual stimulation with trials performed while
      subjects received sham stimulation, the investigators will determine if the stimulation has
      an effect on the accuracy of the movements performed by the subjects.

      It is worth noticing that the investigators collected primary outcome data to assess changes
      associated with the use of actual stimulation vs sham stimulation. Data during a follow-up
      session was also collected, but not for the purpose of collecting outcome measures.
