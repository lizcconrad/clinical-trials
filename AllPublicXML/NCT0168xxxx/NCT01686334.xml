  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this innovative immunotherapeutic study is to determine whether the
      antileukemic effects seen in our previous phase I/II study can be confirmed in a large cohort
      of patients and whether dendritic cell vaccination can significantly prevent relapse and
      increase survival of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by eradicating minimal residual
      disease.

    <textblock>
      Together with the Transplant Committee of the Belgian Hematological Society (BHS), we will
      perform a multicenter randomized open-label phase II clinical study in 138 patients with
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Adult patients (&gt; 18 years) with AML who have entered
      morphological CR or CRi after (1) at least one course of induction and one course of
      consolidation chemotherapy or (2) at least two cycles to maximum six cycles of
      hypomethylating agents; and fulfilling all other eligibility criteria will be randomized to
      be vaccinated with dendritic cells or to receive regular follow-up care. After randomization,
      patients receiving hypomethylating agents are allowed to continue this treatment in
      combination with DC vaccination or the follow-up care. The primary aim of this innovative
      immunotherapeutic study is to determine whether the antileukemic effects seen in our previous
      phase I/II study can be confirmed in a large cohort of patients and whether dendritic cell
      vaccination can significantly prevent relapse and increase survival of AML patients by
      eradicating minimal residual disease. Patients will be recruited at 8 different centers in
      Belgium. Recruitment will start in the second half of 2013 and will last for 8 years or until
      138 efficacy-evaluable AML patients are included. In the interventional group, 69 patients
      will be treated during two years with autologous dendritic cells loaded by messenger RNA
      electroporation with the Wilms' tumor antigen (WT1). The dendritic cell therapy product will
      be generated and generally administered in the coordinating center, which is the Antwerp
      University Hospital, more specifically the Center for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine
      (CCRG) and the Division of Hematology, both headed by Prof. Zwi Berneman. After inclusion of
      138 efficacy-evaluable patients, relapse rate, relapse-free survival and overall survival
      analysis will be performed. Tumor marker levels and immune activation will also be monitored
      to compare the 2 groups at a molecular and immunological level. General and disease-specific
      quality of life will be evaluated using quality of life questionnaires at regular time
      points.
