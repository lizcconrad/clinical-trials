  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a randomized control trial. The purpose of this study is to observe
      the efficacy and safety of atrial fibrillation ablation, comparing circumferential pulmonary
      vein isolation (CPVI) plus renal sympathetic modification (RSM) with CPVI alone.

      Basic studies suggested that sympathetic nerves over-activity played an important role in the
      pathophysiological changes of arrhythmia occurrence. Present studies of renal ablation show a
      new method to decrease sympathetic nerves activity. Circumferential pulmonary vein isolation
      (CPVI) is an accepted ablation method for atrial fibrillation. The investigators plan to
      evaluate the efficiency and safety of CPVI plus renal sympathetic modification for atrial
      fibrillation ablation comparing with CPVI alone. The trial is going to recruit 100 patients
      randomized into two groups (CPVI+RSM group VS CPVI group = 50:50) with a follow-up duration
      of 4 years. The investigators aim to observe the relapse of atrial tachyarrhythmia lasting
      more than 30 seconds, the incidence of composite cardiovascular events after renal
      sympathetic modification, and safety and efficacy of the intervention, comparing with CPVI
      alone.
