    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the changes in language processing of patients with
      chronic, post-stroke aphasia following the application of brain stimulation. The brain
      stimulation the investigators administer is called transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS). It involves passing a weak electrical current through the brain between two
      electrodes in the form of damp sponges. One sponge will be placed over a specified area on
      the damaged left hemisphere, while the other sponge will be placed on the right scalp.
      Computer-controlled speech-language treatment will be administered during the application of
      tDCS.

    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States. Approximately one-third
      of all strokes result in acute language impairment (aphasia), with approximately one-fifth
      suffering from chronic aphasia. Unfortunately, the prognosis for moderate to severe chronic
      aphasia remains grim, as current behavioral treatment approaches usually offer only
      limited-to-modest benefit. Recent advancements in understanding the relationship between low
      current electrical brain stimulation and cortical plasticity suggest that the effect of
      behavioral aphasia treatment could possibly be enhanced using anodal transcranial direct
      current stimulation (A-tDCS). Indeed, we have shown how A-tDCS can significantly boost the
      effect of behavioral aphasia treatment. Based on these results as well as our other studies
      aimed at understanding how favorable brain plasticity correlates with positive treatment
      outcome in aphasia, we propose to conduct a Phase II clinical trial utilizing a futility
      design. Consistent with the goals of Program Announcement PAR-08-204 by the National
      Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), we plan to &quot;evaluate whether
      there is sufficient evidence of short term improvement in humans to justify a phase III
      trial.&quot;
