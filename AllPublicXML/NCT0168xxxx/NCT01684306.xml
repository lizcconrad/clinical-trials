  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing debate on the use of drugs that can promote cognitive enhancement.
      Amphetamine-like drugs have been employed as cognitive enhancers, but all of them have
      important side effects and may induce addiction. In our study, we will investigate the use of
      modafinil which, in recent years, has been proposed as cognitive enhancer. Modafinil appears
      to have less side effects compared to amphetamine-like drugs and we will analyzed whether the
      drug can influence cognitive performances and the brain resting state network activity of
      healthy young subjects.

      Subjects will be included in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which a single dose
      (100 mg) of modafinil will be administered. Both groups will be, before and three hours after
      administration of drug or placebo, tested for neuropsychological performances with the
      Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices II set (APM).

      Resting state functional magnetic resonance (rs-fMRI) will be also employed, before and after
      three hours, to study changes in the activity of resting state brain networks. Finally, with
      Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) we will evaluate the structural connectivity of the two
      groups.

    <description>Modafinil (Provigil), a drug on the market since 1997, is employed for the treatment of narcolepsy and other sleep disorders. In recent years, modafinil has also been used off-label to treat cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
Study subjects received, in a double blind fashion, either a single dose (100 mg) of modafinil.</description>
