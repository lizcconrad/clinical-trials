             Interview for DSM-IV (SCID).

          3. Live within a commutable distance of the Treatment Research Center (TRC) at the
             Penn/VA Center for Studies of Addiction, University of Pennsylvania. We define this to
             be a distance within the service area of Septa, within an hour drive, or a distance
             that both the patient and Principal Investigator (PI) find acceptable.

          4. Understands and signs the informed consent.

          1. Current DSM-IV diagnosis of any psychoactive substance dependence other than cocaine,
             alcohol, or nicotine dependence, as determined by the SCID.

          2. Subject is, in the investigator's opinion, at risk of requiring medical detoxification
             for alcohol dependence during the study.

          3. Concomitant treatment with psychotropic medications.

          4. Current gambling problems. This will be assessed by the patient's self-report.

          5. Patients mandated to treatment based upon a legal decision or as a condition of

          9. Current use of naltrexone, disulfiram, modafinil, stimulants, haloperidol,
             benzodiazepines or anticonvulsants.

         10. Known hypersensitivity to varenicline.

         11. Patients with known AIDS or other serious illnesses that may require hospitalization

               2. intrauterine progesterone contraceptive system

               3. levonorgestrel implant

               5. oral contraceptives

               6. tubal ligation.

         13. Patients with impaired renal function as indicated by corrected creatinine clearance
             below 60 ml/min as determined by the modified Cockcroft equation (CDC, 1986).

         14. Clinical laboratory tests (CBC, blood chemistries, urinalysis) outside normal limits
             that are clinically unacceptable to the Medical Director. EKG 1st degree heart block,
