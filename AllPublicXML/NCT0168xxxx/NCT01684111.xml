      To investigate the maximum tolerated dose of BIBF 1120, safety and pharmacokinetics in
      escalating doses administered with Vinorelbine i.v. in elderly patients with advanced
      Non-Small Lung Cancer (Stage IV).

    <textblock>
      Patients older than 70 years could be enroled in this clinical trial. The trial is being
      carried out in two trial centres in Germany.

      For the planned sample size it is assumed that two different dosage groups are needed with 6
      patients on each dosage group with the option to deescalate the first dosage. Altogether this
      leads to an estimated sample size of maximal 18 patients.

        -  Duration of treatment/patient: up to 6 month

        -  Follow Up: at least 6 month

               -  Palliative extrathoracic radiotherapy to pre-existing lesions may continue on

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any severe concomitant condition which makes it undesirable for the patient to

          -  Serious infections requiring systemic antibiotic (e.g antiviral, antimicrobial,

             requirements or which are considered relevant for the evaluation of the efficacy or
             safety of the trial drug, such as neurologic, psychiatric, infectious disease or
             active ulcers (gastro-intestinal tract, skin) or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with trial participation or trial drug administration,
             and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry
             into the trial.

          -  Significant cardiovascular diseases (i.e. uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina,
             history of infarction within past 9 months, congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA II)

          -  Therapeutic anticoagulation (except low dose heparin and/or heparin flush as needed
             for maintenance of an indwelling intravenous device) or antiplatelet therapy(except
             for chronic low-dose therapy with acetylsalicylic acid ≤325mg per day)

          -  History of major thrombotic events or clinically relevant major bleeding event in the
             past 6 months (excluding central venous catheter thrombosis and peripheral deep vein
             thrombosis below the joint space of the knee)

          -  Current peripheral neuropathy ≥ CTCAE grade 2 except due to trauma

          -  Gastrointestinal disorders or abnormalities that would interfere with absorption of
             the study drug

          -  Active alcohol or drug abuse.

             contraception

          -  Leptomeningeal disease

          -  Radiographic evidence of cavitary or necrotic tumours
