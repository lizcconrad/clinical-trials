  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this phase II study is to investigate the feasibility, toxicity and efficacy of a
      regimen incorporating a proven systemic regimen, carboplatin /paclitaxel, with conformal
      proton modality, followed by definitive surgery. In most combined-modality trials to date,
      chemotherapy regimens have included cisplatin, usually in conjunction with 5-fluorouracil.

      In designing the regimen, the investigators attempt to improve on the standard
      cisplatin/5-fluorouracil regimen in several ways. First, full-dose paclitaxel is added to the
      regimen. This agent has activity against advanced esophageal cancer and is also a potent
      radiosensitizer. Second, the substitution of carboplatin for cisplatin has resulted in
      reduced toxicity of various combination regimens similar to that used by CROSS trial and
      allows for easier administration in the outpatient setting.4 Third, for localized esophageal
      cancer, dose distribution patterns achievable with proton beam could potentially offer
      important clinical advantages relative to those achievable with x-rays (photons).19 Based on
      this, the investigators believe that this study should be conducted with the radiation
      modality that offers the best dosimetry achievable at our institution.

             stomach up to 5 cm.

          -  Endoscopy with biopsy

          -  Stage T1N102, T2-3N0-2 according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th
             edition staging, based upon the following minimum diagnostic work-up:

        History/physical examination with documentation of patient's weight within 30 days of
        registration

        Chest/Abdominal/Pelvic contrast CT within 56 days of registration
