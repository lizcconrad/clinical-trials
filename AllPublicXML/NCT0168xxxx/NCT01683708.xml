  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate if the perioperative administration of
      symbiotics reduces postoperative infectious morbidity in jaundiced patients scheduled for
      hepato-biliary and pancreatic surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in preoperative patient's selection and anesthetic and surgical techniques,
      surgery in jaundiced patients is associated with significant morbidity and mortality as a
      consequence of septic complications. The evidence that nosocomial infections are frequently a
      consequence of gut-derived organism such as enterobacteriaceae, supports the hypothesis of
      the &quot;gut derived sepsis&quot;. Indeed, several studies have reported that jaundiced patients
      present an increased intestinal permeability and consequently a higher rate of bacterial
      migration from gastrointestinal tract across the lamina propria to local mesenteric lymph
      nodes and from there to extra-intestinal site. This phenomenon increases after surgical
      decompression of bile duct. The higher prevalence of bacterial translocation in jaundiced
      patients is related to different mechanisms such as mucosal atrophy secondary to protracted
      absence of intraluminal bile that open para-cellular route for bacterial translocation and
      the decreased clearance capacity of Kuppfer secondary to cholestasis.

      The mechanisms of action of symbiotics are largely unknown. The probiotic bacteria can
      improve the mucosal barrier function reducing the bacterial translocation of organism to
      mesenteric lymph nodes. Indeed symbiotic can affect the intestinal ecosystem by stimulating
      mucosal immune and non-immune mechanisms through antagonism/competition with potential
      pathogens.

    <description>Patients randomized into the Symbiotic group received Prebiotic® in a dose of one sachet twice a day for at least 1 week preoperatively. Postoperatively the medication was reintroduced as tolerated, and continued until discharge from hospital. One 4,5 gr sachet of Prebiotic® contains at least 1010 living Bifidobacterium bifidum, 1010 living Streptococcus Thermophilus, 1010 living Streptococcus Salivarius, 3 109 Lactobacillus Acidophilus, 1010 living Lactobacillus Casei, 1010 living Lactobacillus bulgaricus and galactooligosaccharides (4,5 gr).</description>
