  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of people seeking treatment for marijuana-related problems is on the rise, yet
      there is no currently accepted medication proven to help them quit. Frequent marijuana users
      have reported that they have trouble sleeping when they try to quit, and that the loss of
      sleep can lead to relapse. This research is designed to measure the severity of sleep
      problems in people as they are trying to quit heavy use of marijuana, and to investigate
      whether extended-release zolpidem (Ambien CRÂ®) can improve quit rates among people trying to
      stop using marijuana.
