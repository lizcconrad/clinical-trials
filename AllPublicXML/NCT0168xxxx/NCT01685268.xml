  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 2-part, Phase 1-2, open-label, parallel group, randomized study in patients with
      Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) who are no longer responding to treatment with
      abiraterone and steroids. In Part A (Phase 1), patients will continue to receive the same
      doses of abiraterone and steroids they were receiving prior to study entry and will be
      randomized to receive 1 of 2 different treatment regimens of AT13387 in combination with
      abiraterone. Once the best regimen is established in Part A, based on safety and antitumor
      activity, patients will be randomized to the selected treatment regimen and dose of AT13387
      in combination with abiraterone or AT13387 alone in Part B (Phase 2).
