    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of an oral vaccine
      tablet to prevent seasonal influenza. The study was a placebo controlled, double blinded
      trial at a single site. The study was conducted under two separate protocols. Initially
      single administrations at two dose levels (low dose and mid dose) of the oral vaccine was
      tested in a placebo controlled study (37 subjects). And subsequently a single high dose of
      the oral vaccine was tested in a separate placebo-controlled study (24 subjects).
