  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The phase 3 Trial 31-12-291 is part of the aripiprazole IM depot clinical development program
      and has been designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole IM depot for the
      treatment of adults experiencing an acute relapse of schizophrenia. Subjects receive
      treatment during a 12-week double-blind acute treatment phase. The current trial (31-12-297)
      will allow the subjects who complete Trial 291 to enter this open label trial at the
      investigator's discretion, where additional safety and tolerability data will be collected.

The symptoms for facial and oral movements were 1= muscles of facial expression, 2= lips and perioral area, 3= jaw and 4=tongue; extremity movements were, 5= upper (arms, wrists, hands, fingers), lower (legs, knees, ankles, toes), 7= neck, shoulders, hips). This scale consisted of 10 items, each to be rated on a 4-point scale of severity, and 2 questions to be answered by yes or no.

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Suicidal Ideation Intensity Total Score by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</title>
        <description>Data collected from C-SSRS were mapped into C-CASA. The Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) method and C-SSRS(text in parentheses as said below) were mapped as; 1= completed suicide(completed suicide); 2= suicide attempt(actual attempt); 3= preparatory actions toward imminent suicidal behavior (interrupted attempt, aborted attempt and preparatory acts/behavior); 4= suicidal ideation(wish to die,active suicidal thought, active suicidal thought with method, active suicidal thought with intent,active suicidal thought with plan/intent); 5= self-injurious behavior, intent unknown; 6= not enough information: death; 7= non-suicidal self-injurious behavior(nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior); 8= other accident; psychiatric/medical; 9= not enough information/non-death. C-CASA category 5, 6, 8 and 9 are not applicable. For each item, each participant received an intensity score from 0(none) to 5(worst). Suicidal ideation intensity total score range from 0 to 25.</description>

The symptoms for facial and oral movements were 1= muscles of facial expression, 2= lips and perioral area, 3= jaw and 4=tongue; extremity movements were, 5= upper (arms, wrists, hands, fingers), lower (legs, knees, ankles, toes), 7= neck, shoulders, hips). This scale consisted of 10 items, each to be rated on a 4-point scale of severity, and 2 questions to be answered by yes or no. To complete the scale, the patient was observed unobtrusively at rest (e.g., in waiting room). The chair used for this examination was hard, firm one without arms.</description>

        <description>The heart rate sitting, which is a vital sign parameter were one of the primary parameters to measure the safety and tolerability of individual participants. Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events of potential clinical relevance included abnormal values in body temperature, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and respiratory rate that were identified based on pre-defined criteria. Orthostatic assessments of blood pressure and heart rate were made after the participant was supine for at least 5 minutes and again after the participant was sitting for approximately 2 minutes.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Clinically Relevant Waist Circumference From Baseline in All Participants.</title>
        <description>Clinically relevant waist circumference was one of the primary parameters to measure the safety and tolerability of individual participants. Each participant's body mass index (BMI) kilogram per square meter (kg/m2) were calculated from the screening. Body weight, BMI, and waist circumference changes were evaluated by calculating mean change from Baseline and by tabulating the incidence of ≥7% weight gain or loss.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to last visit</time_frame>
        <population>Safety Sample was analyzed. All enrolled participants who took at least one injection of study medication in the IM depot treatment period. Last visit was defined as the last assessment visit in the treatment phase (scheduled or unscheduled visit). Only Week 24 and last visit data was included.</population>

      <desc>A SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that results in death or was life-threatening or required inpatient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization. An AE was an exacerbation of an existing problem or any new problem, experienced by a participant when enrolled in a trial, whether or not it was considered drug related by the study physician.</desc>
