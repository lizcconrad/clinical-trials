  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II multi-centered, randomized controlled trial of mechanical ventilation directed
      by esophageal pressure measurement will test the primary hypothesis that using a strategy of
      maintaining a minimal but positive transpulmonary pressure (Ptp = airway pressure minus
      pleural pressure) throughout the ventilatory cycle will lead to an improvement in patient
      survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase II prospective randomized controlled trial of ventilation directed by esophageal
      pressure measurements will enroll 200 patients with moderate to severe ARDS by the Berlin
      conference definition in several academic medical centers in North America. The control group
      will be ventilated using an alternative high-PEEP strategy with PEEP and FiO2 set using to an
      empiric table.

      Plasma samples will be obtained at enrollment and days 3 and 7 and assessed for a variety of
      lung injury biomarkers to better assess the association between our intervention and the
      inflammation associated with mechanical ventilation and the development of ARDS. Hospital
      survivors will undergo a brief follow up phone survey to assess survival, functional status
      (Barthel Index), health-related QOL (Short Form 12), and frailty (VES) twelve months after
      enrollment.

      The study length will be six years with a six month start-up period followed by a planned 50
      month enrollment and twelve month follow-up.

    <measure>A composite outcome of mortality and time off the ventilator at 28-days.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The trial will utilize a primary composite endpoint that incorporates death and days off the ventilator at 28 days in such a manner that death constitutes a more serious outcome. Every subject in the treatment group is compared to every subject in the control group and assigned one number resulting from each comparison. Since mortality outcome is clinically more important, mortality takes precedence over days off the ventilator. These scores are summed up to obtain a cumulative score for each subject. The cumulative scores are added up for each treatment group to form a test statistic by the Mann-Whitney technique.</description>

    <description>The overall goals for the &quot;EPVent&quot; group (esophageal-pressure guided mechanical ventilation) are to employ an open-lung strategy that includes low tidal volumes and maintenance of a positive transpulmonary pressure at end-expiration [Ptpexp]. Fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] and transpulmonary pressure pressure during an expiratory hold will be changed to achieve values shown in one of the columns of a protocol-specified table to meet the oxygenation target.</description>

    <description>The overall goals for the Control group are similar to those for the EPVent group: to employ an open-lung strategy that includes low tidal volumes using an alternative high positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] strategy. The control group PEEP and tidal volume will be managed without reference to the esophageal pressure measurements, and instead will follow an empiric high PEEP mechanical ventilation strategy. PEEP and FiO2 will be raised or lowered to achieve the oxygenation target level specified in a study table.</description>
