    <textblock>
      In vivo differentiation of benign and malignant skin lesions is a fundamental issue in
      clinical dermatology. Malignant skin diseases are known to be accompanied by structural
      alterations. Conventional excisional biopsies and further histopathology are regarded as the
      reference standard for investigating these pathologies. Biopsies are invasive procedures and
      additionally may cause side effects. Therefore, research efforts are focused on the
      development of diagnostic techniques capable of providing in vivo information on the skin's
      structure. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a technical application, which allows the
      identification of microscopic patterns indicative for benign and malignant skin lesions. OCT
      is a promising noninvasive imaging technique for the micromorphology of the skin. So far,
      it's clinical application, as an additional diagnostic tool for malignant skin lesions has
      been studied in a limited extend. To evaluate the clinical usefulness of OCT, we conducted a
      prospective pilot study at the Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Vienna. The
      study is in cooperation with the Center of Biomedical Engineering and Physics at the Medical
      University of Vienna.

      A total of 70 malignant skin lesions was evaluated during this prospective pilot study.
      Diagnoses based on OCT imaging as an additional diagnostic tool, were compared to those based
      on the clinical standard pathway at the Department of Dermatology, Medical University of
      Vienna. For the purpose of this study, the histopathological diagnosis was used as the
      reference diagnostic standard.

      The major aims of this study is the investigation of the ability of ultrahigh resolution OCT
      to identify fine morphological characteristics associated with basal cell carcinoma, actinic
      keratosis, superficial squamous cell carcinoma, seborrheic keratosis, melanocytic nevi and
      melanoma.

        -  To correlate the morphologic features identified with ultrahigh resolution OCT with
           routine histopathology

        -  To investigate the clinical feasibility of ultrahigh resolution and spectroscopic OCT
           technology

        -  To assess the effectiveness of ultrahigh resolution and spectroscopic OCT imaging to
           diagnose various melanocytic and non-melanocytic skin tumors

        -  To compare the diagnostic capabilities of ultrahigh resolution OCT with standard
           non-invasive diagnostic procedures such as epiluminescence microscopy

      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a technical application, which allows the
      identification of microscopic patterns indicative for benign and malignant skin lesions. It
      is a promising non-invasive imaging technique for the micromorphology of the skin. OCT
      provides in vivo cross sectional tomographic images of tissue in situ and real-time with
      micrometer resolution. It works analogously to ultrasound; the reflection of infrared light,
      instead of acoustical waves, from the skin is measured and the signal strength is imaged as a
      function of position. Depending on the scattering properties of tissue and some accepted loss
      in resolution, a penetration depth of up to 2 mm can be achieved. The image data are
      displayed by assigning color or gray scales to each reflection, according to the measured
      signal strength. The OCT probe is applied directly after application of ultrasound gel to the
      skin. Acquisition time for an OCT image is approximately 3 seconds.
