      The purpose of this study is to determine if, in type 2 diabetic patients undergoing
      treatment with PCI and a stent, who fail to respond to normal doses of clopidogrel, a loading
      dose of 60 mg of prasugrel followed by 10 mg once daily is superior to the standard dose of
      75 mg of clopidogrel in achieving greater than 50% inhibition of platelet aggregation at
      24-36 hours of treatment.

      The VERDI study consists on a randomized, mono-center study comparing the treatment plan of a
      loading dose of prasugrel as opposed to the standard dose in type 2 diabetic patients, who
      suffer acute coronary syndrome, revascularized through an invasive percutaneous strategy with
      a stent. The aim of this study is to determine if, in type 2 diabetic patients undergoing
      treatment with PCI and a stent, who fail to respond to normal doses of clopidogrel, a loading
      dose of 60 mg of prasugrel followed by 10 mg once daily is superior to the standard dose of
      75 mg of clopidogrel in achieving greater than 50% inhibition of platelet aggregation at
      24-36 hours of treatment.

    <description>The principal objective is to determine whether in type 2 diabetic patients who are non-responsive to clopidogrel at habitual doses and who receive treatment through percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a stent, a treatment plan with a loading dose of prasugrel (60 mg) followed by 1 cp (10 mg) once a day, is superior to a standard dose of 75 mg clopidogrel in achieving greater than 50% inhibition of platelet aggregation at 24-36 hours of treatment.</description>

             bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.
