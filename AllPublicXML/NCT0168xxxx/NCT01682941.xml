      RATIONALE: Eating a diet high in soy foods may lower the risk of some types of cancer.
      Isoflavones are compounds found in soy food that may prevent cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well soy isoflavones work in treating
      patients with recurrent prostate cancer or rising prostate-specific antigen

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To precisely quantify the absorption, serum concentrations over time, and excretion
      patterns of soy isoflavones and metabolites in men consuming the two bread products to define
      relationships between dietary intake, isoflavone metabolism and the biological outcomes.

      II. To describe the safety as well as incidence and severity of toxicity in men consuming the
      control soy bread or beta-glucosidase-enriched soy bread.

      III. To see if consumption of beta-glucosidase-enriched soy bread compared to control soy
      bread has a greater effect on blood hormonal patterns and biomarkers that favor anti-prostate
      cancer activity.

      IV. To see if beta-glucosidase-enriched soy bread compared to control soy bread improves
      hormonal patterns (lower insulin like growth factor-I, increased insulin like growth factor
      binding protein 3, lower androgens), reduce prostate specific antigen velocity, and lower
      circulating vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (closed to accrual as of
      02/14/2011).

      ARM I: Patients consume 2 slices of soy bread daily for 8 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients consume 2 slices of soy almond bread daily for 8 weeks.

      After a 2 week washout period, patients crossover to the alternate treatment arm.

             Gilberts syndrome, past history of alcohol, hepatitis, or a history of non-alcoholic
             steatohepatitis) will be permitted to participate after clinical evaluation by the
             study physician.&quot;

          -  Have no history of malabsorptive disorders or other metabolic disorders requiring
             special diet recommendations. Diabetics will be permitted to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have an active malignancy other than prostate cancer that requires therapy.

          -  Have a history of pituitary hormone diseases that currently require supplemental
             hormonal administration (thyroid hormones, adrenocorticotropic hormone, growth
             hormone) or other endocrine disorders requiring hormone administration with the
             exception of diabetes, osteoporosis and men who have been stable (&gt; 6 months of
             thyroid stimulating hormone within normal limits) on thyroid replacement therapy.

          -  Have a known allergy to tree nuts, soy or wheat protein.
