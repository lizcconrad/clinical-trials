  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled intervention trial with 1,500 pregnant and postpartum women
      to examine the efficacy of an enhanced model of ongoing post-test support for women attending
      antenatal and postnatal care in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Through the intervention, the
      investigators will tailor voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for HIV to the ANC setting
      and provide a continuum of psychosocial support for pregnant women through: (1) a
      standardized health education video before HIV pre-test counseling; (2) HIV pre- and
      post-test counseling sessions that prepare women for decisions related to testing, serostatus
      disclosure and anti-retroviral (ARV) prophylaxis and help women plan strategies for sexual
      risk behavior change; (3) two additional post-test counseling sessions postpartum focusing on
      legal education and referral, partner testing, sexual risk behavior change and family
      planning decisions and; (4) an active referral system to post-test support groups run by a
      clinically trained staff psychologist and (5) an active referral system to legal services run
      by a lawyer at the clinic.

      Through this intervention trial the investigators will be testing the following hypotheses:

      H1: Women receiving the intervention will have significantly lower sexual risk of HIV at 14
      weeks and 9-months post-partum as compared to women in the control arm. Sexual risk of HIV
      will be measured by: STI incidence (Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhea and
      Chlamydia), consistent condom use, unprotected sex in past 30 days, and unprotected sex since
      delivery.

      H2: Women receiving the intervention will report significantly better outcomes related to
      prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) service uptake at 14 weeks and 9 months
      post-partum as compared to women in the control arm. PMTCT service uptake will be measured by
      acceptance of HIV VCT among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women; acceptance of ARVs,
      adherence to national infant feeding guidelines, and family planning use among HIV-positive
      women.

      H3: Women in the intervention arm will report significantly better psychosocial outcomes at
      14 weeks and 9 months post-partum as compared to women in the control arm. Psychosocial
      outcomes will be measured by: perceived social support, emotional distress, and partner
      violence among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women.

    <description>Women in the control arm receive the standard of care in terms of HIV counseling and testing during pregnancy. The standard of care for HIV counseling adheres to guidelines provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization. Women receive one individual pre-test counseling session immediately before they are tested for HIV, and one individual post-test counseling session the same day that they are tested.</description>

    <description>Women in the enhanced counseling arm receive the following intervention package: a video prior to their HIV pre-test counseling session that prepares them for decisions they will have to make regarding HIV testing and PMTCT participation, a pre-test counseling session and post-test counseling session with their nurse midwife/counselor, and two additional post-test counseling sessions with the same nurse midwife at 6 and 10 weeks postpartum. Women in the enhanced counseling arm also have access to ongoing support groups and legal support if needed at the clinic.</description>
