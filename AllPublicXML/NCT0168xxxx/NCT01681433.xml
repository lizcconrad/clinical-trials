      This Phase II study has been designed to evaluate the anti-tumor effects of adding OGX-427 to
      continuing abiraterone acetate and prednisone treatment in men with metastatic
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer (MCRPC) who have prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      progression

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      This is an open-label, randomized, Phase II clinical trial designed to evaluate the
      anti-tumor effects of OGX-427 and continuing abiraterone acetate and prednisone versus
      continuing abiraterone acetate and prednisone alone in men with MCRPC who have evidence of
      PSA progression but no evidence of symptomatic or radiographic progression that would require
      alternative therapy (e.g., needing radiation therapy for pain or significant progression of
      visceral metastases).

      Patients on the control arm will be allowed to cross-over to receive OGX-427 following
      documented disease progression. Patients will be randomized with equal probability to one of
      the following arms:

      EXPERIMENTAL ARM (Arm A):

      OGX-427 Starting within 7 days of randomization, three loading doses of 600 mg intravenously
      (IV) within Week 1 if possible (up to 10 days of initiating treatment), followed by weekly
      doses of 800 mg IV

      Continuation of standard therapy with abiraterone acetate 1000 mg by mouth (PO) daily and
      prednisone 10-20 mg PO daily

      CONTROL ARM (Arm B):

      Continuation of standard therapy with abiraterone acetate 1000 mg PO daily and prednisone
      10-20 mg PO daily

      After documented disease progression, patients on Arm B may opt to receive OGX-427 treatment
      (according to the Arm A schedule) following a screening evaluation (i.e., all inclusion and
      exclusion criteria have been met)

      Both Arms:

      Evaluations at 4 week-intervals. Disease assessments required at the milestone Day 60
      assessment (expected to occur after 8 weeks of treatment and prior to Day 1, Week 9) and at
      16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 weeks (if applicable) or until documented disease progression.
      Patients who are withdrawn from the study for a reason other than documented disease
      progression or patient withdrawal of consent will be followed every 4 weeks in the
      Off-Treatment Follow-up Period until documented disease progression.

      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

      Life Expectancy: Not Specified

      Hematopoietic:

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109 cells /L, platelet count ≥ 100 x 109 /L, and
           hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL without transfusion

      Hepatic:

        -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.1 x upper limit of normal (ULN) unless elevated secondary to
           conditions such as Gilbert's disease, in which case a direct bilirubin ≤ ULN is required

        -  Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), alanine transaminase (ALT) and alanine
           transaminase (SGOT) aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤ 3.0 x ULN

      Renal:

        -  Creatinine ≤ 1.3 x ULN

      Cardiac:

        -  Known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50% or New York Heart Association
           (NYHA) Functional Classification Class III or IV heart failure

      Other:

                  an absolute value of ≥2 ng/mL, which is confirmed by a second value ≥2 weeks
                  later.

               -  No evidence of symptomatic or radiographic progression that would require
                  alternative therapy (e.g., needing radiation therapy for pain or significant
                  progression of visceral metastases or &gt;33% increase in daily opioid use within 2
                  weeks prior to randomization).

          -  All patients who have not had a surgical orchiectomy must continue treatment with a
             luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist or antagonist to maintain a
             castrate level of testosterone.

          -  Patient must fulfill &quot;Prior Therapy&quot; criteria as follows:

               -  Chemotherapy: no more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for castrate-resistant
                  prostate cancer (CRPC) is permitted; a minimum of at least 28 days must have

                  required.

               -  Experimental therapy: prior non-cytotoxic experimental therapy is permitted
                  provided a minimum of at least 14 days has passed since completing therapy. Prior

             being performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting ANY of the following exclusion criteria will NOT be eligible for inclusion
        into the study:

          -  Currently receiving abiraterone acetate in combination with any other anti-cancer
             agent (except prednisone)

          -  Documented brain metastases, or carcinomatous meningitis, treated or untreated (Brain
             imaging for asymptomatic patients is not required.)

          -  Cord compression requiring surgery or radiation therapy while on abiraterone treatment

          -  Active second malignancy (including lymphoid malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic
             leukemia or low grade lymphoma) defined, in general, as requiring anticancer therapy
             or at high risk of recurrence during the study; not including adequately treated non
             melanomatous skin cancer or other solid tumors curatively treated with no evidence of

          -  Active autoimmune disease requiring treatment

          -  Participated in a prior Phase 3 clinical study evaluating custirsen regardless of
             study arm assignment (i.e., either control or investigational arm), or prior exposure
             to OGX-427

          -  Uncontrolled medical conditions such as myocardial infarction, uncontrolled
             hypertension, stroke or treatment of a major active infection within 3 months of
             randomization, as well as any significant concurrent medical illness that in the
             opinion of the Investigator would preclude protocol therapy

          -  Planned concomitant participation in another clinical trial of an experimental agent,
             vaccine, or device. Concomitant participation in observational studies is acceptable.
