    <textblock>
      Wide Pulse Pressure is frequently present in the normal, full-term neonatal population. This
      study will evaluate the frequency and persistence of wide pulse pressure in the neonatal
      population. Using a prospective study design in the Regular newborn and Observation nurseries
      of SIUH, North site. Healthy newborns that are between 0-72 hrs of age will have their blood
      pressures measured using the oscillometric method. This data will offer insight into whether
      the presence of wide pulse pressure in otherwise healthy newborn infants warrants further
      cardiovascular evaluation

    <description>Healthy newborns in Regular and Observation nurseries who are between 0-72 hrs of age. Infants with gestational age &gt; or = 35weeks and birth weight &gt; 2500g, who are hemodynamically stable, have no cardiorespiratory abnormalities and have no evidence of sepsis. If a blood culture was drawn due to the presence of maternal risk factors (e.g. maternal fever, prolonged rupture of membranes), patients will be included only if the blood culture result is negative and in case of intrapartum antibiotic treatment, ancillary blood tests (CBC with differential, CRP) are also within the normal range</description>
