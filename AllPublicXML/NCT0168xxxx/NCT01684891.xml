  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open label, multiple dose study to investigate the pharmacokinetics
      of RG1662 given twice daily over 28 days, and in addition, the excretion and metabolism of
      [13C]-labeled IV microdoses and an oral [14C]-labeled dose of RG1662 in healthy male
      volunteers. The anticipated time of study treatment is 4 weeks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male volunteers

          -  Volunteers who are surgically sterilized or who do not intend to father children in
             the future

          -  Absence of evidence of any active or chronic disease following a detailed medical and
             surgical history, a complete physical examination including vital signs, 12-lead ECG,
             hematology, blood chemistry, serology and urinalysis

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 inclusive

          -  Volunteers and their partners of childbearing potential must use two medically
             approved methods of contraception (e.g. hormonal contraception, IUD, barrier
             contraception), one of which must be a barrier method, for the duration of the study
             and for 3 months after last drug administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  If capable of reproduction, unwilling to use an effective form of contraception

          -  Suspicion of regular consumption of drug of abuse

          -  Positive result on hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), or HIV 1 and 2

          -  Clinically relevant ECG abnormalities at screening

          -  Family history of congenital long QT syndrome or known congenital arrhythmia

          -  Systolic blood pressure greater than 140 or less than 90 mm Hg, and diastolic blood
             pressure greater than 90 or less than 50 mm Hg. Resting Pulse Rate greater than 90 or
             less than 45 beats per minute

          -  Any other clinical relevant clinical abnormalities

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 90 days prior to
             screening

          -  Donation of more than 500 mL of blood within three months prior to screening

          -  Concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with, or treatment of which
             might interfere with, the conduct of the study, or that would, in the opinion of the
             investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the volunteer in this study
