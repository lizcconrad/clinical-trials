      Specific Aim 1: To investigate whether, in Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) patients, the
      combination of sirolimus and hydroxychloroquine is safe and well tolerated

      Specific Aim 2: To investigate whether, in LAM patients, 6 months of combination therapy with
      sirolimus and hydroxychloroquine results in improvement of indicators of disease, and whether
      the gains are sustained after stopping therapy.

      Specific Aim 3: To investigate the potential role of a LAM-specific peripheral blood
      signature to predict rates of disease progression and determine responsiveness to combination
      therapy.

      This will be a phase I dose escalation study of the combination of sirolimus (2 mg adjusted
      to keep trough levels between 5-15 ng/ml) and hydroxychloroquine (200 mg or 400 mg) taken
      orally daily. Up to 18 adult women with LAM will be enrolled.

      to keep trough levels between 5-15 ng/ml) and hydroxychloroquine (200 mg or 400 mg) taken
      orally daily for 6 months. The study is to be conducted at 2 sites. Up to 18 adult women with
      LAM will be enrolled, and each recruiting site will recruit between 8-12 subjects. The
      protocol will use the following eligibility criteria.

    <description>We will conduct a two-center phase I trial of sirolimus (mTOR inhibitor) in combination with hydroxychloroquine (autophagy inhibitor 200-400mg) administered daily for 24 weeks. Eligible subjects will receive sirolimus at an initial dose of 2mg followed by dose adjustment to keep sirolimus trough levels between 5-15ng/ml consistent with the effective dose in the MILES trial. In addition to sirolimus subjects will receive hydroxychloroquine at 200 mg daily or twice a day for 6 months, depending on time of enrollment into the study, following a standard phase I dose escalation design. All adverse events will be captured.</description>
