    <textblock>
      Dysphagia occurs relatively commonly in patients with acute stroke, and can lead to
      aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition. By using the stroke registry of our hospital, we will
      evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of Dysphagia screening in Acute Stroke using
      High-resolution impedance manometry (DASH). The hypothesis tested in this study is that
      high-resolution impedance manometry (HRiM) can provide the clinical efficacy to evaluate
      dysphagia and the diet plan in acute stroke patients.

      The hypothesis tested in this study was that high-resolution manometry can provide the
      clinical efficacy to evaluate dysphagia and the diet plan in acute stroke patients. By using
      of stroke registry of our hospital, we assessed feasibility and usefulness of Dysphagia
      screening in Acute Stroke using High-resolution impedance manometry in patients with acute
      stroke.

      The registry had the contents of two evaluation steps; the first step was the process to
      identify the patients with risk of possible aspiration and the second step was for detection
      of silent aspirators.

      Firstly, the patient was interviewed regarding difficulties with food intake, chewing and
      swallowing, and the neurological signs were confirmed by two independent neurologists. After
      then, the patients were stratified into three aspiration risk group and controlled by proper
      diet program. Finally the emergence of aspiration pneumonia was observed.

    <description>All patients with dysphagia received swallowing rehabilitation training and were guided as per National Dysphagia Diet level or nasogastric tube feeding. These patients were monitored in terms of the improvement of dietary program (e.g., From nasogastric tube feeding to step 4 dysphagia diet).</description>

    <description>The test was performed as general guideline for high-resolution impedance manometry test. The parameter was obtained and analyzed using the Chicago classification for the liquid swallows with Takasaki's modification for pharyngeal function monitoring. Swallowing pattern and aspiration risk were defined using real-time assessment of high-resolution impedance manometry test.</description>
