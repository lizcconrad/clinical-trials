  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High intake of insoluble fiber is strongly associated with a reduced incidence of diabetes
      and cardiovascular events in prospective observation studies. Our primary objective is to
      compare a life style diabetes prevention program(PRAEDIAS) with and without added insoluble
      fibers in its effectiveness to prevent incident diabetes type 2 in high risk individuals with
      impaired glucose tolerance. Subjects with IGT not willing to participate in the intervention
      will be used as independent controls. Secondary aims are to identify mechanisms of action
      with regard to body composition, anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects of fibers. We
      propose a randomized, prospective intervention study. The results will be of general
      relevance for guidance of fiber intake in the population and will help the food industry to
      design healthy high fiber foods. Fiber can be added at low cost to numerous foods. Increased
      fiber intake may therefore provide a simple non-cognitive prevention strategy effective at
      the population level.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to investigate whether insoluble fibers added to standard nutrition
      can reduce the progression of impairment of glucose metabolism in a high risk population with
      impaired glucose metabolism. Large prospective cohort studies clearly show that mainly
      insoluble cereal fiber from whole grains is associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes
      and cardiovascular disease. However, there is a lack of evidence from prospective
      intervention studies targeted to evaluate the potential of dietary fibers to reduce diabetes
      and cardiovascular disease as recently stated by the Cochrane Foundation. Dietary fiber
      intake is generally much lower than currently recommended, which may in part be related to
      side effects of whole grain nutrients and their gustatory properties. Intestinally
      uncomfortable effects are at least partly related to fermentation which is much less induced
      by insoluble non-fermentable fibers than by soluble fermentable fibers. The prospective
      demonstration of beneficial effects of insoluble fibers in preventing diabetes type 2 will
      allow detailed nutritional recommendations. This may serve to support the consumption of
      metabolically beneficial constituents of fiber-rich diets and help to increase fiber intake
      by high fiber natural nutrients or everyday nutrients enriched in insoluble natural fibers.
