  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether fluorescence angiography is an
      effectiveness technique for the localization of vascular perforators and their area of
      perfusion and for the postoperative monitoring of flap perfusion.

      Reconstructive surgery is intended to replace amputated anatomical regions by autologous
      tissue taken from distant locations: flaps. The goal is to restitute ad integrum with minimal
      sequelae. Among the flaps available, perforator flaps have the advantage of being highly
      plastic, large and can be taken from accessory vessels the loss of wich does not compromise
      the vitality of the sampling site. However their more variable anatomy requires irradiating
      preoperative morphological assessment (CT angiography) or a doppler ultrasonography that is
      not always performed by the surgeon himself and does not distinguish between muscle
      perforator and skin perforator.

      Fluorescence angiography is a superficial exploration technique of vascularization. After
      intravenous injection of a tracer (indocyanine green ICG), fluorescence angiography provides
      useful surface angiographic imaging in real-time. It can also help in monitoring
      intraoperative and postoperative quality of vascular anastomoses. Although fluorescence
      angiography has numerous applications (ophthalmology, neurosurgery, liver
      transplantation...), its usefulness in surgical flaps is only supported by a few
      publications. None really validate its clinical value by comparing it to reference
      investigations (CT angiography or doppler ultrasonography).

      40 candidate for reconstructive surgery will be included in this study. The day before
      surgery, in addition to the usual technique used to locate perforator flaps, the patient will
      receive an injection of 0.025 mg / kg Infracyanine® (indocyanine green) and the area of
      interest of the flap will be explored with the Fluobeam™ camera.

      Two hours after the surgery, during the usual clinical monitoring of the vitality of the
      flap, a new injection of Infracyanine® will test perfusion of the flap by measuring
      fluorescence intensity of the target area. These measurement will then be repeated every 6
      hours for 4 days.

    <description>Intraoperative monitoring of vascular flow through the micro-anastomoses will be determined by:
measuring the arterial and venous trans-anastomotic flow (ml / mm)
flow measurement (ml / mm) of an equivalent diameter vessel located in the operative field and not affected by the anastomosis
intrinsic transit time (in seconds) which is the time required for the fluorescence between the arterial anastomosis and the venous anastomosis
the number of leaks around the anastomosis.</description>

    <time_frame>Every six hours for four days after surgery</time_frame>

    <description>The surgeon will prescribe the usual morphological assessment of the proposed flap:
CT angiography for an anterolateral thigh flap or an epigastric inferior flap
A Doppler ultrasonography for a fibula flap.
In addition to the usual radiological technique used to locate the perforating arteries, the patient will have a fluorescence angiography prior to surgery, another just after the end of surgery and then one every six hours during the next 4 days.</description>
