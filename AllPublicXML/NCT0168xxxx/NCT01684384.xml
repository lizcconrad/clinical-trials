    <textblock>
      In this study the consequences of exacerbations will be visualized by high resolution
      computed tomography (HRCT) scan at functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity
      (TLC) as taken during an episode of exacerbation and after recovering. Changes in HRCT based
      airway dimensions and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) -based resistance values will be
      correlated with changes in patient reported outcomes (PROs) and lung function tests recorded
      at the same time.

    <description>The secondary objective is to check if the changes in CFD data actually correlate better with changes in PRO than changes in lung function parameters.</description>

    <description>As tertiary objective the reproducibility of the segmentations done by the centers will be evaluated. To accomplish reproducible segmentations the multiple centers will be guided to perform accurate segmentations, and bottlenecks in the usage of the program will be identified and resolved in order to simplify it where necessary and possible.</description>
