  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Timing of laparoscopic cholecystectomy following after endoscopic retrograde cholangiography
      for acute biliary pancreatitis is a controversial issue. There are still many confounding
      findings offering either early laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 72 hours following
      endoscopic sphincterotomy or delayed surgery after 6 weeks. Peritoneal plasmin system is
      known to be an important factor in peritoneal healing and adhesion formation. Measurement of
      tissue concentrations of tissue-type plasminogen activator and its specific activity,
      urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 are thought
      to be helpful to show peritoneal adhesions after endoscopic sphincterotomy.

    <textblock>
      Peritoneal fibrinolysis is crucial in peritoneal healing processes and subsequent adhesion
      formation. It is expected that endoscopic retrograde cholangiography is a trauma causing
      adhesions around the hepatobiliary area. Such adhesions may cause some difficulty for
      consequent gallbladder surgery. For that reason, tissue measurements of factors indicating
      degree of peritoneal healing and adhesion is helpful for timing of such surgical
      interventions.

      Patients are going to be randomized to early and delayed surgery groups. Sampling of
      peritoneum around the gallbladder during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients after
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiography is performed. Tissue concentrations of tissue-type
      plasminogen activator and its specific activity, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and
      plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 are going to be studied by using commercial assays.

      Peritoneal fibrinolytic activity and surgical outcomes are going to be compared.
