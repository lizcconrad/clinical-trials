  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia depends on being able to locate physical landmarks on a patient's body. In
      obese patients, the commonly used landmarks may be difficult or even impossible to feel. In
      addition, the spine can be hidden beneath a layer of fatty tissue.

      Ultrasound is useful for finding the correct injection site in pregnant patients, but the
      usefulness of ultrasound has not been adequately evaluated in non-pregnant patients. The
      potential benefits for obese patients from the use of ultrasound include shortening the
      duration of the procedure, increasing patient comfort, decreasing the total number of
      attempts, and aiding in the choice of appropriate needle length for the patient.

      The investigators hypothesize that there is no difference in time to perform a spinal
      anesthetic when landmarking with ultrasound as compared to tactile landmarking in patients
      with BMI &gt; 35.

    <description>Subcutaneous local infiltration with a 25g needle we be performed prior to the spinal. Neuraxial technique will be attempted midline with a 25 gauge whitacre needle in the sitting position. Spinals will be attempted on either L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5 interspaces. The amount and type of local anesthetic/intrathecal narcotic will be left to the discretion of the Anesthetist.</description>
