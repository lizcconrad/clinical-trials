      The purpose of this project is to investigate whether a 12-week, fulltime pulmonary
      rehabilitation program can enhance cognitive functioning, mood, anxiety, and quality of life
      in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

    <time_frame>In the experimental group, this measure is assessed in the first and last week of rehabilitation with an average time frame of 11 weeks. In the Control group, this measure is assessed before and after waiting time with an average time frame of 5 weeks.</time_frame>

    <measure>Adherence to pulmonary rehabilitation</measure>
    <time_frame>These data are collected during the total period of pulmonary rehabilitation, which has a time frame of 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of attendance of treatment session is collected from patients medical records.
Adherence to pulmonary rehabilitation is specified as the percentage of the prescribed treatment sessions that patients actually attend. Adherence is further specified in the following categories: disease, motivation, other.
We use this measure to explore the predictors (e.g., age, education, cognitive functioning) of adherence to pulmonary rehabilitation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>In the experimental group, this measure is assessed in the first and last week of rehabilitation with an average time frame of 11 weeks. In the Control group, this measure is assessed before and after waiting time with an average time frame of 5 weeks.</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dropout from pulmonary rehabilitation</measure>
    <time_frame>From the moment of randomization untill the moment of dropout from pulmonary rehabilitation, assessed up to 1 year after randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>Dropout can be specified as the percentage of patients who, though eligible, do not start pulmonary rehabilitation or patients who do not finish pulmonary rehabilitation. Dropout is further specified in the following categories: death, disease, motivation, practical (e.g. move).
We use this measure to explore the predictors (e.g., age, education, cognitive functioning) of dropout from pulmonary rehabilitation.</description>
