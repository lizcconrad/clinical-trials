    <textblock>
      To look at what types of measures can be used to predict how an older person will tolerate
      chemoradiation treatment for head and neck cancer. This study uses surveys and a blood draw
      to look at the different measures.

      Purpose: To identify baseline predictors of change in function over the course of treatment
      with chemoradiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer.

      Participants: Patients 65 or older who have an appointment at the North Carolina Cancer
      Hospital (NCCH) or other participating sites, have planned chemoradiotherapy for head and
      neck cancer

      Procedures (methods): Consenting subjects will complete a Geriatric Assessment, Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head and Neck and give a blood sample for CBC and p16INK4a at
      the start of their chemoradiotherapy, at week four, at the end and 90 days post therapy. They
      will also complete a health behavior questionnaire at baseline.
