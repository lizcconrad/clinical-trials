  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study will provide the study specimens (samples of bone marrow and blood) and
      the clinical data for a pan-Canadian collaborative research project developed by the MDS/AML
      Research Consortium. The goal of this project involves the evaluation and potential
      validation of five novel prognostic tests for myelodysplasia (MDS) and/or acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML), as well as an analysis of health economic and socio-ethical implications
      related to the potential introduction of these tests into the clinical setting. The
      over-arching goal is to improve the outcomes of patients with MDS and AML. The primary
      hypothesis is that one or more of the laboratory tests being evaluated in conjunction with
      this study, either alone or in combination with other laboratory tests (either established or
      under investigation in this project), will have statistically significant prognostic value
      either alone or in combination with established clinical risk factors.

      The clinical study will involve the enrollment of 200 adults with AML and 200 adults with MDS
      over a 2.5 year period. Participants will be followed on study for two years. Bone marrow and
      blood specimens will be collected at diagnosis and at other time points as required for the
      development of the five laboratory tests.

      Participants will be assigned to treatment according to local institutional practice and will
      be followed for up to 2 years. Health economic and quality of life questionnaires will be
      administered at key time points. Data will be collected regarding participant
      characteristics, diagnosis, disease features, treatment and clinical outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two of the tests involve a technology called flow cytometry. Both of the flow cytometry tests
      are used to predict whether a person is likely to have a good response to chemotherapy or
      not.

      Three of the tests involve new genetic-based technology. One of these tests is called
      comparative genomic profiling. This test can detect genetic abnormalities that current
      testing methods are not able to detect. Another test involves micro-RNA profiling. The final
      test involves RNA sequencing. The researchers think these tests might be useful in predicting
      how well a person will respond to treatment.

      The novel laboratory tests being evaluated as part of this study are still in the early
      phases of development and cannot be used for clinical decision making. Participants enrolled
      in this study will not be informed regarding their individual results with respect to the
      study tests that are conducted using their biospecimens.

      The following information (data) will be collected regarding study participants: diagnosis,
      results of relevant clinical tests, age, gender, treatment and outcome during the 2 year
      study follow-up period. The study also involves the completion of study questionnaires at six
      different time points over the course of the two year study follow-up.

      Some of the laboratory tests that will be evaluated as part of this study will utilize RNA
      and/or DNA. There may be biospecimens left over after the work related to this study is
      complete. At the time of consent for the study, participants will be asked to provide consent
      (or decline their consent) regarding the use of leftover specimens (including RNA and DNA)
      for other research. The details regarding this other research are provided in the protocol
