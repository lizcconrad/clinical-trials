  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of physician's counseling on participation
      and utilization of sedation in a primary colonoscopy-based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening
      program
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participation rate is one of the major factors influencing the effectiveness of screening
      programs. Participation rates in CRC screening, including primary colonoscopy programs,
      remain suboptimal. It is known that one of the strongest predictors of CRC screening
      participation rate is a physician, especially primary care physician (PCP), recommendation.
      Engaging a PCP tends to improve participation rate in organized and opportunistic cancer
      screening programs.

      To our best knowledge there are no randomized controlled trials, dedicated specifically to
      assess the effect of physician's counseling on participation rate in primary colonoscopy CRC
      screening programs. There is also no data on the impact of physician's counseling on
      patient's decision to choose unsedated (not in sedation) or sedated colonoscopy.

      In this study we aimed to quantitatively estimate the impact of a PCP's counseling on
      screening participation rate and utilization of sedation in the opportunistic primary CRC
      screening program when compared to the effect obtained by using a standardized information
      leaflet only.

    <description>Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening was recommended to a patient personally by a PCP. The issue was discussed during a routine medical visit according to a standardized scheme. PCP provided a patient with a rationale for CRC screening in asymptomatic individuals and benefits of early treatment of the disease. A patient was told about colonoscopy-based screening program. A PCP provided patient with information on how colonoscopy is performed and how to prepare a bowel for the examination, and informed a patient about possible adverse events related to the procedure including post-polypectomy bleeding and bowel perforation. According to the scheme of the discussion screening modalities other than colonoscopy were not debated, unless a patient specifically asked about them.</description>
