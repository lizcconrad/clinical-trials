      Comparison between different treatments of obesity in the short and medium term: prescriptive
      diet therapy compared to to cognitive-behavioral approach in the treatment of obesity
      according to the method of clinical trial.

      According to the Italian guidelines on obesity, the target to reach is the weight loss of 10%
      compared to the initial weight, obtained in six months and maintained for the next 5 years.

      The guideline considers six months as the time required to lose weight, but many patients are
      not able to achieve this result. Since in clinical practice many patients fail to achieve
      this weight loss in six months, it was decided to extend to 12 months the time to reach the
      target. As an intermediate goal it has been proposed to achieve a weight loss of at least 5%
      on respect of the basal weight in six months.

      The hypotheses to be tested is that the addition of a short CBT, as it can be applied in a
      public outpatients, is able to improve the percentage of responders and to raise the
      proportion of subjects able to maintain the result over time.
