      Specific Aim 1: To determine the clinical efficacy of early initiation of insulin therapy in
      decreasing the incidence of NODAT among de novo kidney transplant patients with manifested
      post-transplant hyperglycemia during the first week after transplantation.

      Hypothesis 1: Early initiation of insulin therapy protects beta-cell from early stress
      related to the surgery and use of higher doses of immunosuppressive medications, and leads to
      lower incidence of NODAT at 1 and 2 years.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the improvement in overall glycemic control with the early
      initiation of insulin therapy.

      Hypothesis 2: Early initiation of insulin therapy results in greater overall control of
      glycemia compared to standard care of dietary counseling, life-style modification, oral
      hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin as needed at 1 year.

      Specific Aim 3: To determine the improvement in beta-cell function among patients assigned to
      the early initiation of insulin therapy at one year post-transplantation.

      Hypothesis 3: Early initiation of insulin therapy protects beta-cell from glucotoxicity of
      post-transplant hyperglycemia and preserves better beta-cell function at 1 year.
