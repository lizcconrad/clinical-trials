      The primary objective of Part A is to compare the change in elasticity measurements at
      baseline and at 3 months between subjects who have had a resurfacing or tightening procedure
      and those who have not. The secondary objective for Part A is to develop baseline elasticity
      scores for ages 18-35, 36-50, and 51-65 and for Fitzpatrick skin types I-II, III-IV, and
      V-VI. The primary objective of Part B is to compare the age of the scar and surrounding
      tissue with the elasticity measurements.

    <arm_group_label>Part A: 3 Arms</arm_group_label>
    <description>Subjects will be recruited and enrolled to fill one of three Arms. The first Arm will include 25 subjects who are scheduled to receive resurfacing or tightening procedures AS STANDARD OF CARE (CO2 resurfacing or tightening procedure (1 treatment), radiofrequency (2 tx), Fraxel ( 2 tx), or PDL. These subjects will have baseline elasticity measurements recorded on their face and right forearm before their procedures, and follow up measurements will be repeated 3 months following their last treatment. The second Arm will include 25 subjects who are not scheduled to receive any cosmetic procedures but who agree to return for repeated measurements 3 months following the first. Baseline elasticity measurements will be recorded from subjects' face and right forearm and subjects will return in 3 months for follow-up measurements. The third Arm will include the remaining 50 subjects; these subjects will have the elasticity measurements performed only once on their face and forearm.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Part B</arm_group_label>
    <description>The study population in the second cohort will consist of 250 subjects who have a surgical scar &gt;2 cm in length. Subjects enrolled will have three elasticity measurements performed in one study visit. Elasticity will be measured directly in the center of the scar, 3cm perpendicular to the center of the scar, and 3cm in line from one end of the scar (Appendix 2).</description>

        Up to 350 subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for either study Part A, Part
        B or both will be consented and enrolled with the goal of having 100 subjects complete Part
        A and 250 subjects complete Part B. Subjects will be recruited from the Dermatology Clinic
        at Northwestern University and other Northwestern University clinics.
