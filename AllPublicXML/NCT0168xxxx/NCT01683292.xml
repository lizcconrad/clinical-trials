    <textblock>
      In this first study of inhaled apomorphine in Parkinson's disease patients, the primary
      objective is to find the minimum efficacious dose of apomorphine that is useful in rescuing
      patients during 'off' periods. Safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of inhaled
      apomorphine will be assessed during the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with established idiopathic PD (via fulfilment of Steps 1 and 2 of the UK
             Brain Bank Criteria), of at least 3 years duration prior to study entry, who were on
             specific and optimised anti-Parkinson medication (levodopa and/or dopamine agonists),
             and with motor fluctuations.

          2. Patients with a modified Hoehn and Yahr disease severity scoring of between 2 and 4 in
             an &quot;on&quot; state.

          3. Men or women aged over 30 years.

          4. Patients with a signed and dated written valid consent obtained prior to
             participation.

          5. Female patients must have been of non-childbearing potential (ie, physiologically
             incapable of becoming pregnant, including any female who was post-menopausal) or of
             child-bearing potential with a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) at screening.

          6. Patients who experienced motor fluctuations with recognisable &quot;off&quot; periods in control
             of motor symptoms, as assessed by the motor fluctuation questionnaire (patients were
             to have reported at least 1 &quot;Yes&quot; response to the questions in the motor fluctuation
             questionnaire).

          7. Patient willing and able to comply with study procedures.-

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who had participated in a trial with an investigational product within 3
             months prior to randomisation at Visit 2.

          2. Patients with serious uncontrolled disease including serious psychological disorders
             likely to interfere with the study and/or likely to cause death within 6 months of the
             study completion.

          3. Patients with previous intolerance to apomorphine.

          4. Patients with a previous significant complication from oral dopamine agonist therapy
             including hospitalisation following dopamine agonist introduction and/or the
             development of hallucinations or other adverse neuropsychiatric features following
             introduction of sc apomorphine.

          5. Women lactating, pregnant, or of child-bearing potential not using a reliable
             contraceptive method.

          6. Patients with known HIV or active chronic hepatitis B or C infection.

             laboratory data and full physical examination.

          8. Patients who, in the Investigator's opinion, were unsuitable for the study for any
             reason.

          9. Patients with clinically significant blood test abnormalities and previous medical
             history/intercurrent illnesses that may have compromised the safety of the patient in
             the study.

         10. Patients with major ECG abnormalities (as judged by the Investigator).

         11. Patients with a FEV1 &lt;65%.

         12. Patients showing a postural decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP) of &gt; 20 mm Hg, or
             showing significant clinical symptoms associated with orthostatic hypotension.

         13. Patients with persistent elevation of BP, with average systolic readings of 160 mm Hg
             or average diastolic readings of 100 mm Hg.

         14. Patients taking anabolic steroids, traditional antipsychotics (unless low dose), and
             antiemetics other than domperidone.

         15. Patients taking agents of the 5HT3 antagonist class including ondansetron,
             granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, and alosetron.

         16. Patients with existing cancer and those in remission for less than 5 years.

         17. Patients with evidence (as ascertained from examination, tests or history) to indicate
             cardiovascular, gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, central nervous system,
             pulmonary system, or bone marrow disorders that in the Investigator's opinion
             compromised patient safety.

         18. Patients who were known non-responders to apomorphine treatment for &quot;off&quot; episodes.

         19. Patients with a history of drug or alcohol abuse in the 12 months prior to entry.

         20. Patients with a history of clinically significant allergies to VR040 formulation
             constituents (including lactose and opioids) and domperidone.

         21. Patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of schizophrenia, dementia, &quot;Parkinson
             plus&quot; syndromes, or unstable systemic disease
