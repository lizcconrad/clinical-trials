  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of a first-line treatment for major depressive disorder
      (MDD), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), among men and women prisoners.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 3-year randomized trial is to promote uptake of evidence-based treatment
      in criminal justice settings by conducting a fully-powered randomized effectiveness study
      that collects pilot implementation data, including cost-effectiveness data. Group IPT will be
      compared to treatment as usual (TAU) in a sample of 90 male and 90 female prisoners with MDD
      from 4 institutions, allowing us to explore gender effects.
