  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infantile hemangioma (IH) is the most common benign vascular tumor in pediatric population.
      The characteristic natural history of this tumor is rapid growth in the first year of life
      and follows by spontaneous involution. However, it may cause cosmetic unacceptable. Early
      intervention in superficial IH may help to minimize the risk of residual aesthetic problems.
      Topical timolol, a non selective beta-blocker, is an emerging treatment which has been
      reported in efficacy and safety for the treatment of IH. However, the reported studies were
      case-series or small study. This study is a prospective double-blind,randomized-controlled
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 0.5% timolol maleate solution for treatment in
      superficial IH. The patient will be treated with topical timolol for at least 6 months and
      instructed to 4 times daily apply 1-2 drop of timolol solution on the lesion and rub over the
      entire lesion with a finger. Photographs of the lesion will be taken at the baseline and
      every 1-month visit. Clinical evaluation of the treatment efficacy is carried out by 2
      investigators independently to determine the change in lesion size and visual analogue scale
      of the lesion color. The main outcome is to evaluate the efficacy of 0.5% timolol maleate
      solution in treatment of infantile hemangioma compared to placebo.

To determine the side effects, investigators will monitor the vital signs of the patients every follow-up visit and ask the caretakers about the side effects. Furthermore, every patients will receive the dairy to record the frequency of drug usage and side effects found.</description>
