    <intervention_name>WBV and Resistance</intervention_name>
    <description>use of WBV and resistance device during 03 months in elderly health people. The WBV used progressive increases of time and amplitude and the resistance training improves the weight.
For Resistance: performed in upper and lower limbs in weight machine Mega II Movement®, used guidelines from American College of Sports Medicine for elderly, with two series of 08 repetitions (75% weight of one RM), considered for RM calculation the maximum voluntary isometric contraction.
For WBV: used MY3 platform (Power Plate®, MY3, UK) frequency 35 hertz, tri-axial, amplitude 02 mm in adaptation and initial phases, increasing to 04 mm in phases intermediate and final. The time initial was 10 minutes, progressed to 15 min in second month, concluding with 20 min. Rest time between series remained 01 min.</description>

For Resistance: performed similar movments in upper and lower limbs in weight machine Mega II Movement®, without using weights.
For WBV: used MY3 platform (Power Plate®, MY3, UK) frequency 35 hertz, tri-axial, amplitude 02 mm in adaptation and initial phases, increasing to 04 mm in phases intermediate and final.
