  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicentric, randomized controlled trial is to assess whether the timing
      of renal replacement therapy initiation (early vs delayed) has an impact on mortality at 90
      days in patients with severe acute kidney injury at the failure stage (according to RIFLE
      criteria) during the initial phase of septic shock.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute renal failure is one of the most feared complications of septic shock and occurs in 51%
      of patients with these conditions. Mortality at 3 months ranges from 36% to 60%. To date,
      these exists no consensus regarding the optimal time to initiate renal remplacement therapy
      (RRT). Retrospective and observational studies have suggested that early initiation of RRT
      could help to improve prognosis in these patients. Therefore, we aim to investigate wether
      early initiation of RRT (within 12 hours after a diagnosis of acute renal insufficiency at
      the &quot;failure&quot; stage according to the RIFLE Criteria), will reduce 90-day mortality as
      compared to deferred initiation of RRT (48 to 60 hours after diagnosis), in intensive care
      unit (ICU) patients with septic shock who develop acute renal failure.

      Secondary objectives include: to compare the impact of the two RRT strategies on 28, 180 et
      360 day mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of RRT, duration of ICU stay
      and duration of overall hospital stay. In addition, quality of life at 90 and 360 days will
      be evaluated using the EQ5D questionnaire. Tolerance of both strategies will be compared in
      terms of metabolic disorders, arrhythmias, pulmonary oedema by overload, hypotension,
      hemorrhagic complications, and dependence on RRT at hospital discharge.

    <description>Investigators of each center will have the choice of the RRT technique based on their usual practice: intermittent hemodialysis, intermittent hemodiafiltration, continuous hemodialysis, continuous hemofiltration, continuous hemodiafiltration (typically the continuous techniques in the acute phase, followed by intermittent techniques after stabilization).
In case of life threatening conditions within the 48 hours after randomisation (hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis or pulmonary edema) the RRT will be initiated as soon as possible.
In case of improvement of renal function within the 48 hours after randomisation (defined as the return of spontaneous urine output &gt; 1000ml/24 hr or &gt;2000ml/24hr with diuretics), RRT is not mandatory.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Adults (males or females, age &gt;18 years) with septic shock who develop acute renal failure
        (as defined by the &quot;Failure&quot; stage of the RIFLE classification) will be eligible for
        inclusion.

        Septic shock is defined as severe sepsis with at least 2 to 4 &quot;SIRS&quot; criteria and
        persistent hypotension despite adequate vascular filling and need vaso-active drugs.

        SIRS is defined as the simultaneous presence of at least 2 of the following criteria :

          -  Body temperature ≥ 38°C ou ≤ 36°C

          -  Heart rate ≥ 90 bpm

          -  Respiratory rate ≥ 20/mn or PaCO2 ≤ 32 mmHg

          -  Leucocytes ≥ 12,000/mm3 or ≤ 4,000/mm3 or &gt;10% immature forms.

        Acute renal insufficiency is defined as the &quot;failure&quot; stage of the RIFLE classification,
        i.e. the presence of at least one of the following criteria:

        All patients are required to provide informed consent after having been appropriately
        informed about the study. In case of temporary incapacity of the patient to sign, the
        consent form can be signed by a surrogate.

        study:

          1. Patients with chronic renal at dialysis.

             presenting emergency criteria for immediate hemodialysis at the time of randomization
             (i.e. hyperkalemia &gt;6.5 mmol/L or pH&lt;7.15 or pulmonary oedema by fluid overload)

          3. Patients already had hemodialysis before their arrival in the intensive care unit

          4. Pregnant women.

          5. Moribund patients whose life expectancy is less than 24 hours

          6. Patients unlikely to survive to 28 days because of uncontrollable comorbidities (e.g.
             cardiac, pulmonary or hepatic disease at the terminal stage, hepatorenal syndrome,
             uncontrolled cancer, severe post-anorexic encephalopathy…)

          7. Patients with advance directives indicating their wish not to be resuscitated.

          8. Patients under legal guardianship.

          9. Patients participing in another interventional study that may influence the prognosis
             of patients.
