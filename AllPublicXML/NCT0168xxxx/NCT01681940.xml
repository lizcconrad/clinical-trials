        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must have participated in the phase 1 trial (EudraCT number:
             2010-022084-36) and phase 2a trial (EudraCT number: 2010-022085-26)

          -  Subject or subjects legally authorized guardian(s) must provide signed, informed
             consent prior to performing any trial-related activities (trial-related activities are
             any procedures that would not have been performed during normal management of the
             subject)

          -  The subject and his/her guardian(s) must have the ability to comply with the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject cannot walk without support

          -  Presence of known chromosomal abnormality and syndromes affecting psychomotor
             development, other than alpha-Mannosidosis

          -  History of bone marrow transplantation

          -  Presence of known clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary or renal
             disease or other medical conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             preclude participation in the trial

          -  Any other medical condition or serious intercurrent illness, or extenuating
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in
             the trial.

          -  Pregnancy: Before the start of the treatment the investigators will decide whether or
             not there is a need for contraception. This assessment will be done through interviews
             with the patient and parents. The evaluation will be done continuously during the
             study

          -  Psychosis within the last 3 months

          -  Planned major surgery that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude
             participation in the trial

          -  Participation in other interventional trials testing IMP except for studies with
             Lamazym
