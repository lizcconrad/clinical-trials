  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End stage renal disease (ESRD) is a severe clinical state of irreversible loss of endogenous
      kidney function, shortening life expectancy, if left untreated. In the state of ESRD, over
      5000 uremic toxins are accumulated in the body causing dysfunction of various organ systems.
      The survival of these patients depends on renal replacement therapies, such as hemodialysis
      (HD), which artificially purifies the blood from toxins. The investigators assume that some
      of the uremic toxins are also present in the patient's exhaled breath, and could be detected
      by a non-invasive and highly sensitive test: a NA-NOSE artificial olfactory system. It is
      based on analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a novel, non-invasive field in
      medical diagnostics. The NA-NOSE is made from an array of nanosensors, and was developed by
      our collaborator Dr. Hossam Haick (Chemical Engineering, Technion).

      In the current study, the investigators utilize this technology to identify VOCs in the
      exhaled breath of dialysis patients, and to characterize certain patterns of expression that
      could potentially help in future monitoring of HD adequacy. The investigators plan to collect
      150 breath samples from patients before and during dialysis, and from healthy subjects. All
      participants provide a signed informed consent. Subsequently, analysis of samples will be
      done at Dr. Haick's laboratory, using Gas-Chromatography/Mass-Spectrometry and parameters
      extracted from each sensor response.
