      The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes when patients with degenerative sacroiliitis
      (arthritis of the SI joint) and or sacroiliac disruption (abnormal separation or tearing of
      the sacroiliac joint)undergo either SI joint fusion with the iFuse Implant System or undergo
      specific, targeted non-surgical treatment of the SI joint.

      The intended analysis was to examine differences in responses at 6 months. It was
      acknowledged that subjects with chronic pain in the NSM arm group might not experience any
      benefit as there was little evidence at the time that NSM was helpful. The protocol included
      optional crossover to other treatments, including surgical treatment. The protocol
      anticipated a high crossover rate and therefore did not include any comparative analyses
      after month 6.

    <description>Composite endpoint of reduction from baseline in VAS back pain score by at least 20 mm, lack of device-related serious adverse events, absence of neurologic worsening and absence of surgical re-intervention. Note that the primary endpoint analysis is **intent to treat**, meaning that an outcome (success or failure) is assigned to all subjects randomized and treated. Subjects who withdrew early were deemed study failures.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in Quality of Life (QOL) as Measured by SF-36 PCS (Physical Component) at Post-operative Visits</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in quality of life (QOL) as measured by SF-36 PCS (Physical Component) at post-operative / NSM visits. The Short Form 36 health survey (SF-36) is a 36-item patient reported health questionnaire to measure quality of life across 8 domains. The PCS is the Physical Component Summary score. PCS is normed, so that &quot;normal&quot; scores are 50 +- 10. Higher scores indicate higher quality of life; lower scores indicate lower quality of life. SF-36 PCS (NBS, 2009 norms) ranges from 5 (minimum value, poor physical function) to 80 (maximum, excellent clinical function).
Note that secondary endpoint analysis is based on available data only. No imputation of missing scores was prespecified in the protocol.</description>

          <description>Oswestry Disability Index is a validated measure of disability related to low back pain. There are 10 sections, each with a score between 0-5. If all sections are answered, the total possible score is 50/50 = 100% which is the worst disability possible on the scale. (0/50 = no disability at all.) If any section is skipped by the study participant, the total possible score for that section is removed from the denominator. Example - section 8 skipped, total possible score is 45/45 = 100%.</description>

The PCS is the Physical Component Summary score. 0% would represent the lowest or worst possible level of functioning while 100% would represent the highest / best possible level of functioning.
The MCS is the Mental Component Summary score. 0% would represent the lowest or worst possible level of functioning while 100% would represent the highest / best possible level of functioning.</description>

          <description>EQ-5D is a five-question broad quality of life measure that is combined into a single index using population norm data called time trade-off (TTO) utility of current health. A score of 0 would = worst imaginable health, while a score of 1.0 would be best imaginable health. (Scores &lt;0 are also possible, representing states worse than death.) EQ-5D also includes a 0-100 mm health thermometer, where 0 means death and 100 means perfect health.</description>

        <description>Improvement in quality of life (QOL) as measured by SF-36 PCS (Physical Component) at post-operative / NSM visits. The Short Form 36 health survey (SF-36) is a 36-item patient reported health questionnaire to measure quality of life across 8 domains. The PCS is the Physical Component Summary score. PCS is normed, so that &quot;normal&quot; scores are 50 +- 10. Higher scores indicate higher quality of life; lower scores indicate lower quality of life. SF-36 PCS (NBS, 2009 norms) ranges from 5 (minimum value, poor physical function) to 80 (maximum, excellent clinical function).
Note that secondary endpoint analysis is based on available data only. No imputation of missing scores was prespecified in the protocol.</description>

A score of 0 would = worst imaginable health, while a score of 1.0 would be best imaginable health.

          <title>Improvement in Quality of Life (QOL) as Measured by EQ-5D (EuroQol-5D) at Post-operative Visits</title>
          <description>Improvement in quality of life (QOL) as measured by EQ-5D (EuroQol-5D) at post-operative visits. EQ-5D is a five-question broad quality of life measure that can be combined into a single index and represents the time trade-off (TTO) utility of current health. A score of 0 would = worst imaginable health, while a score of 1.0 would be best imaginable health.
Note that secondary endpoint analysis is based on available data only. No imputation of missing scores was prespecified in the protocol.</description>
