  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periconceptional supplementation with folic acid - the synthetic form of the B-vitamin folate
      - reduces the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as spina bifida. The underlying
      biochemical mechanisms for how folic acid affects health outcomes however are unknown. The
      naturally occurring form 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) is now available and discussed as
      an adequate substitute to folic acid. This study aims to determine the effect of folic acid
      compared to 5-MTHF on cellular mechanisms. Stable isotope tracer protocols will be used that
      allow determining the effect of folic acid on the dynamics of metabolic pathways in the human
      body.

      Hypothesis: Supplementation with high-dose folic acid alters the turnover rate of folate
      dependent pathways in healthy humans; but 5-MTHF does not. Genetic variations in a key enzyme
      of the folate metabolism will aggravate the effect of folic acid on the metabolic pathways.
