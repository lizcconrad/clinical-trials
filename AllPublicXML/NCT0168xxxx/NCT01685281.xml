    <textblock>
      study objectives are to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two doses of MG01CI
      (1400 mg and 700 mg) to Placebo for the treatment of symptoms in adults diagnosed with
      PI-ADHD.

      subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment sequences as
      follows:

        1. week 1:1400 mg, week 2:700 mg, week 3:placebo

        2. week 1:700 mg,week 2: placebo,week 3:1400 mg

        3. week 1: placebo, week2:1400 mg, week 3 700 mg

      The study will consist of three periods: a screening period of up to one week, a 3-week
      double-blind treatment period, and a one-week safety follow-up period.

      The purpose of this dose finding study is to compare two doses of MG01CI (1400 mg and 700 mg)
      to Placebo, in adult subjects with PI-ADHD. A crossover study design will allow evaluation of
      safety/tolerability and efficacy using validated computerized tests.

      subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment sequences as
      follows:

        1. week 1:1400 mg, week 2:700 mg, week 3:placebo

        2. week 1:700 mg,week 2: placebo,week 3:1400 mg

        3. week 1: placebo, week2:1400 mg, week 3 700 mg

      Overview of Study Visits

      Screening Period:

      Visit 1 - Screening/Baseline Visit (up to 7 days prior to dosing)

      Treatment Period:

      Visit 2 - Day 0 (Randomization Visit) Visit 3 - Day 7 ± 3 days Visit 4 - Day 14 ± 3 days
      Visit 5 - Day 21 ± 3 days

      Follow-up period:
