      This is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled,
      parallel-group study to determine the efficacy and safety of nebulized fluticasone propionate
      (FP) 1mg twice daily compared with oral prednisone administered for 7 days to Chinese
      pediatric and adolescent subjects (aged 4 to 16 years) with an acute exacerbation of asthma.
      This study is for supporting registration of FP Nebules treating Chinese pediatric and
      adolescent subjects (aged 4 to 16 years) with an acute exacerbation of asthma in China.

      At least 250 subjects, aged 4-16 years old, diagnosed an acute exacerbation of asthma at
      presentation, are eligible to take part in the study if they meet the inclusion criteria.
      They are randomly assigned at the ratio 1:1 to one of the following treatment groups for 7
      days: FP Nebules 2×0.5mg/2ml twice daily/Placebo tablets once daily; Or, Oral prednisone
      tablets once daily (2mg/kg.day, up to 40mg/day for 4 days, then 1mg/kg.day or half of the
      original dose, up to 20mg/day for 3 days) / Placebo Nebules 2×2ml 0.9% saline twice daily.
      While all subjects are given Salbutamol Nebules / MDI for relief of symptoms. After
      randomization (visit 1), the following visits are on Day5 (visit 2) and Day8 (visit 3), and a
      follow-up phone call (visit4) will happen two weeks post treatment on Day 21 for collection
      of adverse events.

      The primary endpoint is mean morning PEF on diary card over the treatment assessment period.
      The secondary endpoints include subject derived data (symptom scores ), evening PEF on diary
      card, use of rescue medications, clinic assessments of pulmonary function ( FEV1, and FVC) ,
      clinical scoring index , patient/parent and investigator global evaluation, and use of rescue
      medications during the trial. Safety endpoints include AEs, vital signs, and oropharyngeal
      examinations, and laboratory tests (haematology, urinalysis, chemistry). The subjects are
      assessed for compliance on completion of diary card.

    <measure>Mean Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (AM PEF) on Diary Card Over the Treatment Assessment Period in Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 2 to 8</time_frame>
    <description>PEF is the maximum flow generated during a forceful exhalation, starting from full lung inflation. Participants (if needed with the help of parents or guardian) recorded on diary card the best of three PEF measurements, using a mini-Wright peak flow meter in the morning before taking any study drug. Only data that was drawn from Days 2 to 8 after randomization and on or before one day after the end date of study drug was used for analysis. The outcome measure was considered missing if less than 2 days were recorded in the given treatment assessment period. Two participants from fluticasone propionate group and 4 participants from prednisone group had the missing outcome measure. Analysis was performed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with effects due to gender, age, centre and treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Mean Evening PEF on Diary Card Over the Treatment Assessment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1/2 to 8</time_frame>
    <description>PEF is the maximum flow generated during a forceful exhalation, starting from full lung inflation. Participants recorded on diary card the best of three PEF measurements, using a mini-Wright peak flow meter in the evening (6:00-9:00 post meridiem [PM]) before taking any study drug. Only data that was drawn from Days 1/2 to 8 after randomization and before or on the end date of study drug was used for analysis. If participants started to take the study drug in the morning (early or on 12:00 PM), only then the evening PEF on the date of randomization was used. The outcome measure was considered missing if less than 2 days was recorded in the given treatment assessment period. Two participants from fluticasone propionate group and 5 participants from prednisone group had the missing outcome measure. Analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with effects due to gender, age, centre and treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Assessment of Lung Function of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>During the treatment period at Day 5, Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometric assessments of FEV1 and FVC were assessed at clinic visit 1 (Screening), 2 (Day 5) and 3 (Day 8). Lung function tests were performed at the approximately same time at each visit in the morning. Participants were instructed to withhold salbutamol therapy for at least 4 hour, and the highest of three FEV1 and FVC measurements were recorded. If participants discontinued before or on Day 5, then the FEV1 and FVC collected at the early withdrawal visit is included in the Visit 2. Otherwise, the FEV1, FVC collected at the early withdrawal visit was included in the Visit 3. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of gender, centre, age and treatment.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Scoring Index at Day 5 and Day 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 5 and Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical scoring index was assessed at Baseline (Visit 1), Day 5 and Day 8. The score assigned represented the sum of the score for each of four signs: respiratory rate, wheezing, inspiration/expiration ratio, and accessory muscle use. Each of these parameters were scored on a 4-point scale of 0 to 3 where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe. The total score ranged from 0 to 12, where 0 indicated absence of symptoms and 12 indicated most severe symptoms. The Baseline value was the last non-missing value prior to randomization. Change from Baseline was calculated/defined as value at the indicated visit minus value at the Baseline. A negative value of change in score from Baseline indicated improvement in severity of symptoms. If participants discontinued before or on Day 5, then the clinical scoring index collected at the early withdrawal visit was included in the Visit 2. Otherwise, the clinical scoring index collected at the early withdrawal visit was included in the Visit 3</description>

        <description>PEF is the maximum flow generated during a forceful exhalation, starting from full lung inflation. Participants (if needed with the help of parents or guardian) recorded on diary card the best of three PEF measurements, using a mini-Wright peak flow meter in the morning before taking any study drug. Only data that was drawn from Days 2 to 8 after randomization and on or before one day after the end date of study drug was used for analysis. The outcome measure was considered missing if less than 2 days were recorded in the given treatment assessment period. Two participants from fluticasone propionate group and 4 participants from prednisone group had the missing outcome measure. Analysis was performed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with effects due to gender, age, centre and treatment group.</description>

          <title>Mean Evening PEF on Diary Card Over the Treatment Assessment Period</title>
          <description>PEF is the maximum flow generated during a forceful exhalation, starting from full lung inflation. Participants recorded on diary card the best of three PEF measurements, using a mini-Wright peak flow meter in the evening (6:00-9:00 post meridiem [PM]) before taking any study drug. Only data that was drawn from Days 1/2 to 8 after randomization and before or on the end date of study drug was used for analysis. If participants started to take the study drug in the morning (early or on 12:00 PM), only then the evening PEF on the date of randomization was used. The outcome measure was considered missing if less than 2 days was recorded in the given treatment assessment period. Two participants from fluticasone propionate group and 5 participants from prednisone group had the missing outcome measure. Analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with effects due to gender, age, centre and treatment group.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Scoring Index at Day 5 and Day 8</title>
        <description>The clinical scoring index was assessed at Baseline (Visit 1), Day 5 and Day 8. The score assigned represented the sum of the score for each of four signs: respiratory rate, wheezing, inspiration/expiration ratio, and accessory muscle use. Each of these parameters were scored on a 4-point scale of 0 to 3 where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe. The total score ranged from 0 to 12, where 0 indicated absence of symptoms and 12 indicated most severe symptoms. The Baseline value was the last non-missing value prior to randomization. Change from Baseline was calculated/defined as value at the indicated visit minus value at the Baseline. A negative value of change in score from Baseline indicated improvement in severity of symptoms. If participants discontinued before or on Day 5, then the clinical scoring index collected at the early withdrawal visit was included in the Visit 2. Otherwise, the clinical scoring index collected at the early withdrawal visit was included in the Visit 3</description>
