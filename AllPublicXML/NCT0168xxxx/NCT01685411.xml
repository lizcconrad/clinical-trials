    <textblock>
      This is a treatment guideline to allow routine clinical data to be collected and maintained
      in Oncore (clinical database) and the University of Minnesota Blood and Marrow Database as
      part of the historical database maintained by the department.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm trial to evaluate the efficacy of busulfan and cyclophosphamide followed
      by an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in the treatment of hematological
      malignancies. The intent of this study is to provide a protocol that will use unmanipulated
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells from related and unrelated donors after a common
      preparative regimen. Results will be compared to historical controls.
