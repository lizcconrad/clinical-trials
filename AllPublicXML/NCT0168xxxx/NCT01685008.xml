             Exception:

             For patients with MCL only, patients with nonmeasurable disease but evaluable sites

             exhibited a full haematological recovery

          6. discontinued previous monoclonal antibody therapy (except rituximab) or
             radioimmunotherapy administration for at least 60 days before study drug
             administration.

          7. off rituximab for at least 14 days before the screening visit and be confirmed to have
             either no response or have disease progression after rituximab treatment.

          8. Patients with DLBCL had a positive [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission
