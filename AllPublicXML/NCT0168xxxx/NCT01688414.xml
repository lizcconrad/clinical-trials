    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies imaging during surgery in diagnosing patients with
      prostate, bladder, or kidney cancer. New diagnostic imaging procedures, may find prostate,
      bladder, or kidney cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the ability of fluorescent imaging
      and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in a clinical setting to distinguish benign from malignant
      tissue.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To qualitatively determine the possible benefit of PAI and fluorescent imaging over
      traditional white light imaging.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo fluorescence imaging and PAI during robot assisted laparoscopic surgery.

    <description>The average lesion signal intensity on PAI and fluorescent imaging will be tested against the histology at pathological examination of the tissue sample. The distribution of signal intensity on PAI will be graphed as boxplot.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a pathologic confirmation of prostate cancer, bladder cancer, or
             kidney cancer based on previous biopsies or procedures OR a strong concern for a
             kidney malignancy based on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI) imaging

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a surgical history or anatomic variant that would preclude robot
             assisted laparoscopic approaches to their surgery (i.e. history of ventral hernia
             repair with mesh)

          -  Patients with medical co-morbidities who cannot tolerate laparoscopic surgery
             secondary to intra-abdominal carbon dioxide insufflation

             baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL
