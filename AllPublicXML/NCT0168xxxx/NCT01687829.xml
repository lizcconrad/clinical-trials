  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since Kelly and Wendel first reported successful closure of idiopathic macular holes (MH) by
      vitrectomy in 1991, many surgical modifications have been made to improve the anatomical and
      visual outcomes of this surgery. Recently, internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling has
      become used widely as an adjunctive procedure during MH surgery because the removal of ILM is
      thought to reduce the tangential traction on the macula, a major factor in the pathogenesis
      of idiopathic macular holes. However, the role of ILM peeling in macular hole surgery is not
      yet well defined. To the best of our knowledge, there is no meta-analysis on comparison of
      the efficacy of ILM peeling and suture for MH surgery. This study reviewed the published
      literature comparing surgical results with and without ILM peeling and and performed a
      meta-analysis to determine whether there is any benefit or detriment anatomically and/or
      visually.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible participants are those with idiopathic FTMH in stages 2-3, of less or equal
             than 18 months duration (based on symptoms reported by the patient) and with a visual
             acuity equal to or worse than 20/40 in the study eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with idiopathic FTMH stages 2-3 but longer than 18 months duration or with
             other causes of decreased vision (e.g. corneal scarring, age-related macular
             degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma if central and/or paracentral absolute
             visual field defects are present) and

          -  Those with FTMH related to high myopia (&gt; 6 dioptres) or trauma will be excluded from
             the study.
