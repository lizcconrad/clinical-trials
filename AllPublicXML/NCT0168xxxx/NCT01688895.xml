  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The initial objective of this protocol is to assemble a well-documented group of patients
      with confirmed diagnoses of the erythropoietic protoporphyrias, including autosomal recessive
      Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP) and X-Linked Protoporphyria (XLP) for clinical,
      biochemical, and genetic studies. The long-term objectives are (1) to conduct a longitudinal
      investigation of the natural history, complications, and therapeutic outcomes in people with
      erythropoietic protoporphyria, (2) to systematically investigate the psychological effects of
      the erythropoietic protoporphyrias on children and adults, and (3) to investigate the
      correlation between the identified genotypes and the resulting clinical presentation, also
      determining the possible interaction of other genetic markers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The porphyrias are a group of rare metabolic diseases that may present in childhood or adult
      life and are due to deficiencies of enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway. The most common
      manifestations are related to accumulation of intermediates in the pathway and usually occur
      as acute neurological attacks (as in the acute or hepatic porphyrias), or cutaneous
      photosensitivity (as in the cutaneous porphyrias, including the erythropoietic
      protoporphyrias). Multiple mutations have been identified in each of the porphyrias
      [Anderson, 2001]. The risk of disability or death from these disorders is significant, in
      part because diagnosis is often delayed due to lack of adoption of diagnostic testing in
      clinical practice. Moreover, the natural history of these disorders is not well described and
      it is not known what determines differences in outcomes. New therapies are needed. For
      existing therapies, high-quality evidence on short and long term efficacy and safety is
      generally lacking [Sood 2008]. Therefore, the purpose of this study of a large group of
      patients with EPP and XLP is to provide a better understanding of the natural history of
      these disorders, as affected by available therapies, and to aid in developing new forms of
      treatment. Much of the data collected on subjects as participants in the Longitudinal Study
      of the Porphyrias will be accessed for this study specific to the investigation of the
      erythropoietic protoporphyrias. To maximize the information that can be informative in our
      objectives, additional data will be collected, including additional biochemical findings and
      EPP-specific psychosocial parameters.

      The Office of Rare Diseases (ORD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) established a
      Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) in collaboration with other NIH Institutes
      and currently has funded 19 rare diseases clinical research consortia and one Data Management
      and Coordinating Center. The Porphyrias Consortium was created as part of the RDCRN, to study
      the human porphyrias. The Porphyrias Consortium is a consortium of the academic institutions
      listed in the participating institutions table. All Centers in the Porphyrias Consortium are
      participating in this study. Additional centers may be added if funding is available.
