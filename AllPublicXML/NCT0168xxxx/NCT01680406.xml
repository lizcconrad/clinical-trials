      The investigators hypothesize that the addition of primaquine (PQ) to both
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and chloroquine (CQ) for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax
      infection will result in decreased chance of relapse by about 60%.

      The investigators plan to assess the therapeutic efficacy of AL compared to combined AL + PQ
      and CQ compared to combined CQ + PQ against P. vivax infection. They also plan to determine
      the number of recurrent vivax episodes in patients receiving PQ compared to those who don't
      receive PQ. Patients aged above 1 year with symptomatic malaria presenting to health centers
      will be enrolled for treatment with AL, AL+PQ, CQ, or CQ+PQ for P. vivax infection.

      Phase 1 of the study will monitor the clinical, parasitological, and hematological parameters
      for P. vivax infection over a 42-day follow-up period, which will be used to evaluate drug
      efficacy. Phase 2 will continue monthly follow-up of these patients for one year to assess
      frequency of recurring vivax infections. Results from this research study will be used to
      assist Ethiopia in assessing their current national malaria drug policies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following the rapid development of significant drug resistance of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)
      to chloroquine and then sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, artemether- lumefantrine (Coartem or AL)
      was adopted as first line therapy in Ethiopia in 2004. According to the current national
      malaria diagnosis and treatment guidelines updated in 2012, first-line treatment for
      uncomplicated P. falciparum infection is AL. First-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax (Pv)
      is chloroquine (CQ) alone in malarious areas and with primaquine in non-malarious areas at
      health center and hospital level. WHO recommends treatment of Pv with CQ or an
      artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in combination with primaquine. For all clinical
      infection without laboratory confirmation, AL is the first-line treatment since AL is
      effective against both Pf and Pv. Thus, in Ethiopia, where treatment for malaria without
      laboratory confirmation occurs frequently, Pv is often treated with AL as the standard of
      care. Similarly, the recommended drug for mixed infection with Pf and Pv is AL. Now with
      wide-spread use of AL and CQ and with evidence that malaria laboratory testing is occurring
      in about half of those suspected with clinical evidence of malaria infection, the
      investigators propose to conduct an antimalarial efficacy study to monitor the effectiveness
      of these therapies in Ethiopia and to determine how efficacious these drugs remain for Pv. In
      addition, with high rates of relapse with P. vivax infection, the efficacy and safety of
      co-administering primaquine will be assessed. This information will inform future policy
      changes with respect to appropriate antimalarial strategies.
