  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamic changes of the tongue in patients with
      obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) during sleep and while awake by using
      Ultrafast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (UMRI)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UMRI was undertaken on the upper airway in 21 OSAHS patients and 20 normal people after being
      deprived of sleep for one night. A series of midline sagittal images of the upper airway were
      obtained. The dynamic alterations of the tongue size and the distance from the tongue to X
      axis (an extended line from the anterior nasal spine to posterior nasal spine) and Y axis (a
      perpendicular line from the center of the pituitary to the X axis) were measured.Statistical
      comparisons between pairs of means were performed via t-tests using Spss10 software. A
      probability level of p&lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

    <description>MRI was performed with a 1.5 superconducting magnet (Gyroscan Intera type, Philips Co. Holland) in a posterior and anterior neck coil. The sequence used to perform the ultrafast MRI was a fast gradient- echo plus sequence. Technical parameters included: echo time, 12 msec; repetition time, 2.3 msec; flap angle, 250; matrix, 192 × 512; section thickness, 7 mm. The imaging time per slice for this sequence was 0.92 sec. A total of 120 consecutive images were obtained as a single section, with a total imaging time of 110.4 seconds. MRI scanning was carried out with the subject first asleep, then whilst awake after 20 minutes in quiet respiration. All images were inputted to the PACS workstation.</description>
