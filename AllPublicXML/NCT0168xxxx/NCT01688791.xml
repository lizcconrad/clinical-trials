    <textblock>
      This trial will be conducted in three parts. Part A is a dose escalation trial followed by a
      dose confirmation trial in folate receptor (FR) 100% endometrial cancer participants. The
      primary hypothesis of this trial is that administration of vintafolide in combination with
      carboplatin and paclitaxel is safe and tolerable. Part B is a single dose, dose escalation,
      pharmacokinetic (PK), and QTc interval trial. The primary objectives include determination of
      the maximum single tolerated dose of vintafolide and to evaluate the effect of this single
      maximum dose on the QTc interval. Part C is a weekly dose escalation trial of vintafolide
      followed by a dose confirmation. The primary hypothesis of this part is that weekly
      vintafolide has acceptable safety and tolerability in participants with advanced cancers.
