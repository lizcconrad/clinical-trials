      Sleep investigation in respirator treated ICU patients: the importance of intensive
      environment.

      Sleep disturbances in the ICU seem to lead to development of delirium, prolonged ICU stay and
      increased mortality.

      The hypothesis of this study is: minimizing of disturbing factors in the ICU, such as noise,
      light, therapeutic and diagnostic procedures between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. will improve sleep
      quality in respirator treated ICU patients.

      Methods: randomized interventional study. 48-hour polysomnographic sleep measurement acc.
      AASM's standard in 46 awake respirator treated patients: 24 hours under ordinary
      circumstances and 24 hours under the protocol 'Quiet in the room' between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
      after randomization.
