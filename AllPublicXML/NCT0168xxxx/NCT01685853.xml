  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is intended to evaluate the effectiveness, tolerability, compliance, and
      feasibility of the low volume bowel preparation, bisacodyl tablets followed by 2L
      Polyethylene glycol (PEG) with citrate and simethicone (CS) given the same day of
      colonoscopy, vs the standard 4L split PEG solution.

      Eligible patients will be informed about the aims, procedures, benefits and possible risks of
      the study prior to sign the informed consent form from day -30 to day-3. They will provide
      medical history and undergo a physical examination. Patients will be evaluated by a Physician
      other than the blind Endoscopist. The same responsible person will instruct the patients
      about administration procedures in both oral and written form. The patients will be assigned
      to receive one of the dosing schedule bowel preparation according to a computer generated
      block-randomisation list. Patients will take the study treatment at home according to the
      given instructions. Patients will return to the clinic for colonoscopy. The colonoscopy will
      be performed by an Endoscopist who will be unaware of the bowel dose-regimen preparation
      taken by the patient. Completed colonoscopic exam will be performed with time recorded
      (intubation and withdrawal from ceacum). The unblind Investigator will ask the patients about
      safety, tolerability, overall acceptance and compliance.
