  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a chronic progressive neurological disorder. Symptoms are tremor,
      slowness in movement, rigidity and postural instability. As the disease progresses and
      treatment with L-dopa is no longer sufficient, some patients may be treated with deep brain
      stimulation.

      When treated with deep brain stimulation, electrodes are inserted in the affected area of the
      brain and through stimulation, motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are significantly
      reduced.

      During the first year of DBS treatment patients and spouses may experience changes in
      everyday life and illness trajectory posing new opportunities as well as new challenges.

      The purpose of the study is to develop an individualised and targeted nursing program to
      support patients and relatives manage changes and challenges in life the first three months
      after Deep Brain Stimulation. The intervention is expected to generate important knowledge
      that will serve as a foundation for the further development of a future nursing program.

      The intervention is designed as a psychosocial intervention, targeted both patients and
      spouses.

      The intervention consists of individually targeted meetings with a specialized DBS nurse
      several times during the first six months og DBS. Patients and spouses likewise have to fill
      out a diary for use in the meetings.

      All meetings have specific topics, addressing aspects of challenges in adjusting to DBS, and
      the aim is to off patients and spouses a tailored intervention, supporting each individual
      based on an individual assessment.
