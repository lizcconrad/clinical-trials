  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity, which afflicts ~65% of the U.S. population and more than 1 billion
      people worldwide, increases the risk of developing hypertension. Activation of the renin
      angiotensin system (RAS) is an important mechanism by which obesity leads to hypertension. In
      addition to its vasoconstricting and sodium retaining actions, angiotensin II also has potent
      pro-inflammatory actions including macrophage infiltration and expression of proinflammatory
      cytokines in target tissues. Adipose tissue and skeletal muscle appear to be a key sites for
      the generation of proinflammatory cytokines. Although angiotensin II receptor blockade
      reduces inflammation in many tissues, the effects on adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in
      humans are not clear. Importantly, the chronic low grade inflammatory state that accompanies
      obesity complicates hypertension by contributing to insulin resistance and accelerating
      cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the general aim of the present proposal will be to
      determine the influence of angiotensin II receptor blockade on adipose tissue and skeletal
      muscle inflammation and its relation to improvements in insulin sensitivity, if observed, in
      obese hypertensive humans. To address these aims, 44 obese (BMI&gt;30 kg/m2) hypertensive
      (BP&gt;140 systolic and/or 90 diastolic) individuals (age=50-65 years) will be randomized to
      receive 8 weeks of either the angiotensin II receptor antagonist, olmesartan medoxomil, or no
      treatment in a crossover manner. Subcutaneous adipose tissue and skeletal muscle biopsies
      will be obtained and insulin sensitivity (intravenous glucose tolerance tests) will be
      assessed at baseline and following 8 weeks of each intervention. A two week washout period
      will separate the interventions.

    <measure>Insulin Sensitivity by Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Testing (Change Over Time)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline testing to post-testing after 8-week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Data collected from the intravenous glucose tolerance tests included blood concentrations of glucose and insulin. Glucose was measured immediately on a YSI glucose analyzer and insulin was measured via ELISA colormetric kits once all study samples were collected. To analyze changes in insulin sensitivity, the MINMOD software was used. The MINMOD software uses Bergman's minimal model to determine insulin sensitivity during an intravenous glucose tolerance test. Both glucose and insulin values were inserted at each timepoint collected (33 in total over the 3-hour protocol) and the software was run to generate the insulin sensitivity value at baseline and post-test. This information was then used to calculate the change of insulin sensitivity from baseline to post-testing after each 8-week intervention.</description>

    <description>RNA extraction and quantification were determined using an RNeasy Mini Fibrous Kit and DNase I treatment (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) in accordance to the manufacturer's directions for mRNA extraction. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) measured the expression of collagen III using an ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System instrument and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Relative gene expression levels were determined using the number of cycles necessary to reach threshold and results were normalized to cyclophilin B RNA levels.</description>

Subjects receive additional daily doses of 40 mg olmesartan for the remainder of the study period (6 weeks). The dose remains at 20 mg per day, however, if BP falls below 110/70 during the first 2 weeks. In addition, subjects will continue taking the drug during the 2-week follow-up testing period.

        <title>Insulin Sensitivity by Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Testing (Change Over Time)</title>
        <description>Data collected from the intravenous glucose tolerance tests included blood concentrations of glucose and insulin. Glucose was measured immediately on a YSI glucose analyzer and insulin was measured via ELISA colormetric kits once all study samples were collected. To analyze changes in insulin sensitivity, the MINMOD software was used. The MINMOD software uses Bergman's minimal model to determine insulin sensitivity during an intravenous glucose tolerance test. Both glucose and insulin values were inserted at each timepoint collected (33 in total over the 3-hour protocol) and the software was run to generate the insulin sensitivity value at baseline and post-test. This information was then used to calculate the change of insulin sensitivity from baseline to post-testing after each 8-week intervention.</description>

        <population>Results of insulin sensitivity by intravenous glucose tolerance (IVGTT) testing are reported per intervention (Olmesartan Medoxomil and No drug). Only 10 of the 16 study participants who participated in all or some of the study measurements opted to complete or had sufficient data to analyze for each pre- and post-intervention (4 total) IVGTT.</population>

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) measured the expression of collagen III using an ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System instrument and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

          <description>Subjects will be provided with daily 20 mg of olmesartan for the first 2 weeks during the 8-week intervention. Subjects receive additional daily doses of 40 mg olmesartan for the remainder of the study period. The dose remains at 20 mg per day, however, if BP falls below 110/70 during the first 2 weeks, subjects will continue taking the drug during the 2-week follow-up period.
