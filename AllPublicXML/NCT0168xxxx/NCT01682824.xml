  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn more about eating practices of survivors of
      childhood Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors (including brain and spinal cord tumors).

      Recent research shows that childhood cancer survivors are experiencing many health issues
      months or even years after active cancer treatment (for example, irregular blood sugar
      levels, overweight/obesity, and heart disease). To address this growing concern, researchers
      at MD Anderson Children's Cancer Hospital and Texas Children's Cancer Center have joined
      forces to learn more about how to design a program that would promote healthy lifestyles
      among survivors of childhood cancer.

      A one-time assessment will be conducted for all participants through the Assessment Center
      website. No treatment or intervention will be provided. Two websites will be set up (Site A
      and Site B). The only difference between the two sites is the order that the questions will
      appear. The actual questions will remain the same. Only the adolescent and young adult (AYA)
      survivors of CNS tumors eligible after screening will be invited to respond to the survey.
      Following the final screening, the eligible participants will be randomized to Site A or Site
      B.

      Each participant will complete the web-based questionnaire that has a total of 53 questions.
      For site A, the order of the questions will be TFEQ-R18v2, multifactor screener, and EQ-EMA.
      For site B, the order of the questions will be EQ-EMA, multifactor screener, and TFEQ-R18v2.
      The 53 questions came from the original TFEQ-R18v2, the multifactor screener used in the
      National Cancer Institute's Observing Protein and Energy Nutrition Study, and the adapted
      TFEQ-R18v2 for use via EMA methodology.

      Multifactor screener is a short assessment tool used to evaluate dietary intake of fruits,
      vegetables, percentage of energy from fat, and fiber.

      Eating Questionnaire-EMA (EQ-EMA) was adapted based on the original TFEQ-R18v2 for use via
      EMA methodology. The changes made were related to a change in verbiage to reflect our goal of
      assessing a participant's current behavior before and after an eating episode.

        Adolescent and young adult (AYA) males and females (15 to 39 years old) who survived
        childhood CNS tumors from MD Anderson Cancer Center, Texas Children's Cancer Center, and
        Web sources.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adolescent or Young Adult (AYA), 15 to 39 years old who has survived a primary CNS
             tumor

          2. Has been off therapy without relapse for at least 6 months

          3. Able to speak, write, and read in English

          4. Has access to the internet

          5. Has telephone access

          6. Currently lives in the United States

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is in foster care

          2. Is experiencing severe cognitive impairments that do not allow them to engage in basic
             conversations [We are excluding individuals who may experience severe cognitive
             impairments because participants will need to provide assent (if &lt;18 years old) or
             consent (if &gt;=18 years old) and will need to have the ability to independently
             complete the TFEQ-R18v2, Multifactor screener, and EQ-EMA. Through the phone screening
             conducted by the MDACC graduate research assistant (GRA), a person is determined to
             not be severely cognitive impaired if the participant is able to respond to basic
             questions such as their age, whether or not they have internet access, and telephone.]

          3. Is incarcerated at the time of enrollment.
