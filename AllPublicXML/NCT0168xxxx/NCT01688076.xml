    <textblock>
      This cross-over design study will evaluate the onset of action, efficacy, and duration of
      botulinum toxin A treatment on forehead/glabellar rhytid complexes with and without
      subsequent muscle contraction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this cross-over design study, the investigators will evaluate whether active muscle
      contraction following Botox® injection of the forehead/glabellar rhytid complex will impact
      the onset of action, efficacy, and duration of Botox® treatment.

    <description>A single dermatologist will rate each photograph of the subject's forehead/glabellar rhytid complex at baseline, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 7 days, 2 weeks, 7 months and 1 day, 7 months and 2 days, 7 months and 3 days, 7 months and 4 days, 7 months and 7 days, and 7 months and 2 weeks. A glabellar wrinkle score and a forehead wrinkle score will be assigned to each photograph. The dermatologist will not know at what point in time the photographs were taken.</description>
