  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the change of medication satisfaction measured by
      Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) from baseline to endpoint for patients who are
      switched into paliperidone palmitate, either immediately or in a delayed mode.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective (patients are first identified and then followed forward as time
      passes), multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), randomized (the study medication is
      assigned by chance), comparative and open-labeled (all people know the identity of the
      intervention) study.

      The study mainly consists of 3 phases including, the screening phase (14 days before
      administration of study medication), treatment phase, and the follow-up phase (28 days after
      the last dose of the study medication). In the treatment phase, patients will be randomly
      assigned equally in 2 groups (Group 1 and Group 2), on the basis of known and unknown
      characteristics. Group 1 (immediate switch group): Patients will be administered with
      paliperidone palmitate immediately after randomization and will continue throughout the
      treatment phase. Group 2 (delayed switch group): Patients will remain on current oral
      antipsychotics until Week 8, and later on will be completely switched to paliperidone
      palmitate. However, during the first 8 weeks if the symptoms or satisfaction with MSQ further
      deteriorates for Group 2, they may be switched into paliperidone palmitate earlier.

      Safety evaluations will include evaluation of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,
      electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination and these will be monitored
      throughout the study.

      The total duration of the study will be approximately 148 days.

    <description>MSQ is designed to assess treatment satisfaction among patients with schizophrenia. The responses will be assessed on a 7-point Likert-type scale rated as follows: 1=extremely dissatisfied, 2=very dissatisfied, 3=somewhat dissatisfied, 4=neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 5=somewhat satisfied, 6=very satisfied, and 7=extremely satisfied.</description>

    <time_frame>Screening, baseline, Week 1, Week 5, Week 8, Week 9, Week 13, Week 17, and Week 21</time_frame>
    <description>The TSQM is a 14-item subject assessed evaluation of treatment medication using a 7-point Likert-type scale rated as follows: 1=Extremely Dissatisfied, 2=Very Dissatisfied, 3=Somewhat Dissatisfied, 4=Neither Satisfied Nor Dissatisfied, 5=Somewhat Satisfied, 6=Very Satisfied, 7= Extremely Satisfied.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to Week 21 in scores of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, and Week 21</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia. The neuropsychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia will be assessed using the 30-item PANSS scale. Each item is rated as follows: 1=absent, 2=Minimal, 3=Mild, 4=Moderate, 5=Moderate Severe, 6=Severe, and 7=Extreme.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to Week 21 in scores of Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, Week 5, Week 8, Week 9, Week 13, Week 17, and Week 21</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is used to rate the severity of a patient's psychotic condition on a 7-point scale. It is rated as follows: 1=Normal, not at all ill, 2=Borderline mentally ill, 3=Mildly ill, 4=Moderately ill, 5=Markedly ill, 6=Severely ill, and 7=Among the most extremely ill.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to Week 21 in scores of Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, and Week 21</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP is a clinician rated instrument providing an overall rating of personal and social functioning in patients with schizophrenia on a scale of 1-100. The scale defines a continuum from grossly impaired functioning, in which total lack of autonomy in basic functioning and survival risk is evident, to excellent functioning. Four domains of functioning are considered in the rating: 1) socially useful activities, including work and study, 2) personal and social relationships, 3) self-care, and 4) disturbing and aggressive behavior.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score of Mediation Adherence Rating Scale (MARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The MARS is a 10-items self-rating scale to measure the adherence of the drug medication for psychosis. Each item is answered &quot;yes/no&quot; and the total score ranges from 0 points (Low medication adherence) to 10 points (High medication adherence).</description>
