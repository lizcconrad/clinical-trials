      This study will examine symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in people before and
      after psychotherapy with 25 mg followed two hours later by 12.5 mg or 125 mg followed two
      hours later by 62.5 mg methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in order to see if this treatment
      is safe and can help reduce PTSD symptoms. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      the two doses of MDMA given in two sessions scheduled three to five weeks apart. They will
      prepare for the sessions before the first one and they will work with psychotherapists in
      conventional (non-drug assisted) psychotherapy afterwards. Symptoms of PTSD and depression,
      sleep quality and general psychological health will be measured at the start of the study and
      2 and 12 months after the second session.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder that develops after people
      undergo a traumatic event, such as a rape, car accident or other life-threatening event. PTSD
      is a worldwide health problem. Psychotherapy or drugs are used to treat PTSD, but there is an
      interest in developing other treatment options. 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
      (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy is one potential treatment. MDMA is known as the active
      ingredient in &quot;ecstasy.&quot; It was used along with psychotherapy to treat people in the past,
      and a study suggests that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy might help people with PTSD.

      This Phase 2 research study will investigate the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted
      psychotherapy in 10 people with chronic, treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). After open-label lead-in in two subjects there will be a randomized, double-blind arm
      comparing 125 vs. 25 mg MDMA in eight participants, and an open-label arm for participants
      who received active placebo.

      In this study, five people will be randomly assigned to receive the full dose of 125 and 62.5
      mg MDMA and three will be randomized to receive the active placebo dose of 25 and 125. mg
      MDMA. MDMA will be administered during two six to eight hour long experimental sessions
      scheduled three to five weeks apart. Study subjects will have a medical and psychiatric
      examination and a measure of their PTSD symptoms to make sure they meet the criteria to be in
      the study. Subjects must be in good physical health. They will also complete questionnaires
      about their PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality. These tests will be
      given by a researcher who will not be present during any of the therapy sessions. This same
      researcher will give the subject the same tests or measures two months after the second
      experimental session and 12 months after a final experimental session.

      Once enrolled, subjects will have three preparatory sessions with a team of two therapists,
      one male and one female. The same team of therapists will work with them throughout the
      entire study. The subject will learn more about MDMA-assisted psychotherapy and the
      therapists will learn more about the subject's goals, hopes and fears. Starting from the
      second preparatory session, subjects will answer questions on thoughts about hurting or
      killing themselves; these questions will be asked during face to face contact this and on two
      of the contact days, which may occur over the telephone. Subjects will have to stop taking
      their psychiatric medication before they have their first experimental session, with exact
      times dependent upon the specific medications involved.

      Both therapists will be present for each experimental session. During experimental sessions,
      subjects will be encouraged to confront trauma-related thoughts, feelings and memories. Blood
      pressure, heart rate (pulse) and body temperature will be measured regularly, and the
      researchers will periodically ask the subject to rate his or her degree of distress. Subjects
      will stay overnight at the clinic and have their first integrative session, where they will
      examine what happened during their experimental session. They will have two more integrative
      sessions until they have their next experimental session. Subjects will fill out a
      questionnaire on their PTSD symptoms on every third integrative session. Two months after the
      second experimental session, subjects will answer questions or complete questionnaires about
      PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality, and one of the researchers will
      assess their general psychological function.

      Subjects and the therapists, but not the person measuring symptoms, will find out if the
      subject had the active placebo or full dose of MDMA at this time, and if the subject had the
      active placebo, they can start the second arm of the study. What happens during this arm is
      very similar to the arm except that the subject and therapists will know the subject is
      getting a full dose of MDMA.

      Twelve months after the subject's final follow-up visit (two months after their final
      experimental session), PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality will be
      assessed again, and subjects will complete an additional questionnaire about their
      experiences during and after the study.

      The study will compare PTSD symptoms before and after MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with a full
      dose and therapy with an active placebo dose of MDMA.
