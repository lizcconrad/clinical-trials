      The purpose of this research study is examine the response of the blood vessels in the eye to
      a light flicker stimulus using the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer (DVA) on two separate days in
      healthy individuals. The DVA uses an instrument which is used during routine eye
      examinations. The hypothesis of the study is that the changes in eye's blood vessel will be
      similar between the two visits; thus establishing reproducibility of the measurements for
      future comparisons to individuals with stroke or heart disease. In addition, this study will
      compare the eye's blood vessel responses to responses of the blood vessels in the arm using
      Doppler ultrasound.

      Retinal blood vessels have been suggested to be an index of the cerebral and coronary
      microvasculature function. Since the retinal vessels are not under direct sympathetic
      control, this vascular bed is an ideal location to examine local mechanisms of vascular
      regulation(i.e. metabolite/endothelial and myogenic). Based on previously published data on
      animal and human responses, the central purpose for the proposed research is to compare the
      retinal and brachial vasodilatation responses in healthy subjects using the Dynamic Vessel
      Analyzer (DVA). Our rationale for this proposal is to better understand retinal blood flow in
      healthy individuals, gain insight into vascular reactivity in different vascular beds, and
      lastly to establish standards and reproducibility of DVA Measurements.
