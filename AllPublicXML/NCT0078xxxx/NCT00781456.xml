    <measure>Percentage of Participants With ≥ 50% Reduction in Migraine Frequency During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (25-35 days before Day 1) and Days 1-91</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with at least 50% reduction in migraine frequency (average weekly number of migraine episodes) through the end of the 91-day treatment period compared with Baseline (the 25- to 35-day baseline qualification period). Participants recorded the incidence, timing and intensity of migraines in a migraine diary during the prequalification period and throughout the 91-day treatment period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With ≥ 50% Reduction in Migraine Frequency During the First, Second and Third Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month1, Month 2 and Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with at least 50% reduction in migraine frequency (average weekly number of migraine episodes) compared to Baseline at each month of the treatment period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average Migraine Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 1, Month 2 and Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Migraine severity was recorded by participants in the Baseline qualification diary and study migraine diary during the treatment period. Participants could report a severity of none (score = 0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). In general, if a headache was mild, daily activities could be resumed and little to no medication was taken. Moderate headaches required medication and effected daily activities. Severe headaches were debilitating and required medication.
Average migraine severity is defined as the sum of the severity ratings divided by the total number of migraine episodes reported during the observation period (for example, Baseline, First Month, Second Month, Third Month, and 91-Day Treatment Period). A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement in severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Required Rescue Medications During the Study Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 1, Month 2 and Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded use of rescue medications for migraines in the migraine diary during the course of study treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Migraine Disability Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The migraine disability assessment (MIDAS) test is used to determine how severely migraines affect a patient's life. Participants were asked five questions about how often their headaches limited their ability to go to work or school, to do household work or to do family or leisure activities in the past 3 months.
The MIDAS score equals the sum of the days answered for each question and ranges from 0 (no disability) to approximately 270 (severe disability; the upper bound is dependent on the number of days a participant would plan to work or participate in other activities).
The MIDAS score is classified into four grades of severity:
0 to 5: MIDAS Grade I, Little or no disability
6 to 10: MIDAS Grade II, Mild disability
11 to 20: MIDAS Grade III, Moderate disability
21+: MIDAS Grade IV, Severe disability</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Headache Impact Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The Headache Impact Test (HIT) is a tool used to measure the impact headaches have on patients' ability to function on the job, at school, at home and in social situations.
HIT-6 consists of 6 questions each scored on a scale from Never (6 points) to Always (13 points). The total score ranges from 36 to 78 with higher scores indicating greater impact on life.
There was an error in administration of the HIT-6 in this study. Question 6 was not administered, and question 3 from the MIDAS was included instead. Therefore, the total score of the HIT-6 could not be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment or clinical study.
The following definitions were used to assess AE severity: Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but they are easily tolerated; Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity; Severe: Incapacitating, with inability to perform usual activity.
Relationship to study drug was assessed as either: None: Causal relationship can be ruled out; Possibly: Causal relationship at least reasonably possible, i.e. relationship cannot be ruled out; Definitely: Causal relationship is certain.
A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that met any one of the following criteria:
Fatal or life threatening
Requires or prolongs in patient hospitalization
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Congenital anomaly / birth defect
Important medical event.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Migraine Severity</title>
        <description>Migraine severity was recorded by participants in the Baseline qualification diary and study migraine diary during the treatment period. Participants could report a severity of none (score = 0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). In general, if a headache was mild, daily activities could be resumed and little to no medication was taken. Moderate headaches required medication and effected daily activities. Severe headaches were debilitating and required medication.
Average migraine severity is defined as the sum of the severity ratings divided by the total number of migraine episodes reported during the observation period (for example, Baseline, First Month, Second Month, Third Month, and 91-Day Treatment Period). A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement in severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Migraine Disability Assessment</title>
        <description>The migraine disability assessment (MIDAS) test is used to determine how severely migraines affect a patient's life. Participants were asked five questions about how often their headaches limited their ability to go to work or school, to do household work or to do family or leisure activities in the past 3 months.
The MIDAS score equals the sum of the days answered for each question and ranges from 0 (no disability) to approximately 270 (severe disability; the upper bound is dependent on the number of days a participant would plan to work or participate in other activities).
The MIDAS score is classified into four grades of severity:
0 to 5: MIDAS Grade I, Little or no disability
6 to 10: MIDAS Grade II, Mild disability
11 to 20: MIDAS Grade III, Moderate disability
21+: MIDAS Grade IV, Severe disability</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Headache Impact Test</title>
        <description>The Headache Impact Test (HIT) is a tool used to measure the impact headaches have on patients' ability to function on the job, at school, at home and in social situations.
HIT-6 consists of 6 questions each scored on a scale from Never (6 points) to Always (13 points). The total score ranges from 36 to 78 with higher scores indicating greater impact on life.
There was an error in administration of the HIT-6 in this study. Question 6 was not administered, and question 3 from the MIDAS was included instead. Therefore, the total score of the HIT-6 could not be calculated.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment or clinical study.
The following definitions were used to assess AE severity: Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but they are easily tolerated; Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity; Severe: Incapacitating, with inability to perform usual activity.
Relationship to study drug was assessed as either: None: Causal relationship can be ruled out; Possibly: Causal relationship at least reasonably possible, i.e. relationship cannot be ruled out; Definitely: Causal relationship is certain.
A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that met any one of the following criteria:
Fatal or life threatening
Requires or prolongs in patient hospitalization
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Congenital anomaly / birth defect
Important medical event.</description>
