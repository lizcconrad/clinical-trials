  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a local anesthetic nerve block on
      markers of inflammation and pain after a sunburn. This is important because it may provide
      information regarding the way that nerve blocks help with the treatment of pain and in
      particular provide preemptive analgesia.
