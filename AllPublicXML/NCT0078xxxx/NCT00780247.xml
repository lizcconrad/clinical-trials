  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is a common problem. The principal source of vitamin D for humans is
      solar exposure, with cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D by photoconversion of
      7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to pre-vitamin D3. Latitude, altitude, season, skin
      pigmentation, and age are recognized factors that influence how much vitamin D can be made by
      solar exposure. However, the relative influences of each are largely unknown and we cannot
      reliably answer the question of how much sun exposure an individual needs at various
      latitudes and at various seasons in order to ensure normal vitamin D status.

      Purpose of the study: To determine the effect of environmental influences on Vitamin D
      status.

      Specific Aims

        1. To measure the prevailing 25D and Vitamin D levels in communities at diverse latitudes
           (Alaska and Hawaii).

        2. To collect information on variables that influence Vitamin D status such as skin color,
           history of sun exposure and sunscreen use, diet history, vitamin and calcium supplements
           used, and BMI.

        3. To collect typical food samples from the region for future analysis of their Vitamin D
           and 25D content.

        4. To collect a blood sample for DNA analysis of inter-individual differences in Vitamin D
           metabolism (Gc or Vitamin D binding protein alleles).

        Age of Subjects: The subjects will be between ages 18-60. The upper age is limited to age
        60 as aging skin is less able to make vitamin D, therefore a separate study of elderly
        people would be more appropriate.

        Racial and Ethnic Origin: Both sites have a diverse ethnic and racial population and the
        subjects will be as representative of the population as possible.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to consent and come for a study visit. Male or female males and females ages
             18-60.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to consent or come to a visit, taking Vitamin D supplements, anticonvulsants,
             barbiturates, steroids, having granulomatous disease, or liver or kidney disease as
             these medications and conditions interfere with Vitamin D metabolism.
