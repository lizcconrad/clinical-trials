  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Image-guided surgery essentially describes the interactive use of medical images during a
      surgical procedure and is often referred to as a &quot;global positioning&quot; system (GPS) for
      surgery.

    <textblock>
      In an automobile GPS, the current position of a vehicle is accurately localized or
      &quot;registered&quot; onto an electronic roadmap located on the dashboard. As the automobile moves,
      its position is updated on this roadmap. The driver can use the GPS as a guide to determine
      where the vehicle has been and where it is headed. This same concept is applied during
      image-guided surgery, as the current surgical position of instruments in the operating room
      is registered onto medical images of the patient acquired preoperatively. These images are
      used as a guide by the surgeon for more accurate localization of tumors and other surrounding
      anatomic structures. This clinical trial is designed to determine the effectiveness of using
      image-guided techniques for the treatment of liver tumors.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent must be obtained.

          2. Patient must be 18 years or older.

          3. Patients recruited are male or non-pregnant, non-lactating females. Liver resection or
             ablation could be harmful to an unborn child, and therefore is not recommended during
             pregnancy. All consented patients of childbearing potential will be advised to use
             adequate birth control (oral, implanted, or barrier methods), along with their sexual
             partners, while being considered for liver tumor resection or ablation and one month
             following surgery.

          4. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test result at screening in women of childbearing
             potential (applies to patients without documented menopause or sterility).

          5. Patients enrolled must be candidates for surgical liver resection of liver cancer
             (primary or metastatic) or benign liver lesions (hemangioma, Focal Nodular
             Hyperplasia, Adenoma). Liver cancer must be present on preoperative imaging study (CT
             and/or MRI), if applicable.

          6. Patient must be scheduled for surgical treatment of the liver cancer requiring the
             removal of at least one (1) anatomic segment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any condition which, in the judgment of the clinical investigator or his designee,
             might increase the risk to the subject or decrease the chance of obtaining
             satisfactory data to achieve the objectives of the study.

          2. Patients that have a mental condition rendering them unable to understand informed
             consent to the nature, scope, and possible consequences of this study.

          3. Patients requiring surgical intervention that extends beyond the liver, with the
             exception that extension into some adjacent structures might be allowed unless the
             liver is not the primary focus of the surgery AND the potential blood loss from the
             other surgical sites may jeopardize the safety of the patient. There is no absolute
             rule as to what adjacent structures would be allowed, thus prior approval must be
             obtained from the Medical Monitor listed above for all extrahepatobiliary surgery.

          4. Patients with hereditary hematologic/coagulation disorders unrelated to their liver
             disease.

          5. Patients with cirrhosis of the liver classified as Child's B or C. (See Appendix A)

          6. Use of aspirin within 7 days prior to surgery or antiplatelet agents (i.e., Plavix)
             within 10 days prior to surgery or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications within
             48 hours prior to surgery.

          7. Patients with thrombocytopenia (platelet counts below 100,000 per ml, White Count 3.0,
             Hemoglobin 10 or greater).

          8. Patients who are currently (within the last 30 days prior to surgery) participating in
             another clinical trial with any investigational drug or device.

          9. Patients undergoing liver surgery as a result of trauma.

         10. Patients undergoing liver surgery for the purpose of receiving a liver transplant.

         11. Patients undergoing liver surgery in which there is a single minor wedge resection on
             the surface of the liver.

         12. Patients with established renal insufficiency (defined as creatinine greater than 2.5
             mg/dl), or a condition that requires hemodialysis.
