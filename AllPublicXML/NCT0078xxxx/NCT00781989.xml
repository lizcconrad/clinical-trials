  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study designed to look at ultrasound images of the joint
      at baseline and over time, and investigate whether there is a correlation between ultrasound
      images and progression of disease. The researchers wish also to see if ultrasound can be used
      as a tool to predict progression of Rheumatoid Arthritis in patients with early disease who
      have not taken biologics therapy. In addition, the researchers wish to investigate whether
      peripheral blood &quot;biomarkers&quot;can be identified that predict the progression of erosive
      disease in early rheumatoid arthritis, with the intention of testing the most promising
      biomarkers in future clinical trials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female adults aged 18 years or greater.

          2. The subject has a diagnosis of RA according to the revised 1987 criteria of the
             American College of Rheumatology (ACR) with onset of symptomatology of less than 3
             years.

          3. The patient is seropositive for rheumatoid factor (IgM RF measured by agglutination
             assay) and / or anti−cyclic citrullinated peptides (measured by ELISA).

          4. The subject has provided signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission
             to the study

          5. The subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions
             and restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Past or present disease, which as judged by the investigator, may affect both the
             subject's participation in the study or outcome of the study. These diseases include
             but are not limited to, cardiovascular disease, malignancy, hepatic disease, renal
             disease, haematological disease, neurological disease, endocrine disease or pulmonary
             disease.

          2. Current or prior use of biologic drugs ( anti− tumour necrosis factor alpha drugs or
             rituximab)

          3. As a result of the medical interview, physical examination or screening
             investigations, the physician responsible considers the subject unfit for the study.

          4. The subject's RA does not have a clearly recordable time of onset (within a 6 month
             period) as determined by either the notes or from the history taken from the patient
             by the physician responsible
