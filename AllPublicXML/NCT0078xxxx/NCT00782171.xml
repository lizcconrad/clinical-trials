      modified surface in different loading protocols.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a post-market randomized study whereby each patient will receive 1 to 4
      implants placed in the posterior maxilla or mandible. The primary objective of this
      randomized open study is to evaluate the performance in immediate and delayed loading (4
      weeks) of Straumann standard solid screw 4.1mm and the 4.8 mm diameter wide neck implants
      with a new surface. These implants will support single crowns or 2 to 4 unit bridge
      restorations in the posterior maxilla or mandible and the treatment will be evaluated for the
      immediate and delayed loading procedures at one year post surgery. Patients will be allocated
      into two groups and then randomized into immediate or delayed loading arms.

          -  Bone surgery (bone grafts, guided tissue regeneration techniques for bone enhancement)
             prior to implant placement unless performed more than 6 months prior to implant
             placement and the site fully healed. Note: Minor bone enhancement using harvested bone
             from the implant site and a resorbable membrane is allowed at the time of implant
             placement

          -  Patients requiring bone grafting at the surgical sites at the time of surgery.
