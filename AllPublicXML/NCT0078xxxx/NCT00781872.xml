    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis is a multifocal inflammatory disease of the central nervous system which
      affects young individuals and causes paralysis of the limbs, sensation, visual and sphincter
      problems. The disease is caused by an autoimmune mechanism, ie the immune system produces
      antibodies and cells which attack the self myelin antigens, causing therefore demyelination.
      The disease is clinically evident with relapses of neurological disability due to the
      dysfunction of the areas (plaques of multiple sclerosis) in which damage of myelin occurs.
      Disability can accumulate with time and the disease enters a progressive phase due to damage
      of the axons and irreversible neurodegeneration. Although, effective immunotherapies exist
      which downregulate the autoimmune anti-myelin reactivity and reduce the rate of relapses of
      MS (like Copaxone and interferons), there is no effective means today to stop the progression
      of disability and induce rebuilding of the destroyed myelin (re-myelination). Neuronal stem
      cells were shown to possess the ability to restore neuronal activity and produce new neurons
      through transdifferentiation. Various other types of stem cells were tested in animal models
      with promising results, revealing a potential for restoration of the neurological function in
      neuroimmune and neurodegenerative conditions and in central nervous system traumatic injury.
      Adult bone marrow derived stromal cells (MSC) were shown to induce similar (to the neuronal
      stem cells) immunomodulatory and neuroregenerative effects and were shown in our laboratory
      to induce neuroprotection in the animal model of chronic experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis (EAE). These bone marrow derived MSCs offer practical advantages for
      clinical therapeutic applications, since they can be obtained from the adult bone marrow and
      therefore the patient can be the donor for himself, without any danger for rejection of the
      cells. In addition, MSCs carry a safer profile and are less prone to malignant
      transformation.

      Our initial clinical experience with 10 patients with ALS and 10 with multiple sclerosis show
      that intravenous and intrathecal administration of MSCs is feasible and safe.

      In this study we propose an explorative protocol with the injection of MSCs (both
      intrathecally and intravenously) in patients with MS, in an effort to prevent further
      neurodegeneration through neuroprotective mechanisms and induce neuroregeneration and
      restoration of neuronal function. This will be a phase I/II study.

      The primary endpoint will be to further evaluate the safety and feasibility of the treatment
      with MSC infusions, in MS patients. Additionally, the migration ability of the transplanted
      cells will be evaluated by tagging MSCs with the superparamagnetic iron oxide particle
      (Feridex) (an FDA approved cell tracking drug) for detection by MRI. MRI of the brain and
      spinal cord will be performed at weeks 1, 4, 12 and 24 to detect the migration of the stem
      cells. Clinically the patients will be followed by monthly evaluations of the MS functional
      rating scale (EDSS) scale. The MRI, will be also used to evaluate changes in the total volume
      of lesions in the brain and the degree of atrophy.

      Significance: Our center has performed the first clinical trial with intrathecal and
      intravenous injection of adult stem cells in MS and ALS patients and has gained experience
      during the last 3 years with this type of stem cells treatment. After having evaluated the
      safety and feasibility issues, we intent to proceed to the second stage, to evaluate the
      migration ability of those cells (their ability to reach the affected motor areas of the CNS
      gray matter, by tracking them with a paramagnetic material and visualize them by MRI), and
      evaluate indications of clinical efficacy. This project may provide information for possible
      therapeutic uses of this type of bone marrow adult stem cells in MS and ALS but may also
      serve as a pilot platform and pave the path for future applications of various types of stem
      cells in neurodegerative diseases in general.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Consenting patients fulfilling the Poser's clinical criteria for definite MS
