      This will be a descriptive study measuring the postâ€”void residual of patients in the third
      trimester and postpartum. Also, bladder scan values will be compared to the amount of urine
      obtained from a Foley catheter to determine the accuracy of the bladder scanner in the third
      trimester and postpartum.
