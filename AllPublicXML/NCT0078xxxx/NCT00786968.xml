  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-year extension study of the use of laronidase into the spinal fluid to treat
      spinal cord compression in mucopolysaccharidosis I. Mucopolysaccharidosis I is a rare genetic
      condition due to deficiency of the enzyme alpha-l-iduronidase. Spinal cord compression occurs
      in this condition due to accumulation of material called glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Laronidase
      is the manufactured form of the enzyme alpha-l-iduronidase that is deficient in
      mucopolysaccharidosis I patients. The aim of this study is to determine whether laronidase is
      safe and effective when given into the spinal fluid as a potential non-surgical treatment for
      spinal cord compression due to mucopolysaccharidosis I disease. Funding Source -- FDA OOPD

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been developed for mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I), a
      lysosomal storage disorder. ERT helps many physical ailments due to the disease, but does not
      treat the central nervous system, due to inability to cross the blood brain barrier. Our
      purpose is to test delivery of ERT to the spinal fluid via intrathecal injection in patients
      with MPS I. In this pilot study, we will use recombinant human Î±-L-iduronidase administered
      intrathecally once per month for four months to individuals with the Hurler-Scheie and Scheie
      forms of MPS I and spinal cord compression. If successful, intrathecal delivery could
      represent a practical, straightforward method of treating central nervous system disease due
      to lysosomal storage.
