    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness (seroprotection and
      seroconversion as measured by the hemagglutination inhibition [HI] assay) of an
      investigational Vero cell-derived, trivalent, seasonal influenza vaccine in adults 50 years
      of age and older. Subjects will be randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive a single
      intramuscular injection of either the investigational vaccine or a licensed egg-derived
      seasonal influenza vaccine. Blood will be drawn from all subjects for a determination of HI
      antibody titers on Days 0 and 21, body temperature and injection site reactions will be
      monitored daily for 7 days. In addition, subjects will be monitored for adverse events and
      rises in body temperature until Day 21 and again until Day 180.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis to egg protein or any other

             vaccine

          -  Oral temperature of &gt;= 99.5°F (37.5°C) on the day of vaccination in this study (Note:
             Subjects meeting this exclusion criterion may be rescheduled for vaccination and study
             entry at a later date if certain requirements [in the study protocol] are met)

          -  Rash or dermatologic condition or tattoos which may interfere with injection site
             reaction rating

          -  Blood transfusion or immunoglobulins received within 90 days of study entry

          -  Live vaccine received within 4 weeks or inactivated vaccine or subunit vaccine
             received within 2 weeks of study entry

          -  Previous vaccination against influenza for the 2008/2009 northern hemisphere influenza
             season

          -  Functional or surgical asplenia (e.g. from a history of hemoglobinopathies, leukemias,
