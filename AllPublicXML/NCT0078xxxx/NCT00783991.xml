      The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is an NIH Roadmap
      initiative to develop a computerized system measuring patient-reported outcomes in
      respondents with a wide range of chronic diseases and demographic characteristics. In the
      first four years of its existence, the PROMIS network developed item banks for measuring
      patient-reported outcomes in the areas of pain, fatigue, emotional distress, physical
      function, and social functioning. During the item banking process, the PROMIS network
      conducted focus groups, individual cognitive interviews, and lexile (reading level) analyses
      to refine the meaning, clarity, and literacy demands of all items. The item banks were
      administered to over 20,000 respondents and calibrated using models based on item response
      theory (IRT). Using these IRT calibrations, computerized adaptive test (CAT) algorithms were
      developed and implemented. The network has designed a series of studies using clinical
      populations to evaluate the item attributes, examine their utility as CATs, and validate the
      item banks. More information on the PROMIS network can be found at www.nihpromis.org.

      This study is designed to examine how differences in modes of data capture affect
      psychometric properties and score differences and to evaluate the consistency of these
      results across three PROMIS health domains: emotional distress-depression, fatigue, and
      physical function. Four modes of administration will be compared: interactive voice response
      (IVR) technology, paper and pencil questionnaire, personal computer, and personal digital
      assistant (PDA). A total of 800 patients will be enrolled from three diagnostic groups:
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), depression, and rheumatoid arthritis. The study
      will test for equivalence across modes of administration, with the hypothesis that there are
      no mode effects; if mode effects are found, their magnitude across modes will be estimated.
      This network project will result in an improved understanding of the effect of assessment
      mode on patient-reported outcome (PRO) data. Guidance from this project can help in planning
      future PROMIS activities beyond the present PROMIS program.

      This study is designed to systematically test the impact of mode of administration on
      patient-reported outcomes measures included in the PROMIS item banks. It is designed as a
      randomized cross-over study. Two non-overlapping alternate forms (Form A [FA] and Form B
      [FB]) with eight unique items each from three of the PROMIS domains (emotional
      distress-depression, fatigue, physical function) will be developed. Respondents will answer
      one of the forms by automated phone interview using interactive voice response (IVR)
      technology, paper and pencil questionnaire (PP), personal computer (PC), or personal digital
      assistant (PDA) technology. The other form will always be answered by PC. The order in which
      the forms are administered will be randomized. The two assessments will be separated by a
      short interval (e.g., 5 to 10 minutes), but will take place on the same day. The study is
      powered to evaluate equivalence within a score difference of +/-2.0 on a T-score metric
      (standard deviation of 10) with 85% power. Data for the IVR-PC, PP-PC, and PC-PC modes will
      be collected via Polimetrix (n=200 per arm, with random assignment to arm); data for the
      PDA-PC mode will be collected via Stony Brook (n=200). Respondents will have one or more of
      the chronic conditions studied in other Wave 2 studies (COPD, depression, or rheumatoid
      arthritis).
