  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to better understand the effects of nitric oxide, a gas for
      inhalation, on patients with right ventricular infarction.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will assess
      the feasibility of studying inhaled nitric oxide for the treatment of cardiogenic shock due
      to right ventricular infarction, and the dose response of the acute hemodynamic changes
      occurring with nitric oxide inhalation in these patients. Patients with evidence of right
      ventricular infarction and cardiogenic shock, and have angiographic evidence of impaired
      blood flow to the right ventricle, or if right ventricular coronary perfusion is unimpared,
      cardiac shock persists, will be eligible for enrollment. Patients will receive standard of
      care for their condition, and will also recieve either nitric oxide for inhalation or placebo
      for up to 14 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute inferior mycardial infarction (defined as an episode of chest pain lasting &gt;30
             minutes and electrocardiographic evidence of 1 mm or greater ST elevation in inferior
             leads) within the past 72 hours.

          -  Invasive hemodynamic evidence of hemodynamically-significant RV dysfunction, defined
             as the presence of all the following: systemic venous congestion (mean RA pressure &gt;
             10mmHg), the ratio of RA/PCW pressure 0.75 or greater, a low cardiac output as
             determined by Fick or Thermodilution (TD) technique (cardiac index &lt; 2.5 l/min/m2),
             systolic systemic arterial blood pressure of 90mmHg or less or requiring vasopressor
             or mechanical support to maintain systolic pressure &gt; 90mmHg. Patients with a PCWP of
             14mmHg or less should receive intravascular volume repletion until their PCWP is &gt;
             14mmHg.

             marginal branch or evidence of diminished flow to RV marginal branches of the RCA.

          -  If patient undergoes coronary revascularization, there must be evidence of
             unsuccessful right ventricular reperfusion (lack of restoration of TIMI grade III flow
             in the distal RCA and &gt; 1mm RV marginal branches) or evidence of hemodynamically
             significant RVI must persist for greater than 1 hour after successful
             revascularization.

          -  Evidence of shock-related end-organ damage, including creatinine 3.0 or greater,
             metabolic acidosis (pH 7.1 or less) and not corrected by 100 ml NaHCO3 (1mEq/ml),
             disseminated intravascular coagulation, or clinical evidence of diffuse brain injury.

          -  Previous history of severe pericardial, congenital, or valvular heart disease.

          -  Refractory hemodynamically significant arrhythmia.
