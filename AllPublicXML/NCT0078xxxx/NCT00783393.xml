      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy (overall response) and safety of
      temozolomide in Step 1 at the dose and regimen approved in the US and the EU countries (28
      day cycles of temozolomide at 150 to 200 mg/m2 once daily for 5 consecutive days with a 23
      day rest period) in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma at first relapse.

    <description>The study consists of two steps:
Step 1, the therapeutic study phase, comprising six cycles of treatment with temozolomide, and
Step 2, the long-term treatment phase, where subjects with at least disease stabilization at the end of Step 1 may continue temozolomide treatment until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression occur, up to a maximum of 2 years from the start of treatment in Cycle 1.</description>

    <description>Temozolomide orally once daily for 5 consecutive days followed by a 23 day rest period to complete a 28 day treatment cycle. In Cycle 1, temozolomide will be administered at 150 mg/m2/day; in Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles, it will be administered at 100, 150, or 200 mg/m2, depending on hematology test results and adverse events observed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must have histologically confirmed anaplastic astrocytoma on the tentorium at
             first relapse, and satisfy the following:

               -  unequivocal evidence of tumor recurrence or aggravation by MRI scan after
                  treatment for initial onset; the lesions must be measurable;

               -  anaplastic astrocytoma diagnosed histologically by the last pathological
                  diagnostic tests (including initial diagnosis) prior to initial administration of
                  temozolomide;

               -  tissue samples available for Central Pathologic Reviewer;

               -  pathologic diagnosis report by the study-conducting medical institution must be
