             prior to randomization) as represented by a provoking concentration of methacholine to
             cause a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1); (PC20) &lt; 8 mg/mL.

          -  Weight of ≥ 45 kg but ≤ 135 kg (≥ 100 lbs but ≤ 300 lbs).

             standards.

          -  Screening pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 60%.

          -  Women of childbearing potential, unless surgically sterile (including tubal ligation)
             and/or at least 2 years post-menopausal, must use 2 effective methods of avoiding

             device, female condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap,
             abstinence, use of a condom with spermicide by the sexual partner, or sterile sexual
             partner) for 14 days prior to the first dose of the investigational product on Study
             Day 0, and must agree to continue using such precautions through Study Day 161.
             Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible
             physician.

          -  Men, unless surgically sterile, must likewise use 2 effective methods of birth control
             (eg, condom with spermicide) and must agree to continue using such contraceptive
             precautions through End of Study/Study Day 161.

          -  Ability to complete the study period, including follow-up period until Study Day 161
             as required by protocol.

             the study or any biologic(s) within 5 half lives of the agent prior to randomization
             into the study.

          -  Treatment with an oral or systemic burst of corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to
             randomization into the study.

          -  Use of any chronic systemic immunosuppressive drugs, including oral corticosteroids
             within 4 weeks prior to randomization into the study.

          -  Current use of any oral or ophthalmic β-adrenergic antagonist (eg, propranolol), must
             have been stopped 2 weeks prior to randomization into the study.

          -  History of anaphylaxis.

          -  Lung disease other than persistent asthma [eg, chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis,

          -  Acute illnesses or evidence of significant active infection, such as fever

             ≥ 38.0°C (≥ 100.5°F) at screening and up through time of the first dose of the
             investigational product.

          -  History of ingestion of untreated water in a location known to be infected with
             parasites, resulting in acute or chronic diarrhea; or an untreated parasitic infection
             within 1 month of randomization.

          -  Pregnancy (women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test

             study results.

          -  Employees of the clinical study site or any other individuals involved with the
             conduct of the study, or first degree family members of such individuals (ie, parents,
