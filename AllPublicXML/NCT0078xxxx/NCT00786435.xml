      As people with spinal cord injuries (SCI) get older they become more likely to develop health
      problems, just like everyone else. However, SCI increases the risk of certain problems. This
      research project will focus on the control of blood sugar after SCI. Sugar in the blood is
      the important source of energy for the body. Too much sugar in the blood is known as
      hyperglycemia and not enough sugar in the blood is known as hypoglycemia. Under healthy
      conditions, the amount of sugar in the blood is automatically regulated so that a steady
      level is maintained. After SCI, however, this automatic regulation is damaged. The likelihood
      of experiencing too much or too little blood sugar is increased. Over time, having too much
      blood sugar can lead to the development of diabetes. In just the opposite situation,
      individuals with SCI can begin to experience more frequent episodes of too little blood
      sugar. It is thought that the level of SCI, amount of time post-injury, and amount of body
      fat are important factors in the development of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. This study
      will test 2 of those factors, level of SCI and amount of body fat. A total of 35 subjects
      will be enrolled, 24 with SCI and 11 able-bodied controls. All procedures will be performed
      at the university's clinical research center. Susceptibility to hyperglycemia will be tested
      by having each subject drink a sugar water solution and then taking blood samples every 30
      minutes for 2 hours. Hypoglycemia will be tested by very carefully inducing low blood sugar,
      taking blood samples over a 2 hour time period to evaluate different chemicals, and answering
      a questionnaire about different symptoms experienced during the procedure. Body fat will be
      measured by having a special kind of x-ray. It is predicted that subjects with cervical
      injuries and with more body fat will be at the greatest risk of experiencing hyperglycemia
      and hypoglycemia. The results from this study will provide important information for future
      studies aimed at examining the effect of exercise and other potentially therapeutic agents on
      blood sugar regulation in the aging SCI population.

        The characteristics of the proposed subject population are that all subjects must be 18-65
        years old, male or female, pass a medical examination by the study physician, and must
        speak English.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must be 5 or more years post-injury.

          2. Must have a C1-C8 or T7-T12/L1 lesion.

          3. Must be ASIA Impairment Scale grade A or B.

          4. Must not require the use of a ventilator.

          5. Must not have type I or II diabetes.

          6. Must not have any current pressure sores.

          7. Must be cognitively competent and have no concomitant brain damage.

          8. The study physician will determine for each subject whether any medications will
             preclude her/him from study participation. Any subject taking anti-cholinergic
             medication will be asked to not take that medication after midnight prior to study day
             2 (they can take it following the hypoglycemia challenge on study day 2).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Fetuses.

          2. Neonates.

          3. Pregnant women; a negative pregnancy test will be required for all potential female
             subjects in reproductive years.

          4. Prisoners.

          5. Cognitively impaired adults.

          6. Institutionalized individuals.

          7. Children under age 18.

          8. Non-English speaking individuals.

          9. Anyone taking lipid altering medication.
