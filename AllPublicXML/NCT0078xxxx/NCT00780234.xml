  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a chemoprevention trial evaluating the diabetic agent pioglitazone. Non-diabetic
      subjects at risk for lung cancer (based on smoking history, lung function testing, and
      atypical cells in a sputum sample) receive either placebo or pioglitazone and have chest
      computerized tomography (CAT) scans and examinations of their airways with a bronchoscope at
      the start of the trial and after 6 months on treatment. Compensation will be provided to the
      subject after completing the trial.

      This trial evaluates the oral peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)
      agonist pioglitazone in a double-blind placebo controlled trial. The high risk current and
      former smokers qualify based on tobacco exposure, airflow limitation on lung function
      testing, and sputum cytologic atypia. Subjects have a quantitative high resolution thoracic
      CT scan and a fluorescent bronchoscopy at study entry and after 6 months on drug or placebo.
      Biologic samples are collected at both time points. The primary outcome is endobronchial
      histology and determining if pioglitazone can retard progression. Secondary endpoints related
      to the PPAR gamma signaling pathway will also be analyzed.

    <description>Patients will be randomized to receive either pioglitazone or placebo. Pioglitazone hydrochloride, a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agent and a potent peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor-gamma agonist. It is FDA approved for the treatment of Type II diabetes. It has been previously administered to non-diabetic subjects. The most common side effect of pioglitazone is fluid retention and modest weight gain. There is a potential risk that pioglitazone may cause an elevation in liver enzymes and more serious hepatotoxicity (rare). There is risk of edema and weight gain associated with pioglitazone therapy. 5% experienced peripheral edema in clinical trials. fluid retention may result in new onset heart failure or exacerbation of existing heart failure. Small risk of hypoglycemia, anemia, myalgia, bone fracture, headache, and macular retinal edema exists. There is insufficient information to confirm its safety in Pregnancy/Breastfeeding. Bladder cancer is more serious but rare.</description>
