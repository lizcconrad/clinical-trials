  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doxorubicin has been used to treat ovarian cancer as part of different combination therapies,
      but high cumulative doses should be avoided because of the risk of cardiotoxicity. Pegylated
      Liposomal Doxorubicin (Caelyx) has been developed to reduce the risk of cardiotoxicity. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Caelyx in combination with
      carboplatin in women with recurrent ovarian cancer.
