  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common chronic gastrointestinal disorder. Existing
      therapies for IBS are still far from satisfactory and new therapies are being constantly
      sought. Probiotics are promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of IBS. However,
      its efficacy and mechanism is still unclear. The current study aims to evaluate the effects
      of a combination probiotic, VSL#3, on symptoms and rectal sensitivity in patients with IBS.
      The underlying mechanism will also be investigated. We will recruit forty patients with Rome
      III IBS and randomized them, in a parallel group, double-blinded design, to take four VSL#3
      capsules or placebos, twice daily, for six weeks. Before and after treatment, patients will
      be assessed for their symptoms, rectal sensitivity, as well as saliva and fecal melatonin
      levels. Bowel symptom diary and weekly satisfactory relief of bowel symptoms will also be
      recorded and evaluated.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female and male patients with IBS between the ages of 18 and 68 will be recruited. IBS
             will be diagnosed according to the Rome III diagnostic criteria (Drossman and
             Dumitrascu, 2006). The history of previous chronic GI symptoms suggestive of IBS
             should be at least 3 months (not necessarily consecutive) over the preceding 6 months.
             The stool culture of each subject should be negative for hemoccult, pathogens
             (Salmonella and Shigella), parasites (Giardia) and ova/ cyst. Only patients who had
             IBS symptoms for at least one month prior to the study and whose IBS symptom score is
             of at least a moderate severity on at least one of IBS symptoms will be eligible for
             inclusion into the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those subjects who are unwilling or unable to give informed consent, follow protocol
             or to stop all medications used to treat diarrhoea or colitis

          -  Subject taking at the time of proposed enrolment any of the below listed prohibited

                  dolasetron, granisetron).
