  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed in the
      body, distributed within the body, and how it is removed from the body over time) of
      itraconazole (ITCZ) oral solution in participants with Systemic Fungal Infection (SFI) and
      those with febrile (with fever) neutropenia (FN, decrease in white blood cells) suspected of
      fungal infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter
      (conducted in more than 1 center) and uncontrolled (no competitive drugs involved) study.
      Participants with SFI will receive treatment with ITCZ oral solution or switch treatment from
      intravenous (into a vein) infusion of itraconazole (ITCZ-intravenous) to ITCZ oral solution
      as per Investigator's discretion. All the participants with FN suspected of fungal infection
      will receive the switch treatment from ITCZ- intravenous to ITCZ oral solution. The study
      will include 3 periods: Pre-observation period (7 days), Treatment period (85 days for ITCZ
      oral solution monotherapy and 99 days for switch treatment) and Follow-up observation period
      (30 days). The participants who receive ITCZ oral solution monotherapy will receive ITCZ oral
      solution without ITCZ-intravenous in the dose range of 20 milliliter (ml) per day to 40 ml
      per day for 12 weeks (85 days) and those on the switch treatment will receive 400 milligram
      (mg) per day ITCZ-intravenous twice for first 2 days followed by 200 mg per day
      ITCZ-intravenous up to 14 days and then they will be administered treatment as per ITCZ oral
      solution monotherapy. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by assessing the pharmacokinetics.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
