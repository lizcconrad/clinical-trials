  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mother's breast milk provides many benefits to babies with regard to development and improved
      health. We believe the simple sugars which make up these complex sugars in breast milk and
      are also found in the brain may be critical to normal brain development in term and preterm
      infants.

      Babies are exposed to these sugars by placental transport during pregnancy and through
      mother's breast milk after they are born. For the preterm infant, we do not know if breast
      milk gives enough of these sugars compared to what the baby gets during pregnancy.

      A maternal blood sample and blood samples from the baby's umbilical cord will provide us with
      background information for developing a supplement of special sugars that can be added to
      infant formulas to provide the amount that the baby usually gets during pregnancy and from
      breast milk.
