      Individuals with bipolar disorder or those with a history of bipolar disorder may have
      certain structural changes in their brain. The purpose of this study is to look at those
      changes, as well as the assessment of risk factors for bipolar disorders, involving both
      social and psychological aspects of behavior, age, education, marital relations, nutrition,
      physical activity, etc., compared with persons not having bipolar disorder. These changes in
      the brain will be measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

    <measure>Boyko DWM Hyperintensity Value &gt;2 in Subjects Who Received Acute Treatment for Mania</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subject with acute mania were treated for 3 weeks with STEP-BD protocol using valproic acid as the primary intervention. Subject MRI's were evaluated for the presence of deep white matter hyperintensities (DWM) (&gt;2 on the the Boyko Classification). Boyko lesion classification system assesses DWM hyperintensities as follows: 0 = absent, 1 = punctate, 2 = rounded &lt;5 mm, 3 = irregular &gt;5 mm, 4 = confluent lesions.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subject were evaluated for relapse of their mood disorder and for the presence of DWM Hyperintensities (&gt;2 on the the Boyko Classification. Boyko lesion classification system assesses DWM hyperintensities as follows: 0 = absent, 1 = punctate, 2 = rounded &lt;5 mm, 3 = irregular &gt;5 mm, 4 = confluent lesions. Subjects were also assessed for relapse, as defined by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Relapse was defined by protocol as either a MADRS scale &gt;15 or a YMRS scale &gt;15.</description>

    <description>Subject were evaluated for relapse of their mood disorder and for the presence of subcortical (SC) Hyperintensities (&gt;2 on the the Boyko Classification). Boyko lesion classification system assesses SC hyperintensities as follows: 0 = absent, 1 = punctate, 2 = rounded &lt;5 mm, 3 = irregular &gt;5 mm, 4 = confluent lesions.

    <measure>fa LOFC in Subjects Who Received Continuation Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>As an exploratory analysis, subject MRI's were also evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for differences in fractional anisoptery (fa) in the Left Orbitofrontal area (LOFC). FA is a scalar value between zero and one hundred that describes the degree of anisotropy of a diffusion process. A value of zero means that the diffusion is isotropic (unrestricted in all directions). A value of one hundred means that diffusion occurs only along one axis and is fully restricted along all other directions.</description>

          <description>Acutely manic subjects were treated using the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) expert consensus guidelines beginning with valproic acid (titrated to therapeutic levels) over a three week period. If there was a non-response to this intervention, then a subject would continue acute treatment using other interventions indicated by STEP-BD protocols. After stabilization, subjects were followed monthly up to a year's duration and treated using the STEP-BD expert consensus guidelines.</description>

FA is a scalar value between zero and one hundred that describes the degree of anisotropy of a diffusion process. A value of zero means that the diffusion is isotropic (unrestricted in all directions). A value of one hundred means that diffusion occurs only along one axis and is fully restricted along all other directions.</description>
