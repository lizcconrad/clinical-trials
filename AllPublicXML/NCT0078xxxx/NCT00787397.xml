      The purpose of this study is to assess whether improving sleep in children and adolescents
      with anxiety disorder will further enhance affective, clinical, and social functioning.

      This study is one of two interlinking protocols developed to investigate neural, affective,
      behavioral and social predictors of improvement as a critical next step in advancing the
      understanding of processes involved in the treatment response of anxiety disorders in youth.
      This protocol will offer a six to eight session sleep intervention (Sleeping Tigers)children
      ages 9-13 who currently have a DSM-IV anxiety disorder and who endorse some level of
      impairment in their ability to sleep. Participants will have completed a 16 session
      intervention for anxiety (IRB submission, Child Anxiety Treatment Study CATS). We hope to
      assess whether improving sleep will further enhance affective, clinical, and social
      functioning.
