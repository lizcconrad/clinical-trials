      Researchers suggest that the protection of the cycles of sleep is essential for
      neurodevelopment, learning, memory and preservation of brain plasticity to the individual's
      life. Recent research shows that technical bath promote reduction of crying, anxiety and
      improves the behavior of newborns.

      This was a pilot study assessing the technique in this population. The study was conducted
      with 8 stable premature infants admitted in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from
      Hospital Luterano de Porto Alegre. Physiological and behavioral parameters were assessed by
      Brazelton's neonatal behavior assessment scale, and the pain was evaluated by NFCS scale. The
      mean of Brazelton's scale was reduced after the procedures from 5,88 ± 0.35 to 1,38 ± 0.74, p
      &lt; 0.001. The score in pain assessment scale was reduced from 5,38 ± 0.91 to 0.25 ± 0.46, p &lt;
      0.001 after intervention. The study suggests that aquatic physical therapy could be a simple
      and effective method to reduce pain and stress in premature infants admitted in the neonatal
      ICU.
