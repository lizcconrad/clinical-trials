    <textblock>
      The study was designed to study the utility of meta-iodobenzylguanidine (123I-mIBG) imaging
      to identify those participants with heart failure who would experience an adverse cardiac
      event during 24 months of follow-up from the administration date of 123I-mIBG in previous
      studies MBG311 or MBG312.

    <measure>Numerical Heart to Mediastinum (H/M) Ratio at 3 Hours 50 Minutes Post-administration on Planar 123I-mIBG Imaging by Adverse Cardiac Events (ACEs) Status</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of administration of 123I-mIBG in studies MBG-311 or MBG-312 up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The numerical value of 123 I-mIBG uptake (H/M ratio) at 3 hours 50 minutes post administration was calculated by dividing the counts/pixel in the total myocardium region of interest (ROI) by the counts/pixel in the 7x7 pixel mediastinal ROI. Receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC) constructed on the basis of sensitivity and specificity to identify ACEs across all H/M values were used to calculate the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The AUC was used to test for statistical significance of the prognostic usefulness of the H/M ratio. In the present MBG313 study, additional efficacy data is provided for 471 participants and new data from MBG313 were combined with data collected in MBG311 and MBG312 for efficacy analysis.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Designed as a continuation of original phase 3, but objectives were built around analyses of integrated data from both studies. Distinct from endpoints used in MBG311 and MBG312. No intent to analyze current study on single original study basis.</limitations_and_caveats>
