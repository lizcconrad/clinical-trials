      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn the level of effectiveness of the Mirena
      intrauterine device (levonorgestrel IUD) in treating hyperplasia of the lining of the uterus
      and/or early-stage cancer of the lining of the uterus. Researchers want to learn if the
      levonorgestrel IUD can help to shrink or slow the growth of the disease.

      The Levonorgestrel IUD:

      The levonorgestrel IUD is a T-shaped birth control device that is made of flexible plastic.
      It is designed to prevent pregnancy by releasing a hormone called levonorgestrel, which is a
      type of progesterone. Progesterone is a common type of hormone that is used to prevent
      pregnancy.

      In this study, the levonorgestrel intrauterine device is being tested as a treatment for
      hyperplasia and/or early-stage cancer of the lining of the uterus.

      Study Surgery and IUD Placement:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have a surgical
      procedure performed on Day 1 of the study (within 1 week after the screening tests). The
      procedure is called dilation and curettage, and the purpose is to confirm your diagnosis.

      First you will have a complete pelvic exam, and then the lining of your uterus will be
      scraped in the operating room in order to remove a sample of tissue. The tissue sample will
      be used to find out your exact diagnosis. Women who have previously undergone a dilation and
      curettage (D&amp;C) before for this diagnosis will not have to undergo a second D&amp;C. The
      Levonorgestrel IUD will then be placed in the clinic. During this surgery, to lower the risk
      of pain during the procedure, you will receive general anesthesia. The cervix area may also
      be numbed with anesthetic. You will be asked to sign a separate consent form for this
      surgical procedure, and the procedure and its risks will be explained to you in more detail
      at that time.

      At the time of surgery, the levonorgestrel IUD will be inserted into your uterus, where it
      will remain in place.

      Study Visits:

      After you have the IUD placed, you will return to the clinic for the following study visits.

      About one (1) week after surgery, the study staff will review your surgery and pathology
      results with you. If the results showed that you had a change in your diagnosis from
      hyperplasia to early-stage cancer, you will be re-assessed for eligibility for our study. If
      you are still eligible, you will have a chest x-ray and MRI of the abdomen. These scans are
      being performed to check the status of the disease. If your pathology results show that you
      have disease outside the uterus, you will be unable to take part in the study. The LIUD can
      be removed in the operating room when you have surgery for removal of disease outside the
      uterus. You may also have the LIUD removed in clinic.

      About one (1) month after surgery, you will have a visit to check the placement of your LIUD.
      This visit may be in our office or at your local doctor's office, whichever you prefer.
      Placement of the LIUD will be checked first with a pelvic exam. In addition, you may have an
      ultrasound of your uterus to confirm the location of your LIUD. If the IUD is not in the
      correct location, it will be replaced at this visit.

      At Months 3, 6, 9, and 12 after surgery, the following procedures will be performed:

        -  You will be asked about any side effects that you may be experiencing.

        -  You will have a a complete physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a biopsy of the lining of your uterus. To perform this biopsy, a small
           plastic tube will be placed into your uterus. The tube will scrape off a tissue sample
           from the lining of your uterus.

      Biomarker Testing:

      The leftover tissue after your study surgery will be tested for biomarkers (chemical
      &quot;markers&quot; in the tissue that may be related to your response to the study drug,
      levonorgestrel). This biomarker testing will also be performed on the tissue that is leftover
      after your uterine lining biopsy at Month 3.

      Length of Study Participation:

      The first part of this study lasts 12 months, and the levonorgestrel IUD will remain in your
      uterus during that time. If the disease gets worse or you experience intolerable side effects
      at any time, you will be taken off study and the levonorgestrel IUD will be removed. In that
      case, you would not need to return for the follow-up study visits described below. Instead,
      you would visit your primary gynecologic oncologist (your regular doctor for the disease),
      who will discuss with you the different treatment options for the disease.

      At Month 12 of the study, you will be asked if you want to keep the levonorgestrel IUD in
      place.

      If you choose to have the levonorgestrel IUD removed at your Month 12 visit, you will be
      considered &quot;off study&quot; after the Month 12 visit.

      If you choose to keep the levonorgestrel IUD after Month 12, you will remain on study for as
      long as the levonorgestrel IUD is still in place. Instead of visiting the study doctor, you
      will visit your primary gynecologic oncologist after that. Anytime you have check-ups or
      biopsies of the lining of your uterus as part of your routine medical care, as long as the
      levonorgestrel IUD is still in place, the results of the check-ups or biopsies will be shared
      with the study staff and will be used as part of this research study. You will remain &quot;on
      study&quot; for as long as the levonorgestrel IUD is still in place. You may ask your primary
      gynecologic oncologist to remove the IUD at any time.

      This is an investigational study. The levonorgestrel IUD is commercially available and FDA
      approved as a form of birth control. Its use for the treatment of cancer and hyperplasia is
      experimental. At this time and for this purpose, it is only being used in research.

      Up to 70 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 50 will be enrolled at MD
      Anderson. Up to 20 will be enrolled at the Harris Health System.

    <description>Efficacy of the Levonorgestrel Intrauterine Device (IUD) to treat complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH) and grade 1 endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (G1 EEC) is defined as complete regression of disease. Complete regression of disease is defined as no evidence of disease as assessed at one year endometrial biopsy. Response is defined as total regression of disease on endometrial biopsy at the 1 year time point. For patients with CAH, there should be no residual hyperplasia on biopsy. For patients with G1 EEC, response will be defined as no residual endometrial carcinoma on biopsy. If there is residual disease as defined above, the subject will be classified as a non-responder.</description>
