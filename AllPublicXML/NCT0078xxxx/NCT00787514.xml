  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The folate receptor (FR) is a cell over expressed on the surface of certain cancers, this
      occurs most frequently in ovarian cancers. Some normal tissues also express the FR, however
      in these normal tissues, the FR is usually located on the tissue surface that is inaccessible
      to circulating drugs. As such, drugs which target the FR may potentially be used to target
      cancers which overexpress the FR while reducing toxicity to normal tissues. Therefore the
      ability to measure FR levels from different cancer types may help to select patients who are
      most likely to benefit from treatment with FR targeted therapies. Once such drug BGC945 is
      currently being tested in preclinical study at the Institute of Cancer Research

      FR may be released from the cancer cells in the blood. We have developed a method in the
      laboratory which has been able to measure the FR obtained from cancer cells in culture which
      has been added into blood. We would like to study if this method is able to measure the FR in
      stored plasma samples obtained from patients with ovarian cancer, so that it may be developed
      as a method for selecting patients for FR-target treatments such as BGC 945.
