      The primary aim of the survey is to ascertain the emergency preparedness among our families
      with diabetes mellitus and to obtain a percentage of unprepared to the ones who are prepared.
      The secondary aim is to demonstrate the relationship between disaster preparedness and
      factors like socio-economic status, parent's marital status, ethnicity and those who had
      prior experience of a disaster to those who have not experienced a disaster.

      This is a cross-sectional study. The subjects are the parent/parents/legal guardian, who will
      be coming to the clinic for their routine appointment for diabetes management. During the
      time in which the subject is waiting for the doctor or after their check-up, a research team
      member will approach the family and ask for their permission to administer the survey. The
      survey consists of a series of questions designed to ascertain the awareness towards
      emergency preparedness among families. After they have completed the questionnaire they would
      be given and/or mailed handouts to enhance their awareness towards disaster preparedness.

      Potential Benefits:

      This study will help to increase awareness regarding disaster preparedness among the surveyed
      families. Subjects and families will gain valuable information about caring for diabetes in
      the event of a disaster.

      The potential benefit to the society is that through this study we can ascertain the primary
      caregiver's awareness of disaster preparedness in regard to a family member with a chronic
      illness. We will suggest measures to improve their competency towards dealing with disasters.
      We will be providing educational literature to the primary care givers in the form of
      handouts at the end of the survey.
