  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childcare in nursery schools has been shown to be associated with an elevated prevalence of
      neck, shoulder, arm and low back disorders. The current evidence suggests that exercises seem
      to be the only effective preventive intervention. Thus the purpose of this study is to
      determine the effectiveness of an extension-oriented exercise program in preventing low
      back/neck pain and functional disability in nursery school teachers. In addition, the
      investigators also sought to identify the occurrence of musculoskeletal complaints in this
      category of workers.

    <textblock>
      Seventy-one nursery school teachers working in nine school buildings were randomly divided
      into two groups, with each school as a unit of randomization. All the teachers in both groups
      received an ergonomic brochure; teachers in the experimental group also received an
      extension-oriented exercise program, conducted by a physical therapist. Data were collected
      at baseline and at a two-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure recorded was the level
      of disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire and Oswestry Disability Index), while
      secondary outcome measures included LBP and neck pain presence (Pain Drawing) and intensity
      (Visual Analogue Scale). At follow-up, a significant improvement was registered in the
      experimental group for all the outcomes evaluated. In conclusion a six-session
      extension-oriented exercise program proved decisive in preventing low back and neck
      complaints and in reducing consequent LBP functional disability among nursery school
      teachers.

    <description>The exercise program was composed of six graded sessions, two per week for three consecutive weeks. Sessions, each of one hour length, were conducted after the working hours in a wide room of the nursery school, gathering together all the teachers from each school. The exercises were selected in order to reinforce lumbar extension and to strengthen the primary stabilizers of the spine (transversus abdominis, oblique abdominal, multifidus, quadratus lumborum and erector spinae muscles)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The study population was composed by all the 71 nursery school teachers, employed at the
        town hall of Forl√¨, that worked in nine different school buildings similar in size and
        furniture. As provided for by the Italian law (Emilia-Romagna Regional Law No. 1 of January
        10, 2000 - art. 32, followed by the Directive of July 25, 2001), teachers had the same
        working schedule and the same workload in terms of teacher/children ratio depending on
        children age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  medical history of serious injury

          -  spinal surgery
