  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 144 stroke patients 6 -24 months post onset who are between 45 and 75 years old
      will be recruited. A randomized-blocks pretest and posttest control group design will be
      applied. Four groups will be involved in this project and the subjects will be stratified on
      two variables: impairment level of the hand and side of lesion. Randomization will be done in
      blocks of six and each block randomization scheme is within each stratum. Treatment regimens
      will be designed to ensure that patients in 4 groups receive equivalent intensity of
      treatment (5 days/week for 1.5 hours/day for 4 consecutive weeks) directly supervised by
      senior occupational therapists.

      Brain and movement reorganization will be evaluated with fMRI and kinematic instrument,
      respectively before and after the 4-week intervention period. Clinical measures on motor
      impairment, daily function and quality of life will be assessed before, immediately and six
      months after intervention. Two examiners blind to group allocation will collaborate to
      provide both fMRI and kinematic evaluations and one of them will administer clinical
      measures. Before being allowed to work with subjects, the examiner competence will be
      assessed by principle investigator and co-principle investigators. Multivariate analyses of
      covariance will be used to examine change in brain activation, kinematic variables and
      clinical measures as a function of intervention while controlling for pretest data, age and
      onset post stroke. Multiple regression models will be established to examine the possible
      predictor(s) for functional outcome of each rehabilitation approach. Canonical correlation
      analyses will be conducted to quantify the relationship between brain/motor reorganization
      and clinical measures.

          4. no balance problems compromising safety when wearing the constraint device; and,

          5. no excessive spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale â‰¤ 2 at any joint of the upper limb)
