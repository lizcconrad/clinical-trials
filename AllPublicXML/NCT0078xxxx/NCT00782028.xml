      We hypothesize that relative to families who receive standard individual postpartum and
      pediatric care, families that receive group care will be more likely to have:

        -  Improved maternal and child health behaviors: i.e increased breastfeeding, exercise,
           child safety measures in the home and decreased smoking.

        -  Better health care use for babies: i.e. attend more care visits, on-time and complete
           immunizations and decreased emergency services use.

        -  Better psychosocial outcomes for the families: i.e. decreased stress and depression, and
           increased social support.

        -  Improved parenting skills: i.e. improved knowledge of child development, involvement in
           developmentally appropriate activities, and parental sense of competence.
