  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind pilot study was conducted to establish the best way of using desloratadine
      treatment to protect quality of life of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) patients, after an
      initial 4-weeks of daily treatment: prolonging systematic daily treatment or as needed (PRN;
      in the case of symptoms).

          -  Subjects must be in general good health; ie, they must be free of any clinically
             significant disease (other than CIU) that would interfere with study evaluations.

          -  Subjects must understand and be able to adhere to visit schedules, and agree to
             complete the questionnaires and a diary.

          -  Subjects must have at least a 6-week history of CIU (pruritus and hives) prior to
             Visit 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing.

          -  Subjects who used any investigational drug in the last 30 days prior to Visit 1

          -  Subjects with asthma requiring chronic use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids.

          -  Subjects who have been treated with any investigational antibodies for asthma or
             allergic rhinitis in the 90 days prior to Baseline.

          -  Subjects who have been treated with intra-muscular or intra-articular corticosteroids
             in the 90 days prior to Baseline.

          -  Subjects with urticaria that is primarily due to physical urticaria or other known
             etiology, except dermographism.

          -  Subjects treated by immunosuppressive drugs.

          -  Subjects who have been hospitalized (including an emergency department visit) because
             of deterioration in their CIU within 3 months prior to Visit 1.

          -  Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to desloratadine or any of its excipients.

          -  Subjects previously randomized into this study.

          -  Subjects who have any clinically significant metabolic, cardiovascular, immunological,
             neurological, hematological, gastrointestinal, cerebrovascular, or respiratory
             disease, or any other disorder which, in the judgment of the investigator, may
             interfere with the study evaluations or affect subject safety.

          -  Subjects with a history of psychosis, antagonistic personality, poor motivation,
             hypochondriasis, or any other emotional or intellectual problems that are likely to
             limit the validity of consent to participate in the study.
