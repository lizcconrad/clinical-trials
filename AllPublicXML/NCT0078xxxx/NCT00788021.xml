    <textblock>
      Patients who undergo kidney transplant must take medications to prevent organ rejection.
      There are standard immunosuppressant medications such as prednisone, tacrolimus (Prograf),
      mycophenolate mofetil(Cellcept) or sirolimus (Rapamune) that are given to patients to prevent
      rejection. It is well known that patients on immunosuppressant medications are at increased
      risk from viral infections, such as influenza. However, it is not well understood how
      immunosuppressive medications may uniquely affect the immune response to infection. This
      study will determine whether there are unique differences in the effects on the immune system
      by these different immunosuppressive medications, particularly differences between tacrolimus
      and sirolimus.

    <textblock>
      While the benefits of transplantation to society are substantial, the ever-growing population
      of immunosuppressed recipients poses a unique challenge in development of immunization and
      containment strategies to protect the population from communicable pathogens and weaponized
      infectious agents. The immunosuppressive regimens that have allowed the emergence of
      successful transplant therapy not only inhibit T cell-dependent rejection but also cause
      systemic immunosuppression, which attenuates the response to vaccines in general and
      precludes the use of live attenuated vaccines. To date, there has been relatively little
      detailed systematic study of the immune alterations that accompany either the short- or
      long-term immunosuppressive regimens used in clinical organ transplantation. Despite the
      recent development of increasingly effective, but also increasingly complex, regimens using
      drugs with very distinct molecular targets, current policies on vaccination of transplant
      recipients are generic and remain based on old concepts rather than on any new understanding
      of the cellular and molecular effects of these therapies on the human immune system. This
      proposal seeks to improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie the
      distinct immunosuppressive regimens in practice today (calcineurin-inhibitor, or CNI, and
      sirolimus-based regimens) and in emerging regimens that employ agents with novel mechanisms
      of action, such as the CD28 costimulation blockers, and/or JAK3 kinase inhibitors. Such
      knowledge will be critical to strategies for enhancing desirable immune responses while not
      precipitating rejection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients between 18 and 59 years of age

          2. Patients capable of understanding the purposes and risks of the study, who can give
             written informed consent and who are willing to participate in and comply with the
             study.

          3. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7
             days prior to enrollment and must not be breast-feeding.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with any prior organ transplant or multi-organ transplant recipients

          2. Patients that require induction immunosuppression beyond the immunosuppressive regimen
             proposed in this study. For example, patients that receive anti-lymphocyte antibody
             therapy or plasmapheresis as a result of pre-formed immunologic reactivity to the
             transplanted organ.

          3. Patients with evidence of an active systemic infection requiring the continued use of
             antibiotics, evidence of an HIV infection, or the presence of a chronic active
             hepatitis B or C.

          4. Patients with history of malignancy in the last 5 years (except successfully treated
             localized non-melanotic skin cancer)
