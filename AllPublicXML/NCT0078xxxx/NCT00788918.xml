  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with HCV infection often suffer from chronic fatigue, depression and reduced
      cognition, even before evolving severe liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis and hepatic
      encephalopathy.

      It is currently unclear to what extent the symptoms er due to a direct pathological effects
      of the virus itself, or due to pre-existing psychiatric disease. There is a complex
      relationship between prior or existing drug abuse, psychiatric disease and HCV infection,
      that makes it difficult to establish cause-effect relationships.

      A biological mechanism has been suggested to contribute to development of cerebral
      dysfunction in the patients. According to the prevailing Trojan Horses hypothesis circulating
      lymphocytes cross the blood brain barrier carrying HCV to the central nervous system and
      virus is subsequently replicated in the macrophages and the microglia in brain as a separate
      compartment. As part of the immunological response to viral replication, neurodegenerative
      processes takes place with a harmful effect on the neural circuit and cerebral function.
      Identification of HCV RNA negative strand, a replication product, in brain tissue from HCV
      patients, as part of autopsy studies, supports the hypothesis. Moreover, HCV patients have
      also been observed with abnormal metabolic concentrations in the frontal white substance and
      the basal ganglia by MRI spectroscopy compared to control groups.

      The overall study objective is to assess cerebral function with particular emphasis on
      cognitive functions in HCV patients (genotypes 1,2,3 and 4) by use of a neuropsychiatric test
      battery. Furthermore, the patients will be examined by MRI, including magnetization transfer,
      diffusion tensor and contrast perfusion, in order to perform measurements of cerebral
      volumetric and microstructure. Finally, HCV analysis, including viral sequences and cytokine
      profiles, in serum and cerebrospinal fluid will be carried out in the study population.
