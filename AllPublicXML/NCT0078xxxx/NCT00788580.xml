      RATIONALE: Pazopanib and temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Pazopanib may also blocking blood flow to the tumor.
      Giving pazopanib together with temsirolimus may be an effective treatment for advanced solid
      tumors.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of temsirolimus when
      given together with pazopanib in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To investigate the safety and feasibility of temsirolimus and pazopanib when given in
           combination in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  To recommend the maximum tolerated dose of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetics of temsirolimus alone and in combination with
           pazopanib in these patients.

        -  To investigate the effects of this regimen on relevant biological markers.

        -  To preliminarily report objective response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,15, and 22 and oral pazopanib
      hydrochloride once daily on days 4-28 in course 1 and days 1-28 in all subsequent courses.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are obtained periodically for evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of
      temsirolimus and pazopanib, plasma and serum angiogenic and cachectic factors (e.g., VEGF,
      bFGF, PlGF and SDF-1) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and biological markers in the
      mTOR/PI3/Akt, Ras/MAPK, VEGFR, PDGFR, and HIF-1 pathways.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 28 days.
