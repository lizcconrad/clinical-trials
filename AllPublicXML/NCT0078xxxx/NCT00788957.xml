  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a global, multicenter, open-label phase 1b and randomized, double-blinded, 2
      part, phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rilotumumab or ganitumab
      in combination with panitumumab versus panitumumab alone in patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer whose tumors are wild-type KRAS status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consisted of 3 parts:

      Part 1: determination of the tolerable dose of rilotumumab in combination with panitumumab to
      be administered in Part 2.

      Part 2: Comparison of the safety and efficacy of rilotumumab or ganitumab in combination with
      panitumumab versus that of panitumumab alone. In Part 2, participants were randomized 1:1:1
      into 3 cohorts: 6 mg/kg panitumumab plus 10 mg/kg rilotumumab, 6 mg/kg panitumumab plus 12
      mg/kg ganitumab, or 6 mg/kg panitumumab and placebo (panitumumab alone cohort). Panitumumab
      was administered open-label, and rilotumumab and ganitumab were double-blinded.

      Part 3: Exploratory evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the rilotumumab and ganitumab
      monotherapy following treatment with panitumumab in Part 2. In Part 3, eligible participants
      who terminated panitumumab treatment in the Panitumumab Alone arm of Part 2 due to disease
      progression or intolerability could be randomized 1:1 into 2 double-blind cohorts: 10 mg/kg
      rilotumumab or 12 mg/kg ganitumab.

      Participants who permanently discontinued all the investigational products completed a safety
      follow-up visit 30 days and a follow-up visit 60 days after the last dose of investigational
      product. Participants were followed for radiographic disease progression and survival every 3
      months after the 30-day safety follow-up visit for up to 2 years after the last participant
      was enrolled in Part 2.

    <measure>Part 1: Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined as any grade 3 or 4 rilotumumab-related or combination (panitumumab and rilotumumab)-related adverse event or laboratory abnormality that is deemed clinically significant by the investigator</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2: Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of first dose until the data cut-off date of 23 July 2010. Median follow-up time was 30 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>An objective response is defined as a confirmed complete (CR) or partial response (PR) no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met, determined by the investigator considering the radiologic response of all existing target and non-target lesions, evidence of new lesions, and cytology evaluation (as appropriate) according to the Modified-Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.0 criteria: CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target and no new lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the size of target lesions with no increase in non-target lesions, or, the disappearance of all target lesions and persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) not qualifying for either CR or progressive disease. Participants without a post-baseline assessment were considered non-responders. Tumor assessments up to the initiation of another anti-tumor therapy including the Part 3 treatment, if applicable, were used.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2: Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of first dose until the data cut-off date of 23 July 2010. Median follow-up time was 30 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The interval from the first visit of a confirmed objective response to disease progression as defined by the modified RECIST v1.0 criteria. Participants who did not progress by the earlier of the analysis data cutoff date, initiating a new line of anti-tumor therapy, and the start of Part 3 dosing where applicable were censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date prior to the end of reporting period. Progressive disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the size of target lesions, or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or any new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2: Time to Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of first dose until the data cut-off date of 23 July 2010. Median follow-up time was 30 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The interval from the first dose of study therapy to the date of the first confirmed objective response, calculated only for participants with an objective response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2: Percentage of Participants With Disease Control</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of first dose until the data cut-off date of 23 July 2010. Median follow-up time was 30 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with an overall objective response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target and no new lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the size of target lesions with no increase in non-target lesions, or, the disappearance of all target lesions and persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) not qualifying for either CR or progressive disease (PD). SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage of target lesions to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD and no progression of non-target lesions, or the persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) not qualifying for either CR or PD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of first dose until the data cut-off date of 23 July 2010. Median follow-up time was 30 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The interval from the first dose of study therapy to the earlier date of disease progression (per modified-RECIST v1.0) or death. Participants who did not progress or die by the analysis data cutoff date were censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date prior to the earlier of the analysis data cutoff date, initiating a new line of anti-tumor therapy, and receiving study treatment in Part 3 where applicable. Participants enrolled into Part 3 or who started a new line of anti-tumor therapy before radiographic progression but subsequently died were considered as having an event with the event date same as the death date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>On-treatment Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of first dose until 28 days after the last dose until the data cut-off date of 23 July 2010. Median time on treatment was 3.7, 4.9 and 5.1 months in each treatment arm respectively.</time_frame>
    <description>An event is defined as a radiographic progression or death that occurred from the first dose to 28 days since the last dose of study therapy. Participants who did not progress or die during this period were censored at their last evaluable disease assessment before the end of the 28-day period. Participants who received Part 3 treatment before 28 days since their last dose of study drug in Part 2 and did not have radiographic progression or die were censored at their last evaluable disease assessment prior to receiving therapy in Part 3. Radiographic progressions after start of a new anti-tumor therapy, including Part 3 treatment, or after 28 days since the last dose in Part 2 were excluded from the analysis. Participants who died with no prior radiographic disease progression during Part 3 treatment, but within the 28-day period since the last dose in Part 2 were considered as having an event.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of first dose until the data cut-off date of 23 July 2010. Median follow-up time was 30 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The interval from the first dose of study therapy to the date of death. Participants still alive at the analysis data cutoff date were censored at their last contact date.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>First patient enrolled 27 October 2008; last patient enrolled 05 February 2010. In Part 1, participants with wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer received open-label rilotumumab and panitumumab to identify a tolerable dose of rilotumumab for Part 2 of the study. Participants enrolled in Part 1 were not eligible for randomization in Part 2.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>In Part 2 participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the 3 double-blinded treatment arms. In Part 3, participants randomized to Panitumumab Alone in Part 2 and with disease progression or intolerability were re-randomized 1:1 into 2 double-blind groups. Participants completed a safety follow-up visit 30 days after the last dose of study drug.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Part 2: Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response</title>
        <description>An objective response is defined as a confirmed complete (CR) or partial response (PR) no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met, determined by the investigator considering the radiologic response of all existing target and non-target lesions, evidence of new lesions, and cytology evaluation (as appropriate) according to the Modified-Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.0 criteria: CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target and no new lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the size of target lesions with no increase in non-target lesions, or, the disappearance of all target lesions and persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) not qualifying for either CR or progressive disease. Participants without a post-baseline assessment were considered non-responders. Tumor assessments up to the initiation of another anti-tumor therapy including the Part 3 treatment, if applicable, were used.</description>

        <description>An event is defined as a radiographic progression or death that occurred from the first dose to 28 days since the last dose of study therapy. Participants who did not progress or die during this period were censored at their last evaluable disease assessment before the end of the 28-day period. Participants who received Part 3 treatment before 28 days since their last dose of study drug in Part 2 and did not have radiographic progression or die were censored at their last evaluable disease assessment prior to receiving therapy in Part 3. Radiographic progressions after start of a new anti-tumor therapy, including Part 3 treatment, or after 28 days since the last dose in Part 2 were excluded from the analysis. Participants who died with no prior radiographic disease progression during Part 3 treatment, but within the 28-day period since the last dose in Part 2 were considered as having an event.</description>

        <description>A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that is fatal, life threatening (places the participant at immediate risk of death), requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or other significant medical hazard. AEs were graded for severity according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) version 3: Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe; Grade 4: Life-threatening; Grade 5: Fatal. AEs were assessed by the investigator for the relationship of the AE to each one or more of the investigational products by the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?”</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
