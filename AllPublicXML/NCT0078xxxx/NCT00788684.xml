    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study evaluating the safety of ABT-263 administered in combination with
      rituximab in subjects with CD20-positive lymphoproliferative disorders. The extension portion
      of the study will allow active subjects to continue to receive ABT-263 for up to 9 years
      after the last subject transitions with quarterly study evaluations.
