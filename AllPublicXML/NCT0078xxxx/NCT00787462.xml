  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic Small Fiber Neuropathy (called SFN for short), is a condition where nerves that
      sense pain have become damaged, and often painful. SFN pain is common, and it can affect
      sleep, memory, health and overall quality of life.

      Pregabalin is a drug commonly used to treat painful conditions, like nerve pain. It has been
      available to doctors for many years, and many studies have been performed to evaluate its
      effectiveness. In these studies, pregabalin has been shown to be very effective in the
      treatment of nerve pain, with fewer side effects than many other medications currently
      available. The purpose of the study is to determine if pregabalin relieves pain more
      effectively than a pill containing no medication (called a placebo). The study will also
      investigate any side effects as well as the effectiveness and safety of the medication.

      Painful small fiber sensory neuropathy (SFN) is relatively common and a disabling medical
      condition. It is the most common type of painful sensory neuropathy in patients older than 50
      years of age. It is defined as a neuropathy that exclusively or predominantly affects the A-δ
      (small myelinated) and nociceptive C (unmyelinated) nerve fibers and their functions. The
      neuropathic pain associated with SFN is described by the patients as burning (&quot;feet are on
      fire&quot;), sharp (&quot;knife-like, jabbing or pins and needles&quot;), shooting, and aching pain in the
      toes and feet. The feet are described as tingling, numb, or feeling tight, wooden or dead.
      The pain is disabling and often exacerbated at night interfering and disrupting the sleep
      pattern. Allodynia and cramps may also occur. Some patients also describe pressure induced
      pain in their feet with standing and walking. The autonomic nerves may be involved leading to
      increased or decreased sweating, facial flushing, skin discoloration and erectile dysfunction
      in up to 40% of males. On examination there is a dramatic mismatch between the symptoms and
      observable deficits in SFN. Only abnormal findings are the loss of pinprick and temperature
      sensations in feet that may extend up to the knees. Touch sensation may be diminished but
      other sensations are usually preserved. By definition, patients with SFN are allowed to have
      minor involvement of large fibers distally with reduced vibration in toes but the ankle
      reflexes are usually preserved.

      This study will be of a crossover design thus minimizing the number of subjects needed. Each
      patient will act as his/her own control. Previous studies of pregabalin have shown that the
      desired effect is achieved by eight weeks of treatment. Therefore each patient will start on
      either placebo or pregabalin. They will be assessed on this treatment arm for eight weeks.
      There will be a two-week drug tapering and washout period before switching treatments,
      followed by re-assessment for an additional eight weeks. This design minimizes the amount of
      time that the patient will be treated with placebo.

    <description>Available as 75 mg capsules. Subjects will begin Phase 1 treatment on either pregabalin (or placebo) 75mg BID (1 capsule BID) for one week then increasing to 150mg BID or placebo (2 capsules BID) for a further 7 weeks. During this period patients will be allowed to taper the drug to 225mg a day (75mg in am, 150mg in pm) or (75mg BID) if they develop significant adverse effects on the higher dose. After 8 weeks Phase 1 treatment subjects will taper study medication to 75mg BID or placebo (1 capsule BID) for 7 days and then continue taking placebo (1 capsule) for 7 additional days prior to the crossover. After the taper and washout, Phase 2 will begin using the alternate treatment and will follow the same dosing regime as Phase 1 for the remaining 10 weeks.</description>
