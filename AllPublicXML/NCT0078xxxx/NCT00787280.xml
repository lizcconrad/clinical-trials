    <textblock>
      To evaluate whether changes in macronutrient consumption (i.e., switching to a diet low in
      carbohydrates) can change brain responses to cues depicting foods representing that
      macronutrient. In addition to answering specific questions regarding the effects of an LCKD,
      the study will provide general information about relations between brain responses to food
      cues and a broad arrive of factors including typical diet, food preferences, weight control
      history and genes.

      We propose a parallel arm randomized clinical trial of two diets—a low carbohydrate ketogenic
      diet (LCKD) and a low fat diet (LFD). Following screening, eligible participants will undergo
      a six week dietary intervention that will include 7 clinic visits at the Duke Lifestyle
      Medicine Clinic (Director: Dr. Westman). In addition to the dietary intervention,
      participants will undergo fMRI scanning on two occasions: once in the week prior to
      randomization to a diet (Baseline Scan) and after three weeks of following a diet (Post-Diet
      Scan). During scanning participants will view food cues in order to assess the effects of
      diet on brain responses to different macronutrient content categories (e.g., High vs. Low
      Complex Carbohydrate). In addition to scanning measures, we will also record information
      regarding dietary intake, food preferences, weight, mood, and diet adherence.
