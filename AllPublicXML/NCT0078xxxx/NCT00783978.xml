  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) in children represent a heterogeneous group of rare and not
      well defined disorders. Genetic abnormalities of surfactant proteins B (SFTPB) and more
      recently C (SFTPC) have been shown to be related to these pathologies. However, variability
      in the lung disease phenotype suggests the involvement of other surfactant-associated genes
      such as ABCA3 (ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member, 3). Thus, the aim of this project
      is: 1) to assess the prevalence of SFTPC mutation in children with chronic lung diseases, 2)
      to precise clinical and radiological features of children with SFTPC mutation, and 3) to
      identify environmental or genetic factors that may explain the extreme variability of this
      disease.

      The first stage of this project will be to constitute a clinical, radiological, biological
      database of children (1 moth-17 years) with severe respiratory distress and/or an unexplained
      chronic ILD. Mutations in SFTPC, SFTPB and ABCA3 will be further identified by sequencing and
      documented with using the parents blood samples.
