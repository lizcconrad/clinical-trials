  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to
      demonstrate the safety and efficacy of MILR1444A compared with placebo in reducing the airway
      reaction to an inhaled aeroallergen solution in adult patients with mild allergic asthma. The
      study will randomize approximately 24 patients at five study centers. In the event of patient
      discontinuation from the study, additional patients may be enrolled at the discretion of the
      Sponsor.
