  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-clinical data and recently published clinical data suggest a synergistic effect between
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone. We hypothesize that a combination of
      lenalidomide-dexamethasone can overcome rituximab resistance. To determine the response rate
      to lenalidomide and dexamethasone plus rituximab therapy in subjects with recurrent small
      B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who have had lymphoma progression within 6 months of being
      treated with rituximab alone or with a rituximab-containing regimen, we propose initial
      treatment with both drugs for two 28-day treatment cycles (Part I). After response assessment
      following two cycles of lenalidomide-dexamethasone, patients will enter Part II of the study.
      In Part II, patients will receive lenalidomide-dexamethasone and rituximab to evaluate the
      potential reversal of rituximab resistance as measured by response to rituximab and
      progression-free survival following rituximab.
