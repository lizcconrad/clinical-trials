  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, Phase I dose escalation-deescalation protocol (DEP) of
      cyclosporine inhalation solution in patients with Gold Stage III chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of aerosolized
      Cyclosporine in treating COPD.

      The specific aims of the study are:

        1. To identify the short term (28 day) safety profile of CyIS immunotherapy in severe COPD
           (GOLD III) patients with particular attention to airway reactivity and infection risk.

        2. To identify the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of CyIS using peripheral
           blood markers of an adaptive immune response as endpoints in subjects with severe COPD
           (GOLD III) treated short-term.

      Subjects between 45 and 70 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of COPD, Gold Stage III,
      and meet all the study requirements, will be enrolled in this study. A total of 24 subjects
      of either sex will be enrolled in this study. A total of 4 subject cohorts (n=6) will
      participate in the protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age between 45 and 70 years.

          -  A confirmed diagnosis of COPD, Gold Stage III, using current accepted diagnostic
             criteria, including clinical/laboratory findings, pulmonary function tests, and
             appropriate history to exclude other disorders that could explain their lung disease.

          -  Subjects agree to maintain a stable medication regimen in the absence of a disease
             flare

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  pCO2 &lt; 45 mm Hg, room air oxyhemoglobin saturation &gt; 85%

          -  A willingness to participate in all portions of the protocol, including serial
             bronchoscopy, requisite surveillances, and ancillary immunologic studies in follow-up
             visits at this institution.

          -  For woman of childbearing age, a negative pregnancy test, and a willingness to use two
             methods of contraception, or abstinence, and undergo monthly pregnancy testing.

          -  Elevated T-cell cytokine gene expression, defined as baseline values &gt; the mean of the
             pilot Gold 0-1 study population for one variable (CD4+IL-2 &gt;23%, CD8+IFN-g &gt;17%,
             CD8+MHC &gt; 6%, or CD8 TGF-b).
