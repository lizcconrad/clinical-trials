  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple agents have been studied to prevent radiocontrast nephropathy. One of these agents
      is N-Acetylcysteine. Previous trials to assess N-Acetylcysteine's efficacy in the prevention
      of contrast nephropathy have been promising. However, previous studies have limited
      applicability to the Emergency Department (ED) patient population for two reasons:

        -  1) Many of the pretreatment strategies employed in these studies take several hours or
           even days to perform, which is not feasible in acutely ill ED patients.

        -  2) Most of these studies were conducted in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.
           This may be a very different population than patients in the ED undergoing abdominal or
           chest computed tomography.

      The investigators wish to study the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine as an agent to prevent
      radiocontrast nephropathy in ED patients undergoing computerized tomography. The
      investigators propose a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial comparing saline hydration
      plus N-acetylcysteine versus saline hydration alone. The hypothesis of this study is that
      N-acetylcysteine with normal saline will be more effective than saline alone in the
      prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Out of the approximately 110 million Emergency Department (ED) visits in the United States
      each year approximately 8.8 million people undergo Contrast-Enhanced Computerized Tomography
      (CT) studies in United States EDs each year (based on the investigators experience).

      Radiocontrast nephropathy is a serious potential consequence associated with significant
      morbidity and mortality. Preliminary data suggests that the rate of Radiocontrast Induced
      Nephropathy after Emergency Department CT is approximately 5-7%. This figure, coupled with
      our estimate of 8.8 million contrast-enhanced CT studies, suggests that there are somewhere
      between 440,000 and 616,000 cases of radiocontrast nephropathy in the US each year that are
      caused by ED studies.

      Multiple agents have been studied to prevent radiocontrast nephropathy. One of these agents
      is N-Acetylcysteine. There is inconclusive evidence about the benefit of this intervention.
      Some studies have shown that N-Acetylcysteine administered in either a high-dose intravenous
      protocol or a low-dose intravenous plus oral protocol may reduce the incidence of
      radiocontrast nephropathy in patients undergoing emergent cardiac catheterization, although
      other studies have found no benefit.

      It is not clear, however, if these studies generalize to the ED patient undergoing emergency
      CT. ED patients often have different comorbidities or higher acuity which may limit the
      applicability in the ED patient population for two reasons:

        -  1) Many of the pretreatment strategies employed in these studies take several hours or
           even days to perform, which is not feasible in acutely ill ED patients.

        -  2) Most of these studies were conducted in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.
           This may be a very different population than patients in the ED undergoing abdominal or
           chest computed tomography.

      The investigators wish to study the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine as an agent to prevent
      radiocontrast nephropathy in ED patients undergoing computerized tomography. The
      investigators propose a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial comparing saline hydration
      plus N-acetylcysteine versus saline hydration alone. The hypothesis of this study is that
      N-acetylcysteine with normal saline will be more effective than saline alone in the
      prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be randomized to receive either of two interventions: N-acetylcysteine (Treatment group) or Normal Saline (Placebo group).
Patients in the treatment group will receive 3 g of Nacetylcysteine in 500mL normal saline (0.9% Sodium Chloride) solution during 30 minutes before contrast administration. After contrast administration, patients will receive a continuous infusion of 200mg of N-acetylcysteine per hour, administered as an infusion of 67 mL per hour of a solution of 3 g of N-acetylcysteine diluted to a total volume of 1,000 mL with normal saline solution.
Patients in the placebo group will receive 500 mL of normal saline solution during 30 minutes before contrast administration and a continuous infusion of 67 mL per hour of normal saline solution after contrast administration.
Patients in both arms will receive the postcontrast infusion (N-acetylcysteine or saline solution) for a minimum of 2 hours.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Contrast-induced nephropathy was defined as an increase in serum creatinine level of greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/dL or an increase of 25% above baseline. The primary outcome was measured by the change in serum creatinine level from the pre-radiocontrast baseline to the serum creatinine level measured 48 to 72 hours after radiocontrast administration.</description>

      <time_frame>Study participants were monitored during the infusions. Also, we performed a follow-up telephone call to identify patients who had clinically significant renal injury beyond the 72-hour period.</time_frame>
      <desc>Participants were closely monitored by the clinical team. Infusions were discontinued in the event of symptomatic hypotension requiring treatment, altered mental status, respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, oropharyngeal edema or bronchospasm requiring treatment, severe urticaria or patient discomfort, or any other event considered severe enough by the clinical team treating the patient to require discontinuation.</desc>

          <description>Participants in this group received 3 grams of N-acetylcysteine in 500 cc Normal Saline (0.9% Sodium Chloride) over 30 minutes prior to contrast administration. After contrast administration, participants received a continuous infusion of 200 mg N-acetylcysteine per hour, administered as an infusion of 67 cc per hour of a solution of 3 grams of N-acetylcysteine diluted in a total volume of 1000 cc of normal saline.</description>
