  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is designed to compare two types of images; magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) and Trans-Rectal Ultrasound (TRUS) to see which one performs more accurately
      for the image-guided insertion of Fiducial Markers(FMs) within the tumour. Though effective
      for guiding FM placement at the poles of the prostate gland due to excellent visualization of
      the prostatic boundaries, TRUS may not be ideally suited for marking the GTV. Conventional
      TRUS is neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific for accurate visualization of
      intra-prostatic tumor. A new interventional MRI technique enables needle guidance to the
      gross tumour Volume (GTV) for FM placement. It is of particular importance that both
      techniques be evaluated to enable which one is more effective so that it can be implemented
      in the designs of future trials involving dose-escalation to prostate.

    <textblock>
      The success of dose escalation strategies in prostate cancer over the last decade has relied
      on high accuracy in target delineation, localization and radiation delivery. Improved
      biochemical control with acceptable levels of toxicity (specifically rectal) has been
      achieved by stringently monitoring the location of the prostate during the course of
      radiation treatment. Studies in the early 1990's demonstrated that daily bony alignment was a
      poor surrogate for prostate gland location. Since then, various strategies have been devised
      to localize the prostate precisely during treatment. Of these, Transrectal Ultrasound
      (TRUS)-guided gold fiducial marker (FM) insertion and x-ray imaging of markers has been a
      broadly successful approach. TRUS guidance has been used for fiducial marker insertion within
      the prostate since 1985 in various centers throughout the world and has also been a standard
      practice in PMH since 1997 in men undergoing radical external beam radiotherapy. A
      retrospective comparative study of 106 patients evaluating the relative accuracy of
      endorectal MRI and TRUS in detecting the location of tumor reported an improved performance
      of endorectal MRI especially in the base and midgland regions. Over the last few years,
      mounting experience in the interpretation of prostate MRI, and addition of physiologic
      imaging sequences has further improved the performance of MRI in detecting and localizing the
      GTV.
