  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether administration of oral Vitamin D3 given over 21 days will
      change the antimicrobial peptide expression in the skin or saliva of subjects with Atopic
      Dermatitis (AD). This study will help researchers determine if the lack of the expression of
      antimicrobial peptides in individuals with AD plays a role in the susceptibility to eczema
      vaccinatum (EV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder in which the skin becomes
      extremely itchy and is susceptible to recurrent skin infections. AD is thought to occur from
      a combination of immunological, genetic, and environmental factors. Individuals with AD are
      at risk for developing a severe and widely disseminated infection called eczema vaccinatum
      (EV). EV is caused when the live attenuated vaccinia virus in the vaccine reproduces and
      spreads throughout the body. Individuals with AD lack certain antimicrobial peptides,
      specifically cathelicidins.

      This trial also includes a sub-study with individuals who have psoriasis. Psoriasis is also
      an immune-mediated skin disease, and is characterized by scaling skin and inflammation (pain,
      swelling, heat, and redness). Most psoriasis cause patches of thick, red skin with silvery
      scales. These patches can itch or feel sore. This sub-study will provide additional
      information on psoriatic responses to oral vitamin D. (Originally listed separately as
      ADVN-CATH-03-01).

          <title>Body Mass Index (BMI; kg/m^2)</title>
          <description>BMI is a number calculated from a person’s height and weight that provides a reliable indicator of body fatness for most people. Higher values reflect greater amount of body fat. [1] In adults, a BMI less than 18.5 is underweight; 18.5 to 24.9 is a normal or healthy weight; greater than or equal to 25.0 is overweight. The height and weight was collected at baseline only.

A negative value indicates a drop from baseline and a positive value indicates an increase from baseline. Cathelicidin amount is clinically significant as it is necessary to resist infection.

        <description>Human Beta-defensin 3 (HBD-3) Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) expression from skin biopsies as measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Average delta cycle threshold (CT) adjusted for non-atopic average at baseline on the arithmetic scale = [(average of (CT for CAMP - CT for Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)) across replicates) - (the average of (CT for CAMP - CT for GAPDH) for non-atopic subjects at baseline)]. A negative value indicates a drop from baseline and a positive value indicates an increase from baseline. HBD-3 amount is clinically significant as it is necessary to resist infection. HBD-3 amount is not known to be clinically relevant to the clinical signs of dermatitis associated with AD.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline on Day 21 in Relative Abundance of IL-13 mRNA in Lesional and Non-Lesional Skin for Atopic Dermatitis (AD) Participants Who Received Vitamin D3 Versus Vitamin D3-Placebo</title>
          <description>Cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13) Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) expression from skin biopsies measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Average delta cycle threshold (CT) adjusted for non-atopic average at baseline on the arithmetic scale = [(average of (CT for CAMP - CT for Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)) across replicates) - (the average of (CT for CAMP - CT for GAPDH) for non-atopic subjects at baseline)]. A negative value indicates a drop from baseline and a positive value indicates an increase from baseline. A decrease in IL-13 may be clinically correlated with improvement of AD.</description>
