      This pilot study is mainly aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the percutaneous
      Angiojet Rheolytic Thrombectomy (ART) in patients presenting a MPE. Secondarily the
      effectiveness of this treatment modality will also be estimated.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in our society with more
      than 150.000 deaths every year in the US. Usually mortality occurs in the first hour after
      symptoms onset (up to 11%) and may further increase up to 17% at 3 months follow-up.

      In case of massive PE (MPE) mortality dramatically increases up to 30% despite important
      improvements recently made in precocious diagnosis and aggressive medical treatments (i.e.
      i.v. thrombolysis).

      Quite often (up to 40%) in case of PE there is at least one relative fibrinolysis
      contraindication, and less frequently these contraindications are absolute. In these quite
      rare cases, where thrombolytic therapy is absolutely contraindicated, a surgical
      thrombo-embolectomy is advised, however this kind of challenging surgery is not available
      world-wide and it still remains associated with a prohibitive high rate of mortality.

      A less invasive alternative remains the percutaneous thrombectomy, which may further be
      divided into:

        -  Aspiration thrombectomy,

        -  Fragmentation thrombectomy,

        -  Rheloytic thrombectomy. The first transvenous percutaneous pulmonary embolectomy was
           performed more than 30 years ago; however, it is only recently that, thanks to new
           developed technologies, phyisicians manifest an increased interest in developing this
           promising less invasive procedure.

      The angiojet rheolytic thrombectomy (ART) catheter (Angiojet : Possis medical ; Minneapolis,
      MN, USA) utilizes high velocity saline jets for thrombus aspiration, maceration and
      evacuation through the Bernoulli principle. Nowadays this technology is successfully utilized
      daily in the coronary and peripheral artery fields (i.e. thrombus aspiration during coronary
      or arterial angioplasty).

      Due to its safety and efficacy, demonstrated in randomized trials including patients with
      coronary artery disease, several recent reports also confirmed the usefulness of this ART
      also in extra-coronary domain (peripheral arterial and venous diseases).

      Massive PE, as the thrombotic coronary artery occlusion, is a life threatening clinical
      manifestation, therefore several centers began to manage it associating mechanical (i.e.ART)
      clot removal and pharmacological (i.e. lysis).

      The first small, retrospective non randomized series suggest the safety and efficacy of this
      technology, confirming its feasibility compared with the actual proposed treatment of MPE
      (i.e. i.v. or in-situ pulmonary thrombolysis).

      The first in man utilization of the Angiojet rheolytic thrombectomy for treating acute
      massive PE dates 1997, however in-vitro tests also revealed that Angiojet is able to
      successfully remove thrombus up to 14 days old, thus enlarging its usefulness also in
      sub-acute cases (i.e.&gt;14 days old thrombus).

      Despite the fact that indication of an i.v. fibrinolysis is worldwide accepted in case of MPE
      and that established lysis protocols are nowadays available, mortality remains unacceptably
      high (up to 30%) and bleeding related morbidity a major concern. In fact in large PE
      registries, up to 20% of the patients experienced major bleedings complications, and in 3% of
      the cases this was intracranial.

      Of interest in case of sub-massive PE (sub-MPE), which is also associated with a quite high
      mortality (up to 8%) some disagreement concerning the best treatment modality still persists.
      Several authors support an intensive treatment modality favourizing the systemic i.v.
      thrombolysis; however, others suggest a more conservative attitude (anticoagulation alone
      with fibrinolysis only in case of clinical deterioration). These cases of sub-MPE may be very
      challenging, because an established consensus of the definition of sub-MPE combining
      clinical, radiological and cardiological criteria are still lacking. Furthermore the
      thrombolytic regimen is not complication-free, suggesting that, before performing an i.v.
      thrombolysis, the physician in charge of the patient has to seriously take in consideration
      all the absolute and the relative contra-indications of such a treatment. (i.e.recent
      surgery, active peptic ulcer, intra-cerebral bleeding, pregnancy, neoplasm, see Table 1).

      The ongoing debate on how to improve mortality in patients with MPE and concerning the
      correct managing of patients with sub-MPE suggests that in both cases, there is an urgent
      need of improving the actual treatment modalities.

    <description>The Angiojet catheter is a double lumen catheter percutaneously introduced via the common femoral vein into the main pulmonary trunk or the affected pulmonary artery respectively. One lumen serves to deliver high pressure saline jets into the thrombus and the other effluent lumen serves for clot removal utilizing a localized pressure region (Venturi effect) that attracts the thrombus for fragmentation into small particles. The fragmented debris are then pushed out through the evacuation line as a result of the retrograde high pressure saline jets, finally transporting them into a collection bag.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients aged &gt;18 years old

          2. Patients presenting a MPE (i.e. hemodynamically unstable at moment of the inclusion
             (i.e. shock index (SI) &gt;1).

          3. Patients where a hemodynamic stability (SI=1) is hardly obtained despite increasing
             dose of drug support.

               -  If after 2 hours from the first medical contact where an intensive fluid
                  substitution and cathecolamine support is begun the patient remains with a SI =
                  1, he/she could be included in the ART protocol.

               -  If after an initial successful drug support (fluid + catecholamine) the patient
                  represents a second episode of hemodynamic instability, he/she could be included
                  in the ART protocol.

               -  If the patient is under chronic negative chronotrope medication
                  (e.g.beta-blockers) a SI = 1 will be sufficient to include the patient in the
                  study

          4. The MPE have to be confirmed by thorax CT-scan or suspected by echocardiography
             (i.e.visualized thrombus on the RV or main pulmonary trunk or RV overload with a high
             clinical suspicion of MPE).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Very unstable patients with life threatening MPE where the time delays to transport
             them in the cathterization laboratory (i.e. &lt;30 minutes) to perform the ART procedure
             is not acceptable because the systemic i.v. thrombolysis have to be immediately
             initiated in the emergency department.

          2. Patients where a percutaneous right heart catheterization via the common femoral vein
             is contraindicated (e.g.vascular malformation, inferior cava vein occlusion, presence
             of bilateral ilio-femoral thrombosis, RV or pulmonary trunk malformation).

          3. Patients with sub-MPE without any other clinical or para-clinical sign of severity
             (e.g. haemodynamically stable = SI&lt;1).

          4. Patients where the clinical evaluation estimated that the observed episode of MPE is
             older than 14 days (i.e. sub-acute phase with organized thrombus = ART less
             efficacious).

          5. Patient with an estimated clearance to creatinine less than 30 ml/min.

          6. Patients or members of their family who refused to give their signed informed
             consenstement.

          7. Patient haemodynamically very unstable where the first clinical evaluation concludes
             that every therapeutic effort including the ART procedure or a systemic fibrinolysis
             will not change the short-term prognosis of the patient (i.e. imminent death).

          8. Patients with a life expectancy of &lt;3months for other medical pre-existing conditions.
