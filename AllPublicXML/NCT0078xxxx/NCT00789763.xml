      Safety profile and to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / Recommended Dose (DR) of
      Sorafenib in combination with Gemcitabine and Radiotherapy

      Definition of maximum tolerated dose (MTD):

      The MTD is defined as the highest dose level which can be given to 6 patients such that no
      more than 1 patient experiences a DLT .

      Definition of Recommended Dose (DR):

      Is the MTD

      Definition of Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT):

      DLT will be defined as any of the following occurring during the period of treatment and
      regarded as related to the combination regimen.

        -  Grade 4 thrombocytopenia persisting greater than 4 days, or with bleeding requiring
           platelet transfusion

        -  Grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 days

        -  Febrile neutropenia (≥ 38.5oC) with an absolute neutrophil count ≤ 1000/mm3

        -  Any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity related to the combination [occurring despite
           optimal supportive care, if applicable] except hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, deep venous
           thrombosis, or hyperbilirubinemia secondary to stent malfunction.

        -  Hypertension that is symptomatic and not managed by maximal use of three different
           classes of antihypertensives, or any episode of malignancy hypertension

      (Detailed Dose Modifications and G-CSF use in case of febrile neutropenia will be outlined in
      the full protocol version)

      Phase II

      Primary objective:

      Activity profile evaluating Progression-free rates (PFR) at 6 months

      Secondary objective:

      Response rate Overall survival Toxicity profile
