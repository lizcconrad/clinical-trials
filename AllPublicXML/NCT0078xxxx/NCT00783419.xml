      A retrospective review of women who came through the ER at SMH with a pelvic inflammatory
      disease (PID) or tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) between 1995-2005. They were looking at people
      with this diagnosis to determine how they were treated, whether as inpatient or outpatient
      and whether they were treated with drugs and how were these given and also did they develop
      an abscess.
