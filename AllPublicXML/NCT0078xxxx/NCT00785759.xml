    <description>All subjects will receive an I.V. dose of [18F]AH110690 (less than 10 mg of total AH110690). The target activity of a single administration of [18F]AH110690 will be 185 MBq (equivalent to a dose of approximately 6 mSv).</description>

          -  The subject meets Petersen criteria for amnestic MCI.

          -  The subject has no evidence of cognitive impairment by medical history.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject may not be able to complete the study as judged by the investigator.

          -  The subject has received ionising radiation exposure from clinical trials in the last
             12 months or has participated in any other clinical study within 30 days of study
             entry.

          -  The subject has known allergies to [18F]AH110690 or [11C]PIB or their constituents.

          -  The subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  The subject has a history of alcohol and/or drug abuse within the last 2 years based
             upon a review of medical records.
