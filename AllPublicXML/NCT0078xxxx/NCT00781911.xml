    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Rate at Six Months</measure>
    <time_frame>From Start of Study Treatment to Progressive Disease or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 6 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants who are alive and progression-free at 6 month from start of the study treatment over all participants. PFS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment until the date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. Disease progression was assessed via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0, and defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the baseline measurements, and/or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s), and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions. Participants without documentation of progression or death will be censored at the date of last tumor assessment. The PFS was estimated by the binomial distribution and Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <time_frame>From Start of Treatment Baseline to Disease Progression (Up to 18 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Modified ORR is defined as CR+ PR + MR. According to RECIST v1.0, CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR defined as a &gt;30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of the target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the LD and MR defined as 20% - 29% reduction. Disease progression defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the baseline measurements, and/or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s), and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions.</description>

        <description>Percentage of participants who are alive and progression-free at 6 month from start of the study treatment over all participants. PFS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment until the date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. Disease progression was assessed via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0, and defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the baseline measurements, and/or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s), and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions. Participants without documentation of progression or death will be censored at the date of last tumor assessment. The PFS was estimated by the binomial distribution and Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <description>Modified ORR is defined as CR+ PR + MR. According to RECIST v1.0, CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR defined as a &gt;30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of the target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the LD and MR defined as 20% - 29% reduction. Disease progression defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the baseline measurements, and/or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s), and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions.</description>
