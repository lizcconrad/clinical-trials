    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare oxycodone/naloxone combination tablet and
      codeine/paracetamol tablets in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic low back pain or
      pain due to osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, 12-week study to assess the
      efficacy and tolerability of oxycodone/naloxone compared to codeine/paracetamol tablets in
      the treatment of moderate to severe chronic low back pain or moderate to severe pain due to
      OA of the hip and /or knee.

      The screening period will be 3 - 7 days duration. If a subject meets all the screening
      criteria they may enter the Run-in Period.

      During the screening period subjects will continue to take their pre-study pain medication.

      The run-in period will be 7 - 14 days duration. During the run-in period subjects will
      continue to take their pre-study pain medication.

      Visit 3 will occur at the end of the Run-in Period (7-14 days after Visit 2). To qualify for
      entry into the treatment period of the study, subjects must have uncontrolled pain as shown
      by average daily pain scores of &gt;5 on 4 of the last 7 days of the run in period.

      Eligible subjects will be randomised to either oxycodone/naloxone or codeine/paracetamol
      tablets. Subjects will receive double-blind study medication for up to 12 weeks.

    <description>The primary objective was to demonstrate non inferiority of Oxycodone/Naloxone Prolonged Release (OXN PR) compared to codeine/paracetamol in moderate to severe pain as assessed by BS-11 average daily pain scores. The Box Scale-11 is a scale from 0 to 10 (i.e. 0, 1, 2...10), where the subject records their daily pain over the previous 24 hours, by circling the relevant box, where 0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine. This value is the value recorded at week 12 (average pain over the last 24 hours)</description>

    <measure>Number of Intakes of Rescue Medication (Ibuprofen) Between Visit 8 and Visit 9 for the 2 Groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Between visit 8 and 9</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the number of intakes of rescue medication use (ibuprofen) for breakthrough pain between OXN (Oxycodone/Naloxone) and codeine/paracetamol groups. Ibuprofen tablets (400mg up to 3 times per day) were available as rescue medication. This was recorded by the subject in their diary whenever it was taken. The discrepancy in numbers of patients at this stage (between Visit 8 and Visit 9) is due to subject withdrawal during the study. The mean values presented are the &quot;number of intakes of rescue medication&quot; for this period (ie between Visit 8 and Visit 9).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects at least 18 years or older.

          2. Female subjects less than one year post-menopausal must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test recorded prior to the first dose of study medication, be non-lactating,
             and willing to use adequate and reliable contraception throughout the study. A highly
             effective method of birth control is defined as those which result in a low failure
             rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as
             sterilization, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs, sexual
             abstinence or vasectomised partner.

          3. Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of degenerative or primary OA whose primary pain
             site is of the hip(s) and/or knee(s) and that require around-the-clock opioid therapy
             in which the diagnosis may be supported by evidence such as one of the following: MRI,
             CAT, arthroscopy or x-ray. The clinical imaging of OA may include one or more of the
             following features: joint space narrowing, degenerative changes, osteophyte formation
             or subchondral cysts. Subjects will identify the most painful joint (hip or knee) for
             documentation of OA. Pain measurement will be done at this joint only.

          4. Subjects with moderate to severe chronic low back pain e.g osteoarthritis, spinal
             stenosis, spondylolisthesis, failed back surgery, scoliosis, discogenic disorders such
             as herniated disc.

          5. Subjects who are currently receiving codeine/paracetamol combination tablets up to a
             maximum dose of 120 mg codeine per day or tramadol up to a maximum dose of 100 mg/day
             or dihydrocodeine / paracetamol tablets up to a maximum dose of 120 mg dihydrocodeine
             per day.

          6. Subjects willing and able to participate in all aspects of the core study, including
             use of oral medication, completion of subjective evaluations, attending scheduled
             clinic visits, completing telephone contacts, and compliance with protocol
             requirements as evidenced by providing written, informed consent.

          7. Subjects in which the pre-study, non-opioid analgesics, and all other concomitant
             medications, including those medications for the treatment of depression are
             anticipated to remain stable throughout the treatment phase of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any history of hypersensitivity to oxycodone, naloxone, codeine, ibuprofen, bisacodyl
             or related products and ingredients.

          2. Any contraindication to oxycodone, naloxone, codeine, paracetamol or ibuprofen.

          3. Subjects with evidence of significant structural abnormalities of the GI tract (e.g.,
             bowel obstruction, strictures) or any diseases/conditions that affect bowel transit

          9. Subjects with evidence of clinically unstable disease, as determined by medical
             history, clinical laboratory tests, ECG results, and physical examination that, in the
             investigator's opinion, preclude entry into the study.

         10. Subjects with evidence of impaired liver/kidney function upon entry into the study
             defined as: Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or alkaline
             phosphatase levels &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal; Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase
             ≥5 times the upper limit of normal; Total bilirubin level outside of the reference

             with the Medical Monitor it is confirmed the subject does not have renal impairment
             that would preclude the subject's inclusion in the study; In the investigator's
             opinion the subject has liver and/or kidney impairment to the extent that the subject
             should not participate in this study.

         11. Subjects who have required treatment for the diagnosis of IBS.

         12. Subjects receiving hypnotics or other CNS depressants that, in the investigator's

         13. Subjects with a history of depression or other psychiatric disorder that in the
             opinion of the investigator is significant enough to exclude the subject from the
             study.

         14. Subjects who are currently involved in legal action regarding their pain condition or
             subjects in which their pain condition may be of a psychiatric nature.

         15. Subjects receiving opioid substitution therapy for opioid addiction (e.g., methadone
             or buprenorphine).

         16. Subjects presently taking, or who have taken naloxone or naltrexone within 30 days of
             study entry (defined as the start of the Screening Period).

         17. Surgery within 2 months prior to the start of the Screening Period, or planned surgery
             during the12-week treatment period that may affect GI motility or pain levels.

        <title>Average Daily Pain Score Box Scale-11 (BS-11) Recorded at Week 12 (Average Pain Over Last 24 Hours)</title>
        <description>The primary objective was to demonstrate non inferiority of Oxycodone/Naloxone Prolonged Release (OXN PR) compared to codeine/paracetamol in moderate to severe pain as assessed by BS-11 average daily pain scores. The Box Scale-11 is a scale from 0 to 10 (i.e. 0, 1, 2...10), where the subject records their daily pain over the previous 24 hours, by circling the relevant box, where 0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine. This value is the value recorded at week 12 (average pain over the last 24 hours)</description>

        <description>To compare the number of intakes of rescue medication use (ibuprofen) for breakthrough pain between OXN (Oxycodone/Naloxone) and codeine/paracetamol groups. Ibuprofen tablets (400mg up to 3 times per day) were available as rescue medication. This was recorded by the subject in their diary whenever it was taken. The discrepancy in numbers of patients at this stage (between Visit 8 and Visit 9) is due to subject withdrawal during the study. The mean values presented are the &quot;number of intakes of rescue medication&quot; for this period (ie between Visit 8 and Visit 9).</description>
