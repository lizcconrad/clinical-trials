  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cataract extraction is one of the most common operative procedures performed throughout the
      world. Conventionally, patients are discharged with postoperative drops of steroids and
      antibiotics or a combination of both. These drops are to be administered for 2-6 weeks
      depending on individual eye unit protocol. Many patients find the postoperative drops arduous
      and non-compliance can cause prolonged inflammation and discomfort. Patients with cognitive,
      physical and visual impairments require assistance from family or community nurses to
      administer drops. A single perioperative injection of Triamcinolone has been shown to be an
      effective replacement for drops postoperatively in two previous studies 1, 2.

      Aims &amp; objectives

      The aim of this study is to see if a single orbital floor injection of Triamcinolone is
      equivalent to conventional steroid and antibiotic drops used post operatively in uneventful
      phacoemulsification surgery in treating postoperative inflammation.

      This is a prospective randomized control trial of 80 patients undergoing routine
      phacoemulsification cataract extraction. The patients were randomly assigned to receive the
      triamcinolone injection or post operative topical treatment of G Maxitriol QDS 1/52 tapering
      over one month. Forty mg of triamcinolone was injected inferior temporally immediately post
      operatively prior to undraping the patient in theatre in those randomized to this group. The
      patients were reviewed at week one and at one month.
