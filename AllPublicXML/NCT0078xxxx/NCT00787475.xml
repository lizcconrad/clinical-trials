      The objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a community health worker
      intervention at helping to control diabetes among Latinos with poorly controlled Type 2
      diabetes.

      Hypothesis: Compared to those in Enhanced usual care group, patients randomized to the
      intervention will, at 12 months, have greater reductions in: (1) HgA1C; (2) low density
      lipoprotein (LDL); and (3) systolic and diastolic BP.

      The objective of this project is to examine the effectiveness of a community health worker
      (CHW) intervention at addressing glycemic control among Latinos with poorly controlled Type 2
      diabetes. Our group has worked with a promising model of intervention that utilizes CHW's
      based at one of our major community partners. Pilot data from this program has shown
      clinically significant prepost test improvements in HgA1C. Using the Chronic Care Model as an
      overarching framework, the study design of NOCHOP is a randomized controlled trial of 360
      Latinos, mostly of Caribbean descent, aged 35-70 years with HgA1C &gt;=8.0. At a minimum,
      subjects in the intervention group will receive four home visits, ten group level visits and
      monthly phone calls by CHWs based at Alianza. The control groups will receive three separate
      mailings of bilingual diabetes health education materials. The primary outcome is glycemic
      control at 12month follow up, as measured by HgA1c. The secondary outcomes are changes in
      cholesterol and blood pressure (BP). We will also collect exploratory data on potential
      mechanisms through which our intervention resulted in hypothesized improvements including
      medication adherence, medication Intensification, diet and exercise. If successful, our
      project will make an important contribution to ongoing national and local debates about the
      sustainability of CHW programs. In particular, data from this study would be extremely useful
      for local Medicaid managed care plans who have expressed strong interests in data from
      rigorously designed clinical trials addressing the role of CHWs in delivering culturally
      appropriate and effective diabetes care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients age 35-70 years*

          -  Receiving care at our clinic (2 visits with a primary care provider in the previous
             year)

          -  Living in Northern Manhattan or Western Bronx (based on zip codes)

          -  Had a hemoglobin A1C-done within the past year, with the latest value being &gt; or = 8.0

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients whose primary care physician (PCP) believes are not appropriate candidates
             for participation

          -  Type 1 diabetics (identified by PCP), as their care is quite distinct from that of
             Type II patients, and there are very few such patients in our clinic

          -  Patients with diabetes diagnosed when under age 25 (&quot;new-onset&quot; Type I diabetes) as
             such patients are extremely rare in our primary care clinics

          -  Patients who do not self-identify as Hispanic (Hispanics can be of any race e.g.
             white, black, mixed)

          -  Any life-threatening or extreme medical co-morbidity, such as an active cancer
             diagnosis, paraplegia, or end stage cardio-pulmonary disease

          -  Having a diabetes diagnosis for &lt; 1 year, to ensure the stability of hemoglobin A1C
             values above 8.0

          -  Planning to move out of the neighborhood during the next year

          -  Planning to travel out of the neighborhood for more than three consecutive months

          -  Enrollment in any other cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes intervention study
