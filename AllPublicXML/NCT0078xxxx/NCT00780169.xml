      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, the maximum tolerated dose and the
      recommended dose for phase II studies of a chemotherapy-combination of sorafenib, irinotecan,
      and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/folinic acid (FA) (FOLFIRI) as first-line treatment for metastatic
      colorectal cancer.

      A standard phase I dose escalation design with three to six patients per dose level will be
      used. The first three patients will receive chemotherapy at the dose level 1 for 4 weeks (2
      FOLFIRI regimen). The dose will be escalated for the next patients by one dose level if none
      of the three patients at a dose level experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the
      first six weeks. Intrapatient dose escalation is not allowed. If one of the three patients
      has a DLT, an additional three patients will be enrolled at this dose level and the dose will
      be escalated if no additional patients experience a DLT. Otherwise, the dose escalation will
      be stopped, and the last dose will be regarded as the Maximum Administered Dose (MAD). The
      preceding dose level will be declared the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). This dose level will
      be the recommended dose (RD). At least 6 patients will be treated at the MTD. The cohort at
      the MTD dose level can be expanded to as many as 12 patients to gain experience with the
      toxicities and efficacy of Sorafenib + FOLFIRI combination over a broad patient range.
      Patients experiencing a DLT during the first cycle of treatment will have the drug withheld.
      They will be eligible for repeated treatment at a lower dose or treated off protocol.

      Treatment is to be discontinued in cases of serious or unmanageable toxicity or request by
      the patient. Otherwise therapy will continue until clinically or radiologically documented
      disease progression.
