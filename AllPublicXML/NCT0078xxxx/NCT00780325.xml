  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors have become a common analgesic treatment option for
      patients with arthritis. However, long-term treatment has been associated with increased
      cardiovascular risk. With the past withdrawals and rejections of approval for COX-2
      inhibitors the treatment options are now very limited.

      This translates for example to about 10 million osteoarthritis patients in the US who cannot
      receive COX-2 inhibitors because of concomitant hypertension. And this exemplifies the unmet
      medical need to develop and offer safe treatment options for this particular patient
      population.

      This trial investigates pharmacodynamic aspects of CG100649 which is being developed as a
      novel COX-2 inhibitor. Preclinical data show a dual mechanism of action, which consists of
      the inhibition of the two enzymes COX-2 and carbonic anhydrase-I/-II (CA-I/II) and through
      which the cardiovascular risk of COX-2 inhibition might be attenuated.

      Part 1 and 2 (staged analysis): Single dose of study drugs [celecoxib, placebo] followed by 3
      days of blood draws as Period I; then after a wash-out phase, single dose of study drugs
      [CG100649 2mg and 8mg, celecoxib 200mg, placebo], followed by blood draws on 6 days and
      bi-weekly urine collections for 8 weeks.

      Part 3: Five-way cross-over of single doses of study drugs with a CG100649 single dose level
      as determined by part 1 and 2, celecoxib 200mg, naproxen 500mg, acetazolamide 250mg and
      placebo.
