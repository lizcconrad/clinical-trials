    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1.
        - Histological or cytological confirmed diagnosis of a solid tumor. In the dose escalation
        phase, the tumor must be unresectable and locally advanced, or metastatic, and either no
        proven effective therapy exists or the patient cannot tolerate such therapy. Patients
        enrolled in the expanded MTD phase of the study must have either HCC or another select
        tumor type (melanoma, head and neck, colorectal, breast, or thyroid). For HCC patients in
        the expanded MTD phase: - Documentation of original biopsy for diagnosis is acceptable if
        tumor tissue is unavailable. Histological confirmation is mandatory for patients without
        cirrhosis. - Patients with cirrhosis may have a clinical diagnosis of HCC by the American
        Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria.-cytotoxic chemotherapy; a
        targeted agent, including sorafenib; or other experimental treatment) are eligible. For
        non-HCC patients in the expanded MTD phase: - The tumor must be amenable to biopsy and the
        patient must be willing to consent to biopsy. - Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months. - Evidence
        of measurable disease by RECIST criteria on computer assisted tomography (CT) or magnetic
        resonance imaging (MRI). - Normal/adequate swallowing capability, functional small bowel
        intact, and no malabsorption problems (in order to maximally quantify PK absorption
        characteristics). - Amylase and lipase &lt; or equal to 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN). -
        Hemoglobin &gt; or equal to 8.5 g/L. - ANC &gt; or equal to 1,500/mm3. - Platelet count &gt; or
        equal to 75,000/mm3. - Total bilirubin &lt; or equal to 1.5 x ULN (For patients with HCC,
        refer to criterion number 14). - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase
        (ALT) &lt; or equal to 2.5 x ULN (&lt; or equal to 5 x ULN for patients with liver involvement).
        - PT-INR/PTT &lt; or equal to 1.5 x ULN (Patients who are being prophylactically
        anti-coagulated with an agent such as coumadin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or
        therapeutically anti-coagulated with LMWH will be allowed to participate provided that they
        meet these criteria; in addition, these patients must be monitored at appropriate intervals
        throughout the study). - Patients with HCC should have a Child-Pugh score of 5-6 (Class A).
        - Creatinine &lt; or equal to 1.5 x ULN. - Patients must not be pregnant or breast-feeding, as
        chemotherapy is thought to present substantial risk to the fetus/infant. Men and women of
        reproductive potential may not participate in this study unless they have agreed to use an
        effective contraceptive method while on study. - No severe or uncontrolled intercurrent
        illness that in the opinion of the investigator would adversely impact the safety or
        efficacy of the treatment. - Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written
        informed consent form. - Patients must be within normal range cardiac function as measured
        by echocardiogram or multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan. Exclusion Criteria: - Previous
        treatment with sorafenib that required a dose reduction due to toxicity. - Previous
        treatment with RDEA119. - Patients who have had cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy
        within 4 weeks prior to entering the study, those who have not recovered from adverse
        events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier, those who have concurrent use
        of cytotoxic chemotherapy not indicated in the study protocol, or those with use of any
        other investigational agents &lt; 4 weeks from the first dose of the study drug. - Previous or
        concurrent cancer that is distinct in primary site or histology from the cancer being
        evaluated in the study except cervical carcinoma in situ, treated basal cell carcinoma,
        superficial bladder tumors [Ta, Tis &amp; T1] or any cancer curatively treated &gt; 3 years prior
        to study entry. - Swallowing dysfunction and/or malabsorption syndrome that would impair
        sorafenib and RDEA119 treatment. - Cardiac disease: Congestive heart failure &gt; New York
        Heart Association (NYHA) Class 2. Patients must not have unstable angina or new onset
        angina (within the last 3 months) or myocardial infarction (MI) within the past 6 months. -
        Cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy. - Uncontrolled
        hypertension - Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. - Thrombotic or embolic
        events such as cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attacks within the
        past 6 months. - Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. - Major
        surgery, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of first dose of study
        drug. - The use of inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 enzymes, as well as the
        concurrent treatment with any of the agents listed in Section 3.7 of the protocol. These
        and other medications that are inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 should be
        discussed with the sponsor. - Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the drugs or
        components given in this protocol. - Patients with abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal (GI)
        perforation, intra-abdominal abscess, or small bowel resection, any of which is within 6
        months of study entry. - Patients with abdominal radiation resulting in chronic diarrhea. -
        Patients with documented central nervous system (CNS) metastasis who are not off steroids
        and other CNS therapies. - Evidence of uncontrolled active infections except HCV and HBV. -
        Other serious medical or psychiatric illness that would not permit the patient to be
        managed according to the protocol.
