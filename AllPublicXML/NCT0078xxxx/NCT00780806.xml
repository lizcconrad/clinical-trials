        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female subject between the ages of &gt;=18 and &lt;=40 years

          -  Negative urine pregnancy test for all female subjects of childbearing potential prior
             to test article administration and at the completion of the study.

          -  All female or male subjects who are biologically capable of having children must agree
             to abstinence or commit to the use of a reliable method of birth control during for
             the duration of the study and for 30 days after early discontinuation. 4. Hemoglobin
             levels &gt;=12.0 and &lt;=16.5 g/dL for female subjects and &gt;=13.0 and &lt;=18.5 g/dL for male
             subjects.

          -  Blood pressure: Systolic blood pressure &gt;90 and &lt;160 mm Hg; Diastolic blood pressure
             &gt;60 and &lt;95 mm Hg.

          -  Body weight &gt;=45 and &lt;=120 kg.

          -  Able to be contacted by telephone during the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding women

          -  Prior vaccination with a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine.

          -  A previous anaphylactic or severe vaccine-associated adverse reaction.

          -  A known hypersensitivity to any study vaccine components.

          -  A known or suspected disease of the immune system or those receiving immunosuppressive
             therapy, including systemic corticosteroids (excluding topical, inhalation and
             intra-articular corticosteroids).

          -  Bleeding diathesis or condition associated with prolonged bleeding time that would
             contraindicate intramuscular injection.

          -  Receipt of any blood products, including gamma globulin, in the period from 6 months
             before study vaccination through the study conclusion.

          -  Receipt of an inactivated vaccine within 14 days before study vaccinations and live
             attenuated vaccine within 28 days before study vaccination. This will apply throughout
             the study until the last vaccination.

          -  Any clinically significant chronic disease that, in the investigator's judgment may be
             worsened by blood draw.

          -  Received any investigational drug, vaccine or device within the 30-day period before
             study visit 1 and during the conduct of the study.

          -  History of culture-proven invasive disease caused by N meningitidis or N gonorrhoea.
