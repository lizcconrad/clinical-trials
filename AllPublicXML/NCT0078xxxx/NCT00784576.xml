      The objective of the present research is to evaluate the incidence and independent predictors
      of delirium observed among patients after cardiac surgery. Moreover, to asses the sensitivity
      and specificity of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition
      criteria (DSM-IV) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related
      Problems - Tenth Revision criteria (ICD-10), and the cut-off values of the Memorial Delirium
      Assessment Scale (MDAS) and Delirium Index (DI) in diagnosing postoperative delirium.

    <textblock>
      Since 1954, the issue of delirium as a complication following cardiac surgery has been
      extensively investigated. Despite this, postoperative delirium is still a serious event that
      results in higher morbidity and mortality rates, and prolongs hospitalisation.

      Moreover, there is a considerable discrepancy between studies on the incidence and risk
      factors of delirium among cardiac surgery patients.The first potential reason for this
      observation is retrospective design of some studies, secondly, the modest number of
      participants in numerous prospective studies which does not provide strong statistical power
      to select patients with delirium and detect risk factors of this complication. Unfortunately,
      reports with a more considerable number of patients often have methodological limitations.
      Additionally, in previous studies authors usually analyzed pre- and intraoperative variables
      ignoring potential postoperative risk factors of delirium. Finally, some variables which seem
      to have a crucial role in aetiology of delirium after cardiac surgery, particularly
      perioperative hypoxia, anaemia, and preoperative psychiatric disorders like depression and
      cognitive impairment, have not been properly investigated to date.

      Therefore, we made an effort to design a prospective study on the incidence and predictors of
      delirium after different types of cardiac surgery, conducted by experienced investigators,
      and with the use of valid diagnostic tools.To our knowledge this is the first research
      pointing out the association between preoperative psychiatric comorbidity, anaemia and
      postoperative hypoxia, and delirium after cardiac surgery.
