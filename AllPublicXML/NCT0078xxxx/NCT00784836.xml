    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the immunogenicity of Avonex® (interferon
      beta-1a) 30 mcg when administered subcutaneously (SC) to interferon-naïve participants with
      relapsing multiple sclerosis. The secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of Avonex® 30 mcg when administered SC to interferon-naïve subjects
      with relapsing MS.

    <description>AE: any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational product. SAE: any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; in the view of the investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the investigator, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.</description>

             inclusive.

          -  All male subjects and female participants of child-bearing potential must practice
             effective contraception during the study and be willing and able to continue
