  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to determine how FDG-PET, breast MRI and breast ultrasound
      can be incorporated into the assessment of treatment responses in women with LABC undergoing
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A prospective cohort study will be conducted evaluating the ability
      of FDG-PET, breast MRI and breast ultrasound to detect the presence of residual tumour in
      patients with LABC who have completed treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to
      mastectomy.

    <textblock>
      Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) is usually treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      followed by surgery and radiation. At present, monitoring of tumour responses to chemotherapy
      is primarily carried out using physical examination at the beginning of each chemotherapy
      cycle. Differentiating viable tumour tissue from inflammation or fibrotic scar tissue can be
      difficult. There is a growing body of evidence that newer imaging techniques such as positron
      emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be better at determining
      whether or not the tumour is actually shrinking. The purpose of this study is to determine
      the sensitivity and specificity of PET, MRI and ultrasound in evaluating tumour responses to
      chemotherapy in patients with LABC and compare this with physical examination, which is the
      current standard of care.

      Two of the objectives of this study are to 1) determine whether PET, MRI or ultrasound have a
      higher sensitivity/specificity than physical examination alone in determining which LABC
      patients achieve a complete pathologic response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 2) to
      investigate whether these additional investigations might lead to changes in clinical
      management by identifying non-responders earlier than with physical examination alone.

      A prospective cohort study design will be conducted. Patients with LABC who receive
      chemotherapy will undergo physical examination, PET, MRI, and ultrasound at baseline, midway,
      and at the completion of chemotherapy. Approximately 100 patients will be accrued over a
      5-year period.

      This study will give clinicians further insight into the usefulness of PET, MRI, and
      ultrasound in monitoring treatment responses in patients with LABC. This could potentially
      lead to changes in clinical management of these patients.

             sarcoma or lymphoma)

          -  Patients having a clinical diagnosis of locally advanced breast cancer (T3 or T4, or
             N2 according to TNM classification) including inflammatory breast cancer.

          -  Patients must be able to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
