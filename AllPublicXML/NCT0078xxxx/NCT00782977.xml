      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of continuous oxygen provided by
      nasal prongs in preventing or delaying hypoxemia during the apneic period that occurs after
      induction of general anesthesia. This will be evaluated by measuring the arterial oxygen
      tension (PaO2).

      The study will also evaluate whether there is any difference in PaO2 when using nasal prongs
      with flow rates of 5 L/minute versus 10 L/minute of oxygen.

      Certain patient populations are at risk for rapid desaturation and the rapid development of
      hypoxemia (eg. morbidly obese and pregnant patients). Using pulse oximetry, it has already
      been shown that oxygen provided with a catheter inserted into the nasopharynx is effective in
      delaying the desaturation that occurs with apnea before the trachea is intubated. It has also
      been shown that apneic oxygenation with nasal prongs at 5 L/min during fibreoptic intubation
      can delay the onset of hypoxemia.

      The study will evaluate whether there is any significant difference in the PaO2 (arterial
      oxygen tension, as measured by an arterial blood gas) when nasal prongs are used to provide
      apneic oxygenation in paralyzed patients at flows of 5 L/min compared to 10 L/min.

      The study aims to demonstrate that apneic oxygenation using nasal prongs is effective in
      preventing or delaying hypoxemia (by measuring PaO2), and that this technique may be used to
      prevent morbidity and mortality in all clinical areas (not only in the Operating Room
      environment) where airway management is undertaken.
