  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trauma patients are at risk for serious head trauma. The consequences of serious head trauma
      are often life altering. Currently, the only method available to rapidly assess the severity
      of head injury and need for neurosurgical intervention is the CT scan. This time consuming
      test requires transportation of a potentially unstable patient to the CT scanner.

      The investigators goal in traumatic brain injury is to identify early those patients who may
      require neurosurgical intervention. Brain swelling (elevated intracranial pressure) is
      transmitted to the eye and this can be measured with ultrasound. The investigators hypothesis
      is that this test will rule out significant elevations in intracranial pressure and perform
      as well as CT scan in doing this.

      The investigators study aims to demonstrate that ultrasound of the optic nerve is as good as
      CT scan in ruling out clinically significant elevations in pressure within the brain. After
      consent has been obtained, any trauma patient who has an indication to undergo CT scan of the
      brain will also undergo ultrasound of the eye. A radiologist will then review the CT scans to
      determine if signs of elevated intracranial pressure are present. The investigators hope to
      demonstrate that a bedside ultrasound performed in the trauma suite is reliable for ruling
      out the possibility of elevated intracranial pressure.

      **Update August 2009** Currently, deferred consent has been obtained from our REB allowing us
      to defer consent for this intervention of minimal risk. As well, REB has also approved phone
      consent in the interim.
