  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently it is common medical wisdom that HELIOX (mixture of Helium in Oxygen) with a
      fraction of Helium below 60% is not effective in reducing airway obstruction. The
      investigators test the hypothesis that HELIOX with a fraction of Helium below 60% is still
      effective in relieving airway obstruction in a double-blind, randomized and controlled
      clinical PoC study with experimental upper airway obstruction.

    <textblock>
      HELIOX is a mixture of Helium and Oxygen. It is a therapeutic modality that can improve upper
      and lower airway obstruction. The lower density of Helium can help to relieve airway
      obstruction and is known to lower the work of breathing. The fraction of Helium (FHe) in
      HELIOX should be maximized (e.g. up to a fraction of 79% with 21% of oxygen added) in order
      to achieve optimal anti-obstructive outcome and according to the literature a FHe below 60%
      renders HELIOX ineffective.

      Objective: We conducted an investigator-initiated trial using different mixtures of Helium
      and Oxygen in 44 healthy volunteers in a randomized and double-blinded fashion.

      Methods: After an adjustment phase the subjects were breathing through two different external
      resistors (intratracheal tube with inner diameter of either 4.0mm or 5.0mm) while gas of
      different composition (medical air with 79% Nitrogen and 21% Oxygen as control gas and HELIOX
      with a fraction of either 25%, 50% or 75% Helium in Oxygen, respectively) was provided in a
      blinded and random fashion. A crossover design was used so that every subject was exposed to
      every HELIOX gas mixture. Subjects were asked to score their degree of dyspnea after
      breathing different gas mixtures for 2 minutes intervals. In addition the variability of
      different hemodynamic parameters was assessed (continuous non-invasive blood pressure
      (systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure), impedance cardiography (stroke volume and
      cardiac output), ECG (heart rate variability)) were assessed non-invasively and used to
      detected a change in the degree of airway obstruction in respect to the added load and the
      gas mixture.
