  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this open, prospective, non-randomised, parallel group, unicentric pilot-study will be
      compared the progress of valvular and coronary calcification with regard to the therapy with
      either acetyl-salicylic acid or phenprocoumon. The progress of calcification is documented by
      comparison of cardial stratified computed tomography. It is supposed that treatment with
      phenprocumon leads to increased coronary and valvular calcification as well to decreased
      blood levels of carboxylated matrix-GLA-protein

      Patients will be allocated to two groups with either

        1. anticoagulation with phenprocoumon (needed for at least 1 year)

        2. therapy with ASA

      Both treatment groups should include to 50% patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
      &lt; 60 ml/min and &gt; 15 ml/min.

      All patients will undergo a screening procedure with evaluation of calcium regulating
      proteins, echocardiography and stratified computed tomography of the heart. Medical check
      up's are planned after 1,3,6, 12 and 18 months.

      Prior investigations concern diastolic ventricular function under long lasting therapy with
      phenprocoumon and the influence of long lasting therapy with phenprocoumon in patients
      suffering from aortic valve sclerosis.
