  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sixty HIV participants will be enrolled and stratified by PBMC HIV DNA levels, either high
      (greater than or equal to 5000 copies/106 cells) or low (less than 5000 copies/106 cells).
      Individuals will be enrolled into each group until filled. Screening PBMC HIV DNA levels will
      be performed at SEARCH in real-time with less than one-week turn around time. All individuals
      will intend to initiate ARV due to meeting MOPH guidelines for such. The protocol team will
      work with the primary care physician to facilitate initiation of standard ARV care; however,
      initiation of ARV is not a requirement of the study and ARV will not be provided by the
      study.
