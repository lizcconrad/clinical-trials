      The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is an NIH Roadmap
      initiative to develop a computerized system measuring patient-reported outcomes in
      respondents with a wide range of chronic diseases and demographic characteristics. In the
      first four years of its existence, the PROMIS network developed item banks for measuring
      patient-reported outcomes in the areas of pain, fatigue, emotional distress, physical
      function, and social functioning. During the item banking process, the PROMIS network
      conducted focus groups, individual cognitive interviews, and lexile (reading level) analyses
      to refine the meaning, clarity, and literacy demands of all items. The item banks were
      administered to over 20,000 respondents and calibrated using models based on item response
      theory (IRT). Using these IRT calibrations, computerized adaptive test (CAT) algorithms were
      developed and implemented. The network has designed a series of studies using clinical
      populations to evaluate the item attributes, examine their utility as CATs, and validate the
      item banks. More information on the PROMIS network can be found at www.nihpromis.org.

      This is a longitudinal clinical validation study of the PROMIS physical function, fatigue,
      and pain impact short forms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients will
      complete assessments at two points: baseline and 6 months post-baseline. The responsiveness
      of six PROMIS static forms (physical function [HAQ, PF-10, 10 and 20 item short forms],
      fatigue, and pain impact) will be evaluated for change over the 6-month period. Physical
      function change scores will be contrasted with established Legacy physical function
      instruments. The test of &quot;responsiveness&quot; is defined as the ability of the instrument to
      detect change after major treatment intensification, self-reported improvement in
      functioning, or positive changes in patient global scores. The order of presentation of forms
      will be randomly assigned to eliminate questionnaire fatigue or other order effects as
      factors. We will also evaluate the test-retest reliability of four PROMIS static forms (HAQ
      and PF-10 physical function, fatigue, and pain impact) in a random subsample of patients at
      1-week post-baseline. In addition, we will evaluate convergent validity of PROMIS measures of
      physical function by comparing self-report with observation of performance of physical
      function tasks in a subsample of patients randomly selected from the local geographic region.
