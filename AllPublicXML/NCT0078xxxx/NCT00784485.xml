      The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness of Xolair® (omalizumab) in people
      with asthma taking Advair Diskus®. The study will look at the effects of Xolair® on lung
      function using high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans after asthma symptoms are
      induced with a special substance called methacholine. This study is only taking place at
      UCLA, where about 13 subjects will be enrolled. Participation requires 10-14 visits over
      about 26 weeks.

      Subjects will receive an albuterol inhaler to use as needed for immediate relief of symptoms
      and fluticasone 250 mcg/salmeterol 50 mcg or fluticasone 500 mcg/salmeterol 50 mcg (Advair
      Diskus® 250/50 or 500/50) to be taken twice daily. At certain visits, they will be given
      Xolair® injections followed by various assessments, including CT scans and lung function
      tests.

      This is a prospective pilot study evaluating the effect of omalizumab on the small airways of
      moderate to severe asthmatic individuals who are not fully controlled on
      fluticasone/salmeterol 250/50 or 500/50 mcg 1 puff bid. After screening, all subjects will be
      placed on fluticasone/salmeterol 250/50 or 500/50 mcg 1 puff bid for a 6-week run-in.
      Subjects will then be evaluated for level of asthma control. Individuals with total control
      of their asthma (no daytime or nighttime symptoms, no rescue use of short-acting inhaled
      beta-agonist, normal PEF, no unscheduled office visits, no ER visits) will be excluded from
      the study. Subjects without total asthma control will then have baseline studies performed to
      include HRCT of the chest before and after a methacholine challenge test (MCT), spirometry,
      closing volume, inspiratory capacity, symptom scores, asthma questionnaires, exhaled NO
      (performed at different expiratory flow rates to estimate alveolar NO) and blood work for
      evaluation of eosinophils and ECP, and banked serum. Subjects who meet acceptable criteria
      for omalizumab dosing based on serum IgE levels and body weight and the presence of atopy (at
      least one positive skin test to a common environmental allergen) will then receive omalizumab
      in addition to fluticasone/salmeterol 250/50 or 500/50 mcg 1 puff bid for sixteen weeks.
      Subjects will be seen every 2-4 weeks during the sixteen-week treatment phase to receive
      injections as prescribed and every 4 weeks to measure spirometry, inspiratory capacity, and
      to evaluate the level of compliance. After the sixteen-week treatment phase subjects will
      again undergo HRCT of the chest before and after a MCT [in the case where the follow-up
      methacholine responsiveness is diminished (improved) a mid-scan will be performed at the
      prior (target) methacholine dose and the challenge then continued to a maximum dose of 16
      mg/ml and a third scan done], spirometry, closing volume, inspiratory capacity, exhaled NO at
      different expiratory flow rates (to estimate alveolar NO) and blood work for evaluation of
      eosinophils and ECP and banked serum.
