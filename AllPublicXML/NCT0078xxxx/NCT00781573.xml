  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the optimal duration of clopidogrel (an anti-platelet agent) therapy has been
      established after bare metal stent implantation in the blood vessels of the heart, there is
      lack of consensus regarding the optimal duration of therapy after implantation of a drug
      eluting stents (DES). Current American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend clopidogrel
      use for at least one year in the absence of contraindications after DES implantation, while
      recognizing that the optimal duration remains unknown. While an extended clopidogrel therapy
      (that is beyond the current 1 year recommendation) may increase bleeding complication, it may
      reduce the rates of adverse cardiovascular events like heart attacks and repeat
      revascularization procedures. A clinical trial which randomizes patients with an uneventful
      one year course after a DES implantation, to an additional year of clopidogrel and aspirin
      therapy versus aspirin alone, will be able to answer the important question about the role of
      extended (2y) dual anti-platelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin after DES implants. The
      investigators hypothesize that clopidogrel discontinuation at 1 year post-DES implantation is
      associated with an increase in cardiovascular events during the one year of follow-up period.

      SCORE is a multicenter, prospective randomized study of post-percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) patients with an uneventful 1 year post-PCI course on dual anti-platelet
      therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel and aspirin. Patient will be randomized to an additional 1
      year of DAPT (treatment arm) vs. aspirin alone (control arm)to assess the following endpoints
      during the 1 year follow-up period:

        1. Death / Myocardial infarction (MI) (Primary end-point)

        2. Combined endpoints of death, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, stroke,
           and major/minor bleeding (Secondary end-point)

      During the year of follow up, subjects will be contacted once every three months. This will
      enable us to track study endpoints in the study population. In addition the patients' medical
      records will be screened to investigate if any of the aforementioned endpoints have been
      reached.
