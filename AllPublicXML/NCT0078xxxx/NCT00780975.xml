      This is a study to test the safety and efficacy of an investigational chemotherapy agent in
      patients with advanced prostate cancer. Subjects who meet all entry criteria and have signed
      the informed consent will be enrolled in the study. Participants will be required to attend
      regular clinic visits to receive study medication and have their status monitored. A detailed
      explanation can be provided by the investigator conducting the study.

    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer diagnosed in men in the United
      States. The majority of deaths occur in men with androgen-independent prostate cancer [AIPC].
      Although 80% of men with advanced cancer will initially respond to androgen ablation with
      disease regression or stabilization, their malignancies become resistant to such therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent before starting any study-specific procedure. If any patient
             is unable to give consent, it may be obtained from the patient's legal representative
             if in accordance with local laws and regulations.

          2. Men with castrate metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate, with the following
             characteristics:

               -  Confirmed pathological diagnosis.

               -  Metastatic disease (radiologically documented).

               -  All patients with chemical castration must have a serum testosterone level below
                  50 ng/ml. There is no need to document a serum testosterone in patients having a
                  prior surgical castration2.

               -  Baseline PSA &gt; 5 ng/ml (according to the recommendations from the
                  Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group2).

               -  Androgen-independent progressive disease, as defined by detectable, rising PSA in
                  two consecutive measurements at least one week apart:

                    -  If PSA responded to a prior therapy, progression occurs when the PSA is 50%
                       above the nadir level.

                    -  If PSA did not respond to a prior therapy, progression occurs when the PSA
                       increases by 25% or more above pretreatment levels.

                    -  In both cases, the increase in absolute value PSA level must be at least 5
                       ng/ml, and must be confirmed by a second measurement a minimum of 1 week
                       later.

               -  Patients must have received prior docetaxel-based chemotherapy.

                  hyperthyroidism) (i.e. requiring relevant changes in medication within the last
                  month, or hospital admission within the last 3 months).
