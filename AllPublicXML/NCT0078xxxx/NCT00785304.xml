  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thousands of soldiers, marines, and other military personnel have had injuries to the brain
      due the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition, 1.5 million civilians per year in the
      United States have traumatic brain injuries caused by car accidents, falls, sports-related
      injuries or assaults. There are important advances in technology that we think will help us
      learn a lot more about these injuries. One such advance involves new types of MRI scans that
      we think will be able to show what has happened to the brain after trauma more clearly that
      regular scans can. These first new scan is called diffusion tensor imaging, which shows
      injury to the axons (the wiring of the brain). The second new scan is called resting-state
      functional MRI correlation analysis, which shows how well various parts of the brain are
      connected to each other. Importantly, the new types of scans can be done using regular
      scanners that we already have in every major hospital. The innovation is entirely in how the
      scanners are used and how the resulting pictures are analyzed on a computer after they have
      been taken.

      Our overall goal is to see whether these new MRI scans will be useful for people who have had
      traumatic brain injuries. We have already tested them on some civilian brain injury patients
      and found them to be very helpful. For this study, we will test them on military personnel
      who have had traumatic brain injuries caused by explosions. The specific goal will be to see
      if the amount of injury we see can be used to predict how well the patients will do overall
      over the next 6-12 months. We think with the new scans we will be able to predict overall
      outcomes better than with regular scans and other information. A related goal will be to see
      whether injuries to specific parts of the brain seen by these new scans can be used to
      predict whether patients will be likely to have specific problems like memory loss, attention
      deficit, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder. A final goal will be to repeat the
      scans 6-12 months later to see whether the new MRI scans can show whether the injuries to the
      brain have healed, gotten worse, or stayed the same.

      If the study is successful, it will show that these new MRI techniques can to be used to make
      earlier and more accurate diagnoses of traumatic brain injury, predictions of the sorts of
      problems that are likely to occur after brain injury, and assessments of how severe the
      injuries are.

      This study will help traumatic brain injury patients. It will be most useful for military
      personnel who have had brain injuries due to explosions. It is highly likely that it will
      also be useful for younger adults who have had brain injuries due to other causes like car
      accidents, sports-related concussions, falls, or assaults. It is possible that but not known
      for sure whether it will help young children or older adults with traumatic brain injuries.

      These new scans could help with decisions about whether military personnel can return to
      duty, what sort of rehabilitation would benefit them most, and what family members should
      watch for and expect. This could become used in some hospitals within 2 years, and could
      become standard in every major hospital within 5 years.

      The new scans could also be helpful in developing new treatments. For example, if a new drug
      works by blocking injury to the axons, it would be a good idea to test on people who have
      injury to their axons. Right now we have no good way to tell who these people are, and so a
      new drug like this would get tested on lots of people who don't have injured axons, along
      with those who do. This would make it harder to tell if the new drug is working. With the new
      scans we should be able to tell who has injured axons, tell how severe the injury is, and
      figure out whom to test the drugs on. It will likely take 10 years or more to develop new
      drugs like this.

      Further in the future, the new scans could be used to help guide surgery to implant computer
      chips to help rewire the brain. We don't know how long this will take, but estimate 15-20
      years or more.

      Overall MRI scanning is very safe and has no known major risks. Because the scanner uses
      strong magnets, anyone with metal objects in their bodies can't be scanned, as this could be
      dangerous. We will make sure that no one with metal objects in their bodies is included in
      the study. There can be some psychological risks involved in taking tests and answering
      questions, but these are usually mild and can be managed. There is always a risk that
      important confidential information will be made public and that this could have consequences.
      We will do everything possible to maintain confidentiality. Nearly all of the information
      will only be identified using a code number and not by the name of the person, and all of it
      will be kept securely.

      Background: In traumatic brain injury, axonal damage is a major pathophysiological process
      and may be a primary cause of adverse neurological outcomes. However, traumatic axonal injury
      and its effects on brain functional connectivity are very difficult to directly detect and
      quantify in living patients. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) appears to have great promise
      with regard to detecting axonal injury. Resting-state fMRI correlation analysis likewise may
      be a powerful and broadly applicable method for investigating brain functional connectivity.
      In our preliminary studies, these two techniques have been successfully used together in
      several civilian TBI patients. They appear to synergistically cross validate each other;
      disrupted functional connectivity underlying focal neurological deficits were revealed using
      resting-state fMRI correlation analysis while DTI demonstrated the axonal injury responsible
      for the disruptions. Conventional MRI and CT entirely failed to explain many of these
      deficits. This cross validation is important as it adds confidence to the interpretation of
      the results. Without resting-state fMRI correlation analysis, the consequences of apparent
      axonal injury on DTI for the functional connectivity of the brain may not be clear; the
      axonal injury could be in white matter tracts that are redundant, or not severe enough to be
      functionally important. Without DTI, the cause of a disruption in connectivity seen using
      resting-state fMRI correlation analysis will likewise not always be known; processes other
      than traumatic axonal injury could be responsible. Both of these advanced techniques along
      with a full conventional MRI can be performed on standard clinical MRI scanners in
      approximately 45 minutes per patient. Apart from in our preliminary studies, resting-state
      fMRI and DTI have not been used together to investigate traumatic brain injury.

      Objective/Hypothesis: The objective of this proposal is to test these two advanced MRI
      methods, DTI and resting-state fMRI, in active-duty military blast-related TBI patients
      acutely after injury and correlate findings with TBI-related clinical outcomes 6-12 months
      later. These methods may add clinically useful predictive information following traumatic
      brain injury that could be of assistance in standardizing diagnostic criteria for TBI, making
      return-to-duty triage decisions, guiding post-injury rehabilitation, and developing novel
      therapeutics. The overarching hypothesis guiding this project is that traumatic axonal injury
      is a principal cause of impaired brain function following blast-related TBI. Specific
      hypotheses to be tested are:

        1. DTI and resting-state fMRI correlation analysis will noninvasively reveal abnormalities
           that are not present on CT or conventional MRI acutely following blast-related TBI.

        2. Specific patterns of acute axonal injury (on DTI) causing disruption of brain functional
           connectivity (on resting-state fMRI correlation analysis) will predict specific
           neurological, neuropsychological, and psychiatric deficits and disorders.

        3. The overall burden of acute axonal injury and disrupted brain functional connectivity
           will strongly predict overall 6-12 month clinical outcome.

      Specific Aims: 1) to obtain DTI, resting-state fMRI and conventional MRI scans acutely after
      blast-related TBI in active-duty military personnel presenting to Landstuhl Regional Medical
      Center (LRMC).

      2) to collect detailed clinical information on TBI-related outcomes 6-12 months after
      injuries.

      3) to extensively analyze the acute imaging predictors and correlates of 6-12 month clinical
      outcomes.

      Study Design: We propose a prospective, observational study of 80 active duty military
      personnel who have sustained blast-related TBI. Initial scans will be performed within 4 days
      of injury at LRMC. Follow-up will occur monthly by telephone and in person at Washington
      University 6-12 months after injury. Clinical information on TBI outcomes collected will
      include global outcome assessments, neuropsychological testing for memory, attention and
      executive function deficits, motor performance measures, and clinician administered rating
      scales for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Controls will include 1) an
      additional group of 20 active duty military personnel with other injuries, but who have not
      had TBI, and 2) age, gender and education-based norms for standardized test and assessment
      results. Repeat DTI, resting-state fMRI, and conventional MRI will be performed to track the
      evolution of the injuries. Analysis approaches will include prespecified hypotheses based on
      known brain anatomical-clinical correlations and several exploratory approaches, as the
      structural bases for many post-traumatic neurological and neuropsychological deficits are not
      well understood. Non-parametric correlational statistical methods and rigorous correction for
      multiple comparisons will be employed. Expert collaborators and logistics coordinators will
      be or have already been recruited. Confidentiality and privacy will be tightly controlled.
