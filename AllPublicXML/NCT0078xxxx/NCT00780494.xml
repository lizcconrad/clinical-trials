    <textblock>
      To investigate bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and capecitabine for patients with
      unresectable or metastatic GEJ or gastric cancers. We hope that by adding bevacizumab to
      standard chemotherapy for this patient population we will improve Progression Free Survival
      by 80% over historical controls.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must be treated at Stanford University Medical Center for the entire length of
        study participation.

          1. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the GEJ or
             stomach.

          2. Patients must be deemed unresectable due to involvement of critical vasculature or
             adjacent organ invasion. If unresectable, patients must show evidence of disease
             progression prior to enrollment.

          3. Patients with prior surgical resection who develop radiological or clinical evidence
             of metastatic cancer do not require separate histological or cytological confirmation
             of metastatic disease unless an interval of &gt; 5 years has elapsed between the primary
             surgery and the development of metastatic disease. Clinicians should consider biopsy
             of lesions to establish diagnosis of metastatic disease if there is substantial
             clinical ambiguity regarding the nature or source of apparent metastases.

          4. Prior carboplatin as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy will be allowed if &gt;= 6 months
             from the time of study entry.

          5. If patients use aspirin (&gt;325mg/day) or NSAIDS at the time of enrollment, they must
             have a 10 day washout period prior to beginning protocol treatment.

          6. Low molecular weight heparin (or its equivalent, excluding warfarin) will be allowed
             for treatment of venous thromboembolic events if patients have no evidence of bleeding
             on full-dose anticoagulation.

          7. Patients must have a primary or metastatic lesion measurable in at least one dimension
             by Modified RECIST criteria (see Section 11.2.3) within 4 weeks prior to entry of
             study

          8. Patients must have ECOG performance status of 0-1

          9. Patients must be &gt;= 18 years of age

         10. Laboratory values &lt;= 2 weeks prior to randomization:

                  x ULN (&lt;= 5.0 x ULN if liver metastases present). Note: ERCP or percutaneous
                  stenting may be used to normalize the liver function tests.

         11. Life expectancy &gt;= 12 weeks

         12. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for DCE-MRI and DWI imaging will be determined by CT
             scan as part of routine post-chemotherapy imaging. Subjects will be eligible if one
             liver metastasis is greater than 1 cm in size. Participation in the DCE-MRI and DWI
