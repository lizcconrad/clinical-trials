    <textblock>
      This was a study to measure the ability of desloratadine and levocetirizine to decrease nasal
      obstruction in subjects who had study-induced allergic rhinitis. Study participants had
      allergic rhinitis symptoms induced in a Vienna Challenge Chamber and then received
      desloratadine or levocetirizine for 8 days. After at least a 10 to 35-day washout period
      (time when no drug is given), subjects received the opposite treatment for 8 days. Subjects
      had their total nasal symptom measured.on the 8th day of each treatment period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 to 45 years of age

          -  Were free of any clinically significant disease that would interfere with study
             evaluations.

          -  Demonstrated hypersensitivity to the grass allergen used in the chamber unless
             confirmed previously within 12 months.

          -  Hypersensitivity to the allergen was documented by a positive response to the skin
             prick test with a wheal diameter at least 3 mm larger than the diluent control and by
             a radioallergosorbent test (RAST) class of &gt;=2 (rating scale 0 -6).

          -  Had a history of SAR for at least 2 years, as diagnosed by the investigator, another
             physician, or subject-provided history.

          -  Reported having shown therapeutic efficacy with previous use of an antihistamine
             (without a decongestant).

          -  At the screening allergen provocation, the subject had a nasal obstruction symptom
             severity score of at least moderate (&gt;=2) and a decrease from baseline in nasal
             airflow (mL/sec) measured by rhinomanometry of &gt;=30% within 2 hours of allergen
             exposure. Also, the subject had a nasal obstruction symptom severity score of none or
             mild (&lt;=1) prior to exposure to allergen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who were pregnant or nursing.

          -  Had a body mass index (BMI) &gt;=30 kg/m^2.

          -  Had asthma; were being treated with inhaled or oral corticosteroids, chromones,
             theophylline, leukotriene inhibitors, or short-acting inhaled β2-agonists (except
             during or immediately after the allergen exposures); and could not go through the
             washout periods and the entire study without needing these medications.

          -  Developed wheezing or dyspnea during the screening allergen exposure.

          -  Had a respiratory infection during the 4 weeks prior to pre-dose evaluations.

          -  Had any clinically significant deviation from normal in the physical examination that,
             in the investigator's judgment, could interfere with the study evaluation or affect
             subject safety.

          -  Had any history of or laboratory evidence of hepatic failure or renal failure with a
             glomerular filtration rate (GFR) known to be &lt;30 mL/min.

          -  Had a known potential for hypersensitivity, allergic, or idiosyncratic reaction to the
             study drug or excipients.

          -  Had nasal structural abnormalities, including large nasal polyps and marked septum
             deviation, that significantly interfered with nasal airflow.
