        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have one of the following: acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia; or
             Myeloproliferative disorder(MPD) including Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML); or
             Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS); or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (including CLL); or Multiple
             Myeloma

          -  Patients with acute leukemia must meet one of the following conditions:

             *have disease which is refractory to a course of standard induction chemotherapy *have
             relapsed diseased after documentation of previous clinical remission or *have
             untreated disease and not be a candidate for conventional first line treatment

          -  Patients with CML or other MPD must have evidence of accelerated phase or blast crisis

          -  Patients having clinical features of CML in transformation but who are negative for
             Philadelphia chromosome may be entered provided there is a prior definable chronic
             phase

          -  Patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive CML must have failed treated with
             Gleevec (Imatinib) in order to be eligible for study

          -  Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) must have &gt; 5% blasts in the peripheral
             blood or bone marrow and have at diagnosis as IPSS score of &gt;= 1

          -  Patients with CLL must have relapsed or refractory disease after at least three
             courses of conventional therapy and have been determined to no longer be a candidate
             for conventional therapy

          -  Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (other than CLL) must have relapsed or refractory
             disease after at least two courses of chemotherapy and have been determined not to be
             a candidate for further conventional therapies

          -  Patients with multiple myeloma must have failed at least 3 prior therapies

          -  Performance Status 0, 1 or 2

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl; serum bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl and AST/ALT &lt; 3.0 x upper
             limit of normal

          -  PTT within normal range

          -  Age &gt; 18

          -  Patients must have an indwelling central venous catheter

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant cardiac disease which requires active therapy

          -  Intercurrent organ damage or medical problems that will jeopardize outcome of therapy

          -  Pregnant or lactating females

          -  Received prior c-myb AS ODN therapy

          -  Patients with suitable HLA identical sibling donor who are deemed to be appropriate
             and willing candidates for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation

          -  Patients requiring anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin.
