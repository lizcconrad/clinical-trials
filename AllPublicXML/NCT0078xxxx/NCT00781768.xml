  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different treatment protocols for treating nausea
      and vomiting in patients who have undergone bone marrow transplant. Patients will be assigned
      to one of two treatment groups.

      The first group will recieve ondansetron (Zofran) tablets combined with a medicine called
      dexamethasone given IV. Both of these drugs are commercially available.

      Patients in The second treatment consists of the first two drugs, plus a newly approved drug
      known as aprepitant (MK-869, Emend). This combination will be the treatment being tested. The
      combination is approved by the FDA for chemotherapy regimens known to cause a lot of nausea
      and vomiting. It significantly decreases the delayed (more than 24 hours after therapy)
      nausea and vomiting seen with these regimens.

      This will be a single center, comparative, randomized, double-blind, phase III trial designed
      to evaluate the efficacy of the NK-1 antagonist, aprepitant (MK-869), in combination with
      ondansetron and dexamethasone in the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting
      compared to ondansetron and dexamethasone in patients receiving highly emetogenic preparative
      regimens prior to autologous or allogeneic (related and unrelated) stem cell transplantation.

      Patients will be randomized to one of two treatments: dexamethasone 10 mg IV once daily and
      ondansetron 8 mg orally every 8 hours on each day of the preparative regimen plus one
      additional day vs. 7.5 mg IV once daily and ondansetron 8 mg orally every 8 hours on each day
      of the preparative regimen plus one additional day combined with aprepitant, 125 mg orally on
      the first day of their preparative regimen followed by 80 mg daily on each remaining day of
      the preparative regimen plus three additional days.
