    <textblock>
      This study was developed to test the hypothesis that the risk of colorectal cancer recurrence
      was similar in patients who were randomly assigned to 65% nitrous oxide or nitrogen during
      colorectal surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We conducted a 4- to 8-year follow-up of 204 patients with colorectal cancer who were
      randomly assigned to 65% nitrous oxide (n=97) or nitrogen (n=107), balanced with isoflurane
      and remifentanil. The primary outcome was the time to cancer recurrence. Our primary analysis
      was a multivariable Cox-proportional-hazards regression model that included relevant baseline
      variables. In addition to treatment group, the model considered patient age, tumor grade,
      dissemination, adjacent organ invasion, vessel invasion, and the number of nodes involved.
      The study had 80% power to detect a 56% or greater reduction in recurrence rates (i.e.,
      hazard ratio of 0.44 or less) at the 0.05 significance level.
