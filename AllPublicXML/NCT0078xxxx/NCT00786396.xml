      The aim of this study is to develop effective interventions for HIV-infected prisoners who
      are released to the community. The intervention that we will study will be directly observed
      therapy (DAART/DOT) and we will compare this to the current standard of care that involves
      self-administered therapy (SAT). All subjects will get transitional case management and all
      subjects with a prior history of opiate dependence will be offered opiate substitution
      therapy (buprenorphine or methadone).

      Hypotheses:

        -  At the end of six months those receiving DAART will have a higher level of adherence to
           HAART as compared to the SAT group.

        -  The DAART Intervention will result in subjects having lower viral loads and higher CD4
           counts as compared to the SAT group.

        -  At the end of six months, the DAART group will have a lower rate of recidivism to
           jail/prison as compared to the SAT group.

        -  Over the year, the DAART group will be more likely to make repeated primary HIV care
           visits than the SAT group.

    <textblock>
      Any individual that is HIV positive and incarcerated for at least a period of 90 days and on
      antiretroviral medications would be referred to the study by the medical staff of the
      incarceration facilities prior to release or within 30 days of release an individual would be
      able to self refer.

      Subjects would be screened and consented and interviewed prior to their release from
      incarceration, on their day of release, and monthly for a period of one year. At the time of
      their day of release interview, subjects are randomized to either the intervention DAART
      group or the standard of care SAT group. All subjects would be assessed and offered opiate
      substitution therapy if there was a prior history of opiate dependency as a means of relapse
      prevention.

      Subjects in DAART would be seen everyday for a period of six months by a team of research
      assistants who observe the subjects taking their medications, and their last six months would
      be done as standard of care. Standard of care SAT subjects would continue to take their
      medications on their own as prescribed. All subjects would be interviewed monthly and
      quarterly would have laboratory blood tests completed.
