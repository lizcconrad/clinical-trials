    <description>Approximately 0.0025 mL of vaccine will be administered percutaneously with a bifurcated needle using 15 pricks on the volar surface of the forearm. Vaccination may be repeated up to two times within the year if successful vaccination is not demonstrated by a positive &quot;take&quot; reaction and a MA titer of ≥ 1:20.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. At least 18 years old.

          2. Females of childbearing potential must agree to have a urine or serum pregnancy test
             on vaccination day, immediately before vaccination (Exception: documented hysterectomy
             or &gt; 3 years of menopause). The results must be negative. Subjects must agree not to
             become pregnant for 3 months after receipt of the vaccine.

          3. Subjects must be at risk for exposure to F. tularensis.

          4. Subjects must have an up-to-date (within 1 year) medical history including concomitant
             medications, physical examination, and laboratory tests on their charts and be
             medically cleared for participation by an investigator.

          5. Subject must be willing to return for all follow-up visits on days 1 and 2, between
             days 5-9, 12-16, 28-35, and 56-84 (if needed), all visits for serology, and the
             closeout interview 6 months (±14 days) after vaccination or revaccination.

          6. Subject must agree to report any adverse event which may or may not be associated with
             administration of the test article for at least 28 days after vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Over the age of 65 Years.

          2. Vaccinated against tularemia within the last 10 years or had a documented, confirmed
             tularemia infection.

          3. Clinically significant abnormal lab results including evidence of hepatitis C,
             hepatitis B carrier state, or elevated liver function tests (two times the normal
             range or at the discretion of the PI).

          4. Personal history of an immunodeficiency or current treatment with an oral or
             intravenous immunosuppressive medication.

          5. Confirmed HIV* infection.

          6. A medical condition that, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator (PI), would
             impact subject safety.

          7. Antibiotic therapy within 7 days before vaccination.

          8. Pregnancy or lactation. Subjects must agree not to become pregnant for 3 months after
             receipt of the vaccine.

          9. Any known allergies to any component of the vaccine:

             Modified casein partial hydrolysate medium Glucose cysteine hemin agar Sucrose gelatin
             agar stabilizer

         10. Administration of another vaccine within 4 weeks of tularemia vaccination.

         11. Any unresolved AE resulting from a previous immunization.
