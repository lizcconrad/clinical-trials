  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate whether, in patients diagnosed with Vertical
      Heterophoria, the symptoms of dizziness, headache and / or anxiety are reduced or eliminated
      when a kind of correction called vertical prism is added to the patient's normal eye glass
      prescription.

      The experiment will involve giving the patient two pairs of glasses (one pair containing the
      baseline prescription with vertical prism (Standard Treatment Glasses) and the other pair
      containing the baseline prescription but without vertical prism (Placebo Glasses)) to
      demonstrate which pair of glasses is most effective in reducing the symptoms of dizziness,
      headache and / or anxiety in these patients.
