    <measure>Number of Participants With Fatigue Based on Participants Self Assessment Using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12 weeks after MR1 visit</time_frame>
    <description>FSS is an auto-questionnaire estimating the fatigue. It includes 9 questions on 7 points as well as an analogical visual scale estimating the state of fatigue over the last two weeks. Participants had the following two types of visit during the study, one visit with a neurologist and one visit with a rehabilitation physician. Visit to a neurologist: V0=baseline; V1=end of Month 1 of treatment; V2=end of Month 2 of treatment; V3=end of Month 3 of treatment.

    <time_frame>From baseline to 12 weeks after MR1 visit</time_frame>
    <description>SEP (Sclérose en plaques) - 59: auto-questionnaire, multidimensional investigating the felt health. It contains a generic part SF (Short Form) 36 constituted by 36 items including the main concepts of quality of life and a specific part to the MS which investigates the dimensions susceptible to be degraded. 59 items are grouped in 16 dimensions: physical activity, limitations bound connected to the physical health, to the mental health, the social well-being, the pain, the energy, the emotional well-being, general Health, distress, cognitive function sexual function/satisfaction, well-being general, sleep and social support. Visit to a neurologist: V0=baseline; V1=end of Month 1 of treatment; V2=end of Month 2 of treatment; V3=end of Month 3 of treatment. Visit to MR (Medecin Reeducateur: physician for rehabilitation): MR1=1st visit within 15 days after V0; MR2=2nd visit (6 weeks after MR1 +/- 1 week); MR3=end of study visit 12 weeks after MR1.</description>

          <title>Posturography Gain in Static Equilibrium Performances Between MR2 and MR3 Visits</title>
          <description>Posturography protocol: Static equilibrium performances are evaluated in the standing patient on a fixed platform, in the standardized position (arms dangling, feet open at 30° and malleolus at a 5 cm distance). Participants had the following two types of visit during the study, one visit with a neurologist and one visit with a rehabilitation physician. Visit to a neurologist: V0=baseline; V1=end of Month 1 of treatment; V2=end of Month 2 of treatment; V3=end of Month 3 of treatment. Visit to MR (Medecin Reeducateur: physician for rehabilitation): MR1=1st visit within 15 days after V0; MR2=2nd visit (6 weeks after MR1 +/- 1 week); MR3=end of study visit 12 weeks after MR1. This outcome was only measured on patients in the group &quot;Interferon beta-1b, FRP within 15 days after randomization&quot;.</description>
