  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The natural history of cirrhosis has a symptomatic and asymptomatic stage. The symptoms
      include the development of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding. The
      development of portal hypertension represents a critical transition point in the natural
      history of cirrhosis, contributing to, or directly responsible for all of these events. It is
      defined by an increase in intrahepatic vascular resistance to portal venous inflow, with the
      subsequent development of collateral vessels, such as esophageal or gastric varices. As
      portal pressures rise over time, however, the resulting increase in variceal size and wall
      tension translates into an increasing likelihood of rupture and bleeding, leading to death in
      about 30% of patients. Over the last twenty years, data have emerged regarding the role of
      tumor necrosis factor (TNFÎ±) in portal hypertension from animal models as well as in vitro
      experiments. Portal hypertension is a condition characterized by vasodilatation and a
      hyperdynamic circulation, driven by relative overproduction of nitric oxide23. In animal
      trials using inhibitors of TNF it has been shown to decrease the development of the
      hyperdynamic circulatory state and portal pressure.24-25 Based on these data, investigators
      have examined the role of TNF inhibition with thalidomide. Significant improvement in
      blocking the development of the hyperdynamic circulation and portal pressures was
      demonstrated.26 Human trials have also show the efficacy of thalidomide in reducing portal
      pressures. In that these trials have shown promising results further investigation is

      Treatment duration with thalidomide will be for 16 weeks, beginning in the hospital setting
      immediately after the index bleed, and clinical follow-up additional six months. Follow-up in
      both the hepatology, outpatient clinic area and the endoscopy suite will occur. Step wise
      thalidomide dosing will be 100 mg/d once a day at night. If no evidence of toxicity is noted
      after 5 doses, the dose will be increased to 200 mg/d, and continued on that dose as an
      outpatient until completion of the study protocol at 16 weeks. Patients will be followed
      daily while inpatients, and subsequently at two-week intervals upon discharge. Females of
      child-bearing potential will be seen weekly for the first month and must have a confirmed
      negative pregnancy test prior to being dispensed the next one week supply of study drug.
      After the first month, females of child-bearing potential will be seen every two weeks as
      will all other subjects. Standard follow-up medical care after esophageal variceal bleeding
      in patients who have undergone endoscopic therapy will include:

      follow-up endoscopy at regular intervals until variceal obliteration, using either endoscopic
      variceal ligation (EVL) or sclerotherapy titrated dose of a nonselective beta blocker
      (propranolol).

      At each follow-up visit, patients will be assessed for development of any interim outcome of
      interest:

      overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding need for transfusion worsening clinical status

      Patients will initially be followed daily while hospitalized. outpatient visits will occur
      every two-week intervals upon discharge. Standard follow-up medical care after esophageal
      variceal bleeding in patients who have undergone endoscopic therapy will include:

      follow-up endoscopy at regular intervals until variceal obliteration, using either endoscopic
      variceal ligation (EVL) or sclerotherapy titrated dose of a nonselective beta blocker
      (propranolol).

      At each follow-up visit, patients will be assessed for development of any interim outcome of
      interest:

      overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding need for transfusion worsening clinical status the need
      for TIPS, liver transplantation or death. In addition, patients and their families will be
      questioned for any evidence of potential toxicity as assessed by using the CTC Toxicity grade
      version 3, or adverse outcomes by one of the study investigators as well as a nurse
      coordinator, using a standardized questionnaire along with a regular clinical
