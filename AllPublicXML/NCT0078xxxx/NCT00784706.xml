  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to evaluate motor and neglect recovery of stroke patients
      produced by CIT using kinematic and oculomotor assessment, together with conventional
      clinical measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will be carried out using a short term constraint and training protocol
      targeting at subacute and chronic patients with motor and perceptual deficits. The outcome
      measures will include kinematic and oculomotor analyses, which have not been employed yet.

    <measure>Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2008-2009</time_frame>
    <description>The CBS is a therapist-designed checklist to examine the effect of neglect syndrome on a patient's daily function in 10 real-life situations, such as grooming, dressing, or maneuvering a wheelchair. A 4-point scale is used in each item, ranging from 0 (no neglect) to 3 (severe neglect). Patients with a total score of 0 were considered as having no neglect in performing daily activities.</description>

    <measure>Eye movement analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>2008-2009</time_frame>
    <description>An eye tracker system (Tobii 1750, with 1024 Ã— 768 resolutions a 1 nd 30-Hz sampling rate) was used to record the participant's eye movement by detecting his or her pupil. To examine the possible improvement in abnormal eye movement after the intervention, the eye movement parameters included the fixation amplitude (the distance between the most left and the most right fixation points), the number of fixation points, and the fixation time in the left area (Left fixation points and Left fixation time). A fixation point is defined as the gaze point stays in 50 pixels on the screen over 30 ms and can be screened by a fixation filter function in the ClearView 2.0. A wider fixation amplitude, larger L fixation points, and longer L fixation time represent the alleviated syndrome of neglect.</description>

    <measure>kinematic variables</measure>
    <time_frame>2008-2009</time_frame>
    <description>Kinematic analysis was used to detect UE and trunk movement. A 7-camera motion-analysis system (VICON MX; Oxford Metrics Inc., Oxford, UK)6 was linked to a personal computer to capture the movement of markers. Reference markers were placed on the seventh cervical vertebra (C7), the fourth thoracic vertebra (T4), the bilateral clavicles, midsternum, and the unaffected side of the acromion, middle of the humerus, lateral epicondyle,styloid process of the ulna and radius, and index nail. Kinematic variables included reaction time (second), normalized movement time (second), normalized total distance (mm), percentage of movement time where peak velocity (PPV) occurs, and trunk lateral shift.</description>

    <arm_group_label>CIT with eye-patching</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The CIT addressed forced use of the affected UE and restricted the unaffected UE during training. Shaping skills were delivered while participants were forced to use their affected UE in the mass practice of functional tasks, such as drinking water and opening a jar. Participants wore a mitt on their unaffected hand and wrist for 6 hours/day during the 3-week training and reported their compliance in a daily log. Participants were also asked to wear glasses with a patch on the right lens to block the visual stimuli from the right side and force them to receive the stimuli from the left-side visual field.</description>

    <description>traditional occupational therapy matched in intensity and duration with the other groups. The training program included stretching and weight bearing of the affected UE, improving the range of motion of the affected UE, muscle strengthening, and the practice of tasks used for functional training might involve the unaffected UE to assist in the affected UE; for example, stabilizing a bottle while opening its lid or moving pegs into holes on a board.</description>
