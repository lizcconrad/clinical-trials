  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in North America. The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the
      potential of liraglutide to maintain long term weight loss in obese non-diabetic subjects, as
      well as in overweight subjects who have medical problems such as hypertension (high blood
      pressure) or dyslipidaemia (an abnormal amount of lipids in the blood).

      Trial has following trial periods: A 12-week run-in period (from week -12 to week 0) followed
      by a 56-week main trial period (weeks 0-56) and a 12-week follow-up period (weeks 56-68).
