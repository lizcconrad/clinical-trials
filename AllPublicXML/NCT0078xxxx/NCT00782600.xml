    <textblock>
      This study is to test the idea that a controlled release formulation of CE-224,535 may allow
      for less frequent dosing and exposure to lower levels of drug than an immediate release
      formulation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and/or female subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive
             (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed
             medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests).

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18 to 30 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs). A
             BMI lower limit of 17.5 kg/m2 may be rounded up to 18.0 kg/m2; a BMI upper limit of
             30.5 kg/m2 may be rounded down to 30.0 kg/m2 and will be acceptable for inclusion.

          -  An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject or a legally acceptable
             representative.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal
             allergies at time of dosing) disease or clinical findings at screening.

          -  Any conHistory of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or
             14 drinks/week for men (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of
             beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of screening.

          -  condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).
