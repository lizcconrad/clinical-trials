  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study are to determine the safety of the RFM System (Alfred Mann
      Foundation, Santa Clarita, CA) in a patient with incomplete SCI and the effect of the RFM
      system on lower limb strength and spasticity. The secondary aim is to analyze any improvement
      in the participant's mobility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Restoring mobility after spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most important goals of
      rehabilitation. Even for patients with partial lower limb motor function after SCI, many have
      limited mobility because of significant spasticity. Therapeutic electrical neuromuscular
      stimulation (TNS) has been used to improve muscle tone and strength and to enable walking and
      standing in patients with SCI. We propose to use the Radio Frequency Microstimulator (RFM)
      System, a new and novel implantable TNS system developed by the Alfred E. Mann Foundation, to
      improve muscle strength and reduce spasticity in a patient with incomplete SCI. The RFM
      System has several advantages over current TNS systems. The RFM implant devices are small
      enough (diameter 2.4 mm, length 16.7 mm) to be inserted using an incision approximately 5 mm
      long and have no lead wires passing through the skin since the microstimulator contains both
      the anode and cathode. Implanted RFM devices can be placed near multiple motor points and/or
      nerves and are controlled individually using radio frequency technology. Up to six (6) RFM
      devices will be inserted, two to three in each lower limb to provide stimulation to a
      patient's bilateral knee extensors (femoral nerve stimulation) and ankle dorsiflexors
      (peroneal nerve stimulation) to assess the effects on muscle strength, limb spasticity and
      patient mobility.
