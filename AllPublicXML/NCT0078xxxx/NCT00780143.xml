      DLT of Plitidepsin in combination with a fixed dose of Cytarabine in patients with
      relapsed/refractory leukemia and to determine the response rate of the combination of
      Plitidepsin with Cytarabine in patients with relapsed/refractory AML treated at the MTD.

      This is a Phase I/II study to determine:

        -  the safety, tolerability and to identify the MTD and DLT of Plitidepsin in combination
           with a fixed dose of Cytarabine in patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia and to
           determine the response rate of the combination of Plitidepsin with Cytarabine in
           patients with relapsed/refractory AML treated at the MTD.

        -  the pharmacokinetic parameters of Plitidepsin in combination with Cytarabine.

        -  whether Plitidepsin in combination with Cytarabine exerts antiangiogenic effects as
           measured by reduction in microvessel density and VEGFR-1 expression in bone marrow
           biopsies of patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia.

        -  whether measurement of free serum VEGF levels, soluble circulating VEGF Receptor and
           Peripheral Progenitor Endothelial cells provide an early marker of response to
           Plitidepsin.

        -  the effects of Plitidepsin and Cytarabine on cytidine deaminase activity and correlate
           results with Cytarabine drug resistance.

        -  changes in leukemic gene expression as a result of Plitidepsin and Cytarabine
           administration.

        -  tumor response duration.

        -  progression free survival and overall survival.

             such procedure.

          3. Active or metastatic secondary primary malignancy.

          4. Patients with known Central Nervous System involvement will be excluded from this
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events.

          5. Serious concomitant systemic disorders that would compromise the safety of the patient
             or compromise the patient's ability to complete the study, including the following
             specific conditions:

               -  Uncontrolled psychiatric illness or medical illness that the principle
                  investigator feels will compromise the patient's tolerance of the study
                  medication.

               -  Significant non-neoplastic liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis, active chronic
                  hepatitis).

               -  Uncontrolled endocrine diseases (e.g. diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism or
                  hyperthyroidism) (i.e. requiring relevant changes in medication within the last
                  month, or hospital admission within the last 3 months).

          6. Other relevant cardiac conditions:

               -  History or presence of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, valvular heart
                  disease or congestive heart failure.

          7. History of hypersensitivity reaction to cremophor, Cytarabine, Mannitol, or
             Plitidepsin (Aplidin®).

          8. Myopathy or any clinical situation that causes significant and persistent elevation of
             CK (&gt; 2.5 ULN in two different determinations performed with one week apart).

          9. History of significant Cytarabine related neurotoxicity.

         11. Men and women of reproductive potential who are not using effective contraceptive
             methods. The effects of Plitidepsin on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and
             men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth
             control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and
             for 6 months after. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
             Also, if the wife or female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the
             study, the investigator must be notified promptly and the pregnant woman will be
             referred for appropriate follow-up with a High-risk Obstetrician.

         12. Pregnant and/or lactating women.

         13. Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, therefore, known HIV-positive patients with
             active HIV infection and/or receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded
             from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with Plitidepsin or
             other agents administered during the study. HIV testing is not required unless
             infection is clinically suspected.

         14. Known active HBV or HCV infection. Patients with any serological evidence of current
             or past hepatitis B exposure are excluded unless the serological findings are clearly
             due to vaccination. HBV or HCV testing are not required unless infection is clinically
             suspected.

         15. Concomitant therapy with therapeutic dose of coumadin is not permitted. A suboptimal
             dose for permeability venous access devices is allowed.

         16. Treatment with any investigational product in the 30 days period before inclusion in
             the study. Wash-out periods since the end of the precedent therapy less than:

               -  6 weeks for nitrosoureas or high dose chemotherapy.

               -  2 weeks for other chemotherapies or biological agents.

               -  4 weeks for radiation or radionuclide therapy (6 weeks in case of prior extensive
                  external beam radiation, more than 25% of bone marrow distribution).

               -  24 hours for hydroxyurea.

               -  7 days for Gleevec® or other BCL-ABL tyrosine Kinase inhibitors.

         17. Limitation of the patient´s ability to comply with the treatment or follow-up
             protocol.
