      Purposes of this study: 1) To define comprehensive set of descriptive health states related
      to treatment of cervical cancer (e.g. radical hysterectomy, whole pelvic radiation,
      brachytherapy, chemoradiation) 2) To define set of descriptive health states related to
      adverse events associated w treatment of cervical cancer (i.e. bladder dysfunction, pain,
      enteritis, fistula formation) &amp; 3) To derive, using a validated method, a set of QoL related
      utility scores corresponding to these health states.

      Subjects will valuate cervical cancer-related health states using the visual analog score
      (VAS) and TTO (TTO) methods. The subject will be asked to read a pertinent health state
      description and listen while it is read aloud. She will first be asked to place the state on
      a continuum (VAS) from zero to 100, with 100 presenting perfect health and zero presenting
      death. The TTO interview will then be administered. The subject will be asked to assume a
      remaining life expectancy of 30 years, and to choose between 30 years in the health state
      described or 29 years in a state of perfect health. The utility of the health state, a number
      between zero and one, is calculated as the minimum number of years the patient would accept
      divided by 30. Each subject will be asked to review and valuate 20 health states over the
      course of 60-90 minutes.

        Members of the Public- Members of the public are considered the standard group to assign
        utilities for health-economic purposes. Forty-five members of the public, without a
        diagnosis of cervical cancer, will be recruited.

        Cervical Cancer Patients- Fifteen patients, with a diagnosis of cervical cancer (either
        currently being treated or previously treated).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any member of public over age of 18 and without the diagnosis of cervical cancer can
             participate in this study.

          -  Patients over the age of 18 with the diagnosis of cervical cancer are eligible to
             participate in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any member of public under the age of 18 or with a prior diagnosis of cervical cancer
             is excluded from this study.

          -  Any cervical cancer patient younger than 18 is excluded from this study.
