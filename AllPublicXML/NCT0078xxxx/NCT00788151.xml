      This trial will evaluate the use of a tetravalent vaccine against dengue.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To describe the immune response to dengue before and after each vaccination with dengue
           vaccine in two age cohorts of children previously vaccinated with yellow fever (YF)
           vaccine

        -  To evaluate the safety of each vaccination with dengue vaccine in two age cohorts of
           children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The control group will receive two doses of placebo and then one dose of Pneumo 23 vaccine
      for the third vaccination

             weeks prior to first vaccination, until at least 4 weeks after the last vaccination.

          -  Documented receipt of yellow fever vaccine since at least one month before the first
             vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria :
