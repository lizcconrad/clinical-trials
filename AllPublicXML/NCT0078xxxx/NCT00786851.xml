        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of MCL

          -  Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form;

          -  Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements;

          -  Age ≥ 18;

          -  Patients treated with at least one prior treatment regimen, not eligible for or
             relapsed after more intensive treatments (stem cell transplant);

          -  Patients with refractory or relapsed disease;

          -  Measurable and/or valuable disease;

          -  Adequate haematological counts: ANC &gt; 1.5 x 109/L and platelet count &gt; 75 x 109/L
             unless due to bone marrow involvement by MCL;

          -  Conjugated bilirubin up to 2 x ULN unless due to liver involvement by MCL;

          -  Alkaline phosphatase and transaminases up to 2 x ULN unless due to liver involvement
             by MCL;

          -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min;

          -  HIV negativity;

          -  HCV negativity;

          -  HBV negativity or patients with HBcAb +, HbsAg -, HBs Ab+/- and anti HBV prophylaxis
             with lamivudine;

          -  Non peripheral neuropathy or CNS disease;

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 6 months;

          -  Performance status &lt; 2 according to ECOG scale;Disease free of prior malignancies (a
             part MCL) with the exception of currently treated basal cell, squamous cell carcinoma
             of the skin, or carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot; of the cervix or breast;

          -  Written informed consent;

          -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must agree to use two reliable forms of
             contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual

             28 days before starting study drug; 2) while participating in the study; and 3) for at
             least 28 days after discontinuation from the study. The two methods of reliable
             contraception must include one highly effective method (i.e. intrauterine device
             (IUD), hormonal [birth control pills, injections, or implants], tubal ligation,
             partner's vasectomy) and one additional effective (barrier) method (i.e. latex condom,

             vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, rheumatologic,
             hematologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disturbances;

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes (if receiving antidiabetic agents, subjects must be on a stable
             dose for at least 3 months before first dose of study drug);

          -  Creatinine clearances &lt; 50 ml/min;

          -  HIV positivity;

          -  HBV positivity with the exception of patients with HBVcAb +, HbsAg -, HBs Ab+/- in
             anti HBV prophilaxis with lamivudine;

          -  Pregnant or lactating women;

          -  Hypersensitivity reactions to previous thalidomide (if any);

          -  Prior rash ≥ 3 while taking thalidomide (if any);

          -  Active opportunistic infection;

          -  Any other co-existing medical or psychological condition that would preclude
             participation in the study or compromise ability to give informed consent;
