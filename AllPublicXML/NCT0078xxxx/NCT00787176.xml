  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fetal heart rate patterns are an important parameter in the diagnosis of non-reassuring fetal
      status. Combined-spinal epidural analgesia is a method of initiating labor analgesia used by
      approximately 90% of the parturients at Prentice Women's Hospital. Optimizing the variables
      which could affect fetal heart rate patterns at the time of initiation of analgesia, such as
      fluid administration and oxytocin management, could help us provide better care for our
      patients and their fetuses.

      Hypotheses: The combination of fluid administration and lower doses of oxytocin
      administration will have fewer adverse fetal heart rate changes in the first 60 minutes
      following initiation of labor analgesia.

      After obtaining informed, written consent, candidates were randomized to one of four groups
      at the time of request for labor analgesia. All subjects received a maintenance infusion of
      Lactated Ringers(LR). For candidates in Groups A or B, an intravenous bolus of 1000 mL of LR
      was initiated. Candidates in Groups C and D did not receive any additional fluid. If
      randomized to group A or C, the oxytocin management was continued as per the normal active
      management of labor protocal (AMOL). If randomized to groups B or D, the dose of oxytocin
      that was being administered was halved and not increased until 60 minutes after the
      initiation of epidural analgesia. Fetal heart rate monitoring and frequency of uterine
      contractions were recorded by external tocodynamometry.
