    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) is one of the most common chronic gastrointestinal disorders
      affecting humans. Existing therapies for FD are still far from satisfactory and new therapies
      are constantly being sought. Acupuncture has been used for the alleviation of functional
      gastrointestinal symptoms in several non-controlled studies. This study aims to investigate
      the therapeutic efficacy of acupuncture in patients with FD.
