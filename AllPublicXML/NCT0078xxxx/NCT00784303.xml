      This will be an open-label study at approximately 50 study centers in the US, Europe and
      other countries. The study will consist of a screening period (Pre-Treatment Phase), 28-day
      treatment cycles (Treatment Phase), and a study termination/final visit and survival
      follow-up. Patients showing clinical benefit will continue to receive the study drug
      (Extension Phase) and will be followed up with the appropriate assessments.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of Medullary
             Thyroid Cancer (MTC) or Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC).

          2. Measurable disease meeting the following criterion:

               1. At least one lesion (≥ 1.5 cm in longest diameter for non-lymph nodes and ≥2.0 cm
                  in longest diameter for lymph nodes) which is serially and accurately measurable
                  according to Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) using
                  either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

               2. Lesions that have had electron beam radiotherapy must show evidence of
                  progressive disease based on Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
                  Tumors (RECIST) to be deemed a target lesion

          3. Patients must show evidence of disease progression by Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) using site assessment of computed tomography/magnetic resonance
             imaging (CT/MRI) scans within 12 months (+1 month to allow for variances in patient
             scanning intervals) prior to study entry.

          4. Patients with Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC) must be 131-I refractory/resistant:
             never demonstrated 131-I uptake, progression despite 131-I uptake, or cumulative dose
             of 131-I of &gt; 600 mCi (last dose given at least 6 months prior to study entry).

          5. Well controlled blood pressure prior to study entry.

          6. Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, thyroid lymphoma, mesenchymal tumors of the thyroid,
             metastases to the thyroid.

          2. Brain or leptomeningeal metastases.

          3. Significant cardiovascular impairment (history of congestive heart failure &gt; New York
             Heart Association [NYHA] Class II, unstable angina or myocardial infarction within 6
             months of study start, or serious cardiac arrhythmia).

          4. Marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval.

          5. Proteinuria &gt; 1+ or &gt; 30 mg in dipstick testing.

          6. Active hemoptysis (bright red blood of at least ½ teaspoon) in the 28 days prior to
             study entry.
