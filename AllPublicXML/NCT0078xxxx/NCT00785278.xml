  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who use a manual wheelchair depend upon their upper limbs to provide a means of
      locomotion during completion of their activities of daily living. As a result of greater than
      normal usage of the upper limbs, shoulder pain and pathology is common among manual
      wheelchair users. Accordingly, proper wheelchair set-up may be paramount to preventing
      injuries and maintaining comfort during locomotion.

      The purpose of this research study is to create a subject-specific computer model of
      wheelchair propulsion to provide information on wheelchair set-up (in particular, axle
      placement). The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of wheelchair
      set-up on shoulder joint forces during wheelchair propulsion; the secondary objective is to
      develop a predictive model to identify differences in shoulder joint forces that result from
      altering the axle position and seating set-up in user's wheelchairs.

      The hypothesis of the study is that outputs from a patient-specific model will reveal that
      the current axle position for each subject results in peak shoulder joint forces that are
      greater than those predicted from an altered axle position (determined by the model). The
      overall goal is to then adjust each manual wheelchair user's axle placement to one that
      minimizes the magnitude of shoulder joint forces throughout propulsion. It is intended that
      in doing so, the repetitive strain injuries associated with manual wheelchair propulsion may
      be reduced, prolonging a pain-free way of life for this population.

    <description>Able-bodied participants: Able-bodied individuals will be asked to propel a wheelchair at a self-selected speed for a period of time during which data will be collected on their propulsion biomechanics. It is assumed, for the purpose of the study, that un-learned able-bodied individuals learning to propel a wheelchair reflect newly injured individuals who are just getting accustomed to a new chair.</description>
