    <textblock>
      The goal of this 3-year project is to control the spread of community-associated
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) in the Dallas County Jail. CA-MRSA is a
      bacterium spreading rapidly through healthy populations and becoming an epidemic in many
      regions of the U.S. Many people in the community are asymptomatically colonized by MRSA.
      There have been outbreaks of MRSA infections at prisons and jails. We will study the spread
      of MRSA in the jail to better understand how the bacteria are transmitted from person to
      person there and how we can prevent their transmission. All detainees asked to participate
      must give informed consent to do so; their privacy will be carefully protected. Detainees
      with a history of allergy to CHG will be excluded. Seventeen objects in the jail will be
      sampled for contamination with MRSA. Bacteria will be collected from all cultures obtained
      from patients with bacterial skin infections for 18 months in a part of the jail in order to
      determine how frequently these infections are caused by MRSA relative to other bacteria. A
      group of about 1500 adult detainees will be tested for colonization with MRSA in order to
      determine how commonly detainees carry the bacterium. A cluster-randomized 6-month study will
      be undertaken among these detainees and those who take their places when they leave the jail
      to determine if chlorhexidine (CHG)-containing disposable wash cloths for skin cleaning can
      decrease the prevalence of MRSA skin or nose colonization. Detainees receiving CHG cloths
      (about 500 detainees) will be compared to detainees receiving water-soaked cloths for skin
      cleaning (about 500 detainees) or no intervention (about 500 detainees). The primary outcome
      will be a difference in average colonization prevalence in detention tanks, which are
      discrete detention units housing detainees, comparing the usual care to the CHG-exposed tanks
      after 6 months of CHG cloth use. A secondary outcome will be a decrease in skin infections
      from any cause in the tanks receiving CHG compared with usual care. All of the MRSA isolates
      and a sample of the S. aureus isolates susceptible to methicillin from specimens colonizing
      or infecting detainees, as well as those contaminating surfaces and objects in the jail will
      be tested genetically in order to determine which strains of MRSA are present in the jail.
      This study may identify ways to stop the spread of MRSA among people in jails and prisons, as
      well as other places.
