    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the 2.25 mm XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary
      Stent System (XIENCE V® EECSS) in improving coronary luminal diameter in subjects with
      ischemic heart disease due to a maximum of two de novo native coronary artery lesions in
      small vessels, each in a different epicardial vessel.

         13. Elective surgery is planned within 12 months after the procedure that will require
             discontinuing either aspirin or clopidogrel.

         14. Subject has a platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3, a WBC (white

         15. Subject has known renal insufficiency (eg, serum creatinine level ≥ 2.5 mg/dL, or on
             dialysis).

         16. Subject has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood
             transfusions.

         17. Subject has had a cerebrovascular accident/stroke or transient ischemic neurological
             attack (TIA) within the past six months.

         18. Subject has had a significant gastro-intestinal or significant urinary bleed within
             the past six months.

         19. Subject has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French sheath
             insertion.

         20. Subject has other medical illness (e.g., cancer or congestive heart failure) or known
             history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that may cause
             non-compliance with the protocol, confound the data interpretation or is associated
             with a limited life expectancy (i.e., less than one year).

         21. Subject is currently participating in another clinical study that has not yet

         13. Target or non-target vessel(s) have previously been treated with percutaneous
             intervention (e.g. balloon angioplasty, stent, cutting balloon, atherectomy) &lt; 9

         14. A vessel not intended to be treated with a 2.25 mm XIENCE V® EECS or commercial sizes
