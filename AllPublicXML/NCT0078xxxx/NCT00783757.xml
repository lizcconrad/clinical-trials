      The purpose of this research study is to see if Near-Infrared Tomographic Optical Breast
      Imaging (TOBI) scans can help monitor breast tumor response during treatment for breast
      cancer. The images created by the TOBI scan show changes in blood blow and oxygen levels in
      breast tissue.

      -  Participants will have a TOBI scan prior to starting their cancer treatment and again on
           day 8 after their first treatment. Participants will also be asked if they would
           volunteer to undergoing one or more additional TOBI scans on days 2-7 after they begin
           cancer treatment. These additional scans are optional. Participants will also have a
           scan on the first day of each treatment cycle.

        -  TOBI scans will be performed at the Gillette Center for Breast Cancer at the
           Massachusetts General Hospital.

        -  For the scan, each breast is placed between 2 plastic plates in order to spread the
           tissue apart, similar to the procedure for a mammogram. The TOBI scanner is attached to
           these plates. We will apply mild pressure to compress the breast and the breast will be
           scanned using light waves. Each scan will take about 3 minutes.
