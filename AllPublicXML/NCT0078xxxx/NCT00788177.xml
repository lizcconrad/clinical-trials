      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of pegaptanib (Macugen®) for neovascular
      (exudative) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) when the first dose is administered to the
      submacular space instead of vitreous body in cases when previous state-of-the-art treatment
      for the AMD was deemed ineffective.

          -  Patients who at baseline

          -  Have a BCVA letter score in the study eye between 20/40 to 20/320 using an ETDRS chart
             measured at 4 meters or Snellen equivalent

          -  Have a CNV lesion of any type in the study eye with the following characteristics as
             determined by fluorescein angiography:

          -  Evidence that CNV extends under the geometric center of the foveal avascular zone.

          -  Previous state-of-the-art therapy for the disease is deemed ineffective with following
             characteristics are given:

          -  Loss of visual acuity (2 or more Snellen lines) in the previous 3 months defined as
             either OR

          -  ≥10% increase in the lesion diameter as assessed by fluorescein angiography in the
             previous 3 months

          -  Ability of subject to understand character and individual consequences of clinical
             trial.

          -  Signed and dated informed consent of the subject must be available before start of any
             specific trial procedures.

          -  Women with childbearing potential practicing a medically accepted contraception

                  VEGF levels (namely uveitis, neovascular glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic
                  maculopathy, ocular ischemic syndrome, retinal vessel occlusion)

               -  Had previous vitrectomy surgery for whatsoever reason

               -  Are not pseudophakic

               -  Have a &gt;50% area of scarring of the whole CNV lesion size as seen in FA

               -  Arterial hypertension refractory to medical treatment

               -  Pregnancy and lactation.

               -  History of hypersensitivity to the investigational medicinal product or to any
                  drug with similar chemical structure or to any excipient present in the
                  pharmaceutical form of the investigational medicinal product.

               -  Participation in other clinical trials during the present clinical trial or
                  within the last 3 months.

               -  Medical or psychological condition that would not permit completion of the trial
