  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare best supportive care plus oxaliplatin/ folinic acid/
      5-FU versus best supportive alone in patients with gemcitabine refractory pancreatic cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine (G) given until progressive disease (PD) is still standard therapy in patients
      with advanced pancreatic cancer. No standard secondline regimen is available after PD. Best
      supportive care (BSC) is the main option for these patients. Our phase II study (Pelzer et
      al, ASCO 2002) showed activity of the OFF (Oxaliplatin/Folinic Acid/5-FU) regimen. To confirm
      these data we started this multicenter phase III study to examine OFF vs. BSC alone.

      165 patients were needed for this study. Following CT/ MRT confirmed PD patients were
      randomized. Stratification included duration of firstline therapy, Karnofsky Performance
      Status (KPS) and tumor stage. OFF (outpatient regimen): 5-FU 2g/m² (24h)/FA 200 mg/m² (30min)
      on d1, d8, d15, d22, additional Oxaliplatin 85mg/m² (2h) on day 8 and 22. Rest on day 23 and
      42.

    <description>OFF was given according to a six week cycle. FA (500 mg/m2 , 0.5h, i.v.) and 5-FU (2,600 mg/m2, 24-hour, i.v.) were administered on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2 , 2-4 h, i.v.) was administered directly before FA/ 5-FU on days 8 and 22.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic pancreatic
             adenocarcinoma that had progressed during first line gemcitabine therapy were eligible

        Other inclusion criteria were:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70%

          -  Bidimensionally measurable reference lesion, adequate laboratory values for hematology
             (white blood cell [WBC] count &gt; 3.5´109/L, platelet count &gt; 100´109/L), renal function
             (creatine clearance &gt; 30 ml/min) and hepatic function (aspartate aminotransferase
             [AST] or alanine aminotransferase [ALT] &lt; 2.5 ´ upper normal limit [UNL] and in the
             case of liver metastasis &lt; 5 x UNL)

          -  As well as controlled pain

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded from the study if they had any severe concurrent medical

             neuropathy &gt; grade 2 or had previous or current malignancies at other origin; besides,
             pregnant or lactating women were excluded.

          -  All patients provided written informed consent.
