  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the support needed to improve compliance with Chantix for smoking
      cessation. This is a two arm pilot study of African American smokers to provide varying
      levels of side effect management and compliance support during a 12 week treatment period.
      The primary aim of the study is to estimate the effect of induction support compared to
      standard care in increasing compliance with Chantix at month 3

    <description>Compliance with Chantix calculated as the total doses taken over the total number of doses prescribed. Adherence was measured by pill counts. Measurements taken during monthly medication refill visits. There was no specific predetermined cutoff number on the scale which determined non-compliance. All results from compliance calculations are included in the table.</description>
