      The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is an NIH Roadmap
      initiative to develop a computerized system measuring patient-reported outcomes in
      respondents with a wide range of chronic diseases and demographic characteristics. In the
      first four years of its existence, the PROMIS network developed item banks for measuring
      patient-reported outcomes in the areas of pain, fatigue, emotional distress, physical
      function, and social functioning. During the item banking process, the PROMIS network
      conducted focus groups, individual cognitive interviews, and lexile (reading level) analyses
      to refine the meaning, clarity, and literacy demands of all items. The item banks were
      administered to over 20,000 respondents and calibrated using models based on item response
      theory (IRT). Using these IRT calibrations, computerized adaptive test (CAT) algorithms were
      developed and implemented. The network has designed a series of studies using clinical
      populations to evaluate the item attributes, examine their utility as CATs, and validate the
      item banks. More information on the PROMIS network can be found at www.nihpromis.org.

      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the experience and impact of having
      congestive heart failure (CHF). In particular, we hope to develop better questionnaires that
      can measure heart failure patients' quality-of-life.

      This project will assess the validity (including responsiveness) of selected Patient Reported
      Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments in patients with severe CHF who
      receive heart transplants. The following is a list of goals for this project:

        -  To estimate the responsiveness of PROMIS domain scores by comparing scores in patients
           with severe heart failure before and after a clinically significant event (heart
           transplant). The specific PROMIS domains assessed are physical functioning, fatigue,
           satisfaction with discretionary social activities, depression, and global health.

        -  To estimate the responsiveness of a disease-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO)
           measure, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), the Medical Outcomes Study
           Short Form-36 Vitality subscale (SF-36v2), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2).

        -  To collect cross-sectional and longitudinal data on traditional clinical measures of
           heart failure outcome (6-minute walk test and New York Heart Association [NYHA] class)
           that can inform the definition of a minimally important difference (MID) for the PROMIS
           domains of physical functioning, fatigue, satisfaction with discretionary social
           activities, depression, and global health.

    <description>Clinical and patient-reported assessments will be performed at baseline and 8-12 weeks 86 (end of study). Clinical indicators of functioning will include the New York Heart 87 Association (NYHA) classification and the six-minute walk test. We will include the 88 Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), a disease-specific measure of health-89 related quality of life (HRQOL), as a point of reference for understanding the relative 90 validity (including responsiveness) of the PRPROMIS item banks. Instruments will include 91 PROMIS computerized adaptive tests (CATS).</description>
