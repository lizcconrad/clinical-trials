      Purpose of study: Evaluation of the affect of dose rate on UVR induced skin erythema.

      Study design: A single-center, prospective, randomized, crossover, open study.

      Number of patients: 20-40

      Patient population: Healthy volunteers

      Control: Different sites on patients body

      Procedure duration: Total 3-5 hours (4 visits)

      Duration of follow up: 4 days

      Duration of study: Up to 6 months

      Primary objectives: To examine the difference in erythemal response as a function of dose
      rate, and to assess the total amount of energy that is theoretically transmitted through a
      sunscreen within the range of SPF 2-10.
