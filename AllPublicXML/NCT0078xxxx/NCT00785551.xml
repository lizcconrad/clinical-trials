  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 ml/min or &gt;50
      to 80 ml/min, respectively) on the pharmacokinetic profile of quinine and its active
      metabolite, 3'-hydroxyquinine, will be investigated. Safety and tolerability in healthy
      subjects versus those with mild to moderate renal impairment will be compared, as well.

    <textblock>
      Since many of the adverse events associated with quinine are dose-related, it is important to
      consider how varying degrees of renal dysfunction alter quinine pharmacokinetics possibly
      warranting dosage adjustment in these patients. This study will compare the pharmacokinetics
      of quinine in patients with normal, mild or moderate renal impairment. Eighteen non-smoking
      males and female volunteers between 18-65 years of age weighing at least 60 kg with BMI
      between 18- 40 kg/m2 will be divided into 3 groups of 6 subjects each based on renal function
      as defined (6 normal, 6 mild impairment, 6 moderate impairment). Subjects will be confined to
      the study unit during the entire 5 day study period beginning on the evening of Day -3. To
      confirm renal function classification, creatinine clearance will be measured via 24-hour
      urine collection from 7am Day -2 until 7am Day -1. On day 1, after a fast of at least 8
      hours, each patient will receive a single 648 mg dose of quinine sulfate. Blood and urine
      samples will be collected at times sufficient to adequately define the pharmacokinetics of
      quinine and its active metabolite, 3'-hydroxyquinine) in the three study groups. Subjects
      will be monitored regarding adverse effects throughout study participation.
