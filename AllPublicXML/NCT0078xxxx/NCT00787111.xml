    <textblock>
      This open-label research study will continue to monitor the safety of fluoxetine in children
      after their completion of a previous double-blind placebo controlled clinical study, with
      fluoxetine. The study will also look at the effect of fluoxetine on IQ (Intelligence
      Quotient) over an 18 month period.

      This research study will monitor the safety of fluoxetine in all patients after their
      completion of the previous clinical study, in which they received fluoxetine or placebo. The
      study will look at the effect of fluoxetine on IQ (Intelligence Quotient) over an 18 month
      period. A possible total of 128 children and adolescents with AD will participate in the
      study from sites across the US.

      The study is open-label. All of the subjects in this study will receive the active medicine
      fluoxetine orally dissolving tablets (ODT). Children will begin by receiving a daily dose of
      2mg fluoxetine for two weeks. The family and child will be asked to come back to the clinic 2
      weeks later and, depending on the child's tolerance and response to the medicine, may have
      his or her dose increased to 4mg/day. After this visit, the time between visits to the clinic
      and the dose that the child will receive will be decided by the study investigator based on
      their clinical judgment on benefit versus tolerability. The largest daily dose of fluoxetine
      that the child could receive in this study is 54mg.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have met the inclusion criteria for the preceding double-blind SOFIA
             Study, and must have completed at least 10 weeks of treatment in the 14 week SOFIA
             study or have withdrawn from the SOFIA study due to worsening of clinical symptoms
             (i.e. a CGI-I-AD of 6 or 7 which, in the Investigator's opinion, required alternative
             intervention except symptoms of activation which could not be ameliorated by reduction
             in dose).

          2. Patients must have been free of fluoxetine and other SSRI's for 4 weeks prior to the
             first dose of open-label medication (washout).

          3. Female patients who have reached menarche must have a negative pregnancy test at
             baseline and as required, in the opinion of the Investigator.

          4. Females of childbearing potential must be using a medically accepted means of
             contraception not affected by fluoxetine treatment, or must remain abstinent for the
             duration of the study.

          5. Patients must be able to follow the Investigator's instructions and be able to comply
             with visit requirements

          6. Each Legally Authorized Representative (usually parent or guardian) must have a level
             of understanding sufficient to provide written informed consent to all required tests
             and procedures.

          7. As required by the local or central IRB, the patient should assent to all required
             tests and procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who experienced a serious adverse event during the double-blind SOFIA Study
             which was determined to be related to the study medication by the Investigator or the
             sponsor

          2. Patients who were unable to tolerate the lowest dose of study medication in the
             double-blind SOFIA study (2mg fluoxetine or placebo) should not be enrolled in this
             study

          3. Diagnosis of Rett Syndrome, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder

          4. Patients currently taking psychotropic medication are excluded. Patients can be
             enrolled in the study if the psychotropic medication has been completely withdrawn
             prior to the baseline visit; for at least two weeks for neuroleptics / atypical
             antipsychotics and for at least 5 days for stimulants

          5. Patients exhibiting high levels of aggression, irritability or self injurious behavior
             to the extent that in the Investigator's opinion the patient would be more
             appropriately treated with psychotropic medication other than fluoxetine such as an
             atypical antipsychotic

          6. Patients currently taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Patients who have stopped
             taking an irreversible MAOI should be free of medication for at least 2 weeks prior to
             the baseline visit and medication free for at least one day after stopping a
             reversible MAOI A.

          7. Patients with diabetes who are treated with insulin

          8. Patients currently taking tramadol, triptans (e.g.sumatriptan), lithium, tryptophan,

             other factors), as assessed by the Investigator.

         16. Current active seizure disorder

         17. Tourette's Disorder.

         18. Female patients who are either pregnant or nursing.
