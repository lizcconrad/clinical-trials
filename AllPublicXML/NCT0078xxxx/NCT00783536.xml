      This is a randomized, open label, active-comparator, parallel design, outpatient, multicenter
      study being conducted in Mexico. Subjects with early active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who
      have not received treatment with a Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) in the
      previous 6 months will be eligible for the study. Study subjects will be randomized into one
      of two treatments groups and receive either etanercept + methotrexate or standard
      non-biologic DMARD therapy.
