      The purpose of this research study is to test if an experimental drug called ZT-031 can help
      men over 30 years or post-menopausal women over 55 years of age with certain types of hip
      fracture to heal better or faster following surgery and to determine if ZT-031 is safe for
      patients with fractures. To be allowed in the study you have to have a type of hip fracture
      that requires surgery that is being studied (intertrochanteric fracture). You must also
      otherwise be in good health, with no serious diseases such as cancer, neurologic disease,
      other bone disease, liver, heart or kidney disease. You must be able to inject yourself every
      day with the study medication using an injection pen, like that used for insulin injections.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects are required to meet all of the following criteria for inclusion in the study:

          1. Signed Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Research Ethics Board (REB)-approved informed
             consent form (ICF).

          2. Sustained an unstable low energy intertrochanteric (Evans Type II or higher) hip
             fracture within 7 days prior to planned surgery date. Low energy is defined as a
             fracture that occurs spontaneously or from a fall from a stationary height of ≤ 1
             meter (3 feet) or missing one to three steps.

          3. Women ≥ 55 years of age and men ≥ 30 years of age of any race. If female, subjects
             must be post-menopausal for at least 5 years and weigh ≥ 110 lbs or 50 kg.

          4. Subjects who are expected to undergo or have recently undergone (within two weeks)
             open or closed repair of the fracture requiring a CHS.

          5. By history, the subject was at least household ambulatory prior to hip fracture.

          6. Serum calcium level within the normal range when corrected for albumin. Corrected
             calcium (mg/dL) = Serum Ca (mg/dL) + 0.8 x (4.0 - albumin [g/dL])

          7. Able and willing to comply with all protocol procedures.

          8. Cognitive, visual, auditory and physical abilities adequate to undertake assessments.

          9. Availability of a care partner to administer injections or demonstrated ability to
             self-administer injections. Subjects planning to self-administer study drug will need
             to show that they will be capable of accurately self-injecting study drug in rotating
             quadrants of the abdomen, in the opinion of the Investigator.

         10. Clinically acceptable medical history and physical examination, according to the
             judgment of the Investigator.

         11. Laboratory results within normal ranges or, if abnormal, considered by the
             Investigator as not clinically significant for the well-being of the subject or for
             the purpose of the study.

             The following additional criteria are required for randomization and dosing with
             ZT-031 or placebo to occur:

         12. The most recent value for 25-hydroxy Vitamin D (25OHD) must be at or above the lower
             limit of normal (LLN) for the laboratory reference range of the testing method used
             for determination of 25OHD. NOTE: Randomization should be delayed until it is known
             that 25OHD is ≥ LLN.

         13. The most recent value for intact PTH must be ≤ ULN for the laboratory reference range.

         14. Randomization and dosing must occur within 2 weeks post-op. Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects who meet any of the following conditions are excluded from this clinical study:

          1. Previous fracture(s) or bone or joint surgery in the currently fractured site

          2. Intertrochanteric fracture with reverse obliquity

          3. Pathologic fracture: A fracture occurring at a site of metabolic bone disease (other
             than osteoporosis) or a benign or malignant tumor

          4. Presence of a concurrent disease known to affect bone metabolism other than
             post-menopausal osteoporosis, including but not limited to hyperparathyroidism,

             syncope

          7. Unstable or clinically significant cardiovascular disease resulting in:

               1. Hemodynamic instability manifested as hypotension unresponsive to intravenous
                  fluids

               2. Uncontrolled hypertension requiring administration of parenteral therapy.

          8. Renal disease, defined by:
