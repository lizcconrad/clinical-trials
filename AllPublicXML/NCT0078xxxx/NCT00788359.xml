  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical and translational research in cystic fibrosis (CF) is hampered by a lack of
      biomarkers that can be used to identify promising new therapies. There is an urgent need for
      development and validation of biomarkers that more quickly predict the usefulness of
      potential drugs in CF and might prognosticate clinical course. In particular, combinations of
      protein biomarkers that can be obtained non-invasively offer great promise. The goal of this
      project is to determine whether protein biomarkers in blood can demonstrate a beneficial
      effect of treatment over two weeks. We intend to initially target an acute pulmonary
      exacerbation in CF because we know that subjects being treated with intravenous antibiotics
      and enhanced mucus clearance display clinical improvements within two weeks. We propose to
      prospectively collect blood samples from a large cohort of well-characterized CF persons
      serially during inpatient admissions for a pulmonary exacerbation and longitudinally during
      annual visits. Through this proposal, we hope to identify a CF lung injury biomarker panel
      that increases in the setting of an acute pulmonary exacerbation and improves rapidly
      following intravenous antibiotic therapy. Additionally, we will begin to explore whether this
      CF lung injury biomarker panel might also prognosticate clinical course including decline in
      pulmonary function. Finally, this study will serve as an important source of blood samples
      that will be banked for future biomarker and therapeutic studies designed to benefit the
      entire CF community.

        Individuals with CF greater than or equal to 10 years of age who are being started on
        intravenous (IV) antibiotics for a clinically diagnosed pulmonary exacerbation. Patients
        must demonstrate at least 3 of the 11 criteria for pulmonary exacerbation as defined by a
        Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Consensus Conference. Treatment with a minimum of two IV
        antibiotics is required. We expect to enroll an approximately equal number of males and
        females. Most CF patients in our clinics are of white, non-Hispanic origin and we
        anticipate this ethnic mix to persist in this study. The majority of pediatric CF subjects
        will be admitted to the hospital for treatment purposes whereas many adults receive their
        IV antibiotics at home.
