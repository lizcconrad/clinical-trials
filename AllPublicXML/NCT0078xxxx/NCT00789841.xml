  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will study the total gastrointestinal transit time (GITT), gastric emptying and small
      intestine motility in NET patients before and after treated with somatostatin analogues and
      compare these to healthy subjects. For this we will use radio-opaque markers and the newly
      developed Motility Tracking System (MTS).

      Hypothesis: Patients with NET and carcinoid syndrome have decreased GITT, gastric emptying
      and small bowel transit time and an increase in phase III MMC activity compared to healthy
      subjects. Treatment with somatostatin analogues increase transit times and decrease phase III
      MMC activity and improves the clinical symptoms.

    <description>MTS: A small magnetic pill (6x15mm) is swallowed by the patient and the movement of this pill is registered by a sensor (coordinates x,y,z angles θ, φ) and depicted af graphs on a computer screen. For determination of GITT a capsule containing 10 radio-opaque markers is ingested every day for six days, on day seven an abdominal x-ray is performed.</description>
