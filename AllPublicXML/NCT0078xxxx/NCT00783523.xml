  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain vascular malformations, including arteriovenous malformations (AVM), cavernous
      malformations (CVM) and aneurysms, are a source of life-threatening risk of intracranial
      hemorrhage. The etiology and pathogenesis are unknown. There is no medical therapy presently
      available. Prevention of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the primary reason to
      treat brain vascular malformations. The goal of this study is to: begin pilot studies to lay
      the groundwork for future clinical trials to develop medical therapy to decrease ICH risk.

      Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) regulate the extracellular matrix in association with
      various hemorrhagic brain disorders. MMP-9 has been most consistently associated with
      vascular wall instability and hemorrhagic brain disorders. Doxycycline, a non-specific MMP
      inhibitor, may enhance vascular stability, thus reducing the risk of spontaneous hemorrhage
      in brain vascular malformations by decreasing MMP-9 activity.

      -  Doses will be randomized by the Pharmacy Department at UCSF for Doxycycline 100 mg/BID
           and Placebo BID. These will be prepared in blister-packs.

        -  Depending on enrollment/surgery date, patients will take medication either one to two
           weeks before surgery. Patients will be assigned to a treatment group according to a
           random table.

        -  Each patient will be initially provided with a 1 or 2-week supply of drug in blister
           packs. The patient will take the final dose of study drug on the morning of surgery.

      Baseline labs will be obtained and then again at time of surgery along with a piece of
      surgical tissue.
