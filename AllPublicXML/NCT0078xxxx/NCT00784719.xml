    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Ocular Tolerability Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular tolerability assessment included evaluation of severity and duration of the 5 symptoms: burning/stinging, blurred vision, ocular discomfort, pain, tearing. Severity was assessed on a 4-point scale, where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe. Duration was assessed as immediate (if subsided within 5 minutes [&lt;5 min] after application) or persistent (if continued beyond 5 minutes [&gt;=5 min] after application).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire 25-item Score (NEI-VFQ-25) at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>NEI-VFQ-25 questionnaire included 25 items based on which overall composite VFQ score and 12 subscales were derived: general health (GH), general vision (GV), ocular pain (OP), near activities (NAct), distance activities (DA), social functioning (SF), mental health (MH), role difficulties (RD), dependency, driving, color vision (CV) and peripheral vision (PV). Response to each question converted to 0-100 score. Each subscale, total score=average of items contributing to score. For each subscale and total score, score range: 0 to 100, higher score=less symptoms/better visual functioning.</description>

        <description>Corneal staining was assessed by instilling sodium fluorescein dye in the eye and after 1 to 2 minutes, observing for corneal staining with the aid of a yellow filter and slit lamp. The cornea was divided into five different zones and each corneal zone was graded independently using a 0 to 3 grading scale; where 0=none, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=severe. Results from study eye were to be reported. Study eye is the ‘worse eye’, defined as the eye with worse Schirmer test score without anesthesia score at baseline.</description>

          <title>Time to Achieve 100 Percent (%) Clearance of Corneal Staining</title>
          <description>Corneal staining was assessed by instilling sodium fluorescein dye in the eye and after 1 to 2 minutes, observing for corneal staining with the aid of a yellow filter and slit lamp. The cornea was divided into five different zones and each corneal zone was graded independently using a 0 to 3 grading scale; where 0=none, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=severe. Results from study eye were to be reported. Study eye is the ‘worse eye’, defined as the eye with worse Schirmer test score without anesthesia score at baseline.</description>

Study eye is the ‘worse eye’, defined as the eye with worse Schirmer test score without anesthesia score at baseline.</description>
          <population>ITT population included all enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. LOCF method was used for imputing missing data at Week 8. Here, 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time point for each group respectively.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved &gt;=10 mm Schirmer Wetting Score With Anesthesia at Week 8</title>
        <description>Schirmer test was performed 2 to 3 minutes after 1 drop of proparacaine 0.5% was placed in lower conjunctival fornix and superior bulbar conjunctiva of each eye. It was used to estimate tear flow stimulated reflexly by insertion of a filter paper strip into the conjunctival sac for 5 min. The length of wetting was recorded to the nearest 0.5 mm. If the wetting line was oblique, halfway point was used. Results from study eye are reported. Study eye is the ‘worse eye’, defined as the eye with worse Schirmer test score without anesthesia score at baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Corneal Staining Scores at Week 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8</title>
        <description>Corneal staining was assessed using fluorescein dye, a yellow filter, and a slit lamp. The cornea was divided into 5 different zones. Each corneal zone was graded independently using a 0 to 3 grading scale; where 0=none, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=severe. Sum of scores of each zone led to total score. Total score range: 0 to 15, higher score indicated greater staining. Results from study eye are reported. Study eye is the ‘worse eye’, defined as the eye with worse Schirmer test score without anesthesia score at baseline.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Demonstrated 100% Clearance of Corneal Staining</title>
        <description>Corneal staining was assessed using fluorescein dye, yellow filter, slit lamp. Cornea was divided into 5 different zones. Each corneal zone was graded independently using 0 to 3 grading scale:0=none, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=severe. Sum of scores of each zone led to total score. Total score range: 0 to 15, higher score indicated greater staining. Results from study eye are reported. Study eye is the ‘worse eye’, defined as the eye with worse Schirmer test score without anesthesia score at baseline.</description>

        <description>Interpalpebral conjunctival staining was performed 1 minute following ocular administration of lissamine green dye with aid of slit lamp. Based on Oxford grading system, bulbar conjunctiva was divided into 2 zones: nasal, temporal. Staining were graded using a 6-point scale (0=absent, 5=severe). Total score=sum of 2 zone scores. Total score range: 0 to 10, higher score=higher damage to eyes due to dryness. Negative change from baseline indicated improvement. Results from study eye are reported. Study eye is the eye with worse Schirmer test score without anesthesia score at baseline.</description>

        <description>TBUT was the time interval between the last complete blink and the first appearance of a dry spot, or disruption in the tear film. It was measured under a slit lamp following instillation of fluorescein dye in the eye using a stopwatch. Results from study eye are reported. Study eye is the ‘worse eye’, defined as the eye with worse Schirmer test score without anesthesia score at baseline.</description>

It contains 12 questions, each measured on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 6 (always/severe). Total score was transformed to range of 0 to 100, higher score indicated more ocular discomfort. Negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

          <description>OCI: validated questionnaire to measure the frequency and intensity of 6 common dry eye symptoms: dryness, grittiness, stinging, eye tiredness, pain, and itching. It contains 12 questions, each measured on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 6 (always/severe). Total score was transformed to range of 0 to 100, higher score indicated more ocular discomfort. Negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>
          <population>ITT population included all enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. LOCF method was used for imputing missing data at Week 8. Here, 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time point for each group respectively.</population>

Based on these item scores, a total OSDI score (question 1 [Q1]-Q12) and three subscale scores can be derived: Ocular Symptom (Q1-Q3), Vision-related function (Q4-Q9), and Environmental trigger (Q10-Q12). Each derived score ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicates worse condition.</description>

Response to each question converted to 0-100 score. Each subscale, total score=average of items contributing to score.
