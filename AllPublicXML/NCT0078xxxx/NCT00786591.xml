  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute pancreatitis refers to inflammation of the pancreas and is associated with sudden onset
      of severe abdominal pain, often accompanied by transient systemic manifestations, including
      fever. In the majority of cases, the inflammatory process is self limiting and patient
      recovers uneventfully; however, in about 20% to 30% of the cases, a protracted clinical
      course ensues and the disease may progress to a severe necrotizing form, often triggering a
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome during which time, acute respiratory distress
      syndrome, renal failure, shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation may occur. In the
      worst sequelae, multiple organ dysfunctions may follow and death supervene. The clinical
      outcome of patients suffering from severe acute pancreatitis depends to a great extent on the
      early diagnosis and prediction of severity and timely therapeutic intervention to prevent
      local and systemic complications. However, the course of the disease is often difficult to
      predict from the outset. Currently, there is still no single clinical or laboratory test that
      can be considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosis and/or assessment of severity of acute
      pancreatitis. For a disease that may progress rapidly without apparent sign, the ideal marker
      for the prediction of disease severity in a patient would be one that is measurable rapidly
      and easily, besides being able to fulfill all the other criteria required of a good
      biological marker. To identify such a potential marker for acute pancreatitis requires
      understanding of the pathophysiological process underlying the rapid progression of a
      fulminant course of the disease. Although much remains to be elucidated, recent studies in
      animals have suggested that inflammatory mediators substance P and hydrogen sulfide may play
      critical roles. This study will evaluate if inflammatory mediators substance P and hydrogen
      sulfide are upregulated early on in the disease process, and if the levels of their elevation
      predict disease severity.
