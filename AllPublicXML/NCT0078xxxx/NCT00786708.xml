      Hypothesis: In patients that present to an urban emergency room, a single urine neutrophil
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) measurement can classify their kidney disease as
      stable chronic kidney disease, acute tubular necrosis, urinary outlet obstruction or
      pre-renal azotemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether urinary NGAL levels are able to distinguish
      the classical categories of renal disease. Previous studies have strongly suggested that this
      protein marks those with fulminant renal dysfunction with greater sensitivity and time
      resolution than currently used markers. Studies to date have been in highly selected
      populations: children and adults following cardiac surgery, infants with cardiovascular
      anomalies, and patients with known chronic kidney disease. Demonstration of similarly robust
      sensitivity and specificity in a broad Emergency Room population would strengthen the
      conception of NGAL as a marker of early or advancing kidney dysfunction. Most importantly, if
      NGAL can distinguish between types of renal disease at presentation in the ER, it might have
      important implications regarding ER management of these common presentations. For example, it
      could reduce diagnostic ambiguity and lag time from hours or days to seconds.
