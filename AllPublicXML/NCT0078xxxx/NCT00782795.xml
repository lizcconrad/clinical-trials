  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if study drug (Pioglitazone) treatment will improve
      pre-diabetes (insulin resistance) or ealy diabetes and improve clinical symptoms (pain) or
      laboratory evidence of chronic pancreatitis.

      The goal of the investigators is to gather information from this study to help gain
      understanding of a potential therapy for chronic pancreatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pancreas is a digestive organ that secretes insulin (and other hormones) into the blood
      for regulating blood sugar (glucose) and digestive enzymes into the intestine for digesting
      and absorbing nutrients consumed in meals. Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive clinical
      disease of the pancreas, associated with swelling (inflammation), scarring (fibrosis) and
      loss of normal functioning tissue. Patients develop diabetes mellitus (elevated blood sugar),
      malabsorption of nutrients, weight loss and pain. Presently chronic pancreatitis is
      considered an irreversible condition because the mechanisms responsible for chronic
      pancreatitis are poorly understood and no therapy is proven. However, recent studies provide
      important clues that oral medications (Thiazolidinediones) used to treat diabetes mellitus
      might improve or reverse features of chronic pancreatitis, including elevated sugar or
      diabetes, reduced secretion of digestive enzymes, and pancreatic swelling and scarring.

      Note: Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America (TPNA) provided pioglitazone and placebo pills
      with identically appearance until June 28, 2010, approximately the middle of the study.

    <description>The SF36 (Short Form with 36 questions) QoL scoring system has 36 questions, comprising two main dimensions (Physical Health and Mental Health), further divided by 8 independent scales (Physical functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional and Mental Health). The scales for general health and mental health overlap components of both the two main dimensions (Physical Health and Mental Health). The scales, including the total score and dimensions are scored as a number between 0 and 100, where 0 represents lower limits of functioning and 100 is best functioning possible. Data reported is the average total score.</description>

        <description>The SF36 (Short Form with 36 questions) QoL scoring system has 36 questions, comprising two main dimensions (Physical Health and Mental Health), further divided by 8 independent scales (Physical functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional and Mental Health). The scales for general health and mental health overlap components of both the two main dimensions (Physical Health and Mental Health). The scales, including the total score and dimensions are scored as a number between 0 and 100, where 0 represents lower limits of functioning and 100 is best functioning possible. Data reported is the average total score.</description>
