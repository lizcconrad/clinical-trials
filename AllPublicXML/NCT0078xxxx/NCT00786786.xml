      Purpose: This project is designed to identify what the key barriers to participating in
      exercise are for the general population of people living with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the
      United States (US).

      Background: A previous study of 681 people living with SCI demonstrated that the majority of
      participants thought that exercise was important (97%), but that only 57% actually had access
      to exercise (K.D. Anderson. 2004. Targeting recovery: Priorities of the spinal cord injured
      population. J. Neurotrauma. 21:1371-1383). The next step in continuing that research is to
      determine in more detail what the perceived barriers to exercise are so that they can be
      addressed in multiple settings (research design of exercise protocols, community access and
      awareness, clinical effectiveness, etc.).

      Methods: Internet-based survey of people with spinal cord injuries (SCI). Expected Results:
      It is expected that the perceived barriers will fall under 3 main categories (internal,
      resources, and structural). However, there may be other barriers we are unaware of, for
      example, societal or cultural factors or other factors completely unforeseen.

      Relevance to Rehabilitation: The findings of this project will provide valuable information
      needed to design strategies aimed at improving participation in exercise by people living
      with SCI. SCI results in several secondary health conditions over time, which can likely be
      positively impacted by exercise.
