  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate, among persons who have completed the restorative
      phase of stroke and have ceased rehabilitation, the relative effectiveness in improving
      functional exercise capacity of two programs for continued care, a home-based general fitness
      training program using stationary cycling and a disability targeted, home-based exercise
      program to enhance mobility and walking competency. capacity compared with the &quot;walking&quot;
      group and that consequently the cycle group will achieve a higher quality of life.

      A secondary objective is to explore factors associated with compliance with the exercise
      regimens. Previous research has indicated that cognitive-affective-behavioural profile is
      related to exercise activity in a number of populations including sedentary adults, older
      adults and patients with cardiovascular disease. As we anticipate that one of the mechanisms
      by which the cycling will result in an outcome better than the more traditional type of
      disability tailored exercise program is through greater compliance, this second objective is
      very relevant. This study will also address the impact of regular exercise on cardio-vascular
      risk factor profile.

      The specific clinical hypothesis to be tested is that, over a one year period, persons
      assigned to the general fitness &quot;cycle&quot; group will experience a greater increase in
      functional exercise

    <description>Participants will be given a time and intensity graded program at an intensity that is comfortable and tolerable for the individual. The individual will be encouraged to augment, gradually, either the time of cycling per day or the work of cycling, always keeping within the limits of comfort and tolerability. Participants will also be given a target heart rate threshold to try and meet but not to exceed. This will be based their response to the stress test and will most likely be between 50% and 70% of maximum age-predicted heart rate. The aim is to build up to one-half hour of cycling per day. All bicycles will be equipped with electronic monitoring of speed, distance, and heart rate.</description>
