    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate improvement and efficacy of paliperidone
      extended-release for subjective well-being and drug attitudes of participants, when switching
      from oral antipsychotics in participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with
      symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and
      hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-centric
      (conducted in more than one center), prospective (study following participants forward in
      time), and non-comparative study, in participants with schizophrenia. The study consists of
      following parts: Screening (that is, 14 days before study commences on Day 1); Acute
      Treatment phase (24 weeks); Extension phase 1 (24 weeks), which will be followed by
      additional Extension phase 2 (48 weeks). Total study duration per participant will be 96
      weeks. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by change from Baseline in Subjective Well-being
      Under Neuroleptic (SWN-20) Scale score and change from Baseline in Drug Attitude Inventory
      scores. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Subjective Well-being Under Neuroleptic (SWN-20) Scale Total Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SWN-20 scale is a 20 item scale that was originally designed to explore the subjective experience of psychotic participants. The SWN scale contains five sub-scales consisting of four items each: mental functioning (MF), self-control (SC), emotional regulation (ER), and social integration (SI), physical functioning (PF). The total score ranges from a minimum of 20 (poor subjective experience) to a maximum of 120 (excellent subjective experience). SWN scores appear to correlate with measure of objective psychopathology, quality of life and other self-ratings of mood.</description>

    <measure>Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI-10) Total Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The DAI-10 is a 10-item questionnaire to assess 1) subjective experience of drug and 2) attitudes and beliefs toward neuroleptics which may influence compliance in schizophrenia participants. It is the binary scale assessing the participant's subjective response. A 'compliant' response is scored as +1; a dysphoric response is scored as -1. A positive sum of items indicates a positive subjective response (SR); a negative sum of scores indicates a negative SR (non-compliant). The final score is the grand total of the positive and negative points. Total score ranges from (-) 10 to (+) 10, higher score indicates positive SR (compliant) and lower score indicates negative SR (non-compliant).</description>

        <title>Subjective Well-being Under Neuroleptic (SWN-20) Scale Total Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The SWN-20 scale is a 20 item scale that was originally designed to explore the subjective experience of psychotic participants. The SWN scale contains five sub-scales consisting of four items each: mental functioning (MF), self-control (SC), emotional regulation (ER), and social integration (SI), physical functioning (PF). The total score ranges from a minimum of 20 (poor subjective experience) to a maximum of 120 (excellent subjective experience). SWN scores appear to correlate with measure of objective psychopathology, quality of life and other self-ratings of mood.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Self-Control Subscale Score Based on Subjective Well-being Under Neuroleptic (SWN-20) Scale at Week 24</title>
          <description>The SWN-20 scale is a 20 item scale that was originally designed to explore the subjective experience of psychotic participants. The SWN scale contains five sub-scales consisting of four items each: mental functioning (MF), self-control (SC), emotional regulation (ER), and social integration (SI), physical functioning (PF). The total score ranges from a minimum of 20 (poor subjective experience) to a maximum of 120 (excellent subjective experience). SWN scores appear to correlate with measure of objective psychopathology, quality of life and other self-ratings of mood. Self-Control subscale score ranges from 0 to 24 and higher score indicates improvement of disease. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 24. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

        <description>The DAI-10 is a 10-item questionnaire to assess 1) subjective experience of drug and 2) attitudes and beliefs toward neuroleptics which may influence compliance in schizophrenia participants. It is the binary scale assessing the participant's subjective response. A 'compliant' response is scored as +1; a dysphoric response is scored as -1. A positive sum of items indicates a positive subjective response (SR); a negative sum of scores indicates a negative SR (non-compliant). The final score is the grand total of the positive and negative points. Total score ranges from (-) 10 to (+) 10, higher score indicates positive SR (compliant) and lower score indicates negative SR (non-compliant).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI-10) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The DAI-10 is a 10-item questionnaire to assess 1) subjective experience of drug and 2) attitudes and beliefs toward neuroleptics which may influence compliance in schizophrenia participants. It is the binary scale assessing the participant's subjective response. A 'compliant' response is scored as +1; a dysphoric response is scored as -1. A positive sum of items indicates a positive subjective response (SR); a negative sum of scores indicates a negative SR (non-compliant). The final score is the grand total of the positive and negative points. Total score ranges from (-) 10 to (+) 10, higher score indicates positive SR (compliant) and lower score indicates negative SR (non-compliant). Change from Baseline was calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 24. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>

The score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate the degree of difficulty (1, absent to 6, very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Participants with a score of 71 to 100 have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Sleep Quality Based on Visual Analog Scale at Week 24</title>
        <description>Sleep quality was assessed by an 11-point visual analog scale that rates how well participants slept. Participants indicated on the scale (from 0 to 100 millimeter) how well they slept in the previous 7 days (from 0: &quot;very badly&quot; to 100: &quot;very well&quot;). Change from Baseline was calculated as value at Baseline minus value at Week 24. Data for three groups is presented here, based on participants' transition to Paliperidone ER from other oral antipsychotics.</description>
