    <textblock>
      Patients will receive a single intravenous (IV) infusion administered over 3 minutes of
      either ORG 28611 (SCH 900111), 0.12 mg/kg morphine sulphate, or placebo, within 6 hours after
      dental surgery, when they experience moderate to severe dental pain. Patient will then be
      evaluated with pain assessments at Baseline, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes; and 2
      through 8 hours or before rescue medication is needed.
