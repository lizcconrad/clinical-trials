      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Daytrana® in the
      treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults who have abused
      stimulants in the past. Daytrana® is a stimulant medication that has been approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ADHD in children over the age of 6 years
      old.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methylphenidate and amphetamines are considered to be the first line of treatment for ADHD in
      children (Biederman et al, 1997). Although treating children and adolescents with stimulants
      does not appear to increase the risk of substance use disorders (Wilens et al, 2003), little
      is known about the abuse of prescription stimulants in adults with ADHD. A review of the
      literature on the abuse potential of methylphenidate in animals and humans found that
      methylphenidate produced reinforcing, discriminative-stimulus, and subjective effects similar
      to amphetamines or cocaine (Kollins et al, 2001). Although the abuse rates of methylphenidate
      and other stimulant medications used for the treatment of ADHD have not been empirically
      established, significant concern exists so that regulatory mandates are enforced to control
      distribution, and some physicians may be reluctant to use stimulants in patients with drug
      abuse histories. The introduction of a methylphenidate patch is an important advancement, as
      the patch formulation should increase compliance while minimizing abuse potential, making it
      an attractive treatment option in the large population of individuals who have a history of
      previous drug misuse. The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of the
      methylphenidate patch in adult individuals with ADHD who have abused stimulants in the past.
      It is hypothesized that the methylphenidate patch will be efficacious in reducing ADHD
      symptoms in this population.

    <description>Subjects will be provided with a 7-day supply of medication at each study visit. The dose will be flexible and will be titrated based on effect and tolerability. Unless a subject is experiencing side effects, the dose will be increased if a 25% reduction in ADHD symptoms as determined by the WRAADDS is not obtained. A proposed dosing schedule is as follows: Week 1: 12.5 cm2, Week 2: 18.75 cm2, Week 3: 25 cm2, Week 4: 37.5 cm2. The dose may be decreased as needed for tolerability.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy men and women, 18 to 65 years of age

          2. Meet DSM-IV criteria for past stimulant (cocaine, methamphetamine, or prescription
             stimulant) abuse or dependence, with past abuse/dependence defined as a minimum of
             three months since meeting DSM-IV criteria, or have exhibited a pattern of stimulant
             misuse. For the purposes of this study, stimulant misuse will be defined as using
             someone else's stimulant ADHD medication for a minimum of four times in a one-month
             period, and this misuse must have occurred for at least three months.

          3. Meet DSM-IV criteria for current ADHD, determined by a clinical interview and
             confirmed by semi-structured interview with the Conners' Adult ADHD Diagnostic
             Interview for DSM-IV (CAAR-D; Conners et al, 1999)

          4. ADHD symptom severity indicated by a score of 12 or greater on the Wender-Reimherr
             Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Scale

          5. All subjects will agree to and sign a written, IRB-approved informed consent

          6. Subjects must live within a 60-mile radius of Charleston, SC, to facilitate study
             visit compliance

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Individuals meeting DSM-IV dependence for any substance with the exception of nicotine
             and caffeine

          2. Individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for a lifetime history of schizophrenia or another
             non-affective psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder, since these patients will most
             likely be taking other psychotropic medications and often require intensive
             psychiatric care

          3. Individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for current major depressive disorder or eating
             disorder, since these individuals will likely require treatment with psychotropic
             medications.

          4. Individuals who present significant suicidal risk

          5. Individuals with significant cognitive impairment as measured by a score of less than
             26 on the Mini-Mental Status Exam, as they may be unable to understand the informed
             consent, comply with study protocol, or accurately complete assessments

          6. Individuals currently receiving stimulants, benzodiazepines, antidepressant or
             antipsychotic medications.

          7. Individuals currently receiving psychotherapy focusing on reducing ADHD symptoms, as
             this could confound the effects of methylphenidate treatment

          8. Pregnant or nursing women, or women who refuse to use adequate birth control, as
             methylphenidate has not been approved for use in pregnancy

          9. Individuals without stable housing, as contacting these individuals would be difficult

         10. Individuals with major medical illnesses (e.g., HIV, renal failure, unstable angina,
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infectious hepatitis)

         11. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (defined as having blood pressure greater than
             140/90 measured on 3 or more occasions), as methylphenidate treatment can be
             associated with increases in blood pressure

         12. Individuals with a significant family history of cardiac abnormalities, as these
             individuals may be more susceptible to cardiac adverse events

         13. Individuals who are obese (greater than 30% over ideal weight or BMI greater than 30)
             as this may interfere with absorption of methylphenidate

         14. Individuals who, in the investigators' opinion, would not be able to comply with study
             procedures, such as individuals unable to reliably present for intake appointments
