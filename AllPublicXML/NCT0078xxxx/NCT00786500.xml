      The aim of the present study was to investigate the long-term effects on blood glucose
      concentrations and possible adverse effects of an extract of Gynostemma pentaphyllum (GP).
      This is a plant growing in the mountain regions of Northern Vietnam and previously being used
      in traditional medicine. The GP extract, or placebo, was randomized to newly diagnosed
      patients with type 2 diabetes and administered as a &quot;tea&quot;, 3 g two times daily during 12
      weeks. All patients received instructions regarding diet and physical exercise. Oral glucose
      tolerance tests were performed at baseline and then every 4 weeks, and blood tests were taken
      with the purpose to monitor lipids, kidney and liver function, body weight and blood
      pressure.

      In Vietnam, herbal extracts have been used as a long-standing tradition to treat diabetic
      patients, but effects of these extracts have not been studied adequately. Based on previous
      results in experimental animals, we have selected the plant Gynostemma pentaphyllum (GP),
      which grows in the mountain region of Northern Vietnam. GP extract had a hypoglycemic effect
      on mice and rats, and was shown to contain a substance, phanoside, which stimulates insulin
      secretion. In addition, GP has been shown to reduce both hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in
      diabetic Zucker fatty rats.

      The present study aimed at investigate effects of GP extract, administered as a &quot;tea&quot;, and
      compared with placebo in a randomized, double-blind trial in drug-naive patients with newly
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes. All patients also received instructions about diet and physical
      exercise. In addition to monitoring effects on plasma glucose regulation, we also studied
      possible effects on plasma lipids, kidney and liver function as well as body weight and blood
      pressure.
