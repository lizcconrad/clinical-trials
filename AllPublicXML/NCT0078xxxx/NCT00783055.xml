    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the status of perceived autonomy and to evaluate the
      effectiveness of individually tailored programmes on perceived autonomy in physically frail
      older people living in nursing homes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Experiencing autonomy is recognised to promote health and well-being for all age groups.
      Perceived lack of control has been found to be detrimental to physical and mental health.
      There is a lack of evidence-based knowledge elucidating how frail older people in nursing
      home settings perceive autonomy. Further, there are no studies on the extent to which this
      perception can be influenced positively by participating in an individually tailored
      programme based on individual wishes for daily activities.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of individually tailored
      programmes on perceived autonomy in physically frail older people in nursing homes.
