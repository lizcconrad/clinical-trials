  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that pregabalin will decrease post-operative pain scores and opioid use
      following abdominal hysterectomy compared to placebo. This study has been designed to
      determine if after an abdominal hysterectomy, the addition of pregabalin to their
      peri-operative analgesia regimen will demonstrate superior analgesia compared to placebo in
      terms of lower pain scores and reduced usage of opioids. The primary outcome will be
      post-operative pain, measured by total opioid consumption.

      Do women undergoing an abdominal hysterectomy with general anesthesia and receiving
      pregabalin prior to their surgery and 12 hours later have lower opioid consumption in the
      first 24 hours after their surgery than those women who received placebo?
