      The goal of our research is to check the levels of D-Serine, Glycine, and other Glutamatergic
      amino acids, in patients with First Psychotic Episode (FPE). These patients are in the early
      stage of the disease, treated with neuroleptics for short periods of time, and are usually
      hospitalized for the first time. The hypothesis of the research is that we will find low
      levels of Glycine and D-Serine in these patients. Following an Anti-psychotic treatment we
      will expect these levels to return to the norm, and that this correction will be accompanied
      by a reduction of positive and negative symptoms.

      In addition, we will check the D-Serine and Glycine levels in the plasma of first degree
      relatives of the patients and a group of healthy subjects. The results of this study might
      support the hypothesis that the Glutamatergic system in involved in the pathology of
      Schizophrenia from it's early stages.

      In addition, we will check the levels of Oxytocin and Estrogen in the plasma of patients in
      FPE. Our hypothesis is that we will find low levels of Estrogen and High levels of Oxytocin
      in this group of patients. The results of the study might support the hypothesis that
      Estrogen and Oxytocin are involved in the pathology of Schizophrenia from it's early stages.
