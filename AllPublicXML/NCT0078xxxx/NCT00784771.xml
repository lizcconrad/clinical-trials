      Chronic combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder can be difficult to treat. The
      investigators believe that hypnosis, with a stress on the sensation of scent which often
      plays a role in the traumatic memories, can offer help for victims of this disorder who
      continue to suffer after receiving other treatments.

      Our study examines the effect of hypnosis upon 36 individuals who suffer from posttraumatic
      stress disorder incurred in battles or training. The hypnotherapy stresses elements of odor,
      both in conditioning the subject to relate certain pleasant odors with security and calm, and
      in gradually reexposing the patient to the olfactory aspects of the traumatic memories. All
      subjects are taken form the Israel Defense Forces Mental Health Clinic, treated with 6
      one-and-a-half-hour hypnotherapy sessions, and evaluated at baseline, end of treatment, after
      6 months, and after 12 months, on a battery of clinical scales.
