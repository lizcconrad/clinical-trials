  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research protocol to study the efficacy of combined varenicline (Chantix)
      and motivational interviewing (MI) for smoking cessation in a sample of smokers who have been
      diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The study is a double-blind,
      randomized, controlled, subacute treatment trial of MI plus varenicline (VAR-MI) versus MI
      plus placebo (PLA-MI). The pharmaceutical treatment will utilize Chantix at a dose of 1
      mg/day for a period of two weeks.

      The primary goal is to determine if VAR-MI decreases baseline behavioral measures of urge and
      withdrawal and reduces baseline rates of cigarette consumption. The primary efficacy measures
      of VAR-MI vs. PLA-MI treatment are: Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale, Questionnaire for
      Smoking Urge-brief, number of cigarettes smoked per day in the previous week, CO levels, and
      Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Positive And Negative Symptom Scale scores on the last day
      of the study. Other primary outcome measures are to determine the effects of VAR-MI and
      PLA-MI on smoking cue-induced urges in tobacco cue reactivity sessions and reward
      responsiveness as assessed by a computerized task.

             established by standardized interview and medical review by psychiatrist.

             suicidality, current mania, or an organic mental disorder such as dementia or delirium

          -  Presence of unstable psychiatric symptoms or clinical deterioration (i.e., unstable

          -  There currently are no known contraindications to the use of varenicline and no
