      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and tolerability of an experimental
      drug, Chemophase, a combination of recombinant human hyaluronidase, (an investigational
      synthetic enzyme also known as rHuPH20), and mitomycin (MMC) in the treatment of superficial
      bladder cancer when instilled intravesically immediately after TURBT (transurethral resection
      of bladder tumor).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be screened and enrolled prior to undergoing standard of care TURBT for known
      or suspected Stage Ta, T1 or Tis bladder cancer of any histological grade requiring TURBT and
      who are believed to be candidates for IPOP intravesical chemotherapy regardless of the need
      for further intravesical therapy. Within 6 hours after completion of TURBT, patients will be
      administered a single IPOP intravesical instillation of Chemophase with a one-hour dwell
      time. At the end of the one-hour dwell time, the patient will be asked to fully void or, if
      an intravesical catheter has been left in place, the bladder will be fully drained via the
      catheter. Patients will return at 1 and 2 weeks post instillation for follow up visits for
      safety and for a cystoscopy at day 85 (per standard of care). Safety and tolerability will be
      assessed through physical examinations, vital signs, cystoscopy, hematology (CBC), adverse
      event reporting, and measurements of plasma levels of MMC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with histologically confirmed or suspected (based on cystoscopy) initial
             presentation or recurrence of Stage Ta, T1, or Tis transitional cell bladder cancer of
             any histological grade requiring TURBT.

          -  Patient believed to be a candidate for immediate post-operative chemotherapy
             regardless of the need for additional intravesical therapy.

          -  ECOG performance status of Grade 0 or 1.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  A negative urine or serum pregnancy test (if female of child-bearing potential) within
             14 days prior to Day 1/Week 1.

          -  Acceptable liver function within 14 days prior to Day 1/Week 1 defined as:

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), and

          -  AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times ULN.

          -  Acceptable renal function within 14 days prior to Day 1/Week 1 defined as serum
             creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/dL,

          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/dL, and
