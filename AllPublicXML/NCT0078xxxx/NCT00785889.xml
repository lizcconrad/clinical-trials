  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compared with the conventional (air) method, patients examined by the study (water) method
      have lower pain scores and require less medication but have similar cecal intubation rate and
      willingness to repeat future colonoscopy.

  <detailed_description>

      Background: A novel water method permitted 52% of patients accepting on-demand sedation to
      complete colonoscopy without medications and significantly increased successful cecal
      intubation from 76% to 97% in patients accepting scheduled unsedated colonoscopy.

      Aim: To perform a randomized controlled trial comparing air insufflation (conventional
      method) vs. water infusion in lieu of air (study method) colonoscopy in minimally sedated
      patients.

      Hypothesis: Compared with the conventional method, patients examined by the study method have
      lower pain scores and require less medication but have similar cecal intubation rate and
      willingness to repeat future colonoscopy.

      Setting: Outpatient colonoscopy in a single VA hospital Methods: After informed consent and
      standard bowel preparation, patients received pre-medications administered as 0.5 increment
      of Fentanyl (25 Î¼g) and 0.5 increment of Versed (1 mg) plus 50 mg Diphenhydramine. The
      conventional and the study method for colonoscopy were implemented as previously described.
      Additional pain medications were administered at the patients' request.

      Outcome measures: Increments of medications, pain scores, cecal intubation and willingness to
      repeat colonoscopy.

      Limitations: Single VA site, older male population
