      The purpose of this study is to analyze and compare radiological lung expansion after talc
      pleurodesis performed either by videothoracoscopy or chest tube and correlate it with
      clinical outcome. Secondary endpoints evaluated were: clinical efficacy, safety, quality of
      life and survival.

      Talc pleurodesis is the most popular method to control symptoms of recurrent malignant
      pleural effusion. The intrapleural talc delivery may be by videothoracoscopy and talc
      poudrage or talc slurry thought a chest tube and the best method is still controversial.
      Although the lung expansion is a key criteria for success of the procedure, its
      characteristics are poorly studied.

      Patients were enrolled into two groups: videothoracoscopic talc poudrage (VT) and talc slurry
      through a chest tube (DT). Lung expansion was evaluated through chest CT scans obtained
      obtained in the first 7 days and 1, 3 and 6 months after pleurodesis. All examinations were
      revised by two independent observers. Clinical efficacy (considered as lack of new procedures
      during follow up), complications, drainage duration, hospital stay and quality of life
      (general and specific questionnaires) were also analyzed.
