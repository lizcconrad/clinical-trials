  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics are dietary supplements containing potentially beneficial bacterial strains such
      as Lactobacillus. The safety of oral administration of probiotics has been demonstrated in
      hundreds of studies using adults over the last 30 years. Very few studies have been conducted
      with children. UTI in girls occur when virulent bacteria migrate from the rectum and colonize
      the vagina and peri-urethral mucosa, thus gaining access to the bladder.

      This study will randomize girls to ARM A (probiotics + placebo) and ARM B (antibiotics +
      placebo) to determine if UTIs are decreased when the probiotics are given.
