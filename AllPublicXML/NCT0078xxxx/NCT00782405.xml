      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of (a) quetiapine XR and (b) mirtazapine
      on sleep when given as an antidepressant (monotherapy). We hypothesize that (a) quetiapine XR
      has an immediate and lasting positive effect on sleep in depressed patients which does not
      differ from the impact of mirtazapine on sleep in this group of patients; (b) in the context
      of a secondary objective, we expect an antidepressant effect of quetiapine XR which is
      equivalent to that of mirtazapine.
