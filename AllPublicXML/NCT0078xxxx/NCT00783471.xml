      To determine the more effective dosing sequence of intermittent erlotinib and docetaxel for
      treating patients with the diagnosis of advanced Non-Small-Lung-Cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of chemotherapy [such as docetaxel] with continuous administration of
      targeted drugs which block the molecular machinery of cancer cell growth [such as erlotinib]
      have failed to improve their efficacy over only-chemotherapy in patients with metastatic lung
      cancer of the non-small cell histology type. It is not yet known whether administering
      targeted drugs intermittently could result in improved efficacy of the combinations. This is
      a multicenter randomized Phase II trial aiming to determine the more active dosing sequence
      between intermittent erlotinib and docetaxel for treating patients with advanced
      Non-Small-Lung-Cancer.Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: they
      will receive a 12-days course of erlotinib either before docetaxel [arm A] or after docetaxel
      administration [arm B].Treatment will be repeated every 21 days.Patients will be evaluated
      every 2 cycles (~6 weeks) for response using RECIST criteria. Those patients achieving stable
      disease or better will continue therapy up to a total 8 cycles. Those patients experiencing
      progressive disease will be taken off study. Biopsy material will be assessed for biomarkers.

             metastatic NSCLC will be enrolled.

          2. Patients must have not been previously treated with anticancer drugs for advanced
             disease.

          3. ECOG performance status of 0 - 1.

             Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, have fully recovered from limited
