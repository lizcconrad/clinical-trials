      Our aim in this study is to investigate the efficiency of the breathing with different
      breathing patterns. Ten volunteers and twenty patients having respiratory problems will be
      coached on their breathing through specific masks which will provide four different breathing
      patterns. These patterns will be 1) Breathing in through the nose only and out through the
      mouth only 2) Breathing in through the mouth only and out through the nose only 3) Breathing
      in and out through the nose only 4) Breathing in and out through the mouth only The data
      obtained from volunteers and patients will be compared within and between the groups.

Breathing in through the nose only and out through the mouth only

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For healthy subjects:

             1. Ten healthy adult (&gt; 18 years of age) volunteers will be recruited from the MGH
             main campus through intra-hospital e-mail broadcasting. Subjects with the following
             issues will be excluded from the study.

          -  For patients with respiratory insufficiency:

               1. Twenty adult (&gt; 18 years of age) patients will be recruited. These patients will
                  be either patients in acute respiratory failure resulting from COPD exacerbation
                  breathing spontaneously only receiving nasal oxygen admitted to the medical
                  floors of the MGH; or patients with diagnosed stable COPD on home oxygen therapy
                  seen by pulmonary physicians in the outpatient clinics or coming to the MGH as
                  study subjects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For healthy volunteers:

               1. Subjects with facial deformity, heavy beard or moustache which prevents good seal
                  between the mask and the face;

               2. Subjects who have claustrophobia and cannot wear the mask.

          -  For patients with respiratory insufficiency:

               1. Patients with facial deformity, heavy beard or moustache which prevents a good
                  seal between the mask and the face;

               2. Patients who have claustrophobia and cannot wear the mask.

               3. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable.

               4. Patients requiring continuous noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or
                  endotracheal intubation.
