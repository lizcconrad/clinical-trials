  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a five-year prospective randomized trial comparing two intervention conditions
      designed to facilitate substance abuse treatment entry and enhance retention in order to
      reduce the behaviors associated with HIV and HCV risk among injection drug users (IDUs) and
      to improve client overall functioning. The overall goal of this project is to compare
      strengths-based case-management (CM) to an enhanced version of CM that uses case managers to
      facilitate a therapeutic alliance (CM/FTA) among out-of-treatment IDUs in Denver.
