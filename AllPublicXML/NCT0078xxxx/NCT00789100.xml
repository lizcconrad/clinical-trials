  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nottingham Primary Care Trust has launched telemonitoring to support: independent living and
      self-management ability of people with congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) and co-morbidities; and reduce the health care utilisation
      associated with these patients, including the number of hospitalisations, GP visits and
      community matron and specialist community nurse home visits.

      The Multidisciplinary Assessment of Technology Centre for Healthcare (MATCH) will evaluate
      the technology and its impact of this telemonitoring system on quality of care (i.e. process
      measures), patient outcomes and direct healthcare costs from an NHS perspective.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the impact of home-based monitoring to support community
      based nursing services and care matrons in the management of patients with CHF and COPD and
      co-morbidities. The main issue is to design a study that will determine the impact of the use
      of the technology independent of other factors. A randomised controlled trial has been chosen
      in which equal numbers of participants with and without home-based monitoring will be
      followed over the study to determine differences in utilisation of healthcare services
      including number of hospitalisations, length of stay in hospital, GP visits and community
      matron and specialist community nurse home visits.

      The ethical issue is how to determine those that will receive home-based monitoring and those
      that will be denied. The study requires that participants are matched for severity of their
      condition in each arm and this could deny some from the potential benefits of monitoring.
      However, as only a limited number of home-based monitors are available and all participants
      will continue to receive normal health care services, we believe that those denied monitoring
      will not receive care that is different to patients not in the study and the ethical issues
      are acceptable.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants selected will be those: diagnosed with CHF, COPD or co-morbidities and
             referred to the community management service by its selection procedure for severity
             of the condition; are considered eligible for home-based telemonitoring; consent to
             receiving telemonitoring; have an active phone connection; are able to read and speak
             English (language of the equipment); are capable and willing to use the home
             monitoring device.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients are considered ineligible: if they have psychological or psychiatric
             disorders; if they have a cognitive deficiency that makes them unable to participate
             in their self-treatment; if they have a visual or motor deficiency that renders them
             incapable of using the telemonitoring device (unless a spouse or an informal caregiver
             is able to help); if they are currently scheduled for a hospital admission; if their
             life expectancy is shorter than 2 years; or if they already participate in another
             study.
