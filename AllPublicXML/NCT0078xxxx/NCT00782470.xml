  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Understanding how often the bleeding events occur in the subjects who voluntarily decide to
      switch from prophylaxis to on-demand and in those subjects who remain on prophylaxis. Also
      look into the consequences of switching treatment in QoL (quality of life), development of
      target joints, activity level and reasons that might influence the desire to switch.
