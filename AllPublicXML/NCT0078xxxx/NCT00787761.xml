      RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop
      the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the
      donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help
      destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted
      cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving
      antithymocyte globulin before the transplant and tacrolimus and methotrexate after the
      transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving antithymocyte globulin together with
      cyclophosphamide, busulfan, and fludarabine works in treating patients with hematological
      cancer or kidney cancer undergoing donor stem cell transplant.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the percentage of patients with hematological malignancies or renal cell
           carcinoma who achieve &gt; 90% donor T-cell chimerism at 30 days after treatment with
           reduced-intensity conditioning comprising low-dose anti-thymocyte globulin, low-dose
           cyclophosphamide, busulfan, and fludarabine phosphate followed by allogeneic peripheral
           blood progenitor cell transplantation from a matched related donor.

        -  To assess the incidence of severe (grade 3 or 4) acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
           and extensive chronic GVHD in these patients.

        -  To assess whether this regimen is associated with reduced transplant-related toxicity
           and increased tolerability in these patients.

        -  To assess the overall safety of this conditioning regimen as measured by 6-month
           transplant-related mortality in these patients.

        -  To determine the efficacy of this regimen in inducing durable remissions in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC): Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over
           4-6 hours on day -16 and over 6-8 hours on day -15, fludarabine phosphate IV over 30
           minutes on days -7 to -3, busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -4 and -3, and
           cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on day -2.

        -  Transplantation: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell
           transplantation on day 0.

        -  Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive oral tacrolimus every 12
           hours on days -1 to 90, followed by a taper until day 150. Patients also receive
           methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, and 6.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic studies of anti-thymocyte
      globulin and PCR analysis for chimerism.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.

    <description>As demonstrated by groups in Houston, Jerusalem &amp; Seattle, RICT has been used to treat hematologic &amp; solid malignancies with related &amp; unrelated donors. Although adequate comparisons of RICT versus ablative alloHCT remain to be reported, the studies of RICT so far suggest that TRM is generally less than would be expected for similar patients undergoing ablative alloHCT; incidence of acute &amp; chronic GVHD is similar or less than ablative alloHCT; autologous hematopoietic recovery is more common than seen following ablative alloHCT if graft failure occurs; powerful GVT effects can be seen but are dependent on high levels of donor T-cell chimerism and RICT are less effective than ablative alloHCT in controlling aggressive malignancies</description>

      <recruitment_details>24 patients were enrolled between 4/20/2007 and 5/3/2010. Patients who were undergoing transplant at Northside Hospital were potentially eligible.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>29 patients signed consent for this study. 2 patients were initially screen failures but eventually were determined eligible &amp; were treated on study. 1 patient was considered a screen failure due to having an ineligible donor. One patient had progressive disease and one patient had compliance-related issues prohibiting them from particiapting.</pre_assignment_details>
