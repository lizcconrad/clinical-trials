    <textblock>
      This was a one-day single dose trial conducted to compare patient's preference for Nasonex®
      (mometasone) versus Flonase® nasal spray. Each patient was randomized to take one dose (2
      sprays in each nostril) of Nasonex or Flonase. Thirty minutes later, each patient was to take
      one dose of the opposite medication. Questionnaires were given to each patient after each
      drug dose to evaluate patient product preference.
