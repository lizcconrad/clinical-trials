      The purpose of this study is to learn about the natural history of Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
      infection in men. The study will also find out what factors are linked to HPV in men
      including other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). If participants test positive for
      syphilis, gonorrhea or chlamydia, we are required by law to report the results to the Florida
      Department of Health. Participants will be able to get free medical treatment from the
      Florida Department of Health for these STDs. Participants will be given a written report of
      the results of the STD testing.

      The study protocol will include a pre-enrollment run-in visit, a baseline visit (enrollment),
      and 8 additional visits after enrollment scheduled 6 months apart. Intervals of every 6
      months were chosen to insure that both acquisition and loss of infections may be assessed, as
      studies in women indicate that median duration of oncogenic infections ranges between 7-9
      months. Informed consent will occur during the run-in visit. The run-in and follow-up visits
      will include questionnaire administration, visual inspection of the skin and external
      genitalia, and the collection of urine, blood, oral cells, and penile skin samples If
      anogenital lesions are present at any of the clinic visits, they will be sampled as well.

    <description>The first specific aim is to establish the cohort of 3000 men ages 18 - 44 years who will be examined every 6 months for 4 years. To assess potential biases introduced by the run-in visit, Pearson's χ² test of association will be used to compare cohort participants and non-participants who attended the run-in visit with respect to known and potential HPV risk factors and HPV status. All analyses will be conducted using Intercooled STATA (StataCorp. 2001. Stata Statistical Software: Release 8.2 SE College Station, Texas: Stata Corporation).</description>

    <measure>Incidence Rates of Specific HPV Type Infection</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years per participant</time_frame>
    <description>The second specific aim is to determine the incidence and persistence of type-specific HPV infections. Estimates of the incidence rates of specific HPV type infection will be calculated on the basis of the number of cases in which a given type is detected for the first time in men who tested negative for that HPV type at baseline.</description>

      This study will create a specimen repository with which to test future novel hypotheses
      related to HPV infection among men. To assess other genetic, infectious, or environmental
      factors that may influence acquisition and persistence of HPV infections in men, whole blood,
      serum, exfoliated penile cell samples, and oral cells will be stored in aliquots for future
      analyses as funding becomes available. Using banked specimens preserved for DNA, RNA, and
      protein analyses, we will be able to assess novel biomarkers such as methylation status of
      oncogenic HPV, polymorphisms in genes involved in innate immunity (e.g., TLR genes), and mRNA
      of the E6 and E7 HPV oncoproteins in the future.
