      The submitted trial is the first prospective, randomized trial comparing nasal intermittent
      positive pressure ventilation(NIPPV) vs nCPAP in newborn infants with respiratory distress
      syndrome.

    <textblock>
      Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is similar to nCPAP, but also gives
      some breaths, or extra support, to newborn infants through a small tube in the nose. NIPPV is
      safe and effective, and already in use as an alternate &quot;standard&quot; therapy. Nevertheless,
      NIPPV has never been used in chinese babies.

      The submitted trial is the first prospective, randomized trial Comparing NIPPV vs nCPAP in
      newborn infants with respiratory distress syndrome.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Newborn infants with birth weight &gt;500 gm.

          2. Gestational age &gt;24 completed weeks.

          3. Intention to manage the infant with non-invasive respiratory support (i.e. no
             endotracheal tube), where either: 1) the infant is within the first 7 days of life and
             has never been intubated or has received less than 24 hours of total cumulative
             intubated respiratory support; 2)the infant is within the first 28 days of life, has
             been managed with intubated respiratory support for 24 hours or more and is a
             candidate for extubation followed by non-invasive respiratory support.

          4. No known lethal congenital anomaly or genetic syndromes.

          5. Signed parental informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Considered non-viable by clinician (decision not to administer effective therapies)

          2. Life-threatening congenital abnormalities including congenital heart disease
             (excluding patent ductus arteriosis)

          3. Infants known to require surgical treatment

          4. Abnormalities of the upper and lower airways

          5. Neuromuscular disorders

          6. Infants who are &gt;28 days old and continue to require mechanical ventilation with an
             endotracheal tube
