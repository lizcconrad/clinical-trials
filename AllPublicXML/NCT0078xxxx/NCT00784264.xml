    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to measure the thickness of artery walls in the neck (intima
      media thickness IMT) by ultrasound examination in middle-aged subjects with central obesity.
      The purpose of this study is to obtain local data how common asymptomatic atherosclerosis is,
      and to investigate the association between Cardiovascular Disease risk factors and intima
      media thickness (IMT) in the Hong Kong population. Results from this study may enhance the
      public awareness of asymptomatic atherosclerosis and understand its role in the development
      of Cardiovascular Disease in Hong Kong.
