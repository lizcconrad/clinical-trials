  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glutamine levels decrease during severe sepsis; this may be associated with increased
      mortality. The investigators tested the effects of glutamine supplementation on systemic
      inflammation in a human sepsis model.

      The investigators found that glutamine levels drops significantly during experimentally
      induced systemic inflammation. However, glutamine did not affect the degree of inflammation.

      Glutamine levels have been shown to decrease substantially with severe sepsis and this has
      been connected with increased mortality. Therefore, in the present study, we infused either
      saline or Alanine-glutamine during an endotoxin challenge and measured parameters related to
      an immune response, i.e. plasma cytokines and Heat Shock Protein (HSP)-70.

      Materials and Methods This was a double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled crossover trial
      in eight healthy young men. The study was performed in random order on two separate days,
      with a four-week washout period between days. Subjects received an infusion of
      Alanine-glutamine ( Dipeptiven) at a rate of 0.025 g / (kg BW * h) for 10 hrs or saline.
      After two hours of infusion subjects received an intravenous bolus of E. coli endotoxin (0.3
      ng/kg). Blood samples were collected hourly for the following eight hours. HSP-70 protein
      content in isolated Blood Mononuclear Cells (BMNCs) was measured by western blotting.

      Results and Discussion Plasma glutamine was significantly increased during infusion with
      alanine-glutamine infusion. En-dotoxin caused a reduction in plasma-glutamine during saline
      infusion as well as during Alanine-glutamine infusion. A significant effect of endotoxin was
      found on leukocyte subpopulations, tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, the expression of
      HSP-70 in BMNCs, temperature, and heart rate. However, no differences were detected between
      treatments with regard to the effect of endotoxin on any of these parameters.

      Conclusion Endotoxemia reduces plasma glutamine independently of parenteral infusion of
      alanine-glutamine. Glutamine does not alter the response of leukocytes, leukocyte
      subpopulations, IL-6, or TNF-Î±, or the expression of HSP-70 in BMNCs to endotoxemia.
