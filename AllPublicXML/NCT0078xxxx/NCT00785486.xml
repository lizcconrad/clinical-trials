  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label non-randomized single sequence, single group two way drug interaction
      study in healthy adult volunteers to determine the extent to which quinine, an inducer of
      cytochrome p450 CYP 3A4, affects the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, an accepted probe drug
      for CYP 3A4. The study will also determine the extent to which midazolam affects the
      pharmacokinetics of quinine.

      This is an open label single sequence single group non-randomized two way drug interaction
      study in healthy adult volunteers to determine the extent to which quinine, an inducer of
      cytochrome p450 CYP 3A4, affects the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, an accepted probe drug
      for CYP 3A4. The study will also determine the extent to which midazolam affects the
      pharmacokinetics of quinine. This will compare the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and quinine
      at baseline to their kinetics when they are taken together in 24 normal healthy adult
      volunteers who will serve as their own controls. All patients will be confined to the study
      site throughout the entire 11 day study period. On day 1 after a fast of at least 10 hours,
      all study participants will receive a single oral dose of midazolam 2 mg. Blood will be drawn
      at times sufficient to adequately define the baseline concentration time curve for midazolam
      and its metabolite, 1-hydroxy-midazolam. On the morning of day 4, after a 3 day washout
      period and following a fast of at least 10 hours, all volunteers will begin a regimen of 324
      mg of quinine sulfate by mouth every 8 hours. All subjects will continue this regimen from
      day 4-10 (21 total doses). Blood will be drawn after the first daily dose of quinine on days
      4 and 9 at times sufficient to adequately define the baseline and steady state concentration
      time curves for quinine. Additional blood will be drawn prior to the first daily dose of
      quinine on days 7,8,9,and 10. On day 10 after a fast of at least a 10 hours, all participants
      will receive both midazolam 2 mg and quinine 324 mg together. Blood will be drawn a times
      sufficient to characterize the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, 1-hydroxy-midazolam and quinine
      under the stated conditions.

            <description>On day 10 after six days of receiving Qualaquin 324 mg every 8 hours, and after a fast of at least 10 hours, patients received a 2 mg dose of midazolam and 324 mg of Qualaquin (quinine)(Steady state). Blood was drawn sufficient to determine the pharmacokinetics of Qualaquin(quinine) in the presence of midazolam over the final dosing interval (0 – 8 hours), as calculated by the linear trapezoidal method.</description>
