    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) following
      administration of gabapentin in Japanese epileptic patients with renal impairment to confirm
      if there are any clinically relevant differences between the plasma gabapentin concentration
      simulated by population PK model, which was used for the evidence of the dose adjustment for
      the patients with renal impairment, and observed plasma gabapentin concentration.

      Only one subject was able to be enrolled. Given enrollment challenges to identify additional
      appropriate subjects, discussion was held with the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices
      Agency (PMDA) and it was agreed with the PMDA to terminate this study. The study was
      terminated on December 14, 2010. The study was not terminated due to any safety findings.

            <description>The dosage regimens were adjusted depending on the creatinine clearance. Duration of observation was 15 days from screening if the subject had already been treated with gabapentin and 28 days from screening if the subject was treated with gabapentin for the first time.
The subject enrolled was on hemodialysis, receiving a maintenance dose of 300 mg twice daily for 15 days.</description>
