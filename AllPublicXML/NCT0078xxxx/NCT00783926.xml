    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to assess the dose-related safety and immunogenicity of six
      different dose levels of inactivated, Vero cell-derived reverse genetic reassortant
      A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/2005 influenza vaccine in a healthy young adult population. Subjects will
      receive 2 vaccinations (21 days apart) at the dose to which they were assigned. Blood will be
      drawn from all subjects for serum antibody determination on Days 0, 21, 42 and 180. Body
      temperature will be measured daily for 6 days following vaccination. Injection site reactions
      and systemic reactions will be monitored throughout the entire 180 days of the study. Safety
      data obtained at 7 days after the first vaccination for all dose levels in Cohort 1 will be
      reviewed by a Data Monitoring Committee and a recommendation will be obtained whether to
      proceed to the second vaccination of Cohort 1 and to the first vaccination of Cohort 2.

             consent prior to study entry

          -  Are clinically healthy, as determined by the Investigator's clinical judgment through
             collection of medical history and performance of a physical examination

          -  Are physically and mentally capable of participating in the study

          -  Are willing to refrain from blood donation for the duration of Part A of the study
             (until Day 42 [= 21 days after the second vaccination])

          -  Agree to keep a daily record of symptoms for the duration of the study

          -  If female and capable of bearing children - have a negative urine pregnancy test
             result within 24 hours of the scheduled first vaccination and agree to employ adequate
             birth control measures for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from participation in this study if they:

          -  Have a history of exposure to H5N1 influenza virus or a history of vaccination with an
             H5N1 influenza vaccine
