    <textblock>
      Silver nitrate treatment of Bartholin's cyst or abscess will be compared to marsupialization
      treatment.

      It is expected that silver nitrate treatment is effective, simple, inexpensive and the least
      anaesthetic requiring procedure, which can easily be carried out in the outpatient setting.

      Background and objective:

      Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses are common problems in women of reproductive age. The
      traditional treatment of Bartholin´s cyst or abscess is marsupialization, which has
      disadvantages, such as pain of long duration, scarring, risk of general anaesthesia and risk
      of recurrence. In the present study we use silver nitrate in the treatment of Bartholin's
      cyst or abscess and compare to marsupialization. We expect lower healing time, lower
      recurrence rate and less pain with the silver nitrate treatment.

      Methods and materials:

      30 patients with Bartholin´s cyst or abscess will be investigated. It is prospective
      randomized study. The silver nitrate treatment is performed under local anaesthesia on an
      outpatient basis. A simple vertical incision 1 cm in length is made in the vaginal mucosa and
      the underlying cyst or abscess wall. A crystalloid silver nitrate stick of 5 mm in diameter
      and 5 mm in length is inserted into the cyst or abscess cavity.

      The standard marsupialization treatment is performed under general anaesthesia.
