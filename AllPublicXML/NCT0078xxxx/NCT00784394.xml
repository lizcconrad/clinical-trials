      This phase I clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of diindolylmethane in
      preventing cancer in healthy volunteers. Diindolylmethane is formed in the stomachs of people
      who eat a chemical that is normally found in vegetables, including cabbage, broccoli,
      Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and watercress. Diindolylmethane may prevent the development
      of cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine single oral doses of 3,3' di-indolylmethane (DIM) (diindolylmethane) that are
      safe and well- tolerated.

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of these single oral doses of DIM.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive a single dose of diindolylmethane orally (PO) on day 1.

      ARM II: Participants receive a single dose of placebo orally (PO) on day 1.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up on days 2, 3, and 6.

    <time_frame>Up to day 6</time_frame>
    <description>Frequencies and percents will be used to summarize the toxicities seen at each dose level and overall. Descriptive statistics will be calculated on all variables of interest: frequencies and percentages will be used to summarize categorical variables and medians, and ranges will summarize quantitative variables.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after administration</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacokinetic parameters such as half-life, maximum concentration (Cmax), time of Cmax (Tmax), and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) will be calculated for all subjects who complete the study. It is anticipated that a one-compartment elimination model will fit the data. These parameters will be summarized at each dose and overall with median and ranges.</description>
