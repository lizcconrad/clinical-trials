      Objectives:

        1. To explore current lifestyle practices, health status, and quality of life among
           childhood cancer survivors and parent/guardians who are identified as &quot;primary
           caregivers.&quot;

        2. To explore childhood cancer survivors' and &quot;primary caregivers'&quot; awareness of future
           health risks.

        3. To explore interest in various lifestyle interventions and delivery channels among
           childhood cancer survivors and their &quot;primary caregivers.&quot;

        4. To explore factors which may serve as mediators or moderators of future lifestyle
           interventions that target childhood cancer survivors and their &quot;primary caregivers,&quot;
           e.g., strength of the caregiver-child bond, geographic distance from one another, and
           level of education.

      A mailed survey will be conducted that will assess the health behaviors (diet, exercise, and
      tobacco-use) of childhood cancer survivors, and the behaviors of identified &quot;primary
      caregivers&quot; (see definition under inclusion criteria). In addition, these surveys will assess
      awareness of longterm health risks, quality of life (QOL), strength of the child-caregiver
      bond, body image, body weight status, functional status, barriers to lifestyle change, and
      interest in various lifestyle interventions and potential channels for delivery. Mailed
      surveys (with telephone follow-up) will be sent to MDACC childhood cancer survivors diagnosed
      from 1998 - 2007 who are survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, sarcomas, lymphoma
      or leukemia.
