      The purpose of this study is evaluate clinical outcomes and 30-day mortality after on-pump
      CABG.

      Eight hundred and seventeen patients was enrolled in this series and divided into to groups:
      Group AKI (-) - patients without acute kidney injury after on-pump CABG. Group AKI (+) -
      patients with acute kidney injury after on-pump CABG. AKI was defined as an absolute increase
      in serum creatinine (SCr) of more than or equal to 0.3 mg/dl (≥ 26.4 μmol/l) or a percentage
      increase in SCr of more than or equal to 50% (1.5-fold from baseline). The change in SCr
      concentration was defined as the difference between immediate postoperative concentration and
      the highest concentration during the stay in ICU. Clinical Outcomes and 30-day mortality was
      evaluate in this patients.
