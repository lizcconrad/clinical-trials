  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a autologous stem cell transplantation followed
      by a Melphalan/ Fludarabine based dose-reduced allograft from HLA-identical and
      HLA-compatible unrelated donor in patients with Multiple Myeloma. In those with non complete
      remission DLI and/ or new agents such as Bortezomib, Thalidomid or Lenalidomide can be used
      to upgrade remission.
