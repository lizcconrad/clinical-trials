      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has become now a widely used treatment modality in ICU and
      emergency services to deal with respiratory failure.1 NIV has the potential to improve
      ventilatory assistance while avoiding endotracheal intubation and its complications.

      Since the first publications of Meduri2 and Brochard3 the number of studies on the NIV has
      been growing and developing and this technique becomes one of the major progress in the field
      of respiratory assistance. Decompensation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is
      certainly the least questionable indication of the NIV. However, indication of the NIV is
      inexorably spreading to other types of acute respiratory insufficiency, including acute
      cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE).4 Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most
      currently used non-invasive ventilation usually performed without the use of a ventilator.
      NIV using pressure support (NIPSV) combined pressure support (inspiratory aid) and positive
      expiratory pressure as in CPAP. Based on physiological ground, NIPSV would be more performant
      than CPAP to improve ventilatory parameters and reduce the work breathing in APE. However,
      this issue is not settled yet. Number of meta-analysis over the last 2 years were devoted to
      the comparison of CPAP and NISPV,5 so that the scientific evidence is still far from
      established. In addition, it is not sur that patients enrolled in these studies are
      representative of all patients with APE. The fact that they were included solely on the basis
      of clinical criteria, the risk of overlap with other diagnoses is not negligible. Thus the
      use of markers of heart failure as the BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) would be very useful.
      On the other hand, the possible deleterious effect of NIPSV on myocardial perfusion is a
      problem that has not been definitively resolved.

      Objectives of the study:

        1. Compare the efficacy and safety of the NIPSV with those of CPAP in patients presenting
           to the emergency department with CPE.

        2. Compare the two procedures in subgroups of patients with hypercapnia and high BNP
           concentration.

      Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is defined as an increase of hydrostatic pressure in the
      pulmonary microcirculation resulting from postcapillaire hypertension.

      The direct consequence is extravasation of fluid in the alveolar and interstitial tissue,
      leading to acute hypoxemia and a decrease in lung compliance. The decrease in lung
      compliance, increased airway resistance (interstitial and bronchial edema) and hypoxemia will
      cause an increase in work of breathing. The imbalance between the ability of respiratory
      muscles to generate effective gas exchange and exaggerated ventilatory load can lead to
      respiratory muscle fatigue requiring use of mechanical ventilation through endotracheal
      prosthesis. In addition, the increase in inspiratory muscles work during the CPE generates
      very important pleural depression, which increases transmural pressure and left ventricular
      afterload and thus increases pulmonary edema.

      The CPAP is a non-invasive ventilation mode most currently used CPE. It is usually obtained
      via a mask and an expiratory valve to maintain constant pressure in the circuit. No
      inspiratory assistance is provided to the patient. The BOUSSIGNAC valve is currently used in
      clinical practice as an adjunct to the pharmacological treatment of CPE.The effect of CPAP is
      mainly linked to its ability to recruit zones that are collapsed during expiration. • NIPSV
      combines a positive expiratory pressure to ventilatory assistance pressure during inspiration
      delivered by a ventilator. It corresponds to a CPAP associated with inspiratory assistance,
      and thus, it is likely to improve the ventilation parameters, and in particular to reduce
      respiratory work more efficiently than CPAP alone.These beneficial physiological effects of
      NIPSV were well demonstrated during the decompensation of COPD ; they wait to be confirmed
      during CPE. Physiological studies have shown that the NIPSV is more effective in terms of
      reducing the work of breathing in CPE. However, none of the 7 published randomized studies
      has shown superiority of the NIPSV compared to CPAP in terms of reducing mortality and
      intubation requirement
