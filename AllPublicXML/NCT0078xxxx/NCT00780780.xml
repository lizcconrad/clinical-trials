  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetics retinopathy remains the major threat to sight in the working age population in the
      developed world. Furthermore, it is increasing as a major cause of blindness in other parts
      of the world, especially developing countries. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a
      manifestation of diabetic retinopathy that produces loss of central vision.

      The triamcinolone intravitreal injection (1-4mg) is indicated to treatment of diabetic
      macular edema and it is considered an important treatment since it improves the visual acuity
      of patients with resolution of edema.

      Nepafenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), usually sold as a prescription
      eye drop (0.1% solution). Nepafenac is manufactured by Alcon as Nevanac. It is approved by
      FDA as well as ANVISA. Pre-clinical studies suggest this medication showed efficacy to treat
      ocular posterior segment inflammation.

      The purpose of this study is evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal triamcinolone associated
      with nepafenac eye drops as treatment of diabetic macular edema.

      We plan to enroll 40 patients in this prospective randomized clinical trial. Eligible
      patients will be randomized into two groups. All patients will have Early Treatment of
      Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) vision measured and OCT (OCT Stratus - Zeiss)in both eyes
      in following visits: Baseline, Week 4, 8, 12, 20 and 25. OCT measurements will include total
      macular volume, central foveal thickness, and average macular thickness. The patients will be
      evaluated during 25 weeks (7 visits). Parameters for clinical evaluation: visual acuity, IOP,
      biomicroscopy, fundus examination through dilated pupil and OCT.

      Group A: 20 patients will receive intravitreal triamcinolone injection Group B: 20 patients
      will receive intravitreal triamcinolone injection associated with nepafenac eye drops (1 gtt,
      tid) during 6 months.
