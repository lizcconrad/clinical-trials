      The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the efficacy of topical ALT-2074
      applied twice daily for 28 days for treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis in adult subjects.

      The secondary objective will be to evaluate the safety of topical ALT-2074 applied twice
      daily for 28 days for treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis in adult subjects.

      Tertiary objectives will be to provide visual documentation of the improvement of psoriatic
      plaques treated with ALT-2074 using digital photography, and to determine the extent of
      systemic absorption of topically applied ALT-2074 based on a pharmacokinetic measurement of
      blood concentration.

    <description>Two psoriatic plaques of similar surface area and severity will be identified for each subject. ALT-2074 will be applied topically twice daily to 1 of the 2 target plaques, and the placebo control to the other plaque for a period of 28 days in amounts sufficient to cover the entire surface area of the target plaque, extending to 1 cm outside of the plaque border.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to qualify for entry into the study:

          1. Men and women between 18 and 75 years old, inclusive.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of stable, chronic plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months prior to
             Visit 1.

          3. In otherwise good general health and free of any disease or physical condition which
             might impair evaluation of plaque psoriasis.

          4. Plaque psoriasis treatable area &lt;10% BSA. (Subject palm size is equivalent to 1% of
             BSA.)

          5. Have 2 well-matched plaques (target plaques) of approximately 3 to 8 cm by 3 to 8 cm
             in size in areas on the right and left or front and back, at sites other than the
             knees, below the knees, elbows, head, face, scalp, palms, and intertriginous areas.

          6. A Combined Psoriasis Severity Score (CPSS) &gt; 6 for each target plaque at Visit 1.

          7. Willing to avoid prolonged exposure of the treatment area to ultraviolet radiation
             (natural and artificial) for the duration of the study.

          8. Able to understand and willing to comply with all study requirements, particularly the
             regimen for administration of study drug.

          9. Able to understand and willing to sign the Informed Consent Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any subject who meets any of the following criteria will not qualify for entry into the
        study:

          1. Women who are pregnant, lactating, planning to become pregnant, or women of
             child-bearing potential who have not successfully been using the same medically
             acceptable contraceptive methods over the previous 3 months, eg, oral contraceptive
             agents, intrauterine device (IUD), and barrier method plus spermicide.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of guttate, pustular, erythrodermic, or other non-plaque forms of
             psoriasis.

          3. Use of emollients or moisturizers on areas to be treated within 24 hours prior to
             Visits 1 or 2.

          4. Use of topical antipsoriatic therapy (including topical retinoids, corticosteroids, or
             vitamin D analogs) on the areas to be treated within 2 weeks prior to Visit 2.

          5. Received systemic immunomodulatory therapy to treat psoriasis (eg, methotrexate,
             cyclosporine, alefacept, etanercept, infliximab, efalizumab, adalimumab) within 12
             weeks prior to Visit 2.

          6. Received phototherapy (including laser), photochemotherapy, or systemic psoriasis
             therapy (eg, systemic corticosteroids, retinoids such as acitretin) within 4 weeks
             prior to Visit 2.

          7. Recent history (within past 12 months) of alcohol or substance abuse. Alcohol abuse
             will be defined as &gt;14 drinks per week (1 drink = 12 oz beer, 4 oz wine, or 1.5 oz
             distilled spirits).

          8. History of noncompliance to medical regimens or unwilling to comply with the study
             protocol.

          9. Participation in an investigational drug study within 30 days prior to Visit 2.

         10. Serious or unstable medical or psychological conditions that in the opinion of the
