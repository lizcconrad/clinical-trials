  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) often have periods during the year
      when their symptoms become worse. These are often due to an infection and are called
      &quot;exacerbations&quot; by doctors. Exacerbations are more common in the winter and also seem to be
      related to particular types of weather. As well as forecasting the weather the UK Met Office
      has developed a system to try to predict when exacerbations are likely to occur. The main
      purpose of this research study is to find out whether the Met Office forecasting service can
      predict when exacerbations are more likely to occur and whether the advice given during the
      predicted higher risk periods leads to fewer patients having an exacerbation or if it reduces
      the impact of the exacerbation. The study will also assess if there is a link between viral
      or bacterial infection and breathing problems that occur during the study period. The study
      will also collect information about possible causes of the breathing problems and what
      happens to the person afterwards. The results of this study will help us learn more about
      breathing problems which may lead to new research studies that would aim to improve the care
      of people with COPD.
