  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done in healthy volunteers to help researchers understand how ABT-614
      works in the human body, specifically in the brain. The PET imaging technique can be thought
      of as a way to take pictures of chemical changes in the brain. To take a PET scan (picture),
      a substance with low levels of radioactivity (radiotracer) has to be injected when you are in
      the PET camera. The radiotracer is only radioactive for a short period of time. In this
      study, PET is being used to measure how the study drug attaches to specific receptors in the
      brain. The radiotracer used in this study, [11C]-(+)-PHNO, is currently being used for
      studies in people at the CAMH PET Centre.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Body Mass Index (BMI) is 18 to 26 kg/m2, inclusive

          2. A condition of general good physical health based upon the results of a medical
             history, physical examination, vital signs, laboratory profile, 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of a metal implant (i.e., aneurysm clip, metal fragments, internal electrical
             devices such as a cochlear implant, spinal cord stimulator or pacemaker) that would
             preclude a MRI scan

          2. During the last year, a radiation exposure that on its own or in addition to the
             expected radiation from this study exceeds the allowed annual radiation exposition
             level (20 mV)

          3. Use of tobacco or other nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to
             Screening

          4. Diagnosis of substance or alcohol disorder within 12 months prior to Screening

          5. History of claustrophobia or feeling of inability to lie still on his back in the PET
             camera

          6. History or presence of any neurological or psychiatric conditions
