  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Despite spontaneous cardiac activity recovery, a shock occurs in more than half of
      patients after resuscitation for cardiac arrest. This acute circulatory insufficiency
      presents similar characteristics with septic shock and is responsible of most early deaths.
      Most frequently, usual treatments are unable to control this shock and to avoid the
      appearance of multiple organ failure.

      Aim of the study: In addition to conventional therapeutics, an early plasma epuration of
      inflammatory mediators (HDHP) could be able to improve hemodynamic parameters and to reduce
      the shock duration. This improvement could have an impact on multiple organ dysfunctions and
      also on early mortality.

      HDHP (plasma epuration of inflammatory mediators) will be used in addition to the current
      clinical practice. The experimental arm will be treated by HDHP device.

      The high permeability membrane SepteX is a membrane polyarylethersulfone sold by Gambro that
      allows the purification of molecules of average size to near 50 kd molecular weight.

      We can thus purify molecules larger molecular weight than hemofiltration can with the usual
      membranes (30 kd). Furthermore, this increase in permeability allows a significant treatment
      medium-sized molecules in diffusion (hemodialysis), that the usual membranes do not allow.
      Finally, it is possible to purify certain molecules that hemofiltration including high volume
      does not allow (TNFalpha for example).

      Use of this membrane requires the use of specific set dedicated machine Prismaflex itself
      with a specific software (Exceed) to ensure the control and security of processing.

      2 sessions of HDHP will be performed in the first 48 hours following ICU admission (with
      inclusion in the first 8 hours).
