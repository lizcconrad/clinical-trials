  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the implant stability at the time of
      abutment placement on implants placed in healed extraction sockets treated with Straumann
      BoneCeramic (SBC) versus Freeze Dried Bone Allograft (FDBA).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo a single tooth extraction and then will be randomized to receive SBC or
      FDBA. Following a healing period of 6 months, a core biopsy will be taken of the augmented
      site and a dental implant will be placed. The subject will be followed for one year following
      dental implant placement for implant success and survival.

    <description>After screening and enrollment, subjects will undergo tooth extraction of a single tooth with placement of Straumann Bone Ceramic or Freeze Dried Allograft Bone (FDBA) with a resorbable collagen membrane (Bio-Gide) for preservation of the alveolar ridge following tooth extraction. Following 6 months of healing, a core of bone will be taken from the surgical site and a dental implant will be placed. The subjects will then be followed for 12 months following dental implant placement.</description>
