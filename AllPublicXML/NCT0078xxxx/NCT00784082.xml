  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In sickle cell disease (SCD), polymerisation of haemoglobin S and the resulting shape change
      of the red blood cells (RBC) lead to vascular occlusion and severe painful crises. Permanent
      inflammatory state and abnormal RBC adhesion to the endothelium trigger these phenomenon.
      Hydroxyurea (HU) is the only drug that has been shown to reduce clinical severity of SCD, and
      this was initially attributed to the stimulation of foetal haemoglobin (HbF). However, the
      clinical response does not correlate consistently with the degree and time of HbF increment,
      suggesting that HU clinical benefits may involve other mechanisms such as the induction of
      natural anti-inflammatory response via the hypothalami-pituitary-adrenal axis.

      Plasmatic proinflammatory molecules (C-reactive protein, orosomucoid, RANTES, IL-6, IL-8,
      MCP-1, IL-1A, IL-1B, ET-1, IL-4, IL-10, TNFalpha, IFNgamma), hormones from the
      hypothalami-pituitary-adrenal axis (cortisol, ACTH), and hypothalamic peptids (arginine
      vasopressin, corticotrophin-releasing hormone) will be measured from SCD children treated or
      not with HU (20 treated children, 20 untreated children with a history of vaso-occlusive
      events, 20 asymptomatic children, and 20 healthy African controls).
