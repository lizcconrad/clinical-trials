  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with failed extubation stay significantly longer in an intensive care unit (ICU) and
      have a higher mortality rate, than those intubated successfully. Reintubation is associated
      with life-threatening complications and a poor prognosis. Functional respiratory tests are
      frequently used as weaning parameters, however, they are not accurate enough to predict
      extubation failure. The incidence of swallowing dysfunction is underestimated, mainly among
      patients whose intubation lasts longer than 48 h.We previously observed that the assessment
      of the swallowing function and oropharyngeal motricity, conducted by the physiotherapist
      before extubation could be helpful for making decisions to extubate patients intubated for
      over 6 days. The objective of this study is to validate a scale previously devised and used
      for physiotherapist bedside evaluation of the swallowing function and oropharyngeal
      motricity, among patients intubated for over 6 days, to determine whether this scale is a
      good predictor of airway secretion-related extubation failure.Expected results : to validate
      a scale previously devised called &quot; physiotherapist evaluation of the swallowing function and
      oropharyngeal motricity before extubation&quot; by the mean of a multicentric study. In our
      hypothesis the clinical parameters studied could be predictive of extubation failure. Then,
      this evaluation could help the medical decision in the choice of the good time for
      extubation. The final objective is to lower the mortality related to extubation failure.

      -  Patients selection, inclusion and procedure: All successive patients admitted to the
           medical or surgical ICU, and intubated by the orotracheal route for &gt;6 days, will be
           prospectively enrolled when extubation will be decided. Patients with previous
           swallowing disorders, ENT surgery or chronic persistent vegetative status will not be
           included. All patients will have to fulfill the usual criteria for extubation. Then,
           before extubation, the different components of swallowing functions will be evaluated by
           the trained physiotherapist, using a bedside pre-extubation scale based on 3 tests:
           assessment of 1)- cervical, oral, labial and lingual motricity; 2)- the gag reflex; and
           3)- swallowing. After extubation, the ability to cough and swallow, secretion volume,
           and the need for suctioning will be evaluated immediately, then at 24, 48 and 72 hours.

        -  Expected results : to validate a scale previously devised called &quot; physiotherapist
           evaluation of the swallowing function and oropharyngeal motricity before extubation&quot; by
           the mean of a multicentric study. In our hypothesis the clinical parameters studied
           could be predictive of extubation failure. Then, this evaluation could help the medical
           decision in the choice of the good time for extubation. The final objective is to lower
           the mortality related to extubation failure.
