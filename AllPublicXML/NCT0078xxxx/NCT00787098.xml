  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of specific activities with and without
      an early therapeutic mobility (ETM) protocol among patients who experience three or more days
      of mechanical ventilation. A second purpose is to examine staff/delivery system and patient
      factors that influence the initiation and progression of activity with and without an ETM
      protocol. The hypothesis is that ETM protocols will result in improved patient outcomes.

      The specific aims of this study are to:

        1. Compare patient responses to selected modes of therapy (activity) without and with an
           ETM protocol

             1. Molecular responses: markers of inflammation interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10

             2. Physiological responses: peripheral oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure,
                new dysrhythmias

             3. Safety/Unsafe events including pain, fatigue, line or tube dislodgement, fall or
                near fall

        2. Determine the associations between duration and level of activity/ETM achieved and
           outcomes:

             1. occurrence of delirium

             2. occurrence of ventilator associated pneumonia

             3. occurrence of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emboli

             4. occurrence of acquired pressure ulcer

             5. muscle strength

             6. number of days mechanically ventilated

             7. discharge location (after ICU)

        3. Describe strategies used in the ICU to initiate and implement activity with and without
           an ETM protocol

             1. use of personnel such as registered nurses, physical therapists, respiratory
                therapist and nursing assistants

             2. use of equipment such as a walker, lift device, belt or bed

             3. perception of sufficient time and abilities

        4. Describe patient factors that are associated with implementation of ETM

             1. Potentially modifiable exemplars: sedation, site of vascular access, physician
                orders

             2. Potentially nonmodifiable exemplars: weight, consciousness, hemodynamic
                instability, terminal condition

      This is a prospective, longitudinal, repeated measures study with a control period, run-in
      period and intervention period. Data will be collected during all three periods for
      comparison. During the control period, patients will receive standard care. Standard care in
      this institution does not include a program of progressive or early mobility but does include
      activities similar to the ETM protocol, implemented at the discretion of the staff. During
      the run-in period, subjects will receive a mix of standard care and the intervention.

    <description>RA begins data collection with chart review for demographic and explanatory variables, collects data for baseline muscle strength. During standard care period, PM will obtain information about the plan for activity for enrolled patients (turning, complete or partial weight-bearing i.e., reverse Trendelenberg positioning, ROM, sitting and walking) through discussion with the direct providers. RA will interview one provider about factors which influence the decision to implement activity or provide bedrest, including the presence of orders for bedrest or physical therapy. If activity is planned, the PM will observe and record the type and duration of activity, drawing serum biomarkers 20 minutes before and 20 minutes after the activity. If no activity is planned or activity duration is less than 10 minutes, serum for only baseline inflammatory biomarkers will be drawn. The RA will collect outcomes data within 24 hours of discharge from the ICU.</description>

    <description>Identical procedures for date recruitment, consent and data collection will occur. In this phase, the Project Manager will promote the use of the ETM protocol through coaching (e.g., reminding staff of benefits of mobility, identification of available resources, or suggesting cessation of bedrest orders) and by participating in planning at least one 20-minute activity.</description>

    <intervention_name>ETM protocol</intervention_name>
    <description>ETM is 4 levels. Level 1, each receives repositioning from lateral to supine positions at even hours, totaling 60 minutes of activity/positioning over 24 hours. If tolerated, two periods of 20 minutes of supine position with a reverse trendelenberg position of 15-20 degrees will be used to promote orthostasis. Level 2 is turning every 2 hours, positioning in reverse trendelenberg at 15-25 degrees as tolerated, active resistance with ICU staff for 20 minutes daily for a total of 60-80 minutes of activity/positioning daily. At Level 3, 2 times 20 minutes of a sitting are added to active ROM and inbed turning (estimated 80-100 total minutes of activity daily). Sitting is in bed or with non-weightbearing assisted transfer to chair with backrest elevation at 75-90 degrees and legs in a dependent position. Level 3 interventions; minimal weight-bearing. Level 4, weight-bearing transfer to chair and ambulation are added to inbed turning.</description>
