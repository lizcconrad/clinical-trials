  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate a unique natural experiment that aims to transform the primary care
      of patients with depression. The experiment's aim is to cause statewide implementation of an
      evidence-based care model for depression by changing the reimbursement system and by using an
      established regional collaborative (the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement) to both
      facilitate the model's widespread use and certify that medical groups have implemented it.
      Study hypotheses include the following:

        1. Newly treated depressed patients in medical groups that have implemented the new
           reimbursement and facilitation will report receiving higher rates of best care processes
           than such patients in these medical groups before implementation.

        2. Rates of best care practices reported to be received by newly treated depressed patients
           two years after each medical group implements changes will be maintained at least at the
           rate reported by patients one year post implementation.

        3. Newly treated depressed patients in medical groups that have participated in the new
           reimbursement and facilitation will have greater improvement in depression symptoms and
           work productivity and lower healthcare costs than such patients in groups before
           participation.

        4. Medical group measures of priority for improving depression care, capability to manage
           change, and practice systems will be predictive of more patient-reported best care
           processes, both at one point in time and in change over time.

      The study will use a multiple baseline across settings with staggered implementation to test
      the effects of changed reimbursement and facilitated organizational change on the use and
      sustainability of evidenced-based care processes for patients with depression. The study will
      also test the effect of the care process changes on changes in depression symptoms,
      healthcare costs, and work productivity.
