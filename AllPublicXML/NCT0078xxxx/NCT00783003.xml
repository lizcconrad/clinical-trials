  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GW642444 and GSK233705 are in development for treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease. Development of these two inhaled drugs as a combination therapy would have potential
      for improved patient benefit as they both work through different mechanisms and the combined
      bronchodilatory effect might be additive. This study will look at the this combination, for
      the first time, in healthy Japanese subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac
             monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the
             reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Japanese ethnic origin (defined as having been born in Japan with four ethnic Japanese
             grandparents and able to speak Japanese)

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age.

          -  Female subjects must be of non childbearing potential including pre-menopausal females
             with documented (medical report verification) hysterectomy or double oophorectomy or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea or 6 months of
             spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml
             (&lt;140 pmol/L) or 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
             hysterectomy.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until 90 days post-last dose.

          -  Body weight &gt; 45 kg and body mass index within the range of 18-28 kg/m2 inclusive.

          -  Average QTc(B) &lt; 450 msec taken from triplicate assessments at screening.

          -  No clinically active and relevant abnormality on 12-lead ECG at screening or 24h
             Holter ECG.

          -  Normal spirometry (FEV1 ≥ 80% of predicted, FEV1/FVC ≥ 70%).

          -  Non-smokers (never smoked or not smoking for &gt;6 months with &lt;10 pack years history
             (Pack years = (cigarettes per day smoked/20) x number of years smoked))

          -  A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject

          -  The subject is capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form

          -  Available to complete the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically important abnormality identified at the screening medical assessment
             (physical examination/medical history), clinical laboratory tests, or ECG (12-lead).
             24hr Holter monitoring outside normal limits.

          -  A history of breathing problems (i.e. history of asthmatic symptomatology, unless
             asthma in childhood that has now resolved and no longer requires maintenance therapy
             which should not be an exclusion).

          -  A mean QTc(B) value at screening &gt;450msec, or an ECG that is not suitable for QT
             measurements (e.g. LBBB or poorly defined termination of the T wave).

          -  A history of elevated resting blood pressure or a mean blood pressure higher than
             140/90 mmHg at screening.

          -  A mean heart rate outside the range 40-90 bpm at screening.

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates and
             benzodiazepines. The detection of drugs with a legitimate medical use would not
             necessarily be an exclusion to study participation. The detection of alcohol would not
             be an exclusion at screening but would need to be negative pre-dose and during the
             study.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody (if determined by the local SOP's).

          -  History of high alcohol consumption within 3months of the study defined as: an average
             weekly intake of greater than 21 units or an average daily intake of greater than 3
             units (males), or defined as an average weekly intake of greater than 14 units or an
             average daily intake of greater than 2 units (females). One unit is equivalent to a
             half-pint (220mL) of beer or 1 (25ml) measure of spirits or 1 glass (125ml) of wine.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, (except for simple analgesics eg
             paracetamol), including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's
             Wort (Hypericum)) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer)
             or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication,
             unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will
             not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history of regular use of tobacco- or
             nicotine-containing products prior to screening.

          -  The subject is unable to use the novel dry powder inhaler correctly.

          -  The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to ipratropium bromide,
             Tiotropium, atropine and any of its derivatives.

          -  Any adverse reaction including immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to any β2 agonist
             or sympathomimetic drug,

          -  The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to milk protein or the excipients
             lactose monohydrate and MgSt.
