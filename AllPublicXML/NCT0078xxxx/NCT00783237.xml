    <textblock>
      This was a single-dose study to determine the time it takes for mometasone furoate nasal
      spray to go in effect, after a single dose of 2 sprays per nostril. Patients who are eligible
      were exposed to ragweed pollen for 3 hours on one or two occasions. Patients who experienced
      adequate symptoms during the pollen exposure phase came back for a Treatment Phase visit.
      During the Treatment Phase visit, patients were exposed to ragweed pollen for 2 hours and
      then received either mometasone or placebo nasal spray. Symptom evaluations began on the
      patients every hour for the next 11 hours.

          -  had a history of SAR to ragweed pollen for at least one year

          -  had a positive skin test (prick) to short ragweed allergen.

          -  if female, had a negative urine pregnancy test (HCG) at the Screening Visit, and prior
             to treatment on the Treatment Visit

          -  were non pregnant women of childbearing potential and used a medically acceptable,

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  had an upper respiratory or sinus infection within two weeks prior to treatment;

          -  had received escalating doses of immunotherapy, oral immunotherapy or short course
             (rush) immunotherapy for treatment of rhinitis;

          -  were female subjects who were pregnant, breast feeding, or premenarchal;

          -  could not adhere to concomitant medication prohibitions;

          -  had a known potential for hypersensitivity, allergy, or idiosyncratic reaction to

          -  had asthma that requires systemic or inhaled corticosteroid treatment;

          -  had large nasal polyps, marked septum deviations, or any other nasal structural
             abnormality that significantly interferes with nasal airflow;

          -  had rhinitis medicamentosa;

          -  had any relevant abnormal vital sign due to an unknown underlying disease and
