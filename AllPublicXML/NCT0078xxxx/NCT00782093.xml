      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic
      profile of volociximab intravitreous injection in subjects with subfoveal choroidal
      neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to AMD (i.e., predominantly classic,
             minimally classic or occult no classic) as documented by fluorescein angiogram.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any prior treatment for AMD or any intravitreal treatment for any indication in the
             study eye prior to the screening visit, except oral supplements of vitamins and
             minerals.

          -  Previous or concomitant therapy with intravitreous corticosteroids.

          -  Any of the following underlying diseases including:

          -  Diabetic retinopathy

          -  History or evidence of severe cardiac disease (e.g., NYHA Functional Class III or IV -
             see Appendix 19.6), history or clinical evidence of unstable angina, acute coronary
             syndrome, myocardial infarction or revascularization within last 6 months, ventricular
             tachyarrythmias requiring ongoing treatment.

          -  History or evidence of clinically significant peripheral vascular disease, such as
             intermittent claudication or prior amputation.

          -  Clinically significant impaired renal (serum creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dl or s/p renal
             transplant or receiving dialysis) or hepatic function. Patients with results outside
             these ranges may be enrolled in consultation with Ophthotech.

          -  Stroke (within 12 months of trial entry).

          -  Any major surgical procedure within one month of trial entry.

          -  Previous therapeutic radiation in the region of the study eye.

          -  Any treatment with an investigational agent in the past 60 days for any condition.

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing.

          -  Known serious allergies to the fluorescein dye used in angiography, to the components
             of the ranibizumab formulation, or to the components of the volociximab formulation.
