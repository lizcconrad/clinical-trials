  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bradykinin stimulates t-PA release from intact vessels, but not from endothelial cells in
      culture. It has been proposed that the nerves of blood vessels are the source of bradykinin
      stimulated t-PA release. In order tho test this hypothesis, we intend to infuse bradykinin
      into the brachial (arm) artery and the coronary arteries of heart transplant recipients and
      control subjects. This is because heart transplant recipients do not have nerves to their
      coronary arteries.

      This protocol studies the effects of bradykinin on t-PA release in the forearm of transplant
      recipients. The brachial artery has intact nerves.

      Separate protocols address coronary artery infusions in healthy subjects and transplant
      recipients and forearm infusions in healthy subjects.

    <description>Patients receive 0, 10, 20, and 40 ng/min/100cc forearm volume of intrabrachial bradykinin, for 5 minutes at each dose. Forearm blood flow will be measured by strain gauge plethysmography, blood samples will be obtained to measure t-PA, PAI-1 at each dose. FMD and Radial artery tonometry will also be performed under resting conditions.</description>
