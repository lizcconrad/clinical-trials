      Study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses and multiple
      ascending doses of VX-509 administered to healthy male and female subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, and PD of single ascending
      doses of VX-509.

      Part B will evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, and PD of multiple ascending doses of
      VX-509 administered for 14 days.

      A total of 72 subjects will be enrolled: 36 subjects in Part A and 36 subjects in Part B.
