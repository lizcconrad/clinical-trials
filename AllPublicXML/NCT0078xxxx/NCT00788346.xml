  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prescribing decisions by clinicians are often thought to be simple: a patient's clinical
      problem leads a prescriber to choose the optimal treatment. However, many factors other than
      the patient's condition affect prescribing decisions, including the marketing of
      pharmaceuticals. Clinicians are subjected to direct &quot;detailing&quot; by representatives of the
      pharmaceutical industry, advertisements in medical journals and requests for specific
      treatments from patients, who are increasingly exposed to direct-to-consumer (DTC)
      advertising. These influences, often based on biased or inaccurate information, contribute to
      a variety of problems in prescribing, including the unnecessary use of expensive, heavily
      marketed medications.

      Overcoming these influences requires innovative approaches. The movement toward widespread
      adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) and electronic prescribing presents new
      opportunities to educate both clinicians and patients at the time of medication prescribing.
      This project, endorsed by the AHRQ-supported Centers for Education and Research on
      Therapeutics (CERTs; www.certs.hhs.gov) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), aims
      to test the effectiveness of computerized prescribing alerts and state-of-the-art educational
      outreach to reduce the unnecessary use of heavily marketed medications. A second goal is to
      improve clinicians' knowledge of industry marketing practices, so that they can more
      effectively assess information provided by drug companies. Thus, the study has two specific
      aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To assess whether computerized prescribing alerts linked electronically to
      patient educational material can reduce prescribing of heavily marketed medications.

      Specific Aim 2: To assess whether group academic detailing increases clinicians' knowledge
      about industry marketing practices and increases the effect of prescribing alerts.
