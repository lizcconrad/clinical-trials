      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)
      following the administration of iopamidol-370 (Iopamiro-370) and iodixanol-320 (Visipaque
      320) in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus
      undergoing cardiac angiography.

    <textblock>
      This was a Phase IV, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of
      iopamidol-370 and iodixanol-320 in patients at high risk for CIN, i.e., patients with:

        -  Stage 3 or 4 CKD (SCr level of ≥ 1.5 mg/dL for men and ≥1.3 mg/dL for women or eGFR
           between 15 and 50 mL/min, and

        -  Diabetes mellitus who would undergo clinically indicated cardiac angiography procedures.
           Approximately 10 investigative centers were to participate in this study. This study was
           to enroll approximately 220 patients to ensure that 200 evaluable patients were able to
           complete the study according to this protocol.

      Patients were to be randomized to receive either iopamidol-370 or iodixanol-320. Each patient
      was to be evaluated for the occurrence of CIN within 48 to 72 hours postdose.

    <description>The number of participants who presented with CIN (defined as an increase in Serum Creatinine (SCr) from baseline greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/dL following the administration of iopamidol-370 or iodixanol 320 while undergoing cardiac angiography).

    <description>Only 1 participant presented with incidence of CIN (change from baseline greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/dL) following the administration of iopamidol-370 while undergoing cardiac angiography. The participant's measurements at baseline and at 48 to 72 hours after the injection of contrast agent, as well as the difference between the two, are displayed here.
