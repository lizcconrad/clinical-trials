      RATIONALE: Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well vorinostat works in treating women with
      ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the in vivo molecular and biological effects of vorinostat by analyzing
           changes in proliferation and apoptosis, histone acetylation, and HDAC protein expression
           in women with ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral vorinostat twice a day for 3 days in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo lumpectomy or mastectomy 2 hours after the last
      dose of vorinostat.

      Blood and tissue samples are collected at baseline and during surgery for biomarker
      laboratory studies. Samples are analyzed by immunohistochemistry for Ki-67, HDAC1 and HDAC6
      protein expression, and histone H4 and α-tubulin acetylation.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 1 month and then every 6 months
      for 5 years.
