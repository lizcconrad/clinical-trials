  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On regular (diagnostic) MRI images brain tumors can show &quot;contrast enhancement&quot;: uptake of an
      intravenously administered contrast agent can cause an enhancement pattern that is seen as a
      white area on a frequently used MRI protocol (&quot;T1 weighted imaging&quot;). High grade gliomas are
      a common brain tumor that share this enhancement pattern. The goal of surgery is to resect
      this contrast enhancing part without causing additional neurological damage. Intraoperative
      MRI (iMRI) is a helpful tool in achieving this goal, because it can provide updated images
      during resection and correct for deformations that occur in the brain during surgery. These
      deformations make preoperative images that are used for standard neuronavigation systems less
      reliable. However, due to manipulations during surgery, the contrast uptake during surgery
      may differ from contrast uptake in diagnostic MRI. This study aims to relate contrast
      enhancement on iMRI and tumor characteristics on tissue samples from the tumor. When the
      neurosurgeon considers the resection of the high grade glioma to be complete, an iMRI scan
      will be made, and tissue sampling will be performed on the borderzones of the tumor or tumor
      resection cavity respectively. This will provide insight in the relation between contrast
      enhancement on iMRI and the presence of tumor tissue. Such knowledge is important to improve
      effectiveness and safety of iMRI guided brain tumor resection.
