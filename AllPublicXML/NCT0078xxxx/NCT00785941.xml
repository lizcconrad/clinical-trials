      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      of the anti-IGF-IR monoclonal antibody IMC-A12 administered every other week in patients with
      advanced solid tumors who no longer respond to standard therapy or for whom no standard
      therapy is available.

    <description>All patients will receive intravenous infusions of IMC-A12, with the dose depending on which cohort they are enrolled into a minimum of three patients will be enrolled in each Cohort. When all patients complete a cohort, dose escalation to the next Cohort will occur.
A treatment cycle will consist of IMC-A12 administered intravenously, once every other week for 4 weeks, for a total of 2 doses; followed by a 2-week observation period.</description>
