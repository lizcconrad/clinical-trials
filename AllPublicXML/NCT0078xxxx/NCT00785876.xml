  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankle injuries are a very common injury in children. Each year approximately 35000 kids
      present to Ontario emergency departments (ED) with this problem. Right now, about 90% of
      these children get x-rays of the injured ankle, even though only 12% of these x-rays show a
      break in the bone. Some excellent research has created some rules that doctors can use to
      help them decide which children really need x-rays. Unfortunately, even though these rules
      have been proven to safely reduce x-rays by as much as two-thirds, most doctors are not using
      these rules.

      Therefore, this study will be the first to put the best paediatric ankle x-ray rule, the Low
      Rick Ankle Rule, into physician practice in EDs. Our main goal is to determine how much we
      can reduce ankle x-ray rates in EDs that use this rule regularly versus those that do not. If
      we show that doctors can safely use this rule regularly and the number of ankle x-rays will
      be significantly less, this will lessen unnecessary potentially harmful radiation exposure in
      children, these children will spend less time in an ED, and the health care system will save
      money.

Post-LRAR: At 27 weeks, in addition to the aforementioned ED collection sheet and phone follow up, the implementation strategy for the LRAR rule and related management will be introduced at the intervention hospitals.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All otherwise healthy children between the ages of 3 and 16 years of age that present
             to the participating EDs with an isolated acute (&lt; 72 hours) blunt ankle injury due to
             any mechanism of injury will be eligible for the study. The age criteria were chosen
             to match those ages in which the LRAR was validated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Children with ankle injuries who were referred from outside the hospital with
             radiographs.

          2. Children with ankle injuries who returned for reassessment of the same ankle injury.

          3. Children with open wounds on their ankle and/or foot

          4. All children at risk for pathological fractures such as those with congenital or
             acquired generalized bony disease (Appendix I). Clinical presentation and risks in
             these cases may be altered.

          5. Congenital anomalies of the feet and/or ankles (eg club feet, tarsal coalition). These
             abnormalities may have features which may complicate clinical assessment.

          6. Patients with known coagulopathies. Underlying hemarthrosis may complicate clinical
             assessment.

          7. Patients with cognitive and/or developmental delay. These patients may not localize
             pain.

          8. Injuries greater than 72 hours old. The signs and symptoms of the most common
             fracture, the Salter-Harris I fracture of the distal fibula, may be diminished. Our
             ability to make this clinical diagnosis with confidence may thus be compromised.

          9. Recent history of surgery or closed reduction of the same ankle within the last 3
             months. These prior events may confuse current presenting symptomatology and ability
             to weight-bear and recover normally.

         10. Patients with low risk injuries who do not have phone or electronic mail access and/or
             have an insurmountable language barrier. This will preclude follow up.
