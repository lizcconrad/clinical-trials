  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducting preliminary testing to find out whether a particular educational
      program can alter parental overcontrol of their children's eating. There is evidence from
      previous studies that children who are irritable, cry a lot, tend to be overcontrolled and
      are at high risk for developing overweight. If the education program can change parental
      behavior the next study would examine whether this affects children's weight over a longer
      period of time.

      There are two main studies in this project. For both studies families with a child between 2
      and 4-years will be entered to the study although only the parents will participate. At least
      one parent will be overweight with a BMI&gt;27.5, and the child will have a reactive temperament
      assessed by the Children's Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ) completed by the parent with a
      combined score on the approach/impulsivity scales of 4.65 (possible range 1 - 7). The
      cut-points for parental BMI and their child's temperament derive from our previous
      prospective risk factor study. Screening will consist of a brief telephone screen to
      ascertain willingness to participate in further screening and self-reported BMI. Both parents
      will be invited to the laboratory to ascertain whether they meet BMI criteria. In Study 1
      parents with a child with either reactive or non-reactive temperament patterns will be
      entered to this study. In Study 2 only parents with a child with a reactive temperament will
      be admitted to the study. There will be no randomization in Study 1. There will also be 2
      focus groups each lasting 90-minutes to ascertain typical child feeding problems, and a pilot
      administration of the interventions. In Study 2 parents will be randomized to receive either
      the experimental intervention or a health education program aimed at enhancing their
      children's health. Each group session will last 90-minutes and there will be 10 group
      sessions at weekly intervals. Assessments in both studies will be similar and will consist of
      questionnaires aimed at assessing family and children's feeding behaviors and parental
      attitudes and behaviors concerning their own weight/shape and dieting. We estimate that the
      assessments will take approximately 60-minutes to complete in Study 1 and 45-minutes each in
      Study 2 because extraneous questions will be removed as a result of findings in Study 1.

        Children aged 2-4 years at risk for overweight with at least one overweight/obese parent

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For study 1, 60 families (120 parents) with a child between the age of 2-4 years will be
        entered to the study. Children of these families will be at risk for overweight because the
        family will contain at least one obese parent. For study 2, 100 families (200 parents) will
        be entered to the study. Children of these families will be at risk for overweight and have
        a reactive temperament. The reason for using this population is that a combination of
        parental obesity and a child with a reactive temperament appears to put the child at high
        risk for the development of overweight.&amp;#xA;

        Exclusion Criteria:Parental exclusions:

          1. Not able to comprehend English well enough to participate in assessments or the
             intervention.

          2. Serious non-obesity related physical illness, (e.g., cancer), which would preclude
             participation in assessment or intervention.

          3. Serious current psychiatric disorder, e.g. schizophrenia, uncontrolled bipolar
             disorder, mental retardation that would preclude participation in assessment or
             intervention.

          4. Single parents

        Child exclusions:

          1. Serious physical illness or related treatments that would affect feeding or weight
             including history of feeding aversion, failure to thrive, and use of nasogastric or
             gastrostomy feeding.

          2. Prematurity below 37-weeks associated with prolonged hospitalization, ongoing need for
             nutritional supplementation, or naso-gastric feeding.(parental report)

          3. Serious current developmental problems including any that might interfere with
             self-feeding or require additional parental feeding support e.g. developmental delay,
             autism. (parental report).
