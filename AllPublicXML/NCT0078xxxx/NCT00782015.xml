  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the effects of 3 oz almonds added daily to a National Cholesterol
      Education Program Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet in improving endothelial function
      in patients with Coronary Artery Disease. The study seeks to determine if these effects are
      mediated via an increase in Nitric Oxide synthesis and reductions in dyslipidemia and
      systemic inflammation.

      Vascular reactivity will be assessed via flow mediated dilation with endothelium-independent
      and hyperemic flow measured in the right brachial artery by non-invasive 2-dimensional and
      Doppler ultrasound. Serum will be collected and analyzed for biomarkers of dyslipidemia,
      inflammation, endothelial function, vascular reactivity and oxidative stress.

      The study is a randomized, crossover, 6 week intervention trial design with a 6 week run in
      on the TLC diet and a 6 week washout on the TLC diet between control and intervention
      periods. Forty subjects with verified and stable coronary artery disease will be enrolled in
      the study. The control intervention involved maintaining a steady TLC diet without nuts which
      will be monitored with counseling and dietary assessments. The almond intervention involved
      consuming 3 oz. of almonds per day and adjusting lipid intake to remain isocaloric with the
      TLC diet alone. Again subjects will be monitored with counseling and dietary assessments.

      At the beginning and end of each intervention period subjects will be tested for endothelial
      function using flow mediated dilation and blood and urine samples will be collected for
      biochemical analysis for markers of inflammation, dyslipidemia, and oxidative stress.
