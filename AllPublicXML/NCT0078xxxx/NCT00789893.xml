  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient will have radiation to treat the cancer. This treatment can make the vagina both
      narrower and shorter. That can cause two problems. It can make it harder for the doctor to do
      a pelvic exam during a follow-up visits. And, it can make sexual intercourse uncomfortable.

      We tell women to use a vaginal dilator after radiation to the pelvis. This is standard
      education. We do not routinely ask women how they do with it. We are doing this study to see
      if using the dilator as we instruct will help the vagina stretch. The patient will have an
      examine of the vagina before the start of radiation. We will see what size dilator can fit.
      The goal of this study is to have the patient be able to use that size dilator within six
      months after radiation.

    <description>Participants will be instructed to use the dilators 3 times per week, regardless of frequency of sexual intercourse. At 5 time points, data will be collected to determine vaginal dilator size, grade vaginal stenosis &amp; assess vaginal symptoms. 1)Baseline: patient self-assessment following consultation up until the end of the first week of radiation 2)Post-radiation: patient self-assessment one month ± 2 weeks follow-up from last day of radiation 3)Post-radiation: 3 month ± 4 weeks follow-up from initiation of dilator use 4)Post-radiation: 6 month ± 4 weeks follow-up from initiation of dilator use 5)Post-radiation: 12 months ± 4 weeks follow-up from initiation of dilator use. At the 1st &amp; 2nd time points, the nurse will telephone the patient to retrieve her responses. The 1st phone call will occur between the time following consultation up until the end of the first week of radiation, &amp; the 2nd will be one month ± 2 weeks from last day of radiation.</description>
