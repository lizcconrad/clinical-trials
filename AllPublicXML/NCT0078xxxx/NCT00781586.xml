  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is considered research because efficacy (how well a drug works) information is
      needed in healthy, 25-45 year-old, female subjects with moderate caffeine intake. The
      investigational product is available in the United States without a prescription
      (over-the-counter) as a nutritional supplement. The purpose of this study is to assess
      whether One-A-Day Weightsmart Advanced is safe and can increase metabolism and perceived
      energy in female subjects compared with caffeine or placebo (inactive drug). Participation in
      this study will last approximately 4 weeks and require about 4 outpatient visits to St.
      Luk's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. About 21 subjects are expected to participate in this study.

      - Primary efficacy endpoints are area under the curve (AUC) over the first 2 hours and the
      last 2 hours of Resting Metabolic RateRespiratory Quotient- The secondary efficacy endpoints
      are:Perceived Energy scales Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Change from baseline for Systolic Blood
      Pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) respiration, average heart rate over 1st 20
      minutes, average heart rate over last 20 minutes, and temperature
