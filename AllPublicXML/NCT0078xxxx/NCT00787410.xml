    <textblock>
      This study is a multicentre, open label, non-comparative, two stage phase II trial to assess
      the activity of ZD1839 (IRESSA) in patients with malignant mesothelioma. Patients will
      receive trial treatment as first-line therapy, administered continuously once daily until the
      completion of six 4-week cycles of treatment, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
      withdrawal of consent. Patients continuing to show evidence of response, disease
      stabilization or clinical benefit from ZD1839 may continue to receive therapy beyond
      completion of the trail.
