  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test two innovative case management approaches designed to
      increase linkages and engagement with drug abuse treatment, HIV-related care, and other
      health services among an underserved population of African American women at risk for HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is fundamentally concerned with the implementation and evaluation of
      theoretically-based, culturally appropriate case management interventions targeting
      individual, social and environmental factors among highly vulnerable African American women.
      The research is designed to test innovative, comprehensive approaches to HIV
      prevention/intervention through case management driven service linkage and engagement.
      Testing new approaches to intervention with African-American women at high risk for HIV
      addresses a particularly urgent public health need in Miami, as well as other large
      metropolitan areas, where officials continue to document epidemic rates of HIV/AIDS clustered
      in urban, impoverished African-American communities.

      Comparison: Participants will be randomly assigned to: a Strengths-Based / Professional Only
      Condition in which clients participate in a &quot;strengths-based&quot; case management approach; or, a
      Strengths-Based / Professional/Peer Condition in which a team composed of: a) a credentialed,
      professional case manager and b) a recovering addict peer - both trained in &quot;strengths-based&quot;
      case management techniques - develop and facilitate the implementation of a service plan.
