      Background

      Drug-eluting stents (DES) have been extremely successful in reducing restenosis and the need
      for repeat revascularization procedures in patients who undergo PCI. The potential increased
      incidence of late stent thrombosis prompted cardiologists to prolong the use of dual
      anti-platelet therapy after the one year duration recommended by the recent ESC guidelines.
      However, while the premise that the cardiologists should put all their patients on dual
      clopidogrel-aspirin regimen for life sounds the easy way, it is an unrealistic goal because
      of the potential increase of bleeding complications and of the healthcare cost increase. The
      recent possibility to monitor aspirin with bedside assays offers a real opportunity to
      compare in good aspirin responder patients the two strategies: aspirin-clopidogrel regimen
      versus mono-aspirin regimen and to respond to the key question: can the investigators switch
      from dual to single antiplatelet therapy after six months in good aspirin responder patients
      ? Study National, multicenter, randomised prospective open group comparison of dual
      clopidogrel-ASA versus single ASA regimen after six months, in good ASA responder patients
      treated with DES (name: XIENCE) implantation.

      End point Primary: At 12 months: death, myocardial infarction, repeat urgent
      revascularization, stroke requiring a new hospitalisation and major bleedings.

      Secondary: Incidence at 24 and 36 months after drug eluting stent(name: XIENCE) implantation,
      of the same composite endpoint and incidence at 12, 24 and 36 months of minor bleeding
      complications Participating centres: 60 french centers
