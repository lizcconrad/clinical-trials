  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate native tissue optical properties and photosensitizer
      optical properties in vivo with a novel, non-contact optical imaging device call Modulated
      Imaging to help optimize the laser exposure in future photodynamic treatment for patients
      with skin cancer.

      Photodynamic therapy involves the administration of a tumor-localizing photosensitizing agent
      that, when illuminated with the proper wavelength of light, can result in photochemical
      processes that cause irreversible damage to tumor tissues. Photodynamic therapy is
      non-invasive and has been shown to be effective in the treatment of skin cancer while
      producing excellent aesthetic appearance and psychological well-being in patients that
      normally would require invasive excisions.

    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for skin cancer is excision, curettage and electrodesiccation
      and/or cryosurgery.

      The Modulated Imaging can measure tissue optical properties that effect the Photodynamic
      therapy treatment process can show spectral absorption and scattering coefficients, oxy- and
      deoxy-hemoglobin, water, melanin and use that information to provide customized laser light
      treatment.

      The researchers can use an imaging system that can characterize the tissue and
      photosensitizer optical properties and use that information to drive a treatment light
      projection system that can spatially optimize the light irradiance for personalized
      treatment, thus improving outcomes.
