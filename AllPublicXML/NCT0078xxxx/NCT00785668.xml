    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, single dose pharmacokinetic/safety study in male and female
      asthmatic subjects. Subjects will receive a single dose of 10 mg of AER 001 administered as a
      dry powder using a handheld device. The goals of this study are to understand the
      pharmacokinetics and safety of AER 001 administered as a dry powder in mild to moderate
      asthmatics.

      Study Design

        -  Single centre, single dose PK/safety study in male and female asthmatic subjects.

        -  Approximately 10 subjects will be dosed.

        -  Treatments will be administered by dry powder inhalation using a handheld device

        -  Subjects will attend the Unit for screening and if eligible return to the Unit on the
           day of dosing (Day 1). Subjects will be required to stay overnight in the Unit and will
           be discharged on Day 2.

        -  On study Day 1, subjects are to receive a single administration of AER 001. N.B.
           Screening will take place within 28 days prior to administration of AER 001.

      Primary objective: To investigate the pharmacokinetics of AER 001 administered as a dry
      powder in mild to moderate asthmatics.

      Secondary objective: To investigate the safety of AER 001 administered as a dry powder in
      mild to moderate asthmatics.

             female partners using medically acceptable methods of contraception.

          -  Subjects who have a pre study medical history, physical examination, 12 Lead ECG
             acceptable to the investigator.

          -  Subjects who have clinical laboratory tests within the reference ranges or clinically
             acceptable to the investigator.

          -  Subjects who are negative for HbsAg, hepatitis C antibody and HIV II and I test at
             screening.

          -  Subjects who are negative for drugs of abuse at screening and admission.

          -  Subjects who are negative for alcohol on admission.

          -  Subjects who have an improvement in FEV1 of &gt;10% following 400 ug salbutamol
             administration using a spacer device.

          -  Subjects who have a FEV1 &gt; 70% of predicted at screening and pre dose.

          -  Subjects who have not received steroid treatment in the prior week.

          -  Subjects who are non-smokers for at least 3 months prior to screening.
