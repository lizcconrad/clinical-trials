      Given that sedentary behavior is associated with T2DM, the purpose of this study is to
      evaluate whether subjects with T2DM have a significant disincentive to performing exercise
      (due to greater perceived effort) . This study will prospectively compare the perceived
      exercise effort between T2DM and non-diabetic women while adjusting for potential confounders
      including baseline physical activity. This study will also assess whether perception of
      effort is associated with physiologic parameters related to exercise effort. Finally, we have
      3 hypothesis-generating exploratory aims designed to screen for additional psychological and
      physiologic parameters that may increase perceived effort in those with T2DM.

      Hypothesis 1: At the same absolute workload (e.g., 30 watts) and the same relative workloads,
      it is a greater effort for women with T2DM to exercise than for non-diabetic women.

      Specific Aim 1: To determine differences in subjective perceived effort of bicycle exercise
      at low-to-moderate workloads in sedentary women with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) vs.
      non-diabetic sedentary women.

      Hypothesis 2: There will be a significant association between RPE and the physiologic
      measures related to work intensity (e.g., relative work intensity and tau2).

      Specific Aim 2: In the same populations as SA1, to determine the strength of association
      during bicycle exercise between subjective perceived effort and physiologic measures related
      to work intensity.

      Exploratory Aims:

      Exploratory Aim 1: In the T2DM group described in SA1, to determine the strength of
      association during bicycle exercise between subjective effort and additional physiologic
      measures

      Exploratory Aim 2: In the T2DM group described in SA1, to determine the strength of
      association during bicycle exercise between subjective effort and psychologic measures
      related to perception of effort.

      During the first visit, blood will be drawn for measurements of overall health (complete
      blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel), glucose and insulin levels, lipid levels,
      plasma FSH concentration, and HbA1C.

      On two separate visits, blood samples will be drawn from a warmed IV site to measure muscle
      metabolites which change with exercise (e.g., glucose, calcium, lactate, H+, K+, and HCO3-)
      and may be associated with muscle pain or fatigue.

        Twenty-five sedentary post-menopausal women with uncomplicated T2DM (of duration â‰¤ 10
        years) between the ages of 50-70 and twenty-five sedentary non-diabetic post-menopausal
        women between the ages of 50-70 will be recruited.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sedentary women not participating in a regular exercise program (&gt; one bout of
             exercise per week)

          -  If subject has diabetes, must be uncomplicated T2DM and &lt; 25 years since T2DM
             diagnosis

          -  Ages of 50-70 years

          -  BMI of 25-35

          -  Subjects can only be taking the following oral hypoglycemic drugs: metformin,
             sulfonylureas or sitagliptin. Use of insulin or other oral hypoglycemic medications is
             not allowed.

          -  Persons with T2DM will be accepted for study only if they have total glycosylated
             hemoglobin levels (HbA1C) &lt;8% (adequate control) on therapy.

          -  Control subjects must have HbA1C &lt; 5.5% and a fasting blood glucose of &lt;100 mg/dl
             suggesting no significant insulin resistance.

          -  All women must be post-menopausal, documented by menstrual history and follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) level.

          -  Current smokers will be excluded since smoking can impair CV exercise performance but
             people who have quit smoking for at least 1 year will be accepted for study.

          -  Absence of comorbid conditions will be confirmed by history, physical examination and
             laboratory testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In general, people will be excluded with any condition which could limit exercise
             performance.

          -  Persons with clinically evident distal symmetrical neuropathy, determined by
             evaluation of symptoms (numbness, paresthesia) and signs (elicited by vibration,
             pinprick, light touch, ankle jerks), will be excluded from further study as neuropathy
             may limit exercise performance.

          -  Persons with autonomic dysfunction (&gt;20 mm fall in upright BP without a change in
             heart rate) will be excluded as well, due to associated limitations of exercise
             performance.

          -  Persons will be excluded if they have evidence of heart disease by history (Prior
             heart attack or bypass surgery, heart failure, or significant valvular disease) or
             abnormal resting electrocardiogram (EKG) consistent with prior infarct or latent
             ischemia (unless cardiovascular stress imaging or catheterization shows they do not
             have coronary artery disease). We will also exclude subjects with left or right bundle
             branch block on resting EKG (precludes recognition of ischemic EKG changes with
             exercise) or abnormal exercise EKG (&gt; 1 mm ST segment depression 80 msec out in the ST
             segment for 3 consecutive beats).

          -  Persons with angina or any other exercise-limiting cardiovascular, pulmonary or
             musculoskeletal symptoms will be excluded as well.

          -  Presence of systolic blood pressure &gt;150 at rest or &gt;250 with exercise or diastolic
             pressure &gt;95 at rest or &gt;105 with exercise are also grounds for exclusion.

          -  Subjects with proteinuria (urine protein &gt;200 mg/dl) or a creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl,
             suggestive of renal disease will be excluded.

          -  Subjects with total cholesterol &gt;220 mg/dl, low density lipoprotein &gt; 130 mg/dl, or
             triglycerides &gt; 250 mg/dl will be excluded given the potential insulin resistance and
             endothelial dysfunction associated with these cholesterol parameters.

          -  Subjects taking the following medications will be excluded: insulin, oral hypoglycemic
             agents other than those stated in inclusion criteria, estrogen-containing hormone
             replacement therapy including the &quot;estring&quot;.

          -  Control subjects who have an immediate family member with type 2 diabetes will be
             excluded.
