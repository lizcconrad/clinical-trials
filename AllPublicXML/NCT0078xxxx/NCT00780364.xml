      The objective is to establish the effect of sour taste and cold temperature on the pharyngeal
      swallowing transit time after ischemic hemisphere stroke.

      Over the past decade there were many studies over normal and pathological swallowing that
      discuss the influence of taste and temperature. Nevertheless there were many questions on the
      issue that remains to be solved, including the hemispheric lateralization of lesions
      dysphagic patients remains also to be fully understood.Swallowing disorder is defined as
      oropharyngeal dysphagia in presence of alterations in any phase of the complex swallowing
      dynamics. It could be congenital or acquired, affecting nutritional aspects, hydration, lung
      function and the individual's social integration [1]. Stroke, has a high incidence among
      neurological diseases, and cause disturbs on swallowing dynamics presenting signs of
      dysphagia in at least 50% of cases.A study that analyzed swallowing dynamics by
      videofluoroscopy in individuals with history of one or more stroke episodes with
      oropharyngeal dysphagia shows shorter pharyngeal and oropharyngeal transit times with cold
      stimulus than without them. Other study of heterogeneous neurological diseases such as
      cerebral palsy, brain trauma, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease, concluded that sour taste
      improved swallowing, minimizing laryngotracheal penetration and aspiration in individuals
      with neurological damaged. Chen et al. in an analysis of 42 healthy individuals with several
      taste bolus found that awareness and arousal could also influence the swallowing function.
