      The purpose of this study is to determine if an individually tailored diet and physical
      enhancement program can improve mobility, physical activity, and neuropathy in people with
      early diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathy is the most common complication of diabetes mellitus. Impaired glucose regulation
      (IGR) is associated with development of peripheral neuropathy coupled with gait and mobility
      impairment that may be disabling for the patient. Recent novel data from the investigators'
      group indicates that improved diet and exercise can significantly improve and even reverse
      neuropathy associated with IGR, however this has not been tested as a specific intervention
      in a controlled diabetes complications trial. IGR includes patients with early type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and impaired fasting glucose
      (IFG) based on standardized criteria for the diagnosis of T2DM. The investigators hypothesize
      that, compared to IGR participants advised to follow the current standard care
      recommendations on diet and exercise (Standard Care or &quot;SC&quot;), IGR participants undergoing a
      Tailored Diet and Physical Activity (TDPA) enhancement program will show greater improvement
      in the 6 minute walk test (6MW) and will show a greater reduction in markers of neuropathy
      progression e.g. intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IEFND). Furthermore, the investigators
      will test the hypothesis that improvement in measures of neuropathy, mobility function and
      physical activity (PA) will correlate strongly with each other and with improvement in
      specific measures of metabolic function, and weight loss. This proposal will permit us to
      determine if TDPA can improve mobility and induce nerve regeneration in subjects with early
      diabetes.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  IGR at the time of screening or within three months of screening. This definition
             includes patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance
             (IGT), and early diabetes. Patients can be included if they have an increased risk for
             diabetes with a HBA1C &gt; or = 5.7% (using a method certified by the National
             Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program), or they have diabetes with a HBA1C &gt; or
             equal to 6.5%, or an abnormal fasting venous glucose, or abnormal venous glucose
             values following a 75 gram oral load. Glucose values are as defined (mg/dl): IFG
             fasting greater than 100 mg/dl, IGT- fasting less than 126, 2 h 140-199, or diabetes -
             fasting glucose &gt; 126, 2 h &gt; 200 based on the Standards for Medical Care in Diabetes
             2010 by the American Diabetes Association.

          -  The HbA1c may be normal, but must be &lt;8%.

          -  If diabetic subjects are on medication, they should be stable on medication for at
             least 3 months prior to entering the study. Addition or change in antidiabetic
             medications after enrollment does not affect participation or group assignment.

          -  No risk factors for other causes for neuropathy (determined by a medical history,
             family history, history of medications, occupational history, history of exposure to
             toxins, physical and neurological examinations, and laboratory studies).

          -  Clinical signs or symptoms of neuropathy as determined by the treating neurologists
             history and physical exam, plus an abnormality of one of the following: nerve
             conduction studies (NCS), Quantitative Sudomotor Autonomic Reflex Testing (QSART),
             Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST), or IENFD.

          -  Age range from 30 to 80 years inclusive at the time of screening

          -  Medically stable at the time of enrollment.

          -  Able to participate in a standing exercise program without constant standby
             monitoring.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be using an acceptable method of contraception to
             prevent pregnancy when they are enrolled in the study and must agree to continue to
             practice an acceptable method of contraception for the duration of their participation
             in the study.

          -  Patient must agree to taking an alternative medication to coumadin when undergoing a
             skin biopsy

          -  Willing to complete weekly self-report questionnaires.

          -  Willing to accept assignment to either training group.

          -  Willing and able to increase activity level and exercise independently at home.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women, prisoners, institutionalized subjects and other at risk subjects will
             not be included in this study.

          -  Taking insulin.

          -  Etiology of sensorimotor neuropathy other than IGR based on careful clinical and
             laboratory evaluation.

          -  Current severe medical conditions that are active on the day of enrollment and would
             affect a patient's ability to complete study. This may include active advanced current
             ischemic heart disease (e.g., angina or congestive heart failure), permanent residual
             lower extremity weakness or loss of balance resulting from a stroke, active severe
             obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease, ongoing cancer treatment, renal failure
             currently requiring dialysis, or severe ongoing peripheral vascular disease.

          -  An inability to understand or cooperate with the procedures of the trial or refusal to
             sign the informed consent.

          -  Patients who are unable to answer questions correctly on the Evaluation to Sign
             Consent (ESC) tool.

          -  Significant other neurologic, rheumatological, neuromuscular, or other extremity
             conditions that limit safe exercise or weight bearing.
