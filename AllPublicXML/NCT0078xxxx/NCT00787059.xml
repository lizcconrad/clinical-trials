  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to determine: 1) whether gene transfer using an agent called
      Ad5.hAC6 (adenovirus-5 encoding human adenylyl cyclase type 6) can be given safely to
      patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and 2) whether this agent may be of benefit in
      heart failure. Gene transfer is a process by which genes are introduced into cells and the
      cells then produce the specific protein that the gene directs, in this case, a protein known
      as adenylyl cyclase type 6 (AC6). The gene is carried into the heart cells by a modified
      virus. The virus that is modified is an adenovirus (Ad5), a virus that sometimes causes a
      brief cold. In extensive animal experiments, it was found that increased amounts of AC6
      protein in heart cells appeared to make the heart pump more vigorously.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Male or non-pregnant female patients aged 18-80 years of age

          2. ≥3-month history of heart failure

          3. Compensated (stable) CHF not on intravenous inotropes, vasodilators or diuretics, on
             optimal medical and device therapy as defined by AHA/ACC Guidelines

          4. LV ejection fraction (on optimal therapy) no greater than 40%

          5. Implanted cardiac defibrillator

          6. At least one major coronary artery (or graft) with &lt;50% proximal obstruction

          7. Patients unable to walk (spinal injury, orthopedic problems) can be enrolled if all
             other criteria are met.

          8. Women of child-bearing capacity must have a negative pregnancy test within 2 days of
             test substance administration, and female and male patients must be willing to use
             birth control during sex for 12w after test substance administration if the female
             partner is of child-bearing capacity.

          9. Subjects willingly provide informed consent consistent with ICH-GCP guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Unstable or Class IV angina

          2. Coronary revascularization planned or predicted in next 6 months

          3. Ischemic myocardium in 3 or more regions of a single perfusion bed, as assessed by
             stress echocardiography or jeopardized viable myocardium &gt;15% on perfusion imaging.

          4. ≥50% occlusion of an &quot;unprotected&quot; left main coronary artery. If arterial or venous
             conduits provide blood flow to the distal left coronary circulation (ie, patent bypass
             grafts) then left main disease is &quot;protected&quot; and such patients are not excluded. The
             cardiologist performing the cardiac catheterization will make these decisions.

          5. 2° AV Block (Mobitz 2) or 3° AV block unless pacemaker is present

          6. Hospitalization for CHF requiring intravenous inotropes or vasodilators in the past 4
             weeks

          7. History of biopsy proven myocarditis

          8. Myocardial infarction in previous 6 months

          9. Restrictive, hypertrophic or infiltrative cardiomyopathy or chronic pericarditis

         10. Previous or planned organ transplant recipient or donor.

         11. Thrombocytopenia (&lt;100,000 platelets/µl) or bleeding diathesis

         12. COPD requiring supplemental oxygen at home

         13. AST &gt; 2 times upper limit of normal or chronic liver disease such as cirrhosis or
             Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Patients with HCV are eligible only if both of two conditions
             are met: a) liver function tests are normal; AND b) liver biopsy is normal or shows
             only mild fibrosis.

         14. Current or predicted hemodialysis within 12 months or estimated glomerular filtration
             rate (EGFR) &lt;30 ml/min. On online EGFR calculator that uses sex, age, body weight and
             serum creatinine is available at:
             www.kidney.org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculator.cfm. Use the higher of two EGFR
             results, which are based upon MDRD and CKD-EPI formulas.

         15. CVA or TIA &lt;6 months prior to enrollment

         16. Patients who are immunosuppressed by medicines (corticosteroids, methotrexate,
             cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine), illnesses (AIDS, HIV), or neutrophil count &lt;1000/mm3

         17. Patients receiving other investigational drug therapy within 30 days of enrollment
             including gene transfer

         18. Patients with diseases other than CHF that, in the opinion of the investigator, put
             the subject at risk or adversely affect the results
