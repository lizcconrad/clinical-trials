  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of our study was to which determine factors, those measured by ultrasound
      and also demographic and clinical factors (age, number of previous pregnancies, abortions and
      deliveries) predict outcome of medical treatment for early pregnancy failure. Our hypothesis
      was that gestational sac volume predicts outcome of medical treatment for early pregnancy
      failure.
