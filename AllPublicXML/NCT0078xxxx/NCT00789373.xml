  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare progression-free survival in patients with advanced non-squamous
      non-small cell lung cancer. Patients who do not progress following 4 cycles of induction
      treatment with pemetrexed and cisplatin will be randomized 2:1 to receive either maintenance
      pemetrexed or placebo.

    <time_frame>Date of randomization to the date of measured PD or date of death from any cause (up to 19.3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Investigator-assessed objective PFS was measured from the date of randomization to the first date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause. For patients not known to have died as of the data cutoff date and who did not have objective PD, PFS was censored at the date of last objective tumor assessment. PD was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. PD = 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions.</description>

    <time_frame>Date of randomization to first date of measured PD or date of death from any cause (up to 19.3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>To further evaluate the robustness of the PFS analysis, Lilly established an independent review of PFS to assess the potential for investigator bias in the determination of objective PD. PFS was measured from the date of randomization to the first date of objectively determined PD or death. For patients alive as of the data cutoff date and who did not have PD, PFS was censored at the date of the last objective tumor assessment. PD was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. PD = 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the EuroQol Instrument (EQ-5D) Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline randomization through 30-day post-discontinuation visit (up to 19.3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a generic instrument that describes health status in 5 attributes (mobility, self-care, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, usual activities) using a three level scale (no problem, some problems, and major problems). These combinations of attributes are converted into a weighted health-state Index Score according to the United Kingdom (UK) population-based algorithm. The possible values for the Index Score range from -0.59 (severe problems in all 5 dimensions) to 1.0 (no problem in any dimension).</description>

    <description>Analysis for combined phases was not performed since response was calculated separately for each phase of study.

Complete Response (CR)=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response(PR)is at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease(PD) is at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease(SD)=no change or small changes that do not meet the above criteria for CR, PR, or PD.</description>

        <title>Investigator-assessed Objective Progression-free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>Investigator-assessed objective PFS was measured from the date of randomization to the first date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause. For patients not known to have died as of the data cutoff date and who did not have objective PD, PFS was censored at the date of last objective tumor assessment. PD was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. PD = 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is a generic instrument that describes health status in 5 attributes (mobility, self-care, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, usual activities) using a three level scale (no problem, some problems, and major problems). These combinations of attributes are converted into a weighted health-state Index Score according to the United Kingdom (UK) population-based algorithm. The possible values for the Index Score range from -0.59 (severe problems in all 5 dimensions) to 1.0 (no problem in any dimension).</description>
