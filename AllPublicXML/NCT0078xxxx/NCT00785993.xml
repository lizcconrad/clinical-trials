  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Egg-banking would considerably simplify the logistics and means by which oocytes could be
      donated. These banks would make it easier to immediately provide oocytes that would be
      compatible to the recipient, shortening or even eliminating the problem of long waiting
      lists. Egg-banking would also allow the oocytes to be effectively quarantined, drastically
      diminishing the risk of transmission of infectious diseases in a fashion analogous to semen
      banks. The most essential prerequisite for a successful egg cryo-banking program is to have
      an efficient oocyte cryopreservation technology. Recent studies, including our own
      experience, have indicated that vitrified oocytes preserve intact their potential to
      fertilize and further develop into competent embryos, giving high clinical results as well as
      high survival rates. The aim of this study is to evaluate impact of the establishment of an
      egg-banking in our ovum donation program. Oocyte cryopreservation is carried out by Cryotop
      method. The study includes oocyte donation cycles conducted with fresh and vitrified oocytes.
      Recipients are allocated randomly into each group (&quot;fresh vs. vitrified cycles&quot;). Main
      outcome measures include survival, fertilization, embryo development and clinical outcome.
