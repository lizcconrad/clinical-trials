  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of propofol-based,
      gastroenterologist-administered sedation in severely obese patients (BMI≥35) undergoing upper
      endoscopy.

      The investigators aim to test the hypothesis that it is safe to use balanced-propofol,
      gastroenterologist-administered sedation in obese patients.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of propofol-based,
      gastroenterologist-administered sedation in severely obese patients (BMI≥35) undergoing upper
      endoscopy. We will use changes in pulmonary and hemodynamic parameters as the primary safety
      measure in this study. We will compare these results in 30 non-obese patients and in 30 obese
      patients.

      The term balanced propofol sedation refers to using a low dose of propofol in combination
      with small amounts of an opioid and midazolam.

             procedures of the study

          -  Adults between the ages of 18 and 85 inclusive (and of legal age to consent)

          -  ASA score of I, II, or III

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe acute illness that is not resolved or stabilized prior to enrollment. Study
             entry will be based on the investigator's judgment
