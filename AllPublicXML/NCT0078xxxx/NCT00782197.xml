      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PRGF infiltrations in the
      treatment of knee osteoarthritis.

    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown the positive effects of the autologous &quot;Preparation Rich in Growth
      Factors&quot; (PRGF) in different clinical situations involving connective tissues and also in OA
      synovial cells. PRGF is a biological delivery system of a complex mixture of bioactive
      proteins essential to natural repair including anabolic factors for cartilage such as
      transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and
      insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I). The potential of PRGF to enhance the limited capacity of
      cartilage to repair itself encouraged the idea of treating degenerative joint conditions with
      this autologous preparation.

      The present study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of the intra-articular
      injection of PRGF and to obtain useful information about the clinical effects. Since pain is
      the most pressing problem facing people with OA, a significant improvement in pain would
      indicate the potential of the proposed treatment. We will also evaluate functionality and
      quality of life. In addition we will examine changes in novel serum and synovial fluid
      biomarkers and their correlation with MRI-based parameters in a subgroup of patients.
