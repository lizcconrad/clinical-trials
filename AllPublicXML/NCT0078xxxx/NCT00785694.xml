      This is a randomised, comparative, multicentre study to determine if the early recurrence
      rate of intermediate-risk bladder cancer is similar in subjects treated with multiple
      instillations of mitomycin C after resection conducted under white light cystoscopy (group A)
      and subjects treated with 1 instillation of mitomycin C after resection conducted under white
      light and blue light cystoscopy (group B).
