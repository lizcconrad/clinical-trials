  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary efficacy objective of this study is to evaluate the difference in coefficient of
      fat absorption (CFA) of participants treated with high dose EUR-1008 (APT-1008) versus low
      dose of EUR-1008 (APT-1008) in the treatment of signs and symptoms of malabsorption in
      participants with EPI associated with CP. This study is sponsored by Aptalis Pharma (formerly
      Eurand).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After screening, eligible participants will start the placebo baseline ambulatory phase (4
      days). On day 5, they will be hospitalized for three to five days, to undergo a &quot;baseline&quot;
      72-hour CFA determination under a controlled diet and using a stool marker to indicate the
      beginning and end of the controlled diet period, while they continue receiving placebo
      treatment. At the end of the placebo baseline phase, participants will be randomized to a
      &quot;high dose followed by a low dose&quot; or to a &quot;low dose followed by a high dose&quot; EUR-1008
      (APT-1008) dose sequence and proceed to the first crossover (treatment) phase. Each crossover
      (treatment) phase will consist of a stabilization period for six days at home, followed by a
      hospitalization of three to five days to undergo a 72-hour CFA determination using a
      controlled diet and using a stool marker to indicate the beginning and end of the controlled
      diet period.

      Participants will immediately proceed from the first crossover (treatment) phase to the
      second without a washout period or return-to-baseline period in between phases. Participants
      will be stabilized at home for 6 days. Any residual lipase from the prior treatment phase is
      likely to be a negligible influence on the subsequent CFA determination because participants
      will be taking the new dose level (high or low) for six days before the beginning of sample
      collection for a new CFA. This interval is more than enough time for the CFA to be reflective
      of only the new dose.
