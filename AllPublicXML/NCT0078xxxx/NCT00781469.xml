  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease affecting approximately
      1% of the adult population. The disease is characterised by inflammation of synovial tissue
      (ST) in multiple joints, which often leads to destruction of joint integrity, contributing to
      serious functional impairment and disability. The contributors to its pathology include joint
      inflammation, abnormal cellular and humoral responses, and synovial hyperplasia.
      Ultrasonography is a powerful, non−invasive, and feasible way to evaluate synovial
      hyperplasia and guide its collection by biopsy.

      Although RA is a systemic disease, it is not clear whether the gene expression profile
      exhibited by circulated peripheral blood cells and that expressed by the inflamed synovium
      mirror one another. Understanding this relationship would be useful not only in potentially
      having a relatively non−invasive means to predict response to therapy but it might be useful
      in better understanding differences in RA expression amongst patients with this disease, thus
      perhaps assisting in target identification through a better understanding of disease
      processes.
