  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Fenzian™ treatment on symptoms
      (such as shortness of breath), lung function (how well the lungs work), and
      albuterol/salbutamol (rescue medication) use in people with asthma. This will be done by
      comparing the effects of Fenzian™ treatment to the effects of a sham treatment, which looks
      the same as the Fenzian™ device but doesn't do anything.

      The Fenzian™ device is an electrical instrument that the investigators hope will help reduce
      airway inflammation associated with asthma symptoms by stimulating the nerves with very low
      electrical currents. The study device will be applied directly to the skin on the back,
      working along the ribs toward the spine, alternating between left and right sides, and on
      your face.

      Note regarding the blinding of this study: the subject, investigators, and assessor are all
      blinded to which treatment arm (Fenzian or sham) the subject is assigned. However, the
      treatment coordinator, who administers the Fenzian (or sham) treatments, is unblinded.
      Therefore, the design of this study does not neatly fit into either the &quot;single blind&quot; or the
      &quot;double blind&quot; category. We would call this study design &quot;subject and observer blinded&quot;
      because no one involved in any assessment of study outcomes is unblinded. Unfortunately, the
      clinicaltrials.gov system for posting does not allow us to both indicate &quot;single blind&quot; AND
      check multiple masked roles. For this reason, this explanation should accompany any
      discussion of the blinding; subject, investigator, an assessor are all blinded (but cannot be
      checked).
