      The purpose of this study is to determine if IMC-18F1 is safe for patients, and also to
      determine the best dose of IMC-18F1 to give to patients.

      The purpose of this study will be to establish the safety profile and the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) of the anti-VEGFR-1 monoclonal antibody IMC-18F1 administered weekly, every other
      week, or every three weeks in patients with advanced solid tumors who have not responded to
      standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available.

    <description>Cohorts 1-4 will receive IMC-18F1 intravenously for 4 weekly infusions, followed by a 2-week observation period. Cohort 5 will receive IMC-18F1 intravenously every other week for the first 6 weeks of therapy. Cohort 6 will receive IMC-18F1 every 3 weeks for the first 6 weeks for therapy. The starting dose in Cohort 1 will be 2mg/kg. The maximum dose of IMC-18F1 will not exceed 16mg/kg administered every week, 15mg/kg administered every other week, and 20mg/kg administered every 3 weeks. Dose escalation of 100% (2 x previous dose) if no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed in the first three patients within a cohort during the initial 6-week therapy period. Dose escalation increment will be reduced to 50% (1.5 x previous dose) following the occurrence of either grade 2 or higher AEs in 2 or more patients that are possibly, probably, or definitely-related to study medication or one DLT during the initial 6-week therapy period. No intrapatient dose escalation is allowed.</description>

               -  a platelet count ≥100,000/mm3

          7. Adequate hepatic function, as defined by:

               -  a total bilirubin level ≤1.5 x the ULN

               -  aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels ≤2.5 x the ULN
                  or ≤5 x the ULN if known liver metastases
