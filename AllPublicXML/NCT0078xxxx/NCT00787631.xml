  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A high number of birch pollen-allergic individuals develop hypersensitivity reactions to
      certain foods, e.g. apples. This food allergy is due to immunological cross-reactivity. Birch
      pollen-related foods contain proteins, e.g. Mal d 1 in apple, that are structurally related
      with the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1. Hence IgE antibodies and T lymphocytes
      specific for Bet v 1 recognize these food proteins which results in activation of the immune
      system and, consequently, in clinical symptoms.

      In the present study the investigators intend to investigate if and how the consumption of
      birch pollen-related food allergens affects birch pollen allergy. In other words, the
      investigators are interested to analyse whether Bet v 1-related food allergens activate Bet v
      1-specific memory cells and thus, contribute to the maintenance of the pollen allergy outside
      the pollen season. Data obtained in this study will help to clarify the immunological and
      clinical role of cross-reactivity between pollen and food allergies and will reveal whether
      avoidance of such foods should be recommended for the patients. Finally, novel approaches for
      diagnosis and therapy of pollen-related food allergens can be developed.
