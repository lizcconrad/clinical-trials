      The study is designed as a Phase II, prospective, non randomized, open-label, single arm,
      multicenter trial, in which patients with locally advanced or metastatic ACC not amenable to
      complete surgical resection and progressing to cytotoxic chemotherapy will receive Sorafenib
      plus metronomic chemotherapy as treatment.The aim of this phase II trial is to evaluate the
      clinical benefit and toxicity of the combination of Sorafenib plus metronomic chemotherapy in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic ACC who progressed after first or second line
      chemotherapy.

      The study is designed as a Phase II, prospective, non randomized, open-label, single arm,
      multicenter trial, in which patients with locally advanced or metastatic ACC not amenable to
      complete surgical resection.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      The aim of this phase II trial is to evaluate the clinical benefit and toxicity of the
      combination of Sorafenib plus metronomic chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic ACC who progressed after first or second line chemotherapy.

      Primary objective

      To assess the clinical benefit as measured by a non progressing rate after 4 months of the
      combination of Sorafenib plus weekly Paclitaxel in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic ACC who progressed after first or second line chemotherapy.

      Secondary objectives

        -  Assessment of Objective (Complete and Partial) Response Rates

        -  Assessment of Duration of Response

        -  Assessment of Hormonal Response

        -  Assessment of Progression-Free Survival

        -  Assessment of Overall Survival

        -  Assessment of the relationship between specific &quot;biomarkers&quot; and cancer- and
           treatment-related outcomes

        -  Assessment of Quality of Life by EORTC QLQ-C30

        -  Assessment of Toxicity

      ENDPOINTS

      The first disease assessment will be performed after 8-weeks, subsequent assessments will be
      performed every 12 weeks until end of the study.

      Primary endpoint

        -  Progression-Free Survival rate ≥ 40% after 4 months

      Secondary endpoints

        -  Response rate evaluation will be performed according to the RECIST criteria. The same
           methods of measurement and the same technique should be used to characterize each
           identified and reported lesion at baseline and during study.

      TREATMENT SCHEME Treatment scheme consisted of oral Sorafenib 400 mg p.o. bid plus
      intravenous Paclitaxel 60 mg/mq/weekly i.v., until disease progression.
