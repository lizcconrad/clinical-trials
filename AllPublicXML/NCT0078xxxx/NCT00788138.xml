    <textblock>
      Vitamin D insufficiency is common in patients with cystic fibrosis. The investigators study
      will examine a large dose of vitamin D given to patients who have cystic fibrosis and are
      admitted to the hospital for a pulmonary exacerbation to determine whether vitamin D can
      improve clinical outcomes and whether the dose given is correct. The investigators hypothesis
      is that vitamin D therapy will improve production of anti-microbial peptides and will
      increase bacterial killing of microorganisms.

      Vitamin D insufficiency is common in CF patients. Treatment of vitamin D insufficiency in CF
      patients requires large doses of vitamin D. Adequate vitamin D status in CF is important for
      skeletal health and the prevention of osteoporosis. In addition to skeletal benefits of
      vitamin D, recent evidence has demonstrated that vitamin D plays an important role in the
      regulation of the immune system by increasing anti-microbial peptides in the lung and other
      barrier sites. Whether improving vitamin D status in CF patients would enhance the immune
      system has not yet been explored in a clinical study. This would have significant clinical
      impact in CF care since vitamin D status remains undertreated, especially in the setting of
      infection. The hypothesis of this proposal is that rapid correction of vitamin D
      insufficiency will result in improved innate immunity by increasing production of
      anti-microbial peptides resulting in more effective killing of bacteria. To address our
      hypothesis, the following two aims are proposed: 1) To evaluate the effect of rapid
      correction of vitamin D insufficiency as an adjunctive therapy on production of
      anti-microbial peptides in acute respiratory exacerbation in CF patients 2) To determine the
      effect of vitamin D treatment on bacterial killing in acute respiratory exacerbation in CF
      patients and to correlate with free LL-37 levels in sputum. The long term objective of this
      proposal and of our research group is to study the role of nutrition including vitamin D to
      improve the immune system in the setting of infection in CF.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Eligibility Criteria

          -  Study subjects must be patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and seen at the Emory
             University Cystic Fibrosis Center who are admitted to Emory University Hospital for an
             acute pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis as determined by their primary cystic
             fibrosis physician or emergency room physician.

          -  Study subjects must agree to participate in the study and provide written informed
             consent.

          -  Histology: Not applicable.

          -  Site: Emory University Hospital.

          -  Stage of Disease: Admission to Emory University Hospital for an acute pulmonary
             exacerbation of cystic fibrosis as determined by their primary CF physician based on
             symptoms and clinical evaluation.
