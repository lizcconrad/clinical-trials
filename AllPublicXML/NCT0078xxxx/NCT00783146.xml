    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study that used both an
      active control (fexofenadine) and a placebo control to evaluate desloratadine 5 mg once daily
      during a 15-day treatment period. The active treatments and placebo were allocated in a 2:2:1
      ratio.

             allergic rhinitis occurring during the same season(s) as the current study;

          -  have been skin test positive (skin prick test with a wheal diameter at least 3 mm
             larger than the diluent control or intradermal testing with a wheal diameter at least
             7 mm larger than the diluent control) at Screening, or within 12 months prior to the
             Screening Visit, to an appropriate seasonal allergen, which could include seasonal
             molds, prevalent in the geographical area of the study site during the study period;

          -  if female and of childbearing potential (including women who were less than 1 year
             postmenopausal and women who became sexually active during the study), have been using

             prescribed IUD, condom in combination with spermicide) or be surgically sterilized
             (eg, hysterectomy or tubal ligation);

          -  if female and of childbearing potential, have had a negative urine pregnancy test at
             Baseline;

             interfere with study evaluations;

          -  have understood and been able to adhere to the dosing and visit schedules, and agreed
             to record symptom severity scores, medication times, concomitant medications, and
             adverse events accurately and consistently in a daily diary;

          -  have met the following at the Screening Visit: total symptom score (TSS) of 6 or
             greater (not including congestion), with 2 or more symptoms rated as moderate (2) or
             severe (3) and no symptom rated as very severe (4) during the 12 hours prior to this
             visit;

          -  have met the following on the morning of the Baseline Visit: symptom severity score 7
             AM instantaneous TSS of 6 or more (not including congestion), with 2 or more symptoms
             rated as moderate (2) or severe (3), and no symptom rated as very severe (4).

             given to conditions that would interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism
             or excretion of the study drug, or with the subject's ability to complete the diary
             cards;

          -  had any clinically significant deviation from normal in the physical examination that,

             the Screening Visit;

          -  had nasal structural abnormalities, including nasal polyps easily visible on physical
