      Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is the most prevalent genetic disease of haemoglobin.The underlying
      abnormality in the red blood cell (RBC) of SCD is the presence of abnormal sickle cell
      hemoglobin (HbS), which, when deoxygenated, becomes relatively insoluble, forms aggregates
      with other hemoglobin molecules within the RBC and causes rigid deformation of the cell.
      Acute pain vaso-occlusive crisis, strokes and acute chest syndrome are the main acute
      complications, sometimes life-threatening, often leading to organic and functional squeal.
      Although the common SS form of SCD is a unique gene disorder, the range of the clinical
      severity is remarkably wide and striking, suggesting that clinical polymorphism is due to
      modifier genes and environmental factors.Most of the research efforts have been focused on
      the biology of haemoglobin and of the red cells. Meanwhile, the complex pathophysiology of
      SCD is undoubtedly influenced by the many physiologic functions of the vascular wall. In line
      with this hypothesis are several reports of increased circulating levels of
      endothelium-derived surface molecules in SCD patients suggesting marked endothelial stress in
      SCD. Similarly, other processes that involve the endothelium, such as leukocyte adhesion and
      activation, may play a role in vascular occlusion. This accumulation of data raises the
      unanswered question of the mechanisms of endothelium maintenance and regeneration in SCD.
      Through these mechanisms, it is likely that function or dysfunction of the vascular
      endothelium contributes to the overall vascular pathobiology of this disease, which includes
      recurrent vaso-occlusions, stroke, leg ulcers, chronic organ ischemic damages, and
      neovascularizing retinopathy that affect nearly one-half (48%) of the surviving patients by
      the fifth decade.Thus, our groups have combined their respective clinical and biological
      expertises to test the hypothesis that SCD is a condition of specific endothelial stress and
      dysfunction upon chronic and Paracystic abnormal interactions with circulating cells and
      abnormal oxygen delivery to tissues. Specifically, we hypothesize that chronic endothelial
      stress with detachment of activated endothelial cells require increases mobilisation of the
      Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs) that maintain endothelial homeostasis to avoid major
      thromboembolic events and vasospasm. Inappropriate mobilisation or maturation of the EPCs in
      SCD may participate to the severity of the disease.

      In the bone marrow, a reservoir of EPCs does exist, which can be mobilized into circulation
      when needed, for example during ischemia, a situation which may occur in sickle cells
      disease. These cells are able to reach distant targets and to participate to the
      neovascularisation processes necessary for tissue and vascular healing. Conversely,
      abnormalities of the maturation, mobilization or homing processes would contribute to the
      thrombotic and ischemic risks associated to ischemia. Furthermore, vascular stress such that
      encountered in SCD leads to the detachment of endothelial cells from the vessels. The number
      of detached mature circulating endothelial cells (CEC) seems to be related to vascular
      hurting. The balance between EPCs and CECs would thus be informative of the vascular
      condition in patients during the progression of the disease. A relatively high level of EPCs
      would indicate a prominence of a healing neoangiogenesis or vasculogenesis process, while
      increasing levels of CECs would be indicative severe progression of the disease. Our studies
      and those published by others indicate that the number of EPCs in peripheral blood is tightly
      regulated. Indeed, mediators of inflammation could participate to EPC mobilization and to
      their recruitment to the diseased areas by local activation of the vascular endothelium. In
      this context, sickle cells disease provokes transient occlusion episodes, leading to a
      situation of chronic ischemia in different organs, sometimes with acute episodes. This
      suggests defect of the maintenance of the vascular integrity in these target organs.Within
      this project, we will compare the number of EPCs and CECs in 25 SCD patients and 25 normal
      individuals in search of a correlation with the severity of the disease. SCD patients with
      potential confounding factors that may alter endothelial physiology (drugs, blood
      transfusions, hydroxyurea therapy) are excluded. In addition, we will analyse and compare in
      culture and in vivo the phenotypic and functional characteristics of EPCs obtained from
      patients and controls. We have a working bilateral hypothesis, since we do not know whether
      SCD subjects have appropriate angiogenic balance (high EPCs/CEC ratio with functional EPCs)
      to face the situation of endothelial activation and tissue hypoxia induced by SCD. Therefore,
      we will quantitatively and qualitatively study several distinct biological steps:1. Evaluate
      the number of colonies generated by the EPCs in culture and their kinetics of appearance in
      patients (major end point)2. Enumerate EPCs and CECs by flow cytometry using a specific set
      of markers (CD133, CD146, KDR).3. Measure of the plasma concentrations of PlGF, VEGF, EPO,
      ET-1, modulators of angiogenesis.4. Test of correlations between these respective
      characteristics of EPCs with clinical vascular abnormalities of the disease (retinopathy
      assessed by angiography, nephropathy, leg ulcers) and severity of vaso-occlusive crisis
      assessed by number and length of hospitalizations during the previous year and during the
      study.
