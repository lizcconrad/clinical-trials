  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a new way to measure the oxygen level in the mixed
      venous blood system (the system that carries blood collected from all over the body to the
      heart), which is a very important monitoring tool for the overall oxygen delivery to all our
      tissues. This new way measures the oxygen level in the mixed venous blood from outside the
      body, instead of measuring from the inside through a catheter (a thin, flexible plastic tube)
      that is placed by breaking the skin.

    <description>Four sensors of the 'Cerebral/Somatic Tissue Oximeter' device will be placed on subject's both sides of the forehead, palm and calf area. Simultaneously, blood samples will be drawn from the pulmonary artery catheter and arterial line for blood gas analyses. The values obtained from the device measurements will be used in a new equation to calculate the mixed venous oxygen saturation. The calculated value will be compared to the real value from the blood gas analysis for accuracy.</description>
