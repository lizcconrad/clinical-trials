  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare two post operative drop regimens for the
      management of dry eye and control of healing using FDA-approved ophthalmic solutions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This comparison will be made between bilateral eyes of the same patient following excimer
      laser ablation using the FDA-approved LADARVision 4000 Excimer Laser System or the WaveLight
      ALLEGRETTO WAVEâ„¢ Excimer Laser System. Post operative questionnaires regarding the use of the
      drops will be compared. Tear osmolarity and tear breakup time will be evaluated using Tear
      Lab and OQAS II.

          -  Subjects must have a stable refraction as documented by previous clinical records.

          -  Subjects who wear soft contact lenses must discontinue wear at least 3 days prior to
             preoperative exam or surgery.

          -  Subjects who wear gas permeable contact lenses must discontinue wear at least 3 weeks
             prior to preoperative exam or surgery.

          -  Subjects must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to return for scheduled follow up examinations each
             day after surgery at the specified time.

          -  Subjects must sign and be given a copy of the written Informed Consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects for whom either eyes do not meet all inclusion criteria and either eye meets
             any exclusion criteria.

          -  Subjects with clinically significant dry eye syndrome or clinically significant
             blepharitis in either eye.

          -  Subjects with clinically significant anterior segment pathology, including clinically
             significant cataracts, corneal scarring or neovascularization in either eye.

          -  Subjects who have undergone previous intraocular or corneal surgery of any kind,
             including any type of surgery for either refractive or therapeutic purposes in either
             eye.

          -  Subjects who have a history of Herpes zoster or Herpes simplex keratitis.

          -  Subjects on chronic systemic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy that
             may affect wound healing, any immunocompromised subjects, and subjects with clinically
             significant atopic disease, connective tissue disease, or uncontrolled diabetes.

          -  Subjects with a history of steroid-responsive rise in intraocular pressure, glaucoma,
             or preoperative IOP&gt;25 mm Hg in either eye.

          -  Subjects with macular pathology in either eye.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant, lactating, or planning to be pregnant during the course of

             the time of this clinical investigation.

          -  Use of ocular drugs, other than study medications, during the study and within 30 days
             prior to study entry or any other ocular medication.
