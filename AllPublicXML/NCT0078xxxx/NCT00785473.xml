  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck decreases with
      increasing physical handicap (EDSS-score) in MS patients. Possible explanations are less
      weightbearing exercise or less UV-exposure resulting in reduced vitamin D generation in the
      skin. Prevention of osteoporosis is a high priority, because treatment of the established
      disease remains sub-optimal.

      We have designed a double-blind randomised controlled trial of two years' duration including
      90-100 persons with MS age 18-50 to assess whether supplementation with vitamin D, given as a
      weekly dose of 20,000 IU cholecalciferol, can prevent bone loss.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine changes in BMD over the 2 year study
      period comparing treatment and placebo groups.

      The most important secondary objective is to determine cytokine profiles in blood samples. We
      will also assess parameters related to vitamin D status and physical performance.
