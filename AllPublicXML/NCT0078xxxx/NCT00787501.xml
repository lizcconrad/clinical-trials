  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goals are 1) to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to predict which
      depressed individuals will respond to different validated treatments for unipolar depression
      including Cognitive Therapy (CT) and antidepressant medications (selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors; SSRIs) and 2) to understand whether CT and SSRIs affect similar aspects of brain
      function underlying cognition and emotion. Thus, we will examine depressed adults ages 18-55
      using fMRI during cognitive and emotional information processing tasks, before and after
      treatment with an SSRI (n=25) or CT (n=40). We hypothesize that: 1) Recovery will occur in
      treatment with an SSRI primarily for individuals with increased reactivity in limbic brain
      regions associated with emotion generation and prefrontal regions associated with
      regulation,. 2) Recovery with CT will occur for patients with increased activity in brain
      regions associated with emotion generation but decreased activity in prefrontal regions
      associated with emotion regulation. 3) Recovery with an SSRI will yield similar changes in
      brain function to CT in brain regions associated with emotion generation but less change in
      brain regions responsible for emotion regulation such as the prefrontal cortex. Findings from
      this study may have a profound impact on reducing the burden of clinical depression by
      providing evidenced-based diagnostic and treatment guidelines.

    <description>SSRI: 25 patients will receive 14 weeks of an FDA approved selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), administered under the supervision of a staff psychiatrist. After an initial 30-45 minute session patients will be seen for 15-30 minute sessions for 16-20 sessions over 14 weeks. Medication will begin with 10mg escitalopram daily (or its equivalent), increased to 30 mg/day (or its equivalent) by week 6 if pt has not achieved a minimum level of response (i.e., CGI &lt; 2) and tolerability is adequate. Nonresponse at week 10 (CGI &lt; 2) will be cause for medication switch or augmentation.</description>

    <description>Cognitive Behavior Therapy: 40 patients will receive 16- 20 60 minute sessions of procedurally determined Cognitive Therapy (Beck, 1979) over 14 weeks. Patients will begin with 2 sessions per week which may be reduced to once per week in the latter part of the study period if the patient is responding to the therapy. Cognitive Therapy is designed to teach skills that help to reduce depressive severity. Each session will be videotaped and will include homework to be completed and brought to the following session.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV criteria for major depressive disorder (one
             or more lifetime episodes, separated by at least two months of a return to normal
             functioning, in a current episode).

          2. Male or female outpatients between the ages of 18 and 55 at time of enrollment.

          3. Females only must be surgically sterile, post-menopausal for at least one year, or not
             pregnant and using a method of birth control that is acceptable to the investigator.

          4. Have a total score of 14 or more on the first 17-items of the Hamilton Rating Scale
             for Depression at both the initial and secondary interviews.

          5. Be in reasonably good health. Patients with hypothyroidism, diabetes, high blood
             pressure, chronic respiratory, or other medical conditions may be considered
             candidates for study enrollment at the discretion of the investigator if their
             conditions are stable, they have been receiving standard therapies for the treatment
             of the condition, the prescribed dose and regiment of medication has been stable for
             at least 3 months, and all appropriate clinical and lab parameters are within normal
             limits for the condition that are clinically acceptable to the investigator

          6. Be free of prescription psychotropic medications for two weeks (four weeks for
             fluoxetine) before study entry.

          7. Provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Being unable to complete questionnaires written in English, representing an active
             suicide risk (see below), active alcohol or drug dependence, having any eye problems
             or difficulties in corrected vision, having a North American Adult Reading Test
             (NAART) equivalent Full Scale Intelligence Quotient &lt; 85.

          2. Pregnant women and those planning to become pregnant during the first 11 months after
             intake will also be excluded from the study. Pregnancy will be determined by
             self-report at the interview and by a pregnancy test at the time of the Magnetic
             Resonance Imaging scan. There will be no cost to the participant for the pregnancy
             test.

          3. People who have metallic foreign objects in their body, such as aneurysm clips or
             pacemakers, as well as individuals prone to panicking in enclosed spaces will be
             excluded from the study. Subjects with a questionable history of metallic fragments
             will also be excluded.

          4. Participants who are taking psychotropic medications, particularly antidepressant
             medications within two weeks of study entry (4 weeks for fluoxetine) will be excluded.

          5. Participants will not be excluded on the basis of herbs, supplements, and other
             prescription or over the counter drugs other than those noted. HIV serostatus will not
             be evaluated for the research study.

          6. At the initial screening visit, if girth seems to present a potential issue for the
             MRI, than width of participant will be assessed using a hula-hoop that is
             approximately the same diameter as the MRI scanner. If subject exceeds the width of
             the hula-hoop, then they will be excluded from the study.
