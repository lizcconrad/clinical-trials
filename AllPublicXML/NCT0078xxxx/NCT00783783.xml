  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Risperidone is an important medication used to treat children with psychiatric illnesses or
      neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism. Despite excellent symptom control, the
      potential for side effects is worrisome. Treating these disorders is difficult because not
      everyone responds the same way to the same risperidone dose. One reason for this is genetic
      differences in how people break down the drug. Understanding these differences will help
      clinicians choose a dose and better predict the response so patients will be treated
      successfully with a lower risk for side effects. This study will research these genetic
      differences in children with psychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorders. Hypothesis: The
      inter-patient variability in risperidone pharmacokinetics and exposure, adverse events, and
      clinical response in patients with psychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorders is associated
      with identifiable pharmacogenetic factors, such as CYP2D6 single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs).

        Subjects will include up to 41 risperidone-treated children and adolescents with
        psychiatric or neurodevelopmental (ND) disorders who participated in one of two previous
        risperidone pharmacokinetics investigations.

        To have a larger sample of poor metabolizer subjects, we plan to enroll at least 8
        additional subjects who are on stable treatment with risperidone, and perform risperidone
        pharmacokinetics analyses. Prospectively enrolled subjects (n = 8) will be CYP2D6 poor
        metabolizers and will include White / Caucasian subjects, of any socioeconomic status, and
        will be recruited from inpatients or outpatients at Cincinnati Children's Hospital
