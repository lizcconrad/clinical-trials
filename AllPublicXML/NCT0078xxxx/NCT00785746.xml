  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is to estimate, for a frail elderly population, the extent
      to which balance improves following a Core-Strength training program in comparison to a
      Stretch &amp; Strength program. A secondary objective is to explore the impact of core strength
      training on urinary incontinence.

    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to one of the two exercise groups, Core-Strength training
      group or the Stretch &amp; Strength group. The exercises will consist of 15-20 minute session for
      every day they attend the GDH. Measures will be made at admission, after 6 weeks of the
      program and at discharge if more than past 6 weeks.

    <description>This program consists of general stretching exercises and peripheral muscle strengthening exercises with a special emphasis on strengthening the upper extremity muscles because of their importance for ADL but not necessarily balance.</description>

    <description>We have devised a series of core strength training exercises that can be easily and safely performed under the supervision of trained staff. The exercises will be individualized depending on the participants' ability and health conditions. The majority, but not all, of exercises will be performed on or with exercise balls of different sizes and shapes, round for more advanced persons and oval for more frail persons.</description>
