      The purpose of this study is to determine if IMC-A12 is safe for patients, and also to
      determine the best dose of IMC-A12 to give to patients.

      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      of the anti-IGF-IR monoclonal antibody IMC-A12 administered weekly in patients with advanced
      solid tumors who no longer respond to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is
      available

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histopathologically-documented, measurable, advanced primary or recurrent solid tumors
             who no longer respond to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is
             available.

          -  Able to provide written informed consent

          -  Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months

          -  Adequate hematologic functions, as defined by: ANC ≥ 1500mm3, hemoglobin level ≥ 10
             gm/dL, platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3

          -  Adequate hepatic function, as defined by: total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 x the ULN, AST
             and ALT levels ≤ 2.5 x the ULN or ≤ 5 x the ULN if known liver metastases

          -  Adequate renal function, as defined by a serum creatinine level ≤ 1.5 x the ULN

          -  Ejection fraction within the normal institutional limits

          -  Use of effective contraception per institutional standard, if procreative potential
             exists

          -  At least 28 days must have elapsed from major surgery, prior chemotherapy, prior
             treatment with an investigational agent or device, prior radiation therapy (palliative
             radiation therapy is allowed), an open biopsy, or a significant traumatic injury to
             allow for adequate recovery. Ongoing side effects due to these agents must be ≤ grade
             2 prior to entering the study.

          -  At least 6 weeks must have elapsed from nitrosoureas, mitomycin C, or monoclonal
             antibody (not targeting the IGFR) therapy to allow for adequate recovery. Ongoing side
             effects due to these agents must be ≤ grade 2 prior to entering the study.

          -  Accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients enrolled in this trial must be
             treated at the participating center.

             unstable angina pectoris, angioplasty, stenting or myocardial infarction within 6
             months, uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia,
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would compromise patient safety or limit
             compliance with study requirements, patients with symptomatic brain metastases

          -  Serious or nonhealing active wound, ulcer or bone fracture

          -  Know HIV-positive

          -  History of hemorrhagic or thrombotic disorder within 9 months

          -  Proteinuria ≥ 1+ by routine urinalysis (patients with a protein value of ≤ 500mg
             confirmed by a 24-hour urine collection are eligible)

          -  Pregnant (confirmed by serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin [βHCG]) or breast
             feeding

          -  History of prior treatment with other agents specifically targeting IGFRs

          -  Known diabetes

          -  Inability or unwillingness to interrupt steroidal or hormonal therapy for the duration
             of treatment with IMC-A12

          -  Positive anti-IMC-A12 antibody response

          -  History of allergic reactions to monoclonal antibodies or other therapeutic proteins

          -  Employees of the investigator or study center with direct involvement in this study or
             other studies under the direction of the investigator or study center, as well as
