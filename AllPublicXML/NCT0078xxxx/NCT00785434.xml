    <textblock>
      This will be an open label study of escitalopram. Patients not responsive to citalopram will
      be switched directly to escitalopram.

      Patients will receive escalating doses of escitalopram up to a maximum of 50 mg until they
      either achieve remission (MADRS &lt;9) or fail to tolerate the dose.

      Patients will receive escalating doses of escitalopram up to a maximum of 50 mg until they
      either achieve remission (MADRS &lt;9) or fail to tolerate the dose.

      Visit 1 - (Initial visit) - escitalopram 10 mg Visit 2 - (Week 2) - escitalopram 20 mg Visit
      3 - (Week 4) - review visit Visit 4 - (Week 6) - MADRS &lt;12 - continue 20 mg MADRS &gt;12 -
      escitalopram 30 mg Visit 5 - (Week 8) - MADRS &lt;8 - continue current dose MADRS &gt;8 - escalate
      dose (20 mg to 30 mg or 30 mg to 35mg)

      Thereafter, Patients who have achieved remission will be maintained on the remission dosage
      and reviewed at four weekly intervals. At any subsequent visit where the MADRS is &gt;8 they
      will have a dosage increase

      Patients who have not achieved remission will have dosage escalated by 5 mg at two weekly
      intervals until remission, a maximum dose of 50 mg is achieved or the dosage is intolerable
      when they will be reduced to the previous tolerable dose.

      Patients will be followed up until eight months from their initial visit.
