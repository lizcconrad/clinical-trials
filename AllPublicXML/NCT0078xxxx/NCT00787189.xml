  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to determine the effectiveness of low level laser light
      therapy when applied around the head and ears in improving unaided word recognition in ears
      with sensorineural hearing loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sensorineural hearing loss accounts for about 90% of all hearing loss and is found in 23% of
      individuals older than 65 years. Sensorineural hearing loss occurs when the hair cells of the
      inner ear and the neural pathways to the auditory cortex are damaged. In most cases,
      sensorineural hearing loss cannot be improved, reversed or 'cured.' Current treatment options
      focus on methods that amplify external sounds and on teaching the patient various strategies
      to 'retrain' the brain to interpret external stimuli. Low Level Laser Therapy was first
      applied for the treatment of inner ear diseases by Uwe Witt, MD of Hamburg, Germany in the
      1980's. Hearing impaired patients have inflammation and/or atrophy of the tissues and neural
      pathways connected to and supporting the cochlea's cilia hair structure, the hearing
      mechanism of the inner ear. Low level laser therapy is believed to stimulate the mitochondria
      of the adipocyte cells, which subsequently increases the production of ATP. The resultant
      surge in ATP production works to repair damaged tissue and regenerate cells reversing some of
      the damage incurred to the cochlea and thus improving aspects of hearing function.

    <description>Participants were asked to repeat 50 words presented one at a time through headphones to each ear separately at a comfortable listening level to the participant. The 50 words were from a phonetically-balanced list of monosyllabic words called the CID W-22 lists. The percent of total words repeated correctly for each ear was recorded and the change in this percent from baseline to one week after study treatment was referenced against a chart. If the change was equal to or greater than the corresponding value in the chart, the participant was considered to have a successful study outcome.</description>
