      RATIONALE: Radioactive drugs, such as radioactive iodine, may carry radiation directly to
      tumor cells and not harm normal cells. Placing a gene called Ad5CMV-NIS in prostate cancer
      cells may help the prostate cells take in more radioactive iodine and thus kill the cancer
      cells. Drugs, such as liothyronine sodium, may protect the thyroid from the side effects of
      radioactive iodine.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gene therapy given
      together with radioactive iodine in treating patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer
      that did not respond to external-beam radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Ad5CMV-NIS administered intraprostatically
           followed by radioiodine treatment in patients with locally recurrent adenocarcinoma of
           the prostate following external beam radiotherapy.

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of Ad5CMV-NIS in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the PSA response rates, duration, and time to PSA progression in these
           patients.

        -  To evaluate the immune response to Ad5CMV-NIS.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Ad5CMV-NIS.

      Patients receive intraprostate Ad5CMV-NIS, via transperineal injection under anesthesia, on
      day 1. They receive dosimetry oral iodine I 123 on day 4 and undergo image studies
      periodically for the next 24 hours for measurement of radioiodine uptake. Patients receive
      therapeutic oral iodine I 131 on day 5.

      All patients with intact thyroid glands (i.e., not previously surgically removed or ablated)
      receive TSH suppressive doses of oral liothyronine sodium 3 times daily for 10 days prior and
      for 15 days post administration of iodine I 123.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for measurement of PSA, fT4, and TSH; and peripheral
      blood cells are monitored for evidence of virus DNA via quantitative
      reverse-transcriptase-PCR.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4
      months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 8 years. A transrectal tumor biopsy is to be
      performed at 3 months and 1 year post-treatment.
