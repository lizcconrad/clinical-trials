               -  Surgical margins involved with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) will not

             be considered as a positive margin; therefore, such patients will be eligible for this
             study without additional resection.

               -  Patients must have completed axillary lymph node sampling for the pathologic
                  evaluation of axillary lymph nodes as specified below:

             elevation due to Gilbert's disease or a similar syndrome involving slow

             conjugation of bilirubin).

      <recruitment_details>The trial was designed to evaluate if doxorubicin+cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by ixabepilone was more effective than AC followed by standard weekly paclitaxel as adjuvant treatment for patients with operable triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Between Dec 2008 and Jan 2011, 614 women with early-stage TNBC were enrolled from 63 U.S. sites.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either of 2 arms: 306 to AC/Ixabepilone (Ixa); 308 to AC/paclitaxel (Pac). 489 patients completed all planned treatment with AC/Ixa or AC/Pac.</pre_assignment_details>
