    <textblock>
      This study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy profile, in two different dose regimens
      of Edoxaban (DU-176b), (an investigational new drug being tested for the prevention of
      stroke/systemic embolic events (SEE)), in individuals with atrial fibrillation. Patients will
      be randomized to one of three treatment groups: High Dose Regimen, Low Dose Regimen, &amp;
      Warfarin. The expected duration of the study is 24 months.
