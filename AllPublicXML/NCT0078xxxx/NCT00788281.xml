  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgery has been widely accepted for its minimal invasion and safety. However,
      whether it has the same survival benefit as the traditional open surgery in Chinese
      population is still unknown. So we designed this study to evaluate the 3 year disease free
      survival rate in the laparoscopic group versus the open surgery group.
