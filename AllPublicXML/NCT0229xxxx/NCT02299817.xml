      The main objective is to study the efficacy of denosumab in reducing wear-induced osteolysis
      around uncemented acetabular implants used in total hip arthroplasty. Patients included in
      the study will receive the same dose of 60 mg denosumab or placebo (1 ml solution) for a
      total of 6 doses with start on day one and every 6 months with last treatment at 30 months.
      The primary endpoint will be the change in volume of the osteolytic lesion over 3 years
      measured (measured with 3D-CT in cm³).

    <description>Prolia is used to treat osteoporosis (a disease that makes bones fragile) in women who have been through the menopause and in men who have an increased risk of fracture (broken bones). In women who have been through the menopause Prolia reduces the risk of fractures in the spine and elsewhere in the body, including in the hip.
Prolia is also used to treat bone loss in men receiving treatment for prostate cancer that increases their risk of fracture. Prolia reduces the risk of fractures in the spine.
Recently denosumab was found to be effective in preventing osteoporosis related fractures in post-menopausal women by blocking RANKL and thereby inhibiting the development and activity of osteoclast.</description>

             consent prior to any study specific procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:
