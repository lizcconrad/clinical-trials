    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1 study is to determine if AMG 211 given as a continous IV infusion
      is safe and tolerable in adult subjects that have advanced gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma.
      The study will be conducted in multiple sites and test increasing doses of AMG 211. The
      safety of subjects will be monitored by intensive assessment of vital signs,
      electrocardiograms, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. Efficacy will be assessed by
      the usual imaging procedures and their interpretation.
