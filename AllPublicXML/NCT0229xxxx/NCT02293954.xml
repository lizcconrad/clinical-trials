      This pilot clinical trial studies copper Cu 64 anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monoclonal
      antibody M5A positron emission tomography (PET) in diagnosing patients with CEA positive
      cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as copper Cu 64 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A PET, may
      help find and diagnose CEA positive cancer that may not be detected by standard diagnostic
      methods.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the ability of 64Cu labeled M5A antibody (copper Cu 64 anti-CEA monoclonal
      antibody M5A) to localize CEA positive cancers (such as gastrointestinal, lung, medullary
      thyroid and breast cancers), as determined by PET imaging.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the frequency of titer of the human anti-human antibody (HAHA) response to
      64Cu labeled M5A antibody.

      II. To determine the safety of administration of 64Cu labeled M5A antibody.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive copper Cu 64 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A intravenously (IV) on day 0
      and then undergo PET on day 1 and day 2.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 and 3 months.

    <time_frame>Up to day 2</time_frame>
    <description>For lesion analysis, the efficacy of each modality will be evaluated where a successful outcome will be defined as the ability of at least one known tumor identified by conventional imaging modalities to be imaged using the M5A antibody. Using the standard statistical formulas, the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, as well as the sensitivity and corresponding 95% confidence interval will be estimated using the method of Lee and Dubin or Rao and Scott, which accounts for the correlation between lesions within in same subject.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-dose, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, and 3-4 hours post start of infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be drawn at various time points to construct the blood activity curve. Urine data will also be included in our analyses to check the whole body clearance curves. A computer pharmacokinetic model containing 5 compartments including blood, liver, residual body, urine and feces will be used to analyze time activity data. Residence times for various organs will be calculated from this pharmacokinetic model and/or uptake data. Different residence times for different isotopes, e.g. 64Cu, will be calculated by adjusting for physical decay. These times are then substituted into the OLINDA program.</description>
