        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 40 years and &lt; 85

          -  BMI ≥ 25 and &lt; 35

          -  Patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at onset or treated only by diet

          -  HbA1c between 6.0 and 8.0% (based on the last measured and documented laboratory
             measurement of the previous 3 months)

          -  Usual consumption ≤ 3 fish per week

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  T2D treated with antidiabetic oral drugs and/or insulin

          -  Current or previous (within 3 months) intake of omega 3 suplements

          -  Known allergy or intolerance to fish or fish protein

          -  Diagnosis of active neoplasic disease

          -  Suffering from an acute illness which requires a recovery period higher than one week

          -  Currently chronic treatment with oral steroids or nonesteroidal anti-inflammatory for
             more than 5 days, at least 1 month before randomization

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding patients

          -  Serious acute vascular events (cardiac or cerebral) diagnosed previous 2 months before
             the randomization

          -  Current or previous (within 6 months) participation in another study

          -  Chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt;1,5 mg/dl)

          -  Any conditions that the investigator considers may render the patient unable to
             complete the study

        During the interventional study, based on current standards of T2D care, doctors will
        introduce anti-diabetic oral drugs or insulin into the patient's treatment, where they
        consider it to be necessary.
