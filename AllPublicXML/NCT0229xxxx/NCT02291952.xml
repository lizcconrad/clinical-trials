  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this application is to determine whether changing the timing of food intake
      prevents the adverse metabolic effects of circadian misalignment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shift work is associated with circadian misalignment and an increased risk for the
      development diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. This research will determine
      whether changing the feeding schedule can prevent metabolic alterations that can lead to the
      abovementioned disorders. This research will provide mechanistic insight and may provide a
      novel therapeutic approach against the increased risk for diabetes, obesity, and
      cardiovascular disease among shift workers.
