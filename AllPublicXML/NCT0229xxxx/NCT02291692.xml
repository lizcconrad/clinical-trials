      The investigators aimed to evaluate the effect of ultrasound guided thoracic paravertebral
      block with bupivacaine on both perioperative anesthetic agent consumption and postoperative
      analgesia in pediatric patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy for kidney stone.

      This study was performed after approval of Ethics Committee and parents written consent.
      Between the ages 1-5, planned percutaneous nephrolithotomy due to kidney stones 40 patients
      were enrolled in this study, and patients were randomly divided into two group. All patients
      were performed general anaesthesia. The Group I patients was given ultrasound guided thoracic
      paravertebral block with 0.5 ml/kg bupivacaine %0.5 after giving prone position and the Group
      II patients was given 15 mg/kg of paracetamol as postoperative analgesia. In the period of
      postoperative, if the FLACC &gt; 4; it was planned to dose 1 mg/kg of tramadol. Patients'
      hemodynamic parameters, oxygen saturation, sevoflurane concentration were recorded 10, 15, 30
      and 60 minutes intraoperatively. Patients' hemodynamic parameters, oxygen saturation, pain
      scores (FLACC), satisfaction of parents, the number of patients who additional analgesic
      requirements and side effects (nausea,vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia, respiration
      problems etc) were recorded in the postoperative period. Primary outcome measures was pain
      scores using FLACC scale.
