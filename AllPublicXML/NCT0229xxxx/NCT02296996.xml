  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with BRAF V600 mutant advanced melanoma benefit from treatment with a BRAF-inhibitor
      (e.g. dabrafenib, vemurafenib) and from combination of a BRAF- and MEK-inhibitor (e.g.
      dabrafenib and trametinib). Following initial tumor regression, progression is diagnosed in a
      majority of patients treated with BRAF-inhibitor mono-therapy within the first 12-months of
      therapy. Various molecular mechanisms that underlie the development of resistance to
      treatment with a BRAF-inhibitor have been reported. These mechanisms do not include secondary
      mutations in the BRAF-gene and therefore resistance to BRAF-inhibition could potentially be
      reversible when selective pressure by BRAF-inhibition is withheld for a sufficient period of
      time of melanoma progression. This clinical trial protocol addresses the potential renewed
      anti-tumor activity of combined BRAF- and MEK inhibition with the combination of dabrafenib
      and trametinib in patients with unresectable AJCC stage III or - IV BRAF V600 mutant melanoma
      who are documented with progression of disease at least 12 weeks following the last day of
      dosing of a BRAFinhibitor containing treatment regimen.
