  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is essential that serum 25(OH)D changes following surgery be clarified, and the
      mechanism(s) underpinning these changes be identified. As such, the overarching hypothesis of
      this study is that elective total hip arthroplasty reduces serum total 25(OH)D.

    <measure>Change in total 25(OH)D</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at the pre-operative visit on the day of surgery, post-operative visit (on average 1 to 2 days after surgery), and 6 weeks post-operative visit</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DBP (vitamin D binding protein) in serum and urine will be evaluated for 25(OH)D degradation after surgical intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Samples are collected at pre-operative visit on the day of surgery, post-operative (on average 1 to 2 days after surgery) and 6 weeks post-operative visits</time_frame>
    <description>We will evaluate if free 25(OH)D varies over the peri-operative time period. We will evaluate whether the total 25(OH)D change is related to reduced serum DBP and/or increased urinary DBP excretion. We will also correlate the change in free 25(OH)D with serum DBP changes.</description>

    <measure>Effects of hip arthroplasty on vitamin D metabolite levels in the blood.</measure>
    <time_frame>Samples are collected at pre-operative visit on the day of surgery, post-operative (on average 1 to 2 days after surgery) and 6 weeks post-operative visits</time_frame>
    <description>We will evaluate the acute and chronic effects of hip arthroplasty on vitamin D metabolites, vitamin D pathway constituents, inflammation, oxidative stress and metabolic markers in plasma using mass spectrometric proteomic and metabolomics analysis.</description>

        Adults age 50+ undergoing elective total hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis will be
        included. We will exclude individuals having these procedures for other conditions, e.g.,
        rheumatoid arthritis, avascular necrosis and those undergoing reoperation of a previous hip
        arthroplasty.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Elective total hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis

          -  Age 50+

          -  Able and willing to sign informed consent

          -  English speaking

          -  Willing to not alter vitamin D supplementation use for the duration of this study

          -  Willing to utilize sunscreen of SPF-15 or higher when sun exposure for more than 15
             minutes is expected

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Illnesses known to affect inflammatory marker status including, but not limited to,
             rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease

          -  Chronic diseases that could potentially affect DBP status, e.g., chronic kidney
             disease stage requiring dialysis, nephrotic syndrome and chronic hepatitis,

          -  Hip arthritis from causes other than osteoarthritis

          -  Treatment with medications with potential to affect vitamin D metabolism, (e.g.,
             phenytoin, phenobarbital, teriparatide or active vitamin D analogues) or to
             potentially interfere with 25(OH)D measurement by HPLC (atavaquone) within the
             preceding three months.

          -  Treatment with high dose vitamin D supplementation (50,000 IU weekly or more
             frequently) within the preceding three months. Note; subjects on a stable daily
             vitamin D dose will be allowed to participate

          -  Surgical procedure within the preceding six months

          -  Use of tanning beds or salons or unwillingness to utilize sunscreen during periods of
             sun exposure of 15 minutes or longer
