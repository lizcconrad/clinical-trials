      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the complete resolution of constipation in
      participants taking PEG 3350 compared to those taking PEG 4000, based on analysis of the
      number of bowel movements from self-reported bowel movement (BM) data. The complete
      resolution of constipation is defined as the elimination of straining or of hard/lumpy
      stools.
