  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective of study: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of infusional gemcitabine prior to
      HDM (high-dose melphalan) as HDCT (High Dose Chemotherapy) followed by autologous stem cell
      transplantation in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation is the current standard of
      care for patients with chemosensitive relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma and aggressive
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and is an established effective therapy for patients with relapsed
      follicular lymphoma. Disease relapse remains a major problem, occurring in 50% of these
      patients, particularly in patients with primary refractory disease or other high-risk
      features. The addition of gemcitabine to single-agent melphalan as a high-dose conditioning
      regimen presents a promising combination that may lead to improvements in EFS (Event free
      survival). If this trial gives encouraging results, it may lead to a phase III trial
      evaluating this treatment strategy.

      Drug exposure would be AUC (area under curve) and clinical factors would be things like
      obesity, renal function, disease characteristics.

      We would be looking at the safety outcomes - i.e. adverse events as a measure of safety and
      tolerability. The adverse events would be non-hematological toxicities (any) and whether or
      not it is related to AUC. AUC in relationship to PFS (progression free survival) is also
      important (we want to know if we need to adjust dose to improve PFS).

    <description>The goal is to improve overall 3-year PFS by 15% over what would be expected with standard conditioning regimens. Patients will be stratified into 3 groups according to disease: (a) relapsed/refractory Hodgkins's lymphoma, (b) relapsed/refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and (c) relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. Grade 3-4 non-hematological toxicity will be defined by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.</description>

    <description>Drug exposure would be AUC (area under curve) . Once the dose of gemcitabine has been established, all subsequent patients will receive a uniform HDCT (high dose chemotherapy) regimen. Patients will undergo blood draws for pharmacokinetic testing at the following time points relative to the end of melphalan infusion: 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 5 hours, 7-10 hours, and 18-23 hours. Samples will be processed at the local pharmacokinetics laboratory in Calgary</description>

Patients will be assigned a dose level using the continual reassessment method based on the toxicity data available at the time of their enrollment. The dosing will start at 1.5 g/m2 and will increase by 0.5 mg/m2 at each level to a maximum of 2.5 g/m2. Dose-limiting toxicity is defined as grade 3 mucositis or skin toxicity lasting more than 3 days before downgrading, or any grade 4 non-hematological toxicity.</description>
