      Respiratory viruses are known to be risk factors for asthma (e.g respiratory syncytial
      viruses, RSVs, and Human Rhinoviruses, HRVs, may induce bronchiolitis, and wheezing illnesses
      respectively). The common flu is also known to be a risk factor and the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that asthmatics receive the annual flu vaccine, as a
      high-risk group for related asthma exacerbations. The investigators will be evaluating the
      variation in individual responses over time after controlled immune activation following
      influenza vaccination of monozygotic twins, both discordant for asthma, and concordant
      non-asthmatic. The transition from initial healthy to immune-system activated physiological
      states post vaccination will provide unprecedented molecular (omics) data on the molecular
      dynamics of immune response to vaccination, and novel insight into the flu response. The
      investigators will infer novel networks and pathways and as well as the dynamics of genes and
      mechanisms involved in asthma, flu vaccination, and individual responses, and correlate them
      to evaluated personalized genetic risks in the same study. The investigators will be able to
      also contrast the vaccination response in asthmatic and non-asthmatic individuals, in a
      longitudinal approach which has never been performed before using multiple-omics that
      included an immunization response.

      Asthma pathogenesis and exacerbations have been associated to multiple risk factors,
      particularly respiratory viruses. In children respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs) may induce
      bronchiolitis, and Human Rhinoviruses (HRVs) also may induce wheezing illnesses. RSVs and
      HRVs are age dependent risk factors for asthma, with the influenza virus also considered a
      prominent risk factor in adults. The Center for Disease Control recommends influenza
      vaccination in asthmatics annually. Both HRV and RSV infections were detected in a pilot
      integrative personal omics investigation, and provided a unique temporal expression signature
      in the non-asthmatic subject, with the involvement of a common set of antigen and defense
      response genes, as well as immune related pathways. These observed patterns in addition to
      the results of the vaccination study will be used as a guide, to find differences in healthy
      versus asthmatic patients' pathway activations which will provide insights into the genes and
      mechanisms involved in asthma pathogenesis and immune response to influenza vaccination. The
      twin paradigm will allow us to control for multiple confounding factors and focus on the
      individual genetic and possible epigenetic variation. The investigators will be able to infer
      novel networks and pathways and get into the genes and mechanisms involved in asthma, flu
      vaccination, and individual responses, while evaluating personalized genetic risks compared
      to medical history in the same study.

      Our primary investigation involves integrative multi-omics monitoring of individual
      monozygotic twins, healthy or discordant for asthma, following their flu vaccination, over a
      period of two annual vaccination cycles. The investigators will be collecting blood samples
      from monozygotic twin volunteers, for multiple time-points post influenza vaccination. The
      measurements will be repeated the following year after a second vaccination. Genomic
      sequencing will be used to evaluate the volunteer's genomic risks based on variants with
      known disease association. Full transcriptome (via RNA-Sequencing), proteome and metabolome
      profiling (via mass spectrometry) will be performed per time-point, as well as cytokine
      profiling. This will allow the dynamic monitoring of thousands of molecular components and
      their responses to vaccination, capturing both the initial innate response reaction in
      addition to the adaptive response and return to baseline. The study involves following
      responses in blood and saliva components after influenza vaccination. Two annual vaccinations
      will be considered, one per year for 2 years, and at 8 time points samples will be collected.

      This study involves a simple blood draw, saliva collection, standard FDA-approved influenza
      vaccine administration and Spirometry.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Volunteers are eligible to participate in this study if both they and their twin sibling
        have agreed to participate. If after their enrollment in the study, one of the twin
        siblings decides to withdraw, then:

          1. If one sibling withdraws during Year 1, the other sibling will be allowed to continue
             their participation in the study and to complete the current study Year. However they
             will not be included in the randomly selected applicants that will continue
             participation in Year 2 of the study.

          2. If one sibling withdraws duringYear2, the other sibling will be able to conclude Year2
             study activities. -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Volunteer is under18.

          2. Presence of any medical conditions that the study investigators believe will affect
             participation in the study or its results.

          3. Presence of a mental incapacity and/or cognitive impairment that would prevent a
             subject from adequately understanding, or cooperating with, the study protocol.

          4. Volunteers with any severe allergies (life-threatening) or that have ever had a
             life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of flu vaccine, or have a known severe
             allergy to any part of this vaccine, will be advised not to participate.

          5. If a potential subject has ever had Guillain-Barré Syndrome (a severe paralyzing
             illness, also called GBS), they will be advised not to get the influenza vaccine and
             be excluded from this study.

               -  For female participants If they are already enrolled and become pregnant during
                  this study, the investigators will temporarily withdraw them from the study from
                  the day they become pregnant. If they would like to stay in the study, the
                  investigators may continue their participation after their delivery.

               -  If participants are not feeling well on the scheduled day of vaccination the
                  investigators will suggest that they postpone the vaccination until they feel
                  better. If they agree, the vaccination will be re-scheduled for a later date.
