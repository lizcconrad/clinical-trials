      Our aim is to assess the ability of scans to distinguish the organ of origin of pancreatic
      head malignant tumours and to predict the resectability based on the preoperative imaging. To
      achieve this, a retrospective review of the preoperative CT scans will be conducted for all
      patients with pancreatic head malignancy treated at the Peninsula Hepato-Pancreatico-Biliary
      (HPB) cancer unit between January 2006 till January 2014.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer arises from the glandular part of the pancreas and is the fifth most common
      cause for cancer related death in the UK. It. Ampullary carcinoma arises from the epithelium
      of the ampulla of Vater into which the common bile duct and pancreatic duct drain.
      Cholangiocarcinoma arises from the bile duct epithelium, and may occur within the
      intra-pancreatic portion of the distal common bile duct mimicking a pancreatic malignancy.
      Cancers arising from these origins often cause obstructive jaundice and are hard to
      distinguish. Surgery is indicated for the treatment of these types of malignant tumours, and
      the definitive final diagnosis is usually not known until the specimen is examined. This
      situation does not allow specific treatment to be given pre-operatively, so-called
      'neo-adjuvant therapy'. The rationale for this approach is that in a proportion of patients
      the tumour will be made smaller by this treatment, which may facilitate surgical resection.
