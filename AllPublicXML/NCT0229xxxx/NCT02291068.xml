  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Objectives of the current research is to evaluate whether psychological flexibility
      influences psychotherapy outcomes in patients with adjustment disorder and depression. If
      indeed this is the case, we would be able to identify risk factors for low adjustment- such
      as low psychological flexibility, and develop psychotherapy that would try to enhance this
      ability.

      Subjects will be recruited from the Psychiatric daycare center at the Tel-Aviv Souraski
      Medical Center, serving the broader Tel-Aviv municipal area. Referrals to the department will
      be screened for eligibility to participate in the study according to the study's inclusion
      and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria would be adjustment disorder as the referral
      cause, age ranging from 20 to 65 years old and Hebrew speaking. Patients with major
      depression, a psychotic disorder, alcohol or drug dependence will be excluded. All
      participants will sign a written informed consent. The diagnosis of adjustment disorder will
      be conﬁrmed by an open clinical interview followed by a Structured Clinical Interview for
      DSM-IV SCID-IV (Shalev et al. 1994; First et al. 1995).

      Before starting the psychotherapy treatment, the patients will fill a psychological
      flexibility questionnaire (PFQ) and well-being questionnaire (MHI), in order to evaluate
      their psychological flexibility and well-being baseline. At the end of the psychotherapy
      treatment, they will fill the questionnaires again. Also, their therapists will evaluate the
      patients' levels of adjustment disorder or depression before and after the therapy.

    <description>The Mental Health Inventory (MHI: Veit and Ware 1983), a self-report questionnaire which measures psychological distress and well-being, psychiatric symptoms, and clinician rating of illness severity, will be used to measure psychological distress and well-being in the past month.</description>

    <measure>Therapeutic Alliance will be measured by the The Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR) (Munder et al., 2010)</measure>
    <time_frame>end of the psychotherapy treatment- an expected average of 3 months after starting therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR) (Munder, Wilmers, Leonhart, Linster, &amp; Barth, 2010) is a measure of the therapeutic alliance that assesses three key aspects of the therapeutic alliance: (a) agreement on the tasks of therapy, (b) agreement on the goals of therapy and (c) development of an affective bond. It is a self-report questionnaire, which includes 12 items on 1-5 scale. A high score indicates a better therapeutic alliance. The questionnaire was translated to Hebrew and back-translated by the researchers of the current research.</description>

    <description>Psychological Flexibility Questionnaire (PFQ) (Ben-Itzhak, Bluvstein, &amp; Maor, 2014), which includes 20 items 20, divided to 5 factors, each relating to a significant domain of psychological flexibility: (1) positive perception of change; (2) characterization of the self as flexible; (3) self-characterization as open and innovative; (4) a perception of reality as dynamic and changing, and (5), a perception of reality as multifaceted.</description>

    <description>3 months long (12 sessions) dynamic psychotherapy. The dynamic psychotherapeutic technique which will be applied in the current research is derived from Malan's focused, brief psychodynamic psychotherapy (Malan 1976) and from the literature specifying psychodynamic psychotherapies distinctive techniques (Shedler 2010). The principle of this treatment is a time limited intervention in which the primary objective is to enhance the patient's insights regarding repetitive conflicts. As psychodynamic psychotherapy is suitable for all kinds of adjustment disorders, no special adjustment in the course of therapy was made for the different subtypes (Cabaniss et al. 2011).</description>
