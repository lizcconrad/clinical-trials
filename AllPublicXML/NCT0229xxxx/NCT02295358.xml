  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed with the intention to further elucidate the effects of omega-3 fatty
      acids on intraocular pressure (IOP) and signs/symptoms of dry eye. Prior studies have shown
      statistically significant lowering of IOP with use of omega-3 fatty acids but have only been
      performed in animal models. This study will be the first to attempt replication in human
      models. A limited number of studies have shown an increase in tear production/volume as well
      as a decrease in the subjective symptoms of dry eye, but more studies are needed to better
      define these effects. Better understanding of the effects of this supplement on intraocular
      pressure and dry eye will contribute to the expanding knowledge about the pathophysiology of
      glaucoma/ocular hypertension and dry eye syndrome and potentially lead to further studies
      about new potential treatment options for these conditions.

      The purpose of this research project is to determine the effects of omega-3 fatty acid
      supplementation on intraocular pressure (IOP) as well as the signs and symptoms of dry eye.
      We hypothesize that dietary omega-3 fatty acid supplementation will be associated with a
      significant change in intraocular pressure compared to baseline measurements prior to
      beginning supplementation. We further hypothesize that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation
      will be associated with a significant increase in tear production and volume as well as a
      significant change in patients' subjective complaints of dry eye.
