  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is perceived as the optimal method of providing and maintaining
      a clear and secure airway. The 2010 European Resuscitation Council (ERC) guidelines
      emphasized the importance of minimal interruption during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
      These guidelines also suggest that skilled operators should be able to secure the airway
      without interrupting chest compression. The aim of the study was to compare time and success
      rates of the Vividtrac video-laryngoscope and the Miller laryngoscope for emergency
      intubation during simulated pediatric CPR.
