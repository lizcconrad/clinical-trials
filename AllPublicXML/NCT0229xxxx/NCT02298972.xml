      This study evaluates the value of a nursing symptom support en selfmanagement intervention
      for adult patients with cancer treated with chemotherapy. Using a prospective sequential
      design with a comparison group who receives standard care and a (later) intervention group
      who gets the nursing intervention, we will evaluate the effect of this nursing intervention
      on overall symptom distress (primary outcome) and other measures of symptom burden,
      self-efficacy, outcome expectations and self-care. By conducting sem-structured interviews
      with some participants of the intervention group, we will study the patient experience of the
      intervention.
