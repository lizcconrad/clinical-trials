  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High food impulsiveness, impaired food reward and stress response are involved in the
      phenomena of weight gain and resistance at weight loss. Henceforth, hypnosis is a
      complementary medicine which is recognized as effective for defined indications. Complexity
      and diversity of methodological studies with hypnosis does not allow to conclude on its
      efficacy in treating this disease.

      In obese subjects with high food impulsiveness, it is expected that Erickson's hypnosis and
      self-hypnosis practice would improve food disinhibition assessed by an adapted questionary
      (TFEQ 51).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obese failing patients are recruited in an university hospital. Half of the subjects will be
      randomised to practice hypnosis and will learn to practice self-hypnosis to reduce food
      impulsivity and specially disinhibition. In the same time, all the included patients will
      follow therapeutic workshops based on current recommendations of the High Health Authority of
      France (HAS) for physical activity and the dietetic.

      In the hypnosis group, eight workshops are planned during six months. Furthermore, patients
      have to practice daily self-hypnosis. In the same time, all the patients included will
      participate in eight dietetic workshops.

      It is expected an improvement in patient involvement in personalized care plan, that eating
      behavior is more suited and consequently a significant decrease in weight.
