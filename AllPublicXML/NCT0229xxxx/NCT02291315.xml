  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate calcium absorption is essential for reducing one's risk of developing osteoporosis.
      However, postmenopausal Thai women consume diets which are habitually low in calcium due to
      lactose intolerance and dietary patterns which typically do not include milk-based products.
      The primary goal of this study is to measure the fractional calcium absorption from milk and
      a commonly ingested green leafy vegetable (cassia) in postmenopausal Thai women with
      habitually low calcium intakes. The secondary objective is to determine associations between
      calcium absorption and biomarkers which impact vitamin D status and bone metabolism.

      Postmenopausal Thai women (n=22) will be recruited from the community surrounding Bangkok and
      Nakhon Pathon, Thailand. They will be invited to participate in an isotope study comparing
      the fractional calcium absorption from milk and cassia. Upon arrival, a fasting blood sample
      will be drawn on the morning of the absorption study to analyze serum markers of vitamin D
      and bone metabolism (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25OHD], parathyroid hormone [PTH], and
      beta-crossLaps) and to determine their impact on calcium absorption. Following this blood
      draw, women will receive a stable calcium isotope (42Ca) intravenously. Then for breakfast
      and lunch respectively, the women will be randomly assigned to orally ingest a stable calcium
      isotope from either the milk (44Ca) or cassia (43Ca) test meals. On day two, women will
      receive a breakfast, snack, and lunch meal. Urine samples will be collected over the entire
      28 hour period and the 24-hr urine collection will be used to measure urinary calcium
      concentration and to calculate fractional calcium absorption.

    <description>On the morning of the absorption study, fasted women received 2 mg of 42Ca intravenously (in 5 ml of isotonic saline) over 5 minutes before being randomly assigned to receive either the milk or cassia meal first for breakfast and the milk or cassia meal second for lunch. The milk meal consisted of approximately 100 mg of fresh ultrahigh temperature (UHT) milk to which 2 mg of 44Ca was added and allowed to equilibrate for 12 h prior to ingestion and the cassia meal consisted of 142 g of cooked cassia to which 1 mg of 43Ca was extrinsically added.</description>
