      The primary objective of the Visceral Manifold and Unitary Device Study is to assess the use
      of the thoracic bifurcation and the visceral manifold or the unitary device to repair
      thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms in patients having appropriate anatomy. The primary intent
      of the study is to assess safety and preliminary effectiveness of the device. Additionally,
      the study will assess technical success and treatment success at each follow-up interval.

    <description>The TAAA Debranching Stent Graft System is comprised of two investigational devices including the thoracic bifurcation and the visceral manifold and the unitary manifold. The thoracic bifurcation and the visceral manifold as well as the unitary manifold work to facilitate endovascular stenting of the visceral vessels (renals, celiac, SMA) while maintaining flow to the visceral and infrarenal segments.</description>
