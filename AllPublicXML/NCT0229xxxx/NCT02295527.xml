      Hip fractures resulting from falls increase substantially with advancing age and less than a
      half of the elderly that have sustained and survived after the surgery regain their former
      levels of mobility. There is increasing evidence that rehabilitation interventions involving
      exercises and extended beyond the sub acute phase or even in a later stage of care have a
      positive impact on various functional abilities. The purpose of this study is to determine if
      an exercise program training for people who have suffered a fall-related hip fracture will
      improve functional mobility when compared with usual care. Randomized controlled trial using
      blinded assessors and intention-to-treat analysis. We will recruit 82 older adults, 60 years
      or over who have suffered a hip fracture due to a fall and have or have not completed
      physiotherapy and/or rehabilitation. These participants will be in a later stage
      rehabilitation phase (6 months up to 2 years after the fracture). Participants randomized to
      the Intervention Group (IG) will be submitted to a physical exercise program involving a
      progressive and challenging balance training and a neuromuscular and functional training of
      the lower limbs, conducted at home by physiotherapists, once a week, lasting about one hour,
      in the first, second and third month after randomization and will be oriented to perform
      exercises, twice a week, through a booklet. Visits to follow up exercises progression will be
      conducted once a month, from de fourth to the sixth month and each two months until the end
      of the follow up at the 12th month, summing up 18 sessions. Participants will receive monthly
      phone calls to increase exercise adherence. The control group will receive usual care. The
      primary outcome will be mobility-related disability and participants will be assessed in the
      baseline, at the end of the intervention (3 months), at 6 and 12 months. The participants
      will receive monthly phone calls to investigate falls and exercise adherence. Adverse effects
      will be monitored.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over a lifetime, about half of women and a quarter of men will suffer a fragility bone
      fracture [1, 2], mostly due to falling [2]. Among the most serious and common fractures are
      hip fractures, reaching significant levels of mortality [2] and disability [3]. Hip fracture
      is an increasingly important problem internationally, particularly in developing countries,
      due to the growth in the numbers of older people. It is estimated that in 2050 the global
      number of hip fractures will be between 7.3 and 21.3 million [4] and the cost with the
      treatment will be approximately of 131.5 billion dollars [5], due the population increase.

      Physical and psychological limitations post-fracture, such as decreased mobility [6] and
      muscle strength of lower limbs [7], deficit balance [6], lack of trust [7], fear of falling
      [6] and increased risk of falls [8], hamper around 40% of older people from returning to
      their daily activities to live independently and safely [3, 9]. Even after two years of
      injury, more than half of the elderly do not regain the functional level prior to injury
      [10], persisting with moderate to high risk of falls [6].

      Risk of falls and future falls in this population may be due either to physical limitations
      [11, 12] (due to insufficient recovery of balance, muscle strength and consequently mobility)
      and the fact they have already suffered a fracture previously [13], further increasing the
      chances of new fractures in this population [14].

      There is no consensus about the best intervention for functionality of the elderly after hip
      fracture. However, recently different exercise programs have been suggested to improve the
      mobility of these patients [8]. Some studies have shown the effectiveness of rehabilitation
      programs in the period of up to 6 months after injury [15-18]. Although, few studies have
      explored the late period rehabilitation (over 6 months) [19, 20], when functional limitations
      can persist due to inadequate dose as well as the type of exercise performed. Population in
      Brazil is growing age in one of the fastest rates in the world and will be even greater in
      the coming decades. The number of seniors will double between 2002 and 2020, from 15 million
      to 32 million and reach 64 million by 2050 (about 30% of the total population in Brazil)
      [21]. Furthermore, the elderly aged 80 and over will increase exponentially over the next
      four decades, putting a growing and disproportionate demand on the health system and social
      support [21].

      The purpose of this study is to determine if an exercise program training for people who have
      suffered a fall-related hip fracture will improve functional mobility when compared with
      usual care.

    <measure>Lower extremity function (Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline will be assessed at 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>will be measured by theSPPB [27], that consists of three blocks of tests that assess static balance, walking speed and, indirectly, the strength of the lower limbs (sitting and standing from a chair unassisted). Each test has a score of zero (worst performance) to 4 points (best performance), summing a total final score of 12 points. Change from baseline will be assessed at 6 and 12 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physiological risk of falls (Profile Physiological Assessment long version (PPA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline will be assessed at 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>will be measured by the PPA [12] which provides an overall score for risk of falling through a series of tests that evaluates the systems involved in the postural stability system. The results are computed on a software specifically developed for the test that generates a report assessing the risk of falls including 4 components: the individuals score on a global chart of fall risk, profile of the individuals performance in the tests, indicating in a table individuals performance in relation to the standards of the same age. Additionally, individual score for muscle strength, reaction time test, balance, sway and coordination will be also ascertained. Change from baseline will be assessed at 6 and 12 months.</description>

    <measure>Functional performance (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline will be assessed at 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>measured by the WHODAS II [29]. This scale measures the population health and functionality in 6 domains: cognition, mobility, self-care, interpersonal relationships, daily activities and participation. It was developed by WHO with theoretical model to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), and it is not intended for any specific health condition. This short version assesses the difficulty degree of performing 12 activities in past 30 days, which can be classified as none, mild, moderate, severe and extreme (cannot be performed). The degree of difficulty reported is based on the presence of increased effort, discomfort or pain, slowness or the presence of some change in the way of doing the activity. Change from baseline will be assessed at 6 and 12 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life (WHOQOL-bref)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline will be assessed at 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>measured by WHOQOL-bref [30], consists of 26 questions divided in 4 domains: physical, psychological, social relationships and environment. The questionnaire is based on the last 2 weeks of the participant and evaluated, for example, how safe he/she feel in her/his daily life and how satisfied is he/she with his/her ability to perform daily life activities. Change from baseline will be assessed at 6 and 12 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity intensity (Planned Exercise Questionnaire - IPEQ_W)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline will be assessed at 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>will be measured by the IPEQ_W [31], ten questions designed to measure physical activity planned and unplanned for older people. The version estimates the intensity of physical activity during the last week will be used. The participant will be questioned for the frequency (every day, 3-6 times per week, twice a week, once a week or less than once per week) and duration of activity (less than 15 minutes per day, more than 15 minutes and under 30 minutes per day, more than 30 minutes and less than 1 hour, less over 1 h and 2 h per day more and less than 4h per day 2h, 4h, and daily or more). The total score is derived by multiplying the frequency categories by categories of activity duration, expressed in hours per week. The ICC for the IPEQ_W total score was 0.81. The concurrent validity was adequate whereas the instrument was able to identify older people of different ages and degrees of disability. Change from baseline will be assessed at 6 and 12 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of falls</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline will be assessed at 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>will be assessed by monthly phone calls to participants. They will be encouraged to fill the diary that containing the record daily and the number of falls. A structured questionnaire will be used to identify possible falls and their consequences. The intervention group will be compared to control group at 6 and 12 months follow-up in relation to the number of falls, the incidence of falls and the proportion of elderly fallers. Change from baseline will be assessed at 6 and 12 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Usual gait speed (evaluate acceleration and deceleration using a stopwatch)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline will be assessed at 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>will be evaluated on a distance of 4.6 meters, including 2 meters for acceleration and 2 meters for deceleration using a stopwatch. The participant will be instructed to walk at their normal pace as if they were going to buy something at the grocery store. The time that the elderly takes to complete the course will be recorded three times. The computed velocity in meters per second will be calculated dividing the course in meters by the time taken to complete the course. The average of three attempts will be used. The use of walking aids will be allowed during the test [28]. Change from baseline will be assessed at 6 and 12 months.</description>
