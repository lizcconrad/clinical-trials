    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify and use patient centered outcomes to compare
      narrow-spectrum and broad-spectrum antibiotics for the treatment of common acute respiratory
      tract infections (ARTIs) in children.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outpatient, ARTIs account for the vast majority of antibiotic exposure to children, and
      roughly half of these antibiotic prescriptions are inappropriate. Although unnecessary
      antibiotic prescribing for viral infections has significantly decreased, there has been a
      substantial increase in prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat ARTIs when
      narrow-spectrum antibiotics are indicated. Primary care providers, patients, and caregivers
      would benefit from studies assessing the implications of alternate antibiotic regimens for
      these common infections. Specifically, it remains unclear if treating common ARTIs with
      broad-spectrum antibiotics leads to an improvement in patient outcomes compared to treatment
      with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, particularly considering the increasing threat posed by
      antimicrobial resistance. Because of the lack of large comparative effectiveness studies with
      patient-centered outcomes addressing this issue, professional guidelines and expert
      recommendations are conflicting, and, as a result, practice patterns vary considerably.
      Therefore, using patient-centered outcomes, we aim to compare narrow-spectrum and
      broad-spectrum antibiotics for the treatment of common ARTIs in children. To accomplish this,
      we will perform a prospective cohort study of children receiving antibiotics for ARTI across
      a comprehensive pediatric healthcare network. We will conduct telephone interviews with
      parent's of children who receive antibiotic treatment for an ARTI. We will assess previously
      identified patient-centered outcomes included a health-related quality of life measure,
      occurrence of side effects, missed school/daycare, parent missed commitments and/or required
      additional childcare and symptoms were still present on day 3 after diagnosis.

    <description>The health related quality of life score was obtained using the PedsQL(TM) (Mapi Research Trust, Lyon, France. www.pedsql.org) Parent-Proxy Report Generic Core Scales and Parent Report Infant Scales administered during the 5-10 day interview. Briefly, the PedsQL(TM) is a 23-item questionnaire assessing developmentally appropriate metrics (questions vary by age group: 1-12 months, 13-24 months, 2-4 years, 5-7 years, 8-12 years) related to core dimensions of health and role functioning. Our primary outcome was the Total Scale Score, which is a summary score of physical, emotional, social, and school functioning. The score range is zero to 100 and higher scores indicate a better health-related quality of life.</description>

    <description>During 5-10 day interview, parents were asked about symptoms related to child's illness (otitis media: fever, ear pain, decreased appetite; sinusitis: fever, face/head pain, decreased appetite; pharyngitis: throat pain, fever, decreased appetite). Parent was asked if symptoms was present at diagnosis. If yes, had the symptom resolved. If yes, when. We assessed whether symptoms present at day 3 after diagnosis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        We included children between six months and 12 years old, diagnosed with an ARTI (acute
        otitis media, acute sinusitis, Group A streptococcal [GAS] pharyngitis) using International
        Classification of Diseases diagnosis codes and prescribed an antibiotic. For GAS
        pharyngitis, the child also had a positive rapid streptococcal test.

        <title>Health Related Quality of Life Score</title>
        <description>The health related quality of life score was obtained using the PedsQL(TM) (Mapi Research Trust, Lyon, France. www.pedsql.org) Parent-Proxy Report Generic Core Scales and Parent Report Infant Scales administered during the 5-10 day interview. Briefly, the PedsQL(TM) is a 23-item questionnaire assessing developmentally appropriate metrics (questions vary by age group: 1-12 months, 13-24 months, 2-4 years, 5-7 years, 8-12 years) related to core dimensions of health and role functioning. Our primary outcome was the Total Scale Score, which is a summary score of physical, emotional, social, and school functioning. The score range is zero to 100 and higher scores indicate a better health-related quality of life.</description>
