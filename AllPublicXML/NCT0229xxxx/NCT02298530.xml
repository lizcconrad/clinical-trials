      Assess the effects of adding theanine to a caffeinated beverage on changes in blood pressure
      during acute mental stress.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caffeine and (mental) stress can increase blood pressure. In a typical everyday and/or work
      environment they commonly coincide. Tea has the reputation of being a relaxing drink.
      L-theanine is an amino acid found almost exclusively in tea. In a previous study it was shown
      that caffeine increased blood pressure, while theanine antagonised these effects. In the
      current study the effect of theanine to a placebo on blood pressure are directly compared.
