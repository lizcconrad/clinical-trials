  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical-noninvasive recording of sounds from the knees through a brief loaded range of
      motion. Description in phase 1 analytic but descriptive as well in phase 2. No samples other
      than a sound recording. The device is known microphone attached to the skin of the knee with
      elastic material. Sound recorded and analyzed on a lap top computer with Adobe software.

      There is a need for a less expensive and more universally available screening device for the
      knee, and other joint pathology. The equipment used for ultrasound is much less expensive and
      cumbersome than that of an x-ray or magnetic resonance imaging. The equipment we will use for
      the analysis of sound produced by the body itself is an order of magnitude less expensive
      than ultrasound; such as a laptop computer with currently available software and an
      inexpensive transducer. Analysis of sound has proved useful in Pulmonology and Cardiology. We
      believe sound analysis will provide a useful yet inexpensive tool for primary care physicians
      as well as musculoskeletal specialists.

      Phase 1: Establish the normal sound patterns emanating from the uninjured knee; we will look
      for the influence of age, height and weight.

      Phase 2: To record and analyze the preoperative sound patterns from the knees with pathology,
      known by MRI and arthroscopy, then compare them with the normal sounds from Phase 1.

    <description>Phase 1: Analysis will be carried out on the recording from apparently normal knees, sounds are amplification, wave form and filtering. Effects of age, height and weight. Phase 2: analysis of sound will br carried out by a researcher blinded to the MRI and arthroscopic pathology, Then, comparison of the abnormal sounds to the pathology found on the MRI and Arthroscopy to look for correlations.</description>
