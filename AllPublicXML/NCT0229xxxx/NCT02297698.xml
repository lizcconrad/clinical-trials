    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, prospective, randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled
      phase II trial of trastuzumab + nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF versus trastuzumab + GM-CSF alone. Our
      target study population is high-risk HER2-positive breast cancer patients. High-risk
      HER2-positive breast cancer patients are defined as:

      Those with HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of hormone receptor status, who receive
      neoadjuvant therapy with an approved regimen that includes trastuzumab and at least four
      cycles (12 weeks) of taxane-containing chemotherapy, and fail to achieve a pCR.

      Those with HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of hormone receptor status, who undergo
      surgery as a first intervention and are found to have ≥ 4 positive lymph nodes.

      Those with HER2-positive, hormone receptor negative breast cancer who undergo surgery as a
      first intervention and are found to have 1-3 positive lymph nodes.

      Disease-free subjects after standard of care multi-modality therapy will be screened and
      HLA-typed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators intend to assess the ability of the combination of
      trastuzumab and the HER2 vaccine nelipepimut-S (administered with the immunoadjuvant GM-CSF)
      given in the adjuvant setting to prevent recurrences in patients with high-risk HER2-positive
      breast cancer. High-risk is defined as those patients that do not achieve a pCR after
      neoadjuvant therapy with an approved regimen that includes trastuzumab and at least four
      cycles (12 weeks) of taxane-containing chemotherapy or those who undergo upfront surgery and
      are found to have greater than or equal to four positive lymph nodes regardless of hormone
      receptor status or 1-3 positive lymph nodes and are hormone receptor negative.

      Following surgery, patients will be screened and HLA-typed (consent #1). Nelipepimut-S is a
      CD8-eliciting peptide vaccine that is restricted to HLA-2+ or HLA-A3+ or HLA-A24+ or HLA-A26+
      patients (approximately 80% of the US population). HLA-A2+/A3+/A24+/orA26+ patients who meet
      all other eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive trastuzumab +
      nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF or trastuzumab + GM-CSF alone (consent #2). The trastuzumab will be
      administered to all patients consistent with current standard of care. Patients randomized to
      the nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF arm will receive vaccinations of nelipepimut-S (1000 mcg) and GM-CSF
      (250 mcg) administered intradermally every three weeks for six total vaccinations, 30-120
      minutes after completion of trastuzumab infusion. The first vaccination will be given with
      the third dose of maintenance trastuzumab administered as monotherapy optimally, but may be
      given with later maintenance doses of trastuzumab, provided there are at least six remaining
      doses of trastuzumab to overlap with the primary vaccine series. Patients randomized to the
      GM-CSF alone arm will receive inoculations of GM-CSF (250 mcg) administered in an identical
      manner to those receiving nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF. Patients will be blinded as to whether they
      are receiving nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF or GM-CSF alone.

      Upon completion of the primary vaccination/inoculation series, booster inoculations (same
      dose and route) will be administered every six months x 4. The first booster inoculation will
      occur 6 months ± 2 weeks after the completion of the PVS, with subsequent boosters timed
      every six months + 2 weeks. Boosters will therefore occur at the following time points after
      completion of the PVS: 6 months ± 2 weeks, 12 months ± 2 weeks, 18 months ± 2 weeks, 24
      months ± 2 weeks. Booster inoculations will occur for patients randomized to receive
      nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF as well as patients randomized to receive GM-CSF alone, and will consist
      of the same treatment drugs and dosing (i.e., nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF patients will be boosted
      with nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF while GM-CSF alone patients will be boosted with GM-CSF alone).
      Patient blinding will be maintained throughout the study.

      Subjects will be followed for safety issues, immunologic response and clinical recurrence.
      Patients will be monitored 48-72 hours after each inoculation for reaction to the inoculation
      as well as documentation of any adverse effects experienced. Immunologic response will be
      monitored primarily by in vivo delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions but also may be
      documented by other immunologic assays. All patients will be followed for a total of 36
      months from the time of initiation of trastuzumab maintenance therapy to document
      disease-free status.

    <description>Compare invasive DFS between the two treatment groups from time of initiation of trastuzumab maintenance therapy (trasuzumab monotherapy) to time of invasive local, regional or distant recurrence, new primary, or death due to any cause. Disease state will be determined by the patients' own physicians at the individual study sites during their routine follow-up screening. This will occur for all enrolled patients, regardless of randomization, approximately every three months for the first 24 months after completion of primary therapies and every six months thereafter with clinical exam, and laboratory and radiographic surveillance. The primary outcome measure of the trial is invasive DFS.</description>

    <description>Standard local and systemic toxicities will be collected and graded per the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 graded toxicity scale. For both the inoculations during the primary vaccine/inoculation series and the booster inoculations, patients will be monitored closely for one hour after inoculation with questioning, serial exams and vital signs every 15 minutes to observe for a hypersensitivity reaction. Additionally, patients will return to their study site 48-72 hours after inoculation for questioning regarding any systemic toxicity and local injection site reactions. When they return to their study site, the local reaction at the inoculation sites will be examined and measured.</description>

    <time_frame>From the date of the first inoculation of Trastuzumab monotherapy to the end of the patient's fifth year of participation in the study.</time_frame>
    <description>Immune responses will be primarily documented using the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction and using the dextramer assay to enumerate peptide-specific CTL. Each of these measurements will be performed regardless of randomization. DTH reactions will be measured prior to initiation of the primary vaccine/inoculation series, one month ± 1 week after completion of the primary vaccine/inoculation series, and one month ± 1 week after the final booster inoculation. Dextramer measurements will be performed prior to initiating the primary vaccine/inoculation series as well as one month ± 1 week after completion of the vaccine/inoculation series. Additionally, these assays may be performed pre- and post-each booster. Alternatively, these assayed time points may also be performed all at once on frozen and banked cells.</description>
