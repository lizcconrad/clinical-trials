  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progesterone is needed to permit adaptation of the kidney to limit potassium loss in the
      urines. The investigators wonder whether progesterone or other adrenal hormon play the same
      role. The investigators will investigate surrenal hormone production in healthy subjects
      under a 7-day potassium depleted diet and in patients chronically hypokalaemic due to a renal
      loss of potassium.

      The investigators will study the adaptation of steroidogenesis to potassium depletion in
      healthy volunteer, and the role of progesterone in renal adaptation to potassium depletion.
      Practically, healthy volunteers will be submitted twice to two periods of normal Na+/ high K+
      diet (control period) followed by a normal Na+/ low K+ diet sustained by a pharmacological
      treatment with Kayexalate (K+-depleted condition). The subjects will be treated with either
      RU486 or a placebo, according to a randomization. The adrenal response will be evaluated
      after stimulation by Synacthen at baseline and at the end of each experimental period. A
      Synacthen test will be also done in 10 patients suffering of chronic hypokalemia linked to a
      hereditary tubulopathy inducing renal K+ leak called Gitelman syndrome and their plasma
      steroid profile will be established.
