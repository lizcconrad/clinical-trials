      The ETAP study aim to assess the effect of the addition of an ultrasound-guided transversus
      abdominis plane (TAP) block to a multimodal intravenous analgesia protocol on the
      postoperative pain control in open surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The ETAP
      study is a single-center open-label randomized controlled trial. Half of patients included
      will receive the association of TAP block and multimodal intravenous analgesia, and the other
      half will receive the multimodal intravenous analgesia alone. The multimodal intravenous
      analgesia includes intravenous paracetamol and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with
      morphine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a painful surgery. Patients suffering
      from AAA are at high risk of perioperative cardiovascular and pulmonary complications. It has
      been previously suggested that a bad perioperative pain control could increase the incidence
      of such complications.

      Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine is widely considered as the gold
      standard treatment of the postoperative pain in open repair of AAA. High dose of morphine are
      often required and could delay the postoperative recovery and discharge. Side effects of
      morphine, such as respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting or pruritus, are responsible for
      patient discomfort and dissatisfaction when high doses are used.

      The efficacy of the ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been
      described for pain management following abdominal surgery, such as gastrectomy or kidney
      transplantation. The efficacy of the association of TAP block and PCA with morphine was
      higher than multimodal intravenous analgesia including PCA with morphine and than the
      combination of PCA with morphine and epidural analgesia. To our knowledge, the efficacy of
      the ultrasound-guided TAP block has never been studied for the postoperative pain control in
      AAA surgery.

    <description>Patients included in the ETAP group will receive the combination of a bilateral ultrasound-guided Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) block and a multimodal intravenous analgesia protocol for the postoperative pain management after the surgical open repair of an aortic abdominal aneurysm.
The TAP block consists in 2 ultrasound-guided injections of Ropivacaine 0.375% on each side of the abdominal wall between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles: 1 subcostal injection and 1 supra-iliac injection (i.e 10 ml of Ropivacaine 0.375% by injection).
The multimodal intravenous analgesia protocol consists in the association of intravenous infusion of 1 g of Acetaminophen every 6 h and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with Chlorhydrate of Morphine 1 mg/ml.</description>

    <description>The aim of the Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Block is to deposit local anesthetic in the plane between the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis muscles targeting the spinal nerves in this plane. The local anesthetic used in the ETAP study is Ropivacaine 0.375%. 2 ultrasound-guided injections of 10 ml will be performed on each side of the abdominal wall: 1 subcostal injection and 1 supra-iliac injection.</description>

The PCA pump is a computerized pump which contains a syringe of 1 mg/ml of Chlorhydrate of Morphine as prescribed by the physician in charge of the patient, and connected directly to a patient's intravenous line. Doses of Chlorhydrate of Morphine can be self-administered by the patient as needed by the having the patient press a button.</description>
