  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      INDEPTH Network Effectiveness and Safety Studies in Africa (INESS) have demonstrated a
      substantial efficacy decay of Artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT) in Tanzania in 2012
      (from efficacy of 98% to effectiveness of 18%). Hence system readiness for control and
      elimination strategies is severely compromised. Sub-optimal health workers' performance in
      treating malaria cases was a major contributor to the decay, effecting both treatment and
      patient adherence. If these quantified system failures remain unchecked it will pose major
      barrier in achieving malaria control and elimination goals. There is growing evidence that
      mobile phone text message reminders can improve health workers' compliance and patients'
      adherence to malaria treatment guidelines. Tanzania has recently harnessed all public sector
      health worker phones into Short Message System (SMS) platform. The investigators intend to
      exploit this opportunity in a randomized trial of messages to substantially reduce the decay
      documented by the INESS platform.

      The null hypothesis: Sending automated text message reminders to health workers on malaria
      diagnosis and treatment recommendations, will not have any effects in the quality of malaria
      case management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The baseline assessment of systems effectiveness performed by this team, have done a
      comprehensive quantitative documentation of efficacy decay for ACTs in real world settings;
      showing how community and provider's contribute to efficacy decay. The proposed text messages
      reminder intervention builds up from the recent findings of the Kenyan study which
      demonstrated an improvement in malaria case management by 24%. This level of improvement in
      malaria case management, if coupled with other systems interventions to improve timely access
      to ACT providers, should at least double systems effectiveness. This being the case, health
      systems in developing countries will be able to address these significant challenges
      hindering taking the diseases eradication agenda forward. Inappropriate care and untimely
      access to treatment has been identified as one of important elements for ACTs efficacy decay
      that in turn continues to pose a serious challenge to achieving malaria eradication.

      Goal: The study aim to evaluate using cluster randomized control trial whether mobile phone
      text messages reminders can improve the quality of malaria case management.

      Specific objectives:

        1. To develop an automated text messaging system to send reminders to mobile phones of
           health workers based on Tanzanian malaria treatment guidelines;

        2. To evaluate the impact of the intervention on providers' compliance to the National
           Guidelines for Malaria Diagnosis and Treatment (NGMDT);

        3. To evaluate the impact of the intervention on patients adherence to malaria treatment
           with ACT

        4. To evaluate the impact of the intervention on reducing baseline efficacy decay levels.

    <description>Text-message reminders about malaria case management will be prepared and distributed to all health workers seeing outpatients in the selected health facilities through their personal mobile phones and facility phones. These messages will reflect ACT recommendations from Tanzania's national guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of malaria and training manuals. The intervention will run for three months, two text message a day will be send to all identified health workers during regular working hours (i.e. between 8 am to 3 pm), three times a week. To avoid health worker's fatigue of receiving these messages, the messages will also contain some non-malaria humorous, inspirational, motivational and educative contents.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Dispensaries and health centers; public and private; operating in Rufiji district that
        provided outpatient services will be eligible for the study. In the intervention arm
        facility, all health workers who see and take care of patients at the outpatient department
        (OPD) will be registered to receive automated SMS as the intervention in this study.

        During the evaluation phase, all patients attending the surveyed facilities for initial
        illness consultation will be eligible for inclusion in the study. Assessment of adherence
        will be performed to malaria patients (who tested positive) and received ACT for treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Due to logistical difficulties, health facilities within the Delta region will be excluded
        in this study. As well, two hospitals in the district will be excluded in the study since
        they mostly receive referral patients. Also, hospitals have specialized clinic sections
        with highly trained staff and their nurses or clinicians may be rotating in different
        departments, hence there may not be health provider's whose primary duties are on OPD
        patients alone. In addition, health workers in eligible facilities who do not own a mobile
        phone will be excluded to receive &quot;SMS&quot; reminders.

        During evaluation, all severe cases and hospitalized patients will not be included in the
        surveys. Assessment of adherence study will exclude non residents of the study area.
