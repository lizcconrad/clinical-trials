    <textblock>
      This 5-year proposal is a randomized study of split-virus influenza vaccine (SVV) in a
      high-dose (HD) vs. standard-dose (SD) formulation in each of five influenza seasons to define
      the key determinants of vaccine-mediated protection against influenza and how these
      immunologic mediators may be enhanced by vaccination with a newly approved high-dose
      influenza vaccine in older people

    <description>Influenza surveillance includes weekly contact with study subjects to assess for any flu-like symptoms or acute respiratory infection (ARI), and include nasopharyngeal swabs (within 5 days of onset of symptoms) for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of influenza virus and post-influenza season detection of an antibody response to influenza infection. Routine screen for symptoms of ARI will also occur at the 4, 10 and 20 week visits when blood samples are collected. Influenza illness will be documented by PCR detection of influenza during an IARI or seroconversion (4-fold rise in antibody titers) in association with an ARI. ARI includes upper (coryza or sore throat) or lower (cough or shortness of breath) respiratory tract symptoms, or headache, malaise, myalgia or fever (&gt; 99°F or 37.3°C orally or 100°F rectally) [41]. as physician visits, hospitalizations and deaths attributed to acute cardiopulmonary illness and will be tracked through the influenza season.</description>
