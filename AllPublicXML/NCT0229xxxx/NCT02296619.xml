      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of Transversus Abdominis Plane Block on
      hemodynamic variables, anaesthetic and analgesic requirement, and quality of recovery in
      patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain is one of the main causes of the poor perioperative outcomes and pain management is the
      important part of perioperative period. Neuraxial blocks could provide adequate analgesia
      during and after abdominal surgery. However,neuraxial blocks have a lot of contraindicated
      situations and neuraxial anesthesia can easily induce hemodynamic abnormalities. Therefore,
      in most cases, the choice of anaesthetic management may be the general anesthesia. In
      addition to reduce the blood pressure and heart rate changes due to surgical stimulations,
      the large amount of opioids and anaesthetics may be required. Opioid related side effects can
      affect perioperative complications and postoperative quality of recovery. Transversus
      abdominis plane block is a new choice to reduce postoperative pain in abdominal surgery.
      Although its postoperative analgesic efficacy is well known, its effects on hemodynamic
      variables, anaesthetic and analgesic requirement is not clear. The main objective of this
      study is to estimate the effect of Transversus abdominis plane block on hemodynamic
      variables, anaesthetic and analgesic requirement and quality of recovery in patients
      undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy.
