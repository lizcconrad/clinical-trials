    <textblock>
      Purpose This study will examine the effect of the addition of Cycloset upon glucose
      metabolism (glycemic control including post prandial glucose metabolism) in individuals with
      inadequately controlled (HbA1c 7.5-10.0) type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who are already on Bydureon
      (exenatide once weekly) or Victoza (liraglutide once daily) as part of their standard care.

      Both a mechanistic rationale and empirical experimental evidence implicate a beneficial
      interaction between bromocriptine and the incretin mimetics (GLP-1 analogs) upon postprandial
      hyperglycemia in insulin resistant states. One of the actions of the incretin mimetics such
      as the GLP-1 analogs is to stimulate postprandial beta cell insulin secretory response to
      plasma glucose (see drug labeling information; www.fda.gov). Thus the combination of Cycloset
      that is working as a post prandial insulin sensitizier with therapies that increase post
      prandial insulin would be expected to provide complimentary glucose lowering effects. To
      date, however, no such studies investigating the interactive effects of a GLP-1 analog and
      Bromocriptine-QR (Cycloset) have been conducted in humans.
