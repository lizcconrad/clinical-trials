      This is an open-label Phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study of OMP-305B83 in subjects
      with previously treated solid tumors. Study includes a dose escalation phase and expansion
      phase. Subjects will be assessed for safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers,
      and efficacy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have a histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or
             unresectable for which there is no remaining standard curative therapy and no therapy
             with a demonstrated survival benefit or they must be ineligible to receive such
             therapy and/or have declined all such therapy. In addition, subjects must have a tumor
             that is at least 1 cm in a single dimension and is radiographically apparent on CT or
             MRI.

          2. FFPE tumor tissue either fresh core needle biopsied or archived (two FFPE cores
             preferred whenever possible) is required for participation in the study. If fresh
             tissue is obtained, the core biopsy must be done at least â‰¥7 days prior to Day 0.

          3. Subjects must have received their last chemotherapy, non-anti-VEGF biologic, or
             investigational therapy at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment, 6 weeks if the last
             regimen included BCNU or mitomycin C, and 8 weeks if the last regimen was an anti-VEGF
             therapy

          4. Age &gt;21 years

          5. ECOG performance status &lt;2

          6. Life expectancy of more than 3 months

          7. Subjects must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1000/mL (without a colony stimulating factor within
                  the last 2 weeks)

               -  Hemoglobin &gt;10.5 g/dL (without erythropoietin or blood transfusion within the
                  last 2 weeks)

               -  Platelets &gt;100,000/mL (without platelet transfusion within the last 2 weeks)

               -  Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt;2 X institutional ULN (for subjects with hepatic
                  metastases &lt;5 X institutional ULN)

               -  INR and PTT within 1.5 X institutional ULN

               -  Proteinuria &lt; trace

               -  Creatinine &lt;1.5 X institutional ULN OR

               -  Creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with creatinine levels above
                  institutional normal

          8. Women of childbearing potential must have had a prior hysterectomy or have a negative
             serum pregnancy test and be using adequate contraception prior to study entry and must
             agree to use adequate contraception from study entry through at least 6 months after
             discontinuation of study drug. Men must also agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and
             from study entry through at least 6 months after discontinuation of study drug. Should
             a woman enrolled in the study or a female partner of a man enrolled in the study
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study or within
             6 months after discontinuation of study, she should inform the Investigator
             immediately.

             antibody Subjects who have received prior anti-VEGF therapy are eligible, unless they
             have residual serious adverse events related to their anti-VEGF therapy.

          3. Subjects with a history of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation,
             intra-abdominal abscess; clinical signs or symptoms of GI obstruction and/or
             requirement for parenteral hydration or nutrition. In addition, subjects with other

             28 days prior to enrollment to rule out brain metastases), uncontrolled seizure
             disorder, or active neurologic disease

          5. History of a significant allergic reaction attributed to humanized or human monoclonal
             antibody therapy
