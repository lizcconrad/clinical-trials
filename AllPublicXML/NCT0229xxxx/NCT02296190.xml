  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of at least 1 dose of
      intranasal (IN) MSP-2017 (Etripamil) over placebo in terminating PSVT induced in an
      electrophysiology (EP) laboratory.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to
      evaluate the effects of 4 different doses of MSP-2017 (Etripamil) in subjects with paroxysmal
      supraventricular tachycardia. It includes an up to 21-day Screening Period, a 1-day Treatment
      Visit, and either a Follow-up Visit or Early Termination Visit occurring 12 hours to 5 days
      after the Treatment Visit. Subjects will be randomized to yield at least 100 evaluable
      subjects distributed into 5 groups of at least 20 subjects each.

             benzodiazepine(s) (e.g., midazolam) and/or narcotic(s) (e.g., fentanyl) (given via
             single or multiple administration[s]) may be used at the Investigator's discretion.
             The identity(-ies) and actual administered dose(s) of any benzodiazepine(s) and/or
             narcotic(s) should be recorded in the study documentation. Local anesthetic(s) may be
             used at the Investigator's discretion; any use should be recorded in the study
             documentation
