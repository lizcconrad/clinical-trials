  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this protocol is to assess the ExAblate 2100 MR guided high intensity
      focused ultrasound device as an intervention for treatment of facetogenic lower back pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single group, single arm, open/nonblinded, non-randomized study. The primary
      outcomes are safety and preliminary efficacy. The InSightec ExAblate 2100 MRgHIFU system is a
      non-invasive thermal ablation device fully integrated with an MR imaging system and used for
      the ablation of soft tissue and bone.The study will reach primary completion 12 months from
      the time the study opens to accrual.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women &gt; 21 years of age and who are skeletally mature

          2. Body mass index â‰¤ 30 kg/m2

          3. Patients who are able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent
             document and able to attend all study visits

          4. Patients with at least 6 months of chronic lower back pain (LBP) localized to the
             midline or axial low back, with symptoms attributed to the facet joints on physical
             examination that have persisted despite conservative therapy. Conservative therapy is
             defined as systemic pain medications and anti-inflammatory medications, as well as
             physical therapy, such as massage, heating, hydrotherapy, and strengthening exercises.

          5. Patients with Numerical Rating Scale worst lumbar back pain score of at least 4 out of
             10 over the 24 hours preceding the time of rating.

          6. Patients must have chronic LBP attributed to facet joints as demonstrated by MRI
             consistent with at least grade 2 facet joint arthritis, with corresponding abnormal
             activity at the facet joint on 18F-sodium fluoride PET-CT.

          7. Patients must have an analgesic response to either prior local anesthetic injection to
             the facet joint or to radiofrequency ablation of the facet joint, with relapse of
             pain.

          8. The targeted facet joint must be deeper than 10 mm from the skin

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with severe lumbar lordosis

             are not MRI-safe, size limitations, claustrophobia. etc

          3. Patients with known intolerance or allergy to MR contrast agent (gadolinium chelates)

         11. Individuals who are not able or willing to tolerate the required prolonged stationary

             hinder them from completing this study

         13. Patients with unstable cardiac status including:

               3. Congestive heart failure requiring medication (other than diuretic)

               4. Patients on anti-arrhythmic drugs

         14. Patients with severe hypertension (diastolic BP &gt; 100 on medication)

         15. Patients with severe hematologic, neurologic, or other uncontrolled disease (e.g.
             platelets &lt; 50,000/microL, INR &gt; 1.5)
