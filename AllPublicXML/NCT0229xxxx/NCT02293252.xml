      The primary endpoint is the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER), defined as the
      combined clinical endpoint &quot;days alive and not in hospital nor stationary care per days in
      study&quot; and the change in total cost compared to that of the control group.

    <textblock>
      Between January 2010 and June 2013, 621 patients with left ventricular ejection fraction
      (LVEF) ≤ 40% were enrolled and randomly assigned to two study arms comprising usual care and
      a home telemonitoring group. The 302 patients enrolled in the intervention group are
      supported by an interactive bi-directional home telemonitoring system (Motiva®) that collects
      and transfers patient's vital sign data to a dedicated telemedicine data centre. All patients
      were to remain in the study for one year with an examination at the beginning and both, after
      6 and 12 months.
