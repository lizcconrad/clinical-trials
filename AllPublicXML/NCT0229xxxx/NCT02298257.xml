      This phase II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of brentuximab vedotin and
      combination chemotherapy work in treating patients with stage III-IV human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV)-associated Hodgkin lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as brentuximab vedotin,
      can block cancer growth by finding cancer cells and causing them to die. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, vinblastine sulfate, and dacarbazine, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving brentuximab vedotin together with combination
      chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase II study. Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously
      (IV), vinblastine sulfate IV, and dacarbazine IV on days 1 and 15. Patients also receive
      brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      â€¢ To establish an estimate of the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with
      HIV-associated stage III-IV Hodgkin lymphoma when treated using brentuximab vedotin plus the
      AVD chemotherapy regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To evaluate the toxicity of AVD and brentuximab vedotin with highly active
           antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

        -  To estimate the partial response (PR) rate, complete response (CR) rate, overall
           survival (OS), and event free survival (EFS) at 2 and 5 years.

        -  To evaluate the effect of AVD and brentuximab vedotin on CD4 and CD8 counts after cycle
           1, 4, at the end of therapy, and every 3 months after treatment completion for one year.

        -  To investigate the prognostic value of FDG-PET/CT scans at baseline, after cycle 2, and
           at treatment completion, with respect to 2-year progression free survival.

        -  To evaluate HAART status at baseline and to correlate this with tumor response to
           therapy and OS and PFS.

        -  To characterize the histologic subtypes in HIV-HL in the HAART era.

        -  To assess the neurotoxicity of HAART in combination with AVD and brentuximab vedotin.

        -  To evaluate effect of AVD and brentuximab vedotin on viral load after cycle 1, 4, at the
           completion of therapy, and every 3 months after treatment completion for one year.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age â‰¥ 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the
             use of brentuximab vedotin in combination with AVD in patients &lt;18 years of age,
             children are excluded from this study

          2. HIV-1 infection, as documented by licensed HIV rapid test performed in conjunction
             with screening (or ELISA test kit and confirmed by Western blot or other approved
             test). A measurable HIV viral load alone is not sufficient for documentation of the
             diagnosis of HIV. Alternatively, this documentation may include a record that another
             physician has documented that the participant has HIV infection based on prior ELISA
             and western blot, or other approved diagnostic tests

          3. Histologic diagnosis of CD30-positive classical HL as defined by the 2008 WHO
             Classification of Hematological diseases. Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin
             Lymphoma is not eligible

          4. Stage III or IV disease as defined by the Ann Arbor Staging System

          5. Participants must have previously untreated HIV-cHL, with the exception of up to 14
             consecutive days of steroids or 1 prior cycle of cyclophosphamide to reduce tumor
             burden and improve hyperbilirubinemia in the setting of lymphoma related liver
             involvement

          6. Normal baseline cardiac ejection fraction â‰¥ 50%

          7. Serum creatinine of â‰¤ 1.5 mg/dL. If creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL (132 micromol/L), creatinine
             clearance must be â‰¥ 60 mL/minute according to MDRD/Cockroft-Gault formula

          8. ANC â‰¥ 1000/ÂµL and platelets â‰¥ 75,000/ÂµL unless related to bone marrow involvement by
             HIV-cHL

          9. A direct bilirubin level of â‰¤ 2.0 mg/dL (34 Âµmol/L). If, however, the elevated
             bilirubin is felt to be secondary to antiretroviral therapy, the total bilirubin must
             be â‰¤ 3.5 mg/dL (59 Âµmol/L), provided that the direct bilirubin is normal and the AST
             and ALT â‰¤ 3 x the upper limit of normal. Also, if the elevated bilirubin is thought to
             be secondary to cHL the patients should not be excluded from study participation

         10. Female subjects must have a negative pregnancy test within 1 week of enrollment and
             all subjects must agree to use two reliable methods of contraception simultaneously if
             conception is possible during the study

               -  Should a woman subject become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while the
                  subject is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
                  immediately. The patient will then be removed from protocol therapy

               -  Subjects who father a child while participating in the study will be permitted to
                  continue with the protocol. The subject, however, is required to notify the
                  investigator if he fathers a child

         11. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

         12. Karnofsky performance status &gt; 30% (given the aggressiveness of this disease and the
             often severely debilitated nature of the patients at initial presentation). See
             Appendix 20.519.5

         13. Measurable or non-measurable (evaluable) tumor parameter(s). Non-measurable tumor
             parameters will be defined as not having bi-dimensional measurements (i.e., gastric or
             marrow involvement) but can be followed for response by other diagnostic tests such as
             gallium, PET imaging and/or bone marrow biopsy

         14. Patients already receiving erythropoietin or GCSF for treatment of HIV-related
             cytopenia are eligible

         15. CD4 count â‰¥ 100 cells/Âµl and serum HIV viral load &lt;50copies/ml

         16. Subjects are required to be on antiretroviral regimens that are in accordance with the
             current International AIDS Society guidelines concurrently with chemotherapy. Use of
             experimental antiretroviral agents or those containing zidovudine or ritonavir,
             cobicistat or similar potent CYP3 inhibitors are prohibited, as explained in Section
             5.7. In order to be eligible, patients taking zidovudine or ritonavir, or cobicistat
             or other CYP3 inhibitors must change to a different regimen 7 days prior to therapy
             initiation. Subjects must be on HAART for at least 12 weeks prior to therapy. See
             section 10.3

         17. Patients will be required to obtain a pulmonary function test, despite the exclusion
             of bleomycin from protocol regimen. The subject's diffusing capacity of the lung for
             carbon monoxide (DLCO) adjusted for hemoglobin must be greater than 70% predicted to
             enter the study and to continue with brentuximab vedotin

         18. Negative for Hepatitis B, or if infected with Hepatitis B, receiving anti-Hepatitis B
             therapy. All subjects will be required to be screened for Hepatitis B. Per IDSA and
             AASD guidelines, those subjects that show no immunity, defined by the lack of
             Hepatitis B surface antibody, and show evidence of chronic infection (i.e., HBsAg+,
             HBcore+, HBsAB-) will be required to be on anti-Hepatitis B therapy during the study
             in order to be eligible. Patients will be permitted to enroll in the study provided
             normal liver function tests (see Section 9.3) and no evidence of cirrhosis. The exact
             Hepatitis B therapy will be at the discretion of the infection disease specialist or
             investigator. However all patients who present with acute hepatitis B or show normal
             transaminases and are HBsAg+ and IgM+ for Hepatitis core antigen will not be eligible
             for trial enrollment

         19. Patients diagnosed with Hepatitis C who are Hepatitis C antibody positive, whether
             Hepatitis C RNA level is measurable or not, must have no evidence of cirrhosis and
             have liver function tests that conform to Section 9.3

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with prior anthracycline therapy will be excluded

          2. Female subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Confirmation that the subject is
             not pregnant must be established by a negative serum b-human chorionic gonadotropin
             (b-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening. Pregnancy testing is not
             required for post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women

          3. Medical illness unrelated to HL, which in the opinion of the study physician will
             preclude administration of chemotherapy safely. This includes patients with
             uncontrolled infection (including opportunistic), chronic renal failure, myocardial
             infarction (MI) within the past 6 months, unstable angina, or cardiac arrhythmias
             other than chronic atrial fibrillation

          4. Prior malignancy within 5 years of enrolment other than curatively treated cutaneous
             basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, anal
             intraepithelial neoplasia, or cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)

          5. Grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy

          6. Evidence of PML identified on the pretreatment MRI

          7. Central nervous system disease

          8. Patients with history of JC Virus identified in the CSF or previous history of PML
             will be excluded from the study

          9. Cirrhosis secondary to any cause will be excluded
