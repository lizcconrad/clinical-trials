  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to compare traditional muscle function tests with
      computerized versions using body-worn motion sensors and video motion analysis of the same
      tests. The investigators selected the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test as the investigators primary
      variable for this aim with several other function tests (e.g., repeated chair rise, 6-meter
      walk, 2-minute walk, Romberg stance, semi-tandem / tandem stance) as secondary variables. The
      investigators primary hypothesis is that the computerized versions of the TUG test are highly
      correlated (&gt;0.9) with the traditional method, but with comparable or better reproducibility.
      Secondary analyses will correlate other function tests with their computerized version, again
      with the hypothesis that they are highly correlated and that computerized versions are of
      similar or better reproducibility. This analysis will also compare traditional assessments of
      balance with a computerized balance method, computerized dynamic posturography.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Validate the use of BIS (Bioelectrical Impedance Spectroscopy) to adjust DXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) -measured body composition by providing muscle mass measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>BIS is performed at visit 1 and visit 2 up to 4 days later. DXA is performed at visit 2.</time_frame>
    <description>The relationship of lean mass, as estimated by DXA and BIS with muscle mass as measured by deuterated creatine dilution as a nominal gold standard. Additionally, the correlation of lean mass as measured by DXA and muscle mass as measured by BIS and creatine dilution with muscle function tests.</description>

      Blood will be drawn to obtain a serum chemistry panel to document health status of the study
      participants. For subjects who agree to optional banking, serum aliquots will be obtained and
      banked for future study of markers relevant to musculoskeletal health.
