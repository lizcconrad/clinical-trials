  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of human umbilical cord
      mesenchymal stem cell(hUC-MSC) for articular cartilage defect of knee.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human articular cartilage has limited repair potential.Cell-based strategies have explored
      chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with extensive basic science and preclinical
      studies.However the concept of autologous chondrocyte implantation is not ideal,so the focus
      in cartilage repair is shifting toward mesenchymal stem cells.

      To investigate the effects of hUC-MSC treatment for articular cartilage defects, 20 patients
      will be enrolled and receive 4 times of hUC-MSC transplantation.
