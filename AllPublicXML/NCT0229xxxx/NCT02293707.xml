    <textblock>
      GX301 is an experimental therapeutic vaccine directed against human telomerase, an enzyme
      playing an essential role in cancer cell proliferation.

      This clinical trial will test three different GX301 administration regimens in
      castration-resistant prostate cancer patients who have achieved response or disease stability
      with first-line docetaxel treatment. This is aimed at identifying an optimal vaccination
      regimen.

      The three regimens will primarily be compared for their efficacy and safety in inducing
      vaccine-specific immunological responses over a period of 6 months following treatment
      initiation. In addition, patients will be observed for the occurrence of disease progression
      and for their vital status up to 24 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GX301, an experimental therapeutic (anti-cancer) vaccine, is composed of four immunogenic
      peptides from human telomerase and two complementary adjuvants, Montanide ISA-51 VG and
      imiquimod.

      An earlier Phase 1 study of GX301 has provided evidence of vaccine-specific immune response
      in a small sample of stage 4 prostate cancer patients given eight GX301 administrations over
      9 weeks.

      The present Phase 2, randomised, parallel-group, multicentre trial is aimed at comparing
      three different GX301 administration regimens in patients with progressive,
      castration-resistant prostate cancer who have completed a first-line docetaxel treatment and
      have achieved response to chemotherapy or disease stability. Primary comparisons will include
      regimen efficacy in inducing vaccine-specific immunological responses over a period of 6
      months following randomisation; and treatment safety and tolerability over the same period.

      A further study aim is to investigate whether achievement of immunological response,
      irrespective of the assigned GX301 regimen, is related to progression-free and/or overall
      survival.

      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of three GX301 vaccination
      regimens consisting of two, four or eight administrations, respectively, each regimen being
      given over a fixed 9-week period. Randomisation ratio will be 1:1:1. Randomisation will be
      stratified by previous cumulative exposure to docetaxel.

      Following randomisation, immunological responses to GX301 will be determined over a 6-month
      period. However, on-study patient observation will be continued until the occurrence of one
      of the following end-points, whichever the earliest: (a) disease progression; (b) death; (c)
      completion of an 18-month observation period; or (d) patient's decision to terminate his
      participation in the study.

      All patients discharged from the trial for reasons (a) or (c) will undergo a follow-up to
      ascertain survival until 24 months from randomisation.

      Data analysis will be carried out in two sequential steps. The first step will focus on
      co-primary outcomes and will therefore take place upon completion of the study dataset up to
      the 6-month time-point. The second step will incorporate secondary outcomes and will
      therefore be conducted upon completion of the full study dataset.

    <description>GX301 therapy consists of four human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) peptides and two adjuvants.
Peptides are hTERT (540-548) Acetate, hTERT (611-626) Acetate, hTERT (672-686) Acetate and hTERT (766-780) Acetate. Adjuvants are Montanide ISA 51 VG and imiquimod 5% cream (Aldara).
Each GX301 administration will consist of four intradermal injections - one injection for each hTERT peptide - given at the same time and followed by topical application of imiquimod. Each intradermal injection will consist of a fixed hTERT peptide dose, 500 µg, reconstituted as a solution and mixed with Montanide ISA 51 VG.</description>
