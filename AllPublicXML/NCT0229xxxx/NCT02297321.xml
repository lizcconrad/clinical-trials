      This is a prospective study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an accessory for laser
      tattoo removal in allowing multiple passes within a single treatment session. One half of the
      tattoo will be randomly assigned laser treatment utilizing the Device (the &quot;Device half&quot;);
      the other half will receive laser treatment without the Device and serve as the control (the
      &quot;Control half&quot;). Based on statistical analysis sample size calculations, 30 subjects will be
      enrolled. The tattoo must be no larger than approximately 2 ½&quot; x 6&quot; or 3&quot; x 5&quot; in size, such
      that ½ of the tattoo can be covered with a single patch. Each subject will receive a single
      Treatment Session consisting of 5 minutes. Investigators will administer the standard laser
      treatment to both the Device and Control sites using well-established tattoo-removal
      treatment parameters for the laser used. Subjects will return for follow up approximately one
      month post-treatment. The presence of side effects and adverse events will be assessed and
      recorded for both Device and Control sites immediately after treatment and at the 1-month
      follow-up visit.
