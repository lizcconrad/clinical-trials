  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a potentially life threatening condition. If the aneurysm
      ruptures, the mortality can be as high as 80%. Endovascular aneurysms repair (EVAR) is a
      minimal invasive procedure and has been widely used on treating AAA. Advanced endovascular
      techniques are used to treat patients with more complex pathology by using custom-made
      devices and additional stents. In order to accomplish the technical success on advanced EVAR,
      with the current imaging equipment and technique for EVAR procedures (i.e. live x-ray
      fluoroscopy and 2-D digital subtraction angiography (DSA)), multiple angiograms on the target
      arteries (arteriograms) are required. Subsequently patients are exposed to higher dose of
      contrast and radiation, compared to conventional EVAR. This study is to assess the
      feasibility of proper visceral and renal arteries catheterization using a 3D model obtained
      from pre-procedural computed tomographic angiography (CTA), fused with real-time fluoroscopy,
      without contrast injection or angiographic run-offs thus minimizing the contrast use and
      patient radiation exposure while achieving procedure success during Advanced EVAR.
