  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how skin conditions that are related to different kinds
      of cancer or cancer treatments affect a patient's overall well-being. Skin conditions are
      common in cancer patients and survivors. Sometimes, the skin condition is directly related to
      the cancer. Other times, these conditions are a side effect of cancer treatment. Patients in
      the study will be asked to fill out at least one questionnaire about how they feel about
      their skin condition. If the patient needs to be treated for their skin condition, they will
      be asked to complete the same questionnaire when they return for a follow-up visit. The
      investigators hope the study will improve our understanding of how cancer patients feel about
      their skin conditions. They also hope this study helps them learn how to improve the way we
      treat skin conditions in cancer patients.

    <description>in cancer patients and survivors with dermatologic conditions. This is a nontherapeutic and nondiagnostic protocol to obtain quality of life assessments from cancer patients and survivors who have dermatologic conditions, whether related to cancer therapies, or directly related to the primary cancer diagnosis. Data will be collected by using one or more dermatology-specific QoL instruments based on the underlying skin condition/s.</description>

    <description>Patients involved in this study will have a wide range of dermatologic conditions for which they will be assessed and managed by the treating physician. An appropriate QoL instrument will be administered at the initial visit, and if applicable, at subsequent follow-up visit(s). Treatment of the dermatologic condition will be at physician's discretion based on the patient's presenting symptoms and is not an intervention itself within this study.</description>
