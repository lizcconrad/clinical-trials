             the study.

          -  The patient has a platelet count &lt;60 × 10^3/µL (based on the average of 2 screening
             samples obtained up to 24 hours apart).

          -  The patient has alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &gt;250 IU/L or
             total bilirubin &gt;1.5 mg/dL.

          -  The patient has an international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;1.5

          -  The patient is unwilling or unable to abstain from ingesting alcohol the day before
             through 3 days after each infusion of olipudase alfa during the treatment period.
             Measuring alcohol concentration in blood is not required.

          -  The patient is scheduled during the study for in-patient hospitalization including
             elective surgery.

          -  The patient requires medication(s) that may can decrease olipudase alfa activity (eg,
             fluoxetine, chlorpromazine; tricyclic antidepressants [eg, imipramine, or
             desipramine]).
