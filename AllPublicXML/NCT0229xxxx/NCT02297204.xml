    <textblock>
      The Endurance Trial is a phase IV open label clinical study to assess the need for ongoing
      intravitreal aflibercept injections after the 3-year VISTA DME (VGFT-OD-1009) end-point.
      Subjects will be treated with intravitreal aflibercept injections pro re nata (PRN) based on
      the presence of CR-DME (Clinically Relevant-Diabetic Macular Edema). In addition, subjects
      who meet re-treatment criteria will be eligible for focal laser treatment every 90 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety and tolerability of intravitreal aflibercept injections have been investigated in
      previous Phase I, I/II and III studies in AMD, RVO, and DME trials. Potential safety issues
      associated with the route of administration or the pharmacology of aflibercept in the study
      population include decreased BCVA, intraocular inflammation, intraocular infection, transient
      and/or sustained elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP), cataract development or
      progression, retinal or intravitreal hemorrhage, macular edema, retinal break or detachment,
      and arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs). Safety will be assessed by visual acuity,
      ophthalmic examinations, fluorescein angiograms, OCT, intraocular pressure, vital signs, and
      adverse event documentation.

      To minimize the risks of intraocular infections, all injections will be performed employing
      sterile techniques as described in Appendix A. Study drug administration will be held for
      subjects who experience certain ocular events or infections. In the event any subject
      develops an adverse event in the study eye that is considered by the evaluating physician to
      be severe in intensity, serious consideration should be given to withdrawing the subject from
      the study.

      The PI or designated Sub-Investigators will review all adverse events on an ongoing basis to
      determine causality and relationship to study drug and/or study procedures.

All subjects will be treated with intravitreal (IVT) aflibercept injections as needed in the presence of clinically relevant diabetic macular edema (CR-DME). If CR-DME is not present the subject will not receive an IVT aflibercept injection and will be observed.
If a subject has recurrent CR-DME they will receive an IVT aflibercept 2.0 mg injection and interval between visits will be reduced to 4 weeks.
At week 12 through end of study, all subjects will be evaluated for focal laser treatment.</description>

Focal laser treatment and focal laser re-treatment will be administered no more than once every 90 days.</description>
