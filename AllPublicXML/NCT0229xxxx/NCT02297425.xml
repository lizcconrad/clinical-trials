      Phase 1 - open label, multi-center, non-randomized, safety, pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamics dose escalation study of PF-06459988 as a single agent in patients with
      advance EGFRm NSCLC (del 19, L858R, +/- T790M). The resulting PF-06459988 dose selected from
      the phase 1 portion will undergo a series of sub-studies to fully characterize the impact of
      food, antacid and CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers. The PK studies are in addition to the MTD
      expansion and will be completed prior to the initiation of Phase 2. Phase 2 is an open label,
      multi-center single-arm study of PF-06459988 for the assessment of antitumor activity in
      patients with advanced EGFRm (del 19 or L858R) NSCLC with T790M.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of histological or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or
             metastatic EGFRm (del19 or L858R) NSCLC that is resistant to standard therapy.
             Patients must have progressed on treatment with an EGFR TKI, and may have also
             received other line of therapy.

          -  Tissue available (formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) block or 10 unstained
             sections (5 micron)

          -  Patients must be willing to participate in additional PK studies as required (cohort
             dependent); patients will be informed of which PK studies are required prior to
             consenting for study participation

          -  Adequate Bone Marrow Function (Complete Blood Count laboratory test results)

          -  Adequate Liver Function (Laboratory test)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously diagnosed brain metastases, unless the patient has completed their
             treatment and has recovered from the acute effects of radiation therapy or surgery
             prior to the study registration, have discontinued corticosteroid treatment for these
             metastases for at least 2 weeks and are neurologically stable

          -  Systemic anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks of starting study treatment excluding EGFR
             TKIs. Patients on EGFR TKIs must discontinue the agent for a minimum of 5 days prior
             to starting study drug

          -  Hypertension that cannot be controlled by medication (150/100 mmHg despite optimal
             medical therapy).
