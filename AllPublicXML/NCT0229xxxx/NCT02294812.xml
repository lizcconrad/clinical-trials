  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are testing whether cognitive training can lead to
      improvements in speech perception for individuals with hearing loss. Individuals will
      complete 20 hours of cognitive training that is designed to improve cognitive abilities such
      as short term memory and attention. The investigators predict that cognitive training that
      improves the cognitive abilities affected by hearing loss will improve speech perception.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Speech Perception in Noise Test - Improvement in speech perception accuracy from baseline to post-training for high and low predictability sentences</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 10, and 18</time_frame>
    <description>Sentences of high predictability and low predictability are played with multi-user talker babble. Participants must repeat the last word of each sentence as they heard it. The primary outcome measure will be the accuracy for repeating the sentence.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Working Memory Cognitive Training - Improvements in working memory abilities from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 10, and 18</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals are asked to participate in 20 hours of cognitive training that will focus on either improving abilities affected by hearing loss (i.e., verbal working memory), or abilities not affected by hearing loss (i.e., spatial working memory).
Performance on the working memory task, Operation Span Task (OSPAN), will be assessed using the total score which is calculated as a sum based on the number of correct answers (letters accurately sequentially recalled) within a block for the duration of the task. Higher scores indicate better working memory capacity. Performance on the working memory cognitive training games will be assessed using the participant's accuracy, reaction time, and final score on the game.
Improvements in working memory will be assessed by comparing participant performance on working memory tasks (OSPAN; cognitive training memory games) before receiving cognitive training, immediately after receiving cognitive training, and eight weeks post-training.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brain Performance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2 and 10</time_frame>
    <description>The Brain Performance Test (BPT) is an assessment tool available online through the training program website. Participants will be assessed at home on their initial performance for a variety of cognitive abilities including stop-signal tasks, grammatical reasoning, and memory spans. After completing the eight weeks of cognitive training, participants will again be assessed at home with the BPT to determine whether there are any improvements in cognitive abilities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attention Cognitive Training - Improvements in attention abilities from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 10, and 18</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals are asked to participate in 20 hours of cognitive training. Cognitive training will focus on either improving abilities affected by hearing loss (i.e., attention), or abilities not affected by hearing loss (i.e., spatial working memory).
Performance on the attention task, Flanker-Simon, will be assessed based on participant's accuracy and reaction time for the Flanker task, and the Simon task.
Performance on the attention cognitive training games will be assessed using the participant's accuracy, reaction time, and final score on the game.
Improvements in attention will be assessed by comparing the performance of participants on attention tasks (Flanker-Simon; cognitive training attention games) before receiving cognitive training, immediately after receiving cognitive training, and eight weeks post-training.</description>

    <description>Participants will engage in eight weeks of training that focuses on improving various cognitive abilities. For example, short term memory.
Cognitive training will take place 30 minutes per day, five days per week, for eight weeks. Training will be done in the participant's own home using web-based software. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the active control group, the control cognitive training group, or the experimental cognitive training group following the second study visit.
After eight weeks, participants will no longer partake in training.</description>
