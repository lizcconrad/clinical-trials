    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies stereotactic body radiation therapy in treating patients with
      high-risk prostate cancer that has not spread to nearby lymph nodes or to other parts of the
      body. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a
      single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause
      less damage to normal tissue. Studying quality of life in patients undergoing stereotactic
      body radiation therapy may help identify the long-term effects of treatment on patients with
      prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with
      high-risk localized prostate cancer compared to historical data from clinical trials.

      II. To establish the safety with physician-reported outcomes after SBRT in patients with high
      risk localized prostate cancer.

      III. To establish the quality of life with patient-reported validated questionnaires after
      SBRT in patients with high risk localized prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo SBRT daily or every other day for a total of 5 fraction not exceeding 14
      consecutive days. Patients may also receive androgen deprivation therapy for up to 9 months
      at the discretion of the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 5 years, and then every 12 months thereafter.

             high-risk factors:
