  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the ability of a new PET scan radiotracer, called FDHT
      (stands for [18F] Dihydro-Testosterone), to better find and monitor prostate cancer.
      Radiotracers are a type of drug that carries small amounts of radioactivity that can be seen
      by the PET scanner. FDHT is a radiotracer that looks for a protein which is present in almost
      all prostate cancer cells. The investigators want to find out if we can find and monitor
      changes in cancer using a FDHT PET scan.

    <measure>increase in standardize uptake values (SUV) between the second and third FDHT scans</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Enrolling 15 patients will provide 80% power to detect a 33% increase in the mean uptake (from 6 to 8) between the 2nd and the 3rd scans.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>correlate AR expression to FDHT uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>involves collecting formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue from pre-treatment biopsy specimens to correlate androgen receptor (AR) expression to FDHT uptake. AR expression will be measured using RNA-seq and correlated with FDHT SUV values separately for each scan using Spearman's rank correlation.</description>

    <description>The diagnostic intervention of this study is the use of FDHT PET in localized prostate cancer. Patients will undergo a 30 minute dynamic scan of the pelvis followed by a whole body scan of approximately 30-minutes duration. The dynamic scan will be optional, but strongly encouraged. PET scanning will preferably be done on the GE Discovery STE PET/CT scanner or the equivalent generation of scanner. The PET scans are routinely &quot;quantitative,&quot; that is corrected for attenuation and scatter and adjusted for system sensitivity and providing parametric images in terms of standardized uptake values (SUV) (= μCi found/gm tissue / μCi injected/gm body mass).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male aged 21 years or older and below 80 years of age.

          -  Signed written informed consent and willingness to comply with protocol requirements.

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer.

          -  Staging imaging workup including a baseline MRI of the prostate and pelvis performed
             at MSKCC.

          -  Baseline imaging to rule out distant metastatic disease (99mTc bone scan, NaF PET,
             total body MRI, or CT chest/abdomen/pelvis)

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70

          -  Clinical criteria required to be eligible:

             a. One of the following i.Pre-treatment PSA ≥10 ng/dL, OR ii. Clinical T-stage
             assessed by digital rectal exam of ≥T2a, OR ii . Radiographic ≥T3a on MRI, OR iv.
             Gleason score of ≥3+4=7 c. Visible intraprostatic tumor foci ≥1 cm in largest
             dimension on T2-weighted images based on initial pre-treatment MRI

          -  Physician recommendation of ADT.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Metastatic disease on standard staging imaging (beyond regional lymph node
             involvement).

             o Absence of metastatic disease (beyond regional lymph node involvement) as defined by
             a negative bone scan, NaF PET, CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, or total body MRI.

          -  Prior treatment of the prostate gland for malignant conditions (surgery, cryotherapy,
             radiotherapy, or photodynamic therapy).

          -  Physician prescription of androgen receptor antagonist therapy (examples:
             bicalutamide, flutamide, or enzalutamide) during time of protocol scans.

             o Note: ADT consists of chemical castration (i.e. degarelix) to remove endogenous DHT.
             Androgen receptor antagonists will bind to the androgen receptor and inhibit FDHT from
             binding.

          -  Patients receiving testosterone supplementation .

          -  Any contraindication to baseline MRI based on departmental MR questionnaire, or
             inability to cooperate for an MRI scan.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to FDHT.

          -  Hepatic laboratory values:

               1. Bilirubin &gt;1.5 x ULN (institutional upper limits of normal)

               2. AST/ALT &gt;2.5 x ULN

               3. Albumin &lt;2 g/dL

          -  Creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dL

          -  Calcium &gt;11 mg/dL

          -  Other serious illness(es) which might preclude completion of this study or interfere
             with determination of causality of any adverse effects experienced in this study.
