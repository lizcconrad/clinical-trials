  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Grass pollen allergens are recognised as a major cause of allergic diseases in humans and
      animals. Worldwide, at least 40% of allergic patients are sensitised to grass pollen
      allergens and between 50-90% of hayfever or seasonal allergy sufferers are allergic to grass
      pollen. ToleroMune Grass is a novel, synthetic, allergen-derived peptide desensitising
      vaccine, currently being developed for the treatment of grass allergy.

      The purpose of this optional observational follow-on study is to further evaluate
      rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms on exposure to Grass in the EEU among subjects who completed all
      dosing visits in study TG002 approximately two years after the start of treatment.

      This is a follow-up study to a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled,
      parallel group clinical study (TG002) which evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability
      of three doses of ToleroMune Grass versus placebo in grass allergic subjects. Subjects who
      completed TG002 in calendar year 2012 will undergo a further single exposure to grass
      allergens in an EEU.
