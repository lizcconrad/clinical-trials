    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of epacadostat (INCB024360) administered
      in combination with atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that have been previously treated with platinum-based
      chemotherapy and Stage IV urothelial carcinoma who have failed a platinum-based chemotherapy
      regimen. The study will be conducted in two phases. The dose escalation phase will utilize a
      3 + 3 design to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or a Pharmacologically Active Dose
      (PAD) of the combination. This will be followed by a dose expansion phase, which will be
      comprised of three cohorts. Expansion Cohorts 1 &amp; 2 will further evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics at the dose identified in
      phase one. Expansion Cohort 3 will evaluate the change in biomarker expression following
      treatment with epacadostat as monotherapy followed by epacadostat and atezolizumab
      administered in combination.
