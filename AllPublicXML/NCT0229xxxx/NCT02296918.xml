          -  Previously untreated disease and 65 years old OR under 65 years old and or refuse or
             are ineligible for chemoimmunotherapy

        All patients must satisfy one of the following criteria for active disease requiring
        therapy:

             evidence of CLL only, with &lt;10% large cells in the bone marrow.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2

          -  Life expectancy of &lt; 2 years or that would confound assessment of toxicity in this
             study

             investigator's opinion, could compromise the subjects' safety, interfere with the
             absorption or metabolism of acalabrutinib, or put the study outcomes at undue risk.

          -  Subjects with active cardiovascular disease not medically controlled or those who have
             had myocardial infarction in the past 6 months, or corrected QT interval (QTc) ≥480

             the stomach or small bowel or gastric bypass, ulcerative colitis, symptomatic
             inflammatory bowel disease, or partial or complete bowel obstruction.

             including radiation.

          -  History of a bleeding diathesis (eg, hemophilia, Von Willebrand disease).

          -  Uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) or idiopathic thrombocytopenia
             purpura.

          -  History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months before the first dose of
             study drug.

          -  Requires or receiving anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K

          -  Requires treatment with proton-pump inhibitors (eg, omeprazole, esomeprazole,
             lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, rabeprazole, or pantoprazole).

          -  Subjects with history of or ongoing drug-induced pneumonitis.

          -  Subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active infection with hepatitis C
