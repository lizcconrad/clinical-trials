    <textblock>
      Accurate diagnosis of food allergy depends on the identification of the causative allergenic
      molecule(s). The proposed study intends to investigate and compare the pattern of IgE
      antibody sensitisation in walnut allergic subjects from three different regions of Europe
      (south (SEU) and central/north (C/NEU), to evaluate the diagnostic utility of a panel of
      novel allergen reagents.

      Accurate diagnosis of food allergy depends on the identification of the causative allergenic
      molecule(s). Thus, full characterization of the major allergens of walnut and their clinical
      importance is an important undertaking.

      The proposed study intends to investigate and compare the pattern of IgE antibody
      sensitisation in walnut allergic subjects from three different regions of Europe (south (SEU)
      and central/north (C/NEU), to evaluate the diagnostic utility of a panel of novel allergen
      reagents.

      With a view towards improved in vitro diagnostic methods, we intend to evaluate the
      diagnostic potential of recombinant walnut allergens in patients with walnut allergy
      confirmed by a positive provocation or supported by a convincing history of anaphylactic
      reaction(s) to walnut in the past, patients with pollinosis but no symptoms of walnut allergy
      and non-atopic control subjects.
