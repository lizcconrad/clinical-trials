  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate toxicity and effectiveness of electrochemotherapy with
      bleomycin in treatment of primary liver tumors in clinical study phase I and II.

      The study will include 10 patients in phase I clinical study and additional 15 patients in
      phase II clinical study (or in the extension of the clinical study), which will fulfill
      inclusion criteria.

      Treatment effectiveness will be evaluated by DCE-US or CT perfusion, to detect early events
      in tumor perfusion after ECT compared to tumor perfusion before ECT. Long term effectiveness
      of the treatment will be evaluated by modified RECIST criteria, which will take into account
      difference in size and density, determined from images obtained by CT perfusion of the
      treated tumor nodules before and after ECT. Tumor volume will be calculated by following
      formula , where a will be shorter and b longer tumor diameter.

      The secondary objectives of the trial are to quantify the impact of the treatment on the
      patient's quality of life, tolerance to the therapy and suitability for larger study to be
      conducted.

      The study will be conducted on patients with primary liver tumors. 10 patients will be
      included in phase I clinical study and additional 15 patients in phase II clinical study (or
      in the extension of the clinical study).

      Depending on the position of tumors, appropriate electrodes will be selected; hexagonal
      needle electrodes with fixed geometry for tumors not larger than 3 cm in diameter, where
      lower edge of the tumor is located up to 3 cm below the liver capsule or longer single needle
      electrodes. Individual electrodes, positioned according to the prepared treatment plan will
      be used for tumors up to 7 cm in diameter, or located near vena cava or large hepatic or
      portal veins.

      Electrochemotherapy will be performed within 8-28 min after intravenous in bolus
      administration of bleomycin (15 mg/m2).

      Triggering of electric pulses will be synchronized with ECG signals, through the ECG
      triggering device AccuSync to avoid delivery of pulses in vulnerable period of the heart.

      All patients will be treated after the procedure has been thoroughly described to them, and
      have signed informed consent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with primary liver tumors; hepatocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic
             cholangiocarcinoma and other primary tumors not larger than 7 cm that are positioned
             in unresectable liver area, near blood vessels in operable patients.

          2. Patients with the progression of the disease (confirmed by radiological imaging) after
             treatment with TACE, RFA or percutaneous alcohol ablation, which are not suitable for
             potentially curative treatment, but with relatively good &quot;performance status&quot; and
             Child-Pugh score &lt; 8.

             Patients from group 1. and 2. are patients, in whom standard treatment procedures are
             not eligible, so ECT will be the only therapeutic option. In patients with multiple
             liver tumors, unresectable tumors which are also unsuitable for RAF will be treated by
             ECT, whereas other tumors will be resected or treated by RAF.

          3. Patients with tumors smaller tumors, not suitable for liver transplantation, but also
             unsuitable for RFA treatment or percutaneous alcohol ablation because of the position
             of the tumor. Electrochemotherapy will be as bridge therapy, till liver
             transplantation.

          4. Patients with tumors&gt; 4 cm in diameter, in difficult to reach locations, and patients
             unsuitable for treatment with other treatment options.

             Patients from group 3. and 4. are patients, potentially curable with standard
             treatment. Electrochemotherapy in these patients will not affect the standard of care
             of these patients, recommended in guidelines for HCC.

          5. Electrochemotherapy is offered to the patients also when they refuse standard
             treatments.

          6. Histologically confirmed primary liver cancer and/or based on radiological imaging
             laboratory tests confirmed primary liver cancer by multidisciplinary team for liver
             tumors.

          7. Age more than 18.

          8. Life expectancy more than 3 month.

          9. Performance status Karnofsky ≥ 70 or (World Health Organization) WHO &lt; or 2.

         10. Treatment free interval 2-5 weeks, depending on the drugs used.

         11. Patient must be mentally capable of understanding the information given.

         12. Patient must give informed consent.

         13. Patient must be discussed at the multidisciplinary team for liver tumors before
             entering the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Secondary primary tumor, except surgically treated noninvasive cancer of cervix, or
             surgically or irradiated basal cell carcinoma

          2. Visceral, bone or diffuse metastases.

          3. Life-threatening infection and/or heart failure and/or liver failure and/or other
             severe systemic pathologies.

          4. Clinically significant ascites.

          5. Significant reduction in respiratory function.

          6. Age less than 18 years.

          7. Coagulation disturbances (those who do not respond on standard treatment with
             vitamin-K or fresh frozen plasma).

          8. Cumulative dose of 250 mg/m2 bleomycin received.

          9. Allergic reaction to bleomycin.

         10. Impaired kidney function (creatinin &gt; 150 µmol/l).

         11. Patients with epilepsy.

         12. Patients with arrhythmias.

         13. Patients with heart failure or pace maker.

         14. Pregnancy.

         15. Patient incapable of understanding the aim of the study or disagree with the entering
             into the clinical study.
