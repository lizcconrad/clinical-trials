  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently the leading cause of death worldwide. Epidemiologic
      studies have shown a diet rich in plant food protects against chronic degenerative diseases
      especially cardiovascular disease. Many of these studies have highlighted a potential role
      for phenolic compounds, which are abundant secondary plant metabolites, and which provide
      antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and are increasingly being shown to have an
      important role in influencing critical cell signalling pathways. A less well known, but
      nevertheless rich source of polyphenolic compounds is seaweed. In Ascophyllum nodosum, a
      common brown alga in the British Isles, polyphenols have been reported to comprise up to 14%
      of the dry weight of the plant. Some studies suggest that the potential antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory benefits of seaweed-derived polyphenols may yield highly bioactive
      components with commercial potential for food and pharma applications. Preliminary work in
      our laboratory has revealed potent antioxidant activity of Ascophyllum nodosum extracts.

      Therefore, the aim of this randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover design
      study is to investigate the biological activity of a food grade seaweed polyphenol extract in
      terms of reducing oxidative damage to DNA, modulation of inflammatory responses and reduction
      on chronic, low level inflammation in vivo. Apparently healthy volunteers (aged 30-65 years)
      will be randomised to receive either a capsule containing 100mg seaweed extract or a matched
      placebo daily for an 8 week period, with an 8 week washout period between each treatment.
      Fasting blood and urine samples will be taken from each volunteer at 4 time-points during the
      study, at baseline and completion of the 2 treatment phases.
