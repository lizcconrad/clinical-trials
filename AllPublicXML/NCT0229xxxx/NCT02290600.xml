    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 12 week feasibility study is to see how much more accurate a continuous
      glucose monitor (CGM) might be in individuals with type 1 diabetes if the investigators
      personalize sensor calibrations to the user, based on previous wear.

      The purpose of this 12 week study is to see how much more accurate a continuous glucose
      monitor (CGM) might be if we personalize the sensor calibration algorithm for each
      individual. The calibration algorithm is a mathematical calculation built into the CGM.
      Currently, the CGM asks for a regular blood test (finger stick) measurement twice a day in
      order to make its calibration algorithm more accurate. Our goal is to keep refining the
      calculating ability so that it will provide personalized blood sugar control throughout the
      day for each individual using the sensor with the CGM.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for at least one year.

          -  The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is based on the investigator's judgment; C peptide
             level and antibody determinations are not needed.

          -  Actively using an insulin pump (CSII therapy) for the last 6 months, and will continue
             to use an insulin pump throughout the trial.

          -  Age 18 to 75 years.

          -  For females, not currently known to be pregnant or nursing.

          -  HbA1c &lt; 9.5%, as measured with DCA2000 or equivalent device.

          -  Willing to perform the calibration of the study CGMs using a finger stick only and
             willing to follow instructions for CGM wear.

          -  Able to and agrees to avoid the following medication starting 24 hours before sensor
             wear through completion of the study: acetaminophen, prednisone.

          -  An understanding of and willingness to follow the protocol and sign the informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy (as determined by a positive blood pregnancy test performed in females of
             childbearing capacity during screening visit and before phase II) or nursing mother.

          -  Diabetic ketoacidosis in the past 6 months prior to enrollment requiring emergency
             room visit or hospitalization.

          -  Severe hypoglycemia resulting in seizure or loss of consciousness in the 6 months
             prior to enrollment.

          -  Current treatment for a seizure disorder: Subjects with a history of seizures may be
             included in the study if they receive written clearance from their neurologist.

          -  A known medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator might interfere
             with the completion of the protocol such as cognitive deficit.

          -  Mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barriers precluding adequate
             understanding or co-operation, including subjects not able to read or write.

          -  Active coronary artery disease or heart failure

          -  Active gastroparesis

          -  If on antihypertensive, thyroid, anti-depressant or lipid lowering medication, lack of
             stability on the medication for the past 2 months prior to enrollment in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled thyroid disease: Adequately treated thyroid disease and celiac disease do
             not exclude subjects from enrollment.

          -  Abuse of alcohol.

          -  A recent injury to body or limb, muscular disorder, use of any medication, any
             carcinogenic disease, or other significant medical disorder if that injury, medication
             or disease in the judgment of the investigator will affect the completion of the
             protocol.

          -  Current use of a beta blocker medication.

          -  A1C â‰¥ 9.5%

          -  Abnormal liver or renal function (Transaminase &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal,
             Creatinine&gt; 1.5 mg/dL)

          -  Labs drawn at screening visit or within two months prior to screening (for other
             purposes) will suffice for enrollment purposes.

          -  Subject has skin conditions that, in the determination of the investigator, would
             preclude wearing the study devices (CGM sensor), in the abdomen or upper buttocks.
             Examples include but are not limited to: psoriasis, burns, scaring, eczema, tattoos,
             and significant hypertrophy at sites of device wear; any known allergy to medical
             adhesives.

          -  Current participation in another investigational trial or has previously participated
             in this study. However, for this study, if the augmented calibration algorithm is
             modified or more data is needed to update the calibration algorithm, subjects will be
             allowed to re-consent for additional studies at the judgment of the investigator.
             Similarly, if there is missing data from the data collection due to device failure,
             transmission errors or other problems, the subject will be allowed to extend the time
             required to continue each phase as per the judgment of the investigator and will not
             be excluded from continuing the study.
