  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose
      study that will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic
      effects of single doses of RG7625 in healthy male and female volunteers.

      The study will employ an interleaved cohort ('leapfrog') design in which dosing is alternated
      between two cohorts and each individual within a cohort will receive study drug dosing on
      four occasions - in effect giving a four treatment, four period, four-way crossover for each
      individual. The minimum duration for each participant is approximately 8 weeks.
