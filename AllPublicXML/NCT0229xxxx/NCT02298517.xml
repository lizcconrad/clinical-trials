  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of the use of breathing exercises with
      inspiratory loading on respiratory muscle strength and endurance, lung volumes and capacities
      and thoracoabdominal mobility in patients after bariatric surgery.

      It is believed that the use of inspiratory load may mitigate the negative effects of surgical
      trauma on respiratory muscle dysfunction, preserving respiratory muscle strength, lung
      volumes and diaphragm mobility, thus reducing the risk of pulmonary complications in the
      postoperative period.

      This is a prospective, randomized and blinded study, where volunteers will be selected
      anthropometric measurements, assessment of lung volumes and capacities, through spirometry,
      thoracoabdominal mobility through the circumference, assessment of inspiratory muscle
      strength and endurance.

      After these evaluations will be done by lottery randomization, where the volunteers will be
      divided into five groups. They are: control, incentive spirometry to flow, the volume
      incentive spirometry, Threshold ™, Power breathe ®, according to their resources to be
      performed during the postoperative period. Each appeal will be held in 6 sets of 15
      repetitions, totaling seven sessions, two in the immediate postoperative period, and five on
      the first postoperative day. At the end of the intervention volunteers will be reassessed.

    <measure>EVALUATION OF INSPIRATORY MUSCLE ENDURANCE</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively and on the high hostitalar - On day 1 and day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The endurance test is performed using the Power breathe ® K3.
According to Basso and Costa (2012), this assessment divided into two tests:
Test incremental: starting with 10 centimeters of water, the volunteer is instructed to breathe normally for two minutes, thereafter a further minute, the next two minutes of exercise load will be increased, and so on until the volunteer fails to reach the predetermined pressure for three consecutive breaths or present dyspnea and / or fatigue. The largest load that is sustained for at least one minute will be considered the value of sustained maximal inspiratory pressure (PImáxS).
Test constant: is conducted PImáxS to 80%, which is obtained in the previous test, and determined the time limit (Tlim) run 30 minutes. The stopping criteria are the same as the incremental test.</description>

    <measure>EVALUATION OF LUNG VOLUMES AND CAPACITIES</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively and on the high hostitalar - On day 1 and day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was carried out according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) (2005). Three types of maneuver were used in order to evaluate the lung volumes and flows: Slow Vital Capacity (SVC), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Maximum Voluntary Ventilation (MVV). The maneuvers were carried out until three acceptable and reproducible curves were obtained, not exceeding more than eight attempts. The values extracted from each maneuver were selected according to Pereira (2002), and the predicted values calculated using the equation proposed by Pereira et al. (1992) for Brazilians.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>THORACOABDOMINAL MOBILITY</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively and on the high hostitalar - On day 1 and day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of thoracoabdominal mobility was performed by using a tape scaled in centimeters. In the standing position, the measurements were made at levels axillary, xiphoid and abdominal during rest, and at maximal inspiration and maximal expiration. At each level, the measurements were performed three times. It computed the highest value of inspiration and the lowest of expiration. The absolute difference between these values was considered the thoracoabdominal mobility.</description>

    <measure>EVALUATION OF MUSCLE STRENGTH INSPIRATORY</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively and on the high hostitalar - On day 1 and day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Sniff is an alternative non-invasive technique for the assessment of inspiratory muscle strength by sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (PNSN). The measurement is performed using a peak pressure generated by nasal nostril during a maximal sniff from functional residual capacity (FRC).
The measurement will be performed with one nostril occluded by a silicone nasal plug, which remained connected to the digital manometer by a catheter approximately 1mm diameter (RUPPEL, 1994). The maneuver is a maximal sniff, with the mouth closed, from functional residual capacity (FRC). The Sniff Test will be held in ten maneuvers, with an interval of 30 seconds between each maneuver, being used as a selection criterion Sniff acceptable to generate a peak pressure regularly and a duration between 0 and 5 sec.</description>

    <description>Was determined for this study that the flow of inspired air will be sufficient to raise up to three spheres. In addition to direct them to do explosive, fast and deep, lifting the ball explosively breaths. Every fifteen inspirations volunteers will be invited to rest for intervals of 30-60 seconds and repeat six times. The use of incentive spirometry was adapted from the recommendations of the American Association for Respiratory Care (1991).</description>

    <description>Use of this incentive spirometry will be done as follows: the participants will be instructed to inhale deeply through the mouthpiece, to total lung capacity, starting from functional residual capacity. Will be performed 6 sets of 15 breaths each (deep, slow and sustained) intervals with 30-60 seconds between each series.</description>

    <description>This group will use the device Threshold™. Where adjustment is considered 40% of PNSN achieved by the patient evaluation. The volunteer will be instructed to remain in a supine position with 45 ° fowler comfortably with arms and shoulders relaxed and perform an inspiration with enough force to overcome the linear load of the device, then make a normal expiration. This study was determined to carry six sets of 15 repetitions. The rest will be about one to two minutes in each intervention.</description>

    <description>To exercise inspiratory muscle in this group will be used device Power breathe ® K2 have the same resistance setting, allowing us to tailor your level of inspiratory muscles. Such adjustment will be made considering 40% of PNSN achieved by the patient in the assessment sniff. For its implementation, the patient will be lying with a tilt of the head of the litter at 45 °, the patient will be asked to inspire to overcome the resistance of the linear unit and after performing a normal expiration. This group will also be achieved 6 series with 15 repetitions each, with an interval of one to two minutes between sets.</description>
