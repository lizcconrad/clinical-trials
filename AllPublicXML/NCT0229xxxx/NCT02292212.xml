    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to obtain performance data on the Asahi ViE-21 dialyzer (ViE-21)
      .
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate specific parameters related to ViE-21 performance
      including (A) Performance evaluated by uremic solute removal rates of urea, creatinine,
      albumin and B2-MG, (B) Determination of KUF, (C) Biocompatibility evaluated by WBC, platelet
      and C3a measurements, (D) Type and number of adverse events, (E) Type and number of device
      malfunctions.

      Prospective, open-label, non-randomized, single-armed, controlled study. Each patient shall
      have data collected for six dialysis sessions each on a control dialyzer prior to and after
      36 sessions with the ViE-21. These data shall be the basis of comparison for the ViE-21
      performance.

      These data will be utilized in support of a US Regulatory Submission.

    <measure>Removal Rate of Urea</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 (Pre-ViE phase), 7, 13 (ViE phase)</time_frame>
    <description>In order to calculate removal rate for urea by a dialysis session, blood samples were collected at pre and post dialysis. The removal rate was obtained by calculation using the following equation with Pre-dialysis concentration (Cpre) and Post-dialysis concentration (Cpost) of urea.
Removal rate (%) = [(Cpre - Cpost) / (Cpre)] * 100. The removal rates were obtained at one session of the first week with control dialyzer (Pre-ViE phase) and then at each one session of weeks 7 and 13 with ViE-21 (ViE phase), respectively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Removal Rate of Creatinine</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 (Pre-ViE phase), 7, 13 (ViE phase)</time_frame>
    <description>In order to calculate removal rate for creatinine by a dialysis session, blood samples were collected at pre and post dialysis. The removal rate was obtained by calculation using the following equation.
Removal rate (%) = [(Cpre - Cpost) / (Cpre)] * 100. The removal rates were obtained at one session of the first week with control dialyzer (Pre-ViE phase) and then at each one session of weeks 7 and 13 with ViE-21 (ViE phase), respectively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Removal Rate of Albumin</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 (Pre-ViE phase), 7, 13 (ViE phase)</time_frame>
    <description>In order to calculate removal rate for albumin by a dialysis session, blood samples were collected at pre and post dialysis. The removal rate was obtained by calculation using the following equation with hematocrit (HCT) at pre (HCTpre) and post (HCTpost).
Removal rate (%) = {1-[HCTpre*(1-HCTpost/100) * Cpost] / [HCTpost * (1-HCTpre/100) * Cpre]} * 100.
The removal rates were obtained at one session of the first week with control dialyzer (Pre-ViE phase) and then at each one session of weeks 7 and 13 with ViE-21 (ViE phase), respectively. The negative removal rate means the increase of serum concentration of albumin from pre to post dialysis session.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Removal Rate of Beta-2-microglobulin (B2-MG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 (Pre-ViE phase), 7, 13 (ViE phase)</time_frame>
    <description>In order to calculate removal rate for B2-MG by a dialysis session, blood samples were collected at pre and post dialysis. The removal rate was obtained by calculation using the following equation.
Removal rate (%) = {1-[HCTpre*(1-HCTpost/100) * Cpost] / [HCTpost * (1-HCTpre/100) * Cpre]} * 100.
The removal rates were obtained at one session of the first week with control dialyzer (Pre-ViE phase) and then at each one session of weeks 7 and 13 with ViE-21 (ViE phase), respectively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ultrafiltration Coefficient (KUF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 or 2 (Pre-ViE phase), 3-8 and 9-14 (ViE phase)</time_frame>
    <description>The KUF is important for regulating the rate and amount of fluid flow across the dialyzer membrane. It is calculated by dividing ultrafiltration rate with the transmembrane pressure (TMP). More specifically, transmembrane pressures were recorded at 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 minutes after the initiation of the dialysis session with adjustment of the ultrafiltration rate at 0, 600, 1000, 1400 and 1800 mL/hr respectively. These determinations were made during the 2nd or 3rd treatment session during the 1st or 2nd week for control dialyzer (Pre-ViE phase), and for ViE-21 during week 3-8 and week 9-14 (ViE phase).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>White Blood Cell (WBC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 (Pre-ViE phase), 7, 13 (ViE phase)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were obtained during the first week of dialysis with control dialyzer and then during weeks 7 and 13 with ViE-21. WBC count was measured pre dialysis, at 15 minutes and post dialysis. The values were corrected with HCT and then leveled by defining the pre-dialysis value as 100%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Platelet</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 (Pre-ViE phase), 7, 13 (ViE phase)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were obtained during the first week of dialysis with control dialyzer and then during weeks 7 and 13 with ViE-21. Platelet count was measured pre dialysis, at 15 minutes and post dialysis. The values were corrected with HCT and then leveled by defining the pre-dialysis value as 100%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Activated Complement Factor III (C3a )</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 (Pre-ViE phase), 7, 13 (ViE phase)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were obtained during the first week of dialysis with control dialyzer and then during weeks 7 and 13 with ViE-21. C3a was measured pre dialysis, at 15 minutes and post dialysis. The values were corrected with HCT and then leveled by defining the pre-dialysis value as 100%.</description>

        <title>Removal Rate of Urea</title>
        <description>In order to calculate removal rate for urea by a dialysis session, blood samples were collected at pre and post dialysis. The removal rate was obtained by calculation using the following equation with Pre-dialysis concentration (Cpre) and Post-dialysis concentration (Cpost) of urea.
Removal rate (%) = [(Cpre - Cpost) / (Cpre)] * 100. The removal rates were obtained at one session of the first week with control dialyzer (Pre-ViE phase) and then at each one session of weeks 7 and 13 with ViE-21 (ViE phase), respectively.</description>

Removal rate (%) = {1-[HCTpre*(1-HCTpost/100) * Cpost] / [HCTpost * (1-HCTpre/100) * Cpre]} * 100.
The removal rates were obtained at one session of the first week with control dialyzer (Pre-ViE phase) and then at each one session of weeks 7 and 13 with ViE-21 (ViE phase), respectively. The negative removal rate means the increase of serum concentration of albumin from pre to post dialysis session.</description>

        <title>Ultrafiltration Coefficient (KUF)</title>
        <description>The KUF is important for regulating the rate and amount of fluid flow across the dialyzer membrane. It is calculated by dividing ultrafiltration rate with the transmembrane pressure (TMP). More specifically, transmembrane pressures were recorded at 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 minutes after the initiation of the dialysis session with adjustment of the ultrafiltration rate at 0, 600, 1000, 1400 and 1800 mL/hr respectively. These determinations were made during the 2nd or 3rd treatment session during the 1st or 2nd week for control dialyzer (Pre-ViE phase), and for ViE-21 during week 3-8 and week 9-14 (ViE phase).</description>

          <title>Ultrafiltration Coefficient (KUF)</title>
          <description>The KUF is important for regulating the rate and amount of fluid flow across the dialyzer membrane. It is calculated by dividing ultrafiltration rate with the transmembrane pressure (TMP). More specifically, transmembrane pressures were recorded at 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 minutes after the initiation of the dialysis session with adjustment of the ultrafiltration rate at 0, 600, 1000, 1400 and 1800 mL/hr respectively.
