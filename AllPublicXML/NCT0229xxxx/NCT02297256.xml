    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, prospective randomized clinical study intended to compare and
      evaluate the efficacy of subjects who are treated with bone marrow aspirate concentrate
      (BMAC) and allograft to iliac crest bone grafts (ICBG) during posterior lumbar/lumbosacral
      spinal fusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who are candidates for posterior lumbar or lumbosacral spinal fusion without
      anterior interbody support will be screened for inclusion in the study. Participants will be
      enrolled and randomized to either the BMAC + allograft or ICBG group. An enrollment ratio of
      two BMAC + allograft to one ICBG subject (2:1) for up to a total of 40 subjects will be
      enrolled in the study which also accounts for failed screening subjects. The study will
      determine and compare differences in fusion rate and health related quality of life
      parameters at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively.

    <description>Subjects will be treated with bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) and allograft during posterior lumbar/lumbosacral spinal fusion. During lumbar spine surgery, 12 teaspoons of bone marrow will be taken (aspirated) from one side of hip bone. This may be repeated on the other side of hip bone for a total of 12, 24, or 36 teaspoons of bone marrow total taken from your hip bone depending on the decision made by the surgeon. The bone marrow will then be concentrated with a machine for 15 minutes to a final volume of 2, 4, or 6 teaspoons of BMAC. BMAC will be combined with packed allograft bone chips using another machine to produce two or three constructed bone logs. The bone logs will be laid along the backside of the spine and between each vertebral body.</description>

    <description>Subjects who are in the Iliac Crest Bone Graft arm will be treated with Iliac crest bone grafts (ICBG) during posterior lumbar/lumbosacral spinal fusion. During lumbar spine surgery, the surgeon will make an incision to expose the iliac crest (hip bone), and cutting out the segments of the bone that will be needed, based on the decision of the surgeon. The bone chips will be laid along the backside of the spine and also between each vertebral body where the bone will fuse into place. When the bone becomes solid/fused, there is no movement in the fused spine.</description>
