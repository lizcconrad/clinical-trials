  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator will determine a compliance of two diagnostic techniques (EIT and Body
      plethysmography) in collective of children and teenagers with obstructive lung disease and a
      matched control group.

      The aim of the present study is verification of the correlation between EIT-derived data and
      following extracted parameters of the pulmonary function:

        -  forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1)

        -  forced vital capacity (FVC)

        -  relative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1/FVC)

        -  maximal expiratory flow (MEF 25)

        -  total lung capacity (TLC)

        -  resistance (Raw).

      These findings could bring out new prospective opportunity for pulmonary function tests
      without cooperation.

      Furthermore, the study aims to clarify whether EIT technique can be used for regional
      pulmonary function testing.

      In addition, dynamic lung function parameter and static radiological techniques will be
      correlated with EIT.

    <description>The 16-electrode belt will be applied to patient's chest. Following vital signs will be recorded: respiratory rate at rest breathing, heart rate, transcutaneous oxygen saturation. Then impulse oscillometry (IOS) will be performed in a sitting position. After that, subjects with cooperation willingness will get a body plethysmography. A spirometry / forced breathing maneuvers will be performed. All patients will receive 2 strokes salbutamol inhaler for bronchospasmolysis. Please note that inhalation of salbutamol is not study related. It is used in the clinical routine to examine the reversibility of the bronchial obstruction in patients with obstructive lung disease in course of the lung function test. Ten minutes later measurements described above will be repeated.</description>
