    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ziv-aflibercept when given
      together with pembrolizumab in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other
      places in the body. Ziv-afibercept works by decreasing blood and nutrient supply to the
      tumor, which may result in shrinking the tumor. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab,
      may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Giving ziv-aflibercept
      together with pembrolizumab may be a better treatment for patients with advanced solid
      tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety, tolerability and recommended phase II dosing for the combination
      of ziv-aflibercept plus MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in patients with unresectable stage III or
      stage IV melanoma, renal cell cancer, ovarian cancer, or colorectal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary estimates of progression-free survival at 6 months. II. To obtain
      preliminary estimates of the rate of 1-year overall survival. III. To obtain preliminary
      estimates of the response rate. IV. To obtain preliminary estimates of time to progression.
      V. To perform a pilot assessment of positron emission tomography (PET) response versus
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) versus immune-related response criteria
      (irRC) criteria.

      VI. To perform correlative sciences that provide information regarding the mechanisms of
      action for this combination treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ziv-aflibercept.

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 30 minutes and
      ziv-aflibercept IV over 1-2 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 2 weeks for up to 2 years in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 12 weeks.
