    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether fixed-doses of an investigational drug,
      SD-809 (deutetrabenazine), will reduce the severity of abnormal involuntary movements of
      tardive dyskinesia.

    <measure>Change in Total Motor Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Score From Baseline to Week 12 Using a Mixed Model For Repeated Measures (MMRM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Baseline), Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>AIMS is an assessment tool used to detect and follow the severity of tardive dyskinesia (TD) over time. AIMS is composed of 12 clinician-administered and scored items. The exam was digitally video recorded using a standard protocol, and independently reviewed by blinded central raters who were experts in movement disorders.
This outcome sums items 1 through 7 which cover orofacial movements, as well as extremity and truncal dyskinesia (the total motor AIMS score). Ratings were based on a 5-point scale of severity from 0 (none), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe) for a total scale of 0-28. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement.
MMRM with treatment group, visit, treatment group-by-visit interaction, and baseline use of dopamine receptor antagonist (DRAs) as fixed effects and the baseline value as a covariate. The model was fit using an unstructured covariance structure.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Considered a Treatment Success at Week 12 as Assessed by the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGIC is a single-item questionnaire that asks the investigator to assess a patient's TD symptoms at specific visits after initiating therapy. The CGIC uses a 7 point Likert Scale, ranging from very much worse (-3) to very much improved (+3), to assess overall response to therapy.
A treatment success was defined as &quot;much improved&quot; or &quot;very much improved&quot; at the week 12 visit.
Patients whose status at week 12 was not known, as well as patients who were not &quot;much improved&quot; or &quot;very much improved&quot; at the week 12 visit, were considered treatment failures.
The success 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated with the Wilson (score) confidence limits.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Modified Craniocervical Dystonia Questionnaire (mCDQ-24) Total Score From Baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (Baseline), Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CDQ-24 is a disease-specific quality of life questionnaire developed for use in patients with craniocervical dystonia, including both cervical dystonia (CD) and blepharospasm (BPS). The CDQ 24 was modified such that the questions focus more directly on the impact of TD (as opposed to CD/BPS) on quality of life.
The following domains are evaluated in the mCDQ-24: stigma, emotional well-being, pain, activities of daily living, and social/family life. Each of the 24 questions were rated by patients on a scale of 0=no impairment to 4=severest impairment for a total scale of 0 - 96. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement.
For patients with missing data at week 12, the baseline or last available value was used as the week 12 value.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 0 (Baseline), Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Responders who had a 50% or greater improvement in total motor modified AIMS at Week 12 as compared to baseline were reported as a percentage of participants with an outcome at Week 12. The responder 95% CI is calculated with the Wilson (score) confidence limits.

    <measure>Participants With Adverse Events During the Overall Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents normal daily activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator and includes possibly, probably and definitely related categories. Serious AEs (SAE) include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

          <title>Modified Craniocervical Dystonia Questionnaire (mCDQ-24)</title>
          <description>The CDQ-24 is a disease-specific quality of life questionnaire developed for use in patients with craniocervical dystonia, including both cervical dystonia (CD) and blepharospasm (BPS). The CDQ 24 was modified such that the questions focus more directly on the impact of TD (as opposed to CD/BPS) on quality of life. Each of the 24 questions was rated by patients on a scale of 0=no impairment to 4=severest impairment for a total scale of 0 – 96.</description>
          <population>One participant in the SD-809 12 mg/day group was missing a baseline mCDQ-24 total score.</population>

        <title>Change in Total Motor Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Score From Baseline to Week 12 Using a Mixed Model For Repeated Measures (MMRM)</title>
        <description>AIMS is an assessment tool used to detect and follow the severity of tardive dyskinesia (TD) over time. AIMS is composed of 12 clinician-administered and scored items. The exam was digitally video recorded using a standard protocol, and independently reviewed by blinded central raters who were experts in movement disorders.
This outcome sums items 1 through 7 which cover orofacial movements, as well as extremity and truncal dyskinesia (the total motor AIMS score). Ratings were based on a 5-point scale of severity from 0 (none), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe) for a total scale of 0-28. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement.

        <title>Percentage of Patients Considered a Treatment Success at Week 12 as Assessed by the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC)</title>
        <description>The CGIC is a single-item questionnaire that asks the investigator to assess a patient’s TD symptoms at specific visits after initiating therapy. The CGIC uses a 7 point Likert Scale, ranging from very much worse (–3) to very much improved (+3), to assess overall response to therapy.
A treatment success was defined as “much improved” or “very much improved” at the week 12 visit.
Patients whose status at week 12 was not known, as well as patients who were not “much improved” or “very much improved” at the week 12 visit, were considered treatment failures.
The success 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated with the Wilson (score) confidence limits.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Patients Considered a Treatment Success at Week 12 as Assessed by the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC)</title>
          <description>The CGIC is a single-item questionnaire that asks the investigator to assess a patient’s TD symptoms at specific visits after initiating therapy. The CGIC uses a 7 point Likert Scale, ranging from very much worse (–3) to very much improved (+3), to assess overall response to therapy.
A treatment success was defined as “much improved” or “very much improved” at the week 12 visit.
Patients whose status at week 12 was not known, as well as patients who were not “much improved” or “very much improved” at the week 12 visit, were considered treatment failures.
The success 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated with the Wilson (score) confidence limits.</description>

        <title>Change in the Modified Craniocervical Dystonia Questionnaire (mCDQ-24) Total Score From Baseline to Week 12</title>
        <description>The CDQ-24 is a disease-specific quality of life questionnaire developed for use in patients with craniocervical dystonia, including both cervical dystonia (CD) and blepharospasm (BPS). The CDQ 24 was modified such that the questions focus more directly on the impact of TD (as opposed to CD/BPS) on quality of life.
The following domains are evaluated in the mCDQ-24: stigma, emotional well-being, pain, activities of daily living, and social/family life. Each of the 24 questions were rated by patients on a scale of 0=no impairment to 4=severest impairment for a total scale of 0 – 96. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement.
For patients with missing data at week 12, the baseline or last available value was used as the week 12 value.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Had a 50% or Greater Reduction in Total Motor Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) From Baseline to Week 12</title>
        <description>Responders who had a 50% or greater improvement in total motor modified AIMS at Week 12 as compared to baseline were reported as a percentage of participants with an outcome at Week 12. The responder 95% CI is calculated with the Wilson (score) confidence limits.
AIMS is an assessment tool used to detect and follow the severity of TD over time. AIMS is composed of 12 clinician-administered and scored items. The exam was digitally video recorded using a standard protocol, and independently reviewed by blinded central raters who were experts in movement disorders.
This outcome sums items 1 through 7 which cover orofacial movements, as well as extremity and truncal dyskinesia (the total motor AIMS score). Ratings were based on a 5-point scale of severity from 0 (none), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe) for a total scale of 0-28. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Cumulative Percentage of Responders Based on Change in in Total Motor Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Score From Baseline to Week 12 Recorded in Incremental Steps of 10 Percentage Points</title>
        <description>AIMS is an assessment tool used to detect and follow the severity of TD over time, composed of 12 clinician-administered and scored items. The exam was digitally video recorded using a standard protocol, and independently reviewed by blinded central raters who were experts in movement disorders.
This outcome sums items 1 through 7 which cover orofacial movements, as well as extremity and truncal dyskinesia (the total motor AIMS score). Ratings were based on a 5-point scale of severity from 0 (none), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe) for a total scale of 0-28. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement.
Participants with missing data are classified as non-responders. The responder 95% CI is calculated with the Wilson (score) confidence limits. If any of the expected cell counts are &lt; 5, exact Clopper Pearson limits are presented.
Data report the percentage of participants who responded to the percentage improvement indicated in each row.</description>

        <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents normal daily activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator and includes possibly, probably and definitely related categories. Serious AEs (SAE) include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>
