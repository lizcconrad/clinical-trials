  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the intranasal fentanyl in pain
      induced by wound care and rehabilitation in the elderly. The project would also provide a
      preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of intranasal fentanyl used in procedural pains.

      This is a safety clinical trial. This trial is monocentric, open label, non-randomized.

      Sixty elderly patients will be enrolled in this study, 30 with bedsore cares and 30 with
      rehabilitation sessions.

      Six bedsore cares or rehabilitation sessions will be assessed for each subject. For each
      session, patient pain will be evaluated using a visual analogic scale VAS at different times,
      before session, 5 minutes then 20 minutes after the beginning of the session, and a last VAS
      1 hour after the end of the session. During the two first sessions, patients do not receive
      Pecfent® to assess their basal pain. During the following four sessions, patients will
      receive transmucosal fentanyl, 10 minutes before care.

      An evaluation of respiratory rate and of the level of sedation will occur at different time :
      after 5 minutes then 20 minutes of care, at the end of the care session,at half an hour then
      one hour after the care session.

      At the end of sessions,

        -  The nurse or physiotherapist will assess their satisfaction regarding the objectives
           achieved during the session with a four points verbal descriptor scale (very satisfied,
           satisfied, not much satisfied, not satisfied). They will also evaluate at the end of the
           four last session their satisfaction regarding the convenience of the use of pecfent®
           and its contribution towards care.

        -  Patients will assess their satisfaction regarding the course of the session with a
           verbal descriptor scale (VDS) and their level of anxiety felt during the session with a
           VAS.

    <description>The nature and frequency of adverse effects will be described.
