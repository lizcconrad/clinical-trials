      This is an open label, long-term extension study in approximately 24 male DMD subjects
      consisting of children (ages 4-12, inclusive) and adolescents (ages 13-16, inclusive) who
      participated in the MP-104-CL-005 PK study.

      Subjects may have received up to 8 (+2 days) doses of deflazacort during the MP-104-CL-005 PK
      study, at which point treatment will be continued at the same dose and frequency until such
      time that deflazacort becomes commercially available or the study is terminated. Concomitant
      corticosteroid therapy will be prohibited during the study while the subject is taking
      deflazacort.

      Subjects will be given medication to take at home for once-daily, morning dosing following
      the 8 hour PK sample on Day 8 (+2 days) of the MP-104-CL-005 PK study. Subjects will begin
      dosing at home the day following Day 8 (+2 days) of the MP-104-CL-005 PK study.

      Safety will be monitored throughout the study by repeated clinical and laboratory evaluations
      every 3 months for the first year, and then every 3 or 6 months, depending on subjects'
      disease status.

      Subjects will be contacted via telephone between study visits to determine if any adverse
      events (AE) have occurred since the last study visit. Subjects who terminate the study early
      will be contacted if the Principal Investigator (PI) deems necessary.

      Treatment will be continued for a maximum of three years or until such time that deflazacort
      becomes commercially available or the study is terminated.

          -  If above the age of 7, the subject signs and dates a written, informed assent form
             (IAF) and any required privacy authorization prior to the initiation of any study
             procedures. Subjects under age 7 at the time of study entry who turn age 7 will sign
             and date a written informed assent form (IAF) at the visit following their 7th
             birthday, if required by the site's IRB.

          -  Subject participated in and received at least one dose of study medication in the
             MP-104-CL-005 protocol.

          -  The subject must have confirmed diagnosis of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy defined as:

               2. proximal muscle weakness;

               3. increased serum creatine kinase more than 10 times the upper limit of normal
                  (ULN);

               4. muscle biopsy and dystrophin analyses consistent with DMD or DNA mutation and
                  analysis by PCR or Southern blot techniques to detect gene deletions.
