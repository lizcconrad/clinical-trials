  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial phase I/II, double blind, randomized to compare in two groups of
      patients to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the autologous mesenchymal stem cells from
      the adipose tissue (CMMAd) in the treatment of the faecal incontinence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the phase of recruitment, of 20 months of duration, there will be included 16 participants
      who will be randomized to one of the groups of intervention (8 patients group CMMAd / 8
      patients group placebo). The phase of follow-up of every patient will be 12 months, though,
      provided that these patients are seen regularly in the study sites of the study, once
      concluded his follow-up will be continued to be able to obtain safety information and
      efficacy to 24 months.
