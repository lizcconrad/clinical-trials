  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single center, randomized, controlled trial will compare the manual standard bone marrow
      aspiration device to the powered ported bone marrow aspiration device for use in the iliac
      crest in healthy adult volunteers. The study will compare the subjects' perceived level of
      pain, time to sample acquisition, and quality of specimen yield of these devices. To serve as
      their own control, each subject will receive bilateral bone marrow aspiration procedures
      using both the manual standard and powered ported devices.

      This single center, randomized, controlled trial will compare the manual standard bone marrow
      aspiration needle to the power ported aspiration needle for use in the posterior iliac crest
      of healthy volunteers for bone marrow aspiration specimen collection. The study will compare
      the quality of specimen yield of the devices, subject reported level of pain with needle
      insertion and aspiration, and time from needle/skin contact to needle insertion and to sample
      acquisition. Each subject will serve as his/her own control and will receive bilateral bone
      marrow aspiration procedures using both the manual standard and power ported needles. The
      order in which the devices are used for each subject's procedures and on which side each
      device will be used will be randomized.
