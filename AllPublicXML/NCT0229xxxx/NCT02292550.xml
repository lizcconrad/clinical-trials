    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/II study of the ALK inhibitor ceritinib in combination with the CDK4/6
      inhibitor LEE011 in patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the MTD/RP2D of the LEE011 and ceritinib combination
      and evaluate whether the combination is safe and has beneficial effects in ALK-positive
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients.

      In Sep-2016, Novartis made a decision not to move into phase ll after the primary objective
      for this study was met. Because the study never made it to phase ll, the study phase has been
      changed from a phase l/ll to a phase l.

          -  Patients must be diagnosed with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC. The tumor must be
             ALK-positive as determined by ALK rearrangement in ≥15% of cells (as measured by FISH
             using the Vysis break-apart ALK probe) or by using the Ventana ALK IHC test. The
             analysis may be performed locally.

          -  Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.

        For ALK inhibitor naïve patients:

        o A representative tumor sample must be submitted. An archival tumor specimen is acceptable

        For patients after progression on an ALK inhibitor:

        o A new tumor biopsy is required unless a biopsy performed after progression on the
        patient's most recent ALK inhibitor is available for submission For all patients a newly
        obtained tumor specimen must be submitted if no appropriate archival sample is available.
        In the event that no sample is available and a new biopsy cannot be obtained, enrollment
        may be considered after discussion with the sponsor.

             cause Torsades de Pointe that cannot be discontinued or replaced by safe alternative
             medication (e.g. within 5 half-lives or 7 days prior to starting study drug)

          -  Inability to determine the QTcF interval Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias
             (e.g., ventricular tachycardia), complete left bundle branch block, high-grade AV
