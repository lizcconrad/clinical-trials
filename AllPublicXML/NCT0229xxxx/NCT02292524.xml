      Prostate Biomarkers in Men Consuming Tomato Products

    <textblock>
      Participants completed a minimum week-long washout period without consumption of tomato
      products prior to randomization to one of four dietary interventions. Men were randomized to
      one of the following dietary interventions: a controlled low lycopene diet (≤ 5 mg/d from
      foods), daily Prego® spaghetti sauce, daily V8® vegetable juice, or daily Campbell's® Tomato
      Soup. Each of the tomato products provided between 25 and 35 mg lycopene per day. In order to
      provide this dietary intervention in typical serving sizes in the context of a usual diet but
      devoid of other tomato sources, participants kept daily logs documenting compliance with the
      intervention product and a tomato-restricted diet from enrollment to the day of surgery (~3
      weeks). Study participants were asked to complete an abbreviated dietary history
      questionnaire (to establish typical consumption patterns of various tomato products) and two
      separate 3-day diet food records, once during the washout and once during the intervention
      period. Blood and 24-hour urine samples were obtained at two time points, after the one-week
      washout phase and at the end of the dietary intervention period. Fresh prostate samples were
      obtained at time of surgery.
