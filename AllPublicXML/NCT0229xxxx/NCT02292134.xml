  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep architecture is deeply altered in intensive care unit (ICU patients). Among factors
      involved in poor sleep quality are environmental factors, such as light and noise, which are
      an unavoidable consequence of cares.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the benefit of earplug and sleep mask on sleep
      architecture and quality in ICU patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well demonstrated that sleep architecture is deeply altered in intensive care unit (ICU
      patients). The consequences of this alteration are multiple: neuropsychological complication
      such as delirium, long-term sequels such as post-traumatic stress disorders, alteration of
      the circadian fluctuation of various hormones with well demonstrated deleterious impact,
      alteration of the immune response that may promote nosocomial infections and, finally, a
      decrease of respiratory muscle endurance that may compromise weaning from mechanical
      ventilation.

      Various mechanisms contribute to sleep alteration in ICU patients, including intrinsic
      factors linked to disease severity, factors related to therapies such as mechanical
      ventilation and sedation, and environmental factors. Among environmental factors, light and
      noise are an unavoidable consequence of cares that strongly contribute to sleep alteration in
      ICU patients. It is of notice that few studies have focused on strategies to protect ICU
      patients against noise and light such as the systematic use of earplug and sleep mask.
      Although the benefit of earplug and sleep mask on sleep quality has been demonstrated in
      healthy subjects submitted to an environment similar to ICU, it has never been evaluated in
      ICU patients.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the benefit of earplug and sleep mask (designated as
      &quot;protective strategy) on sleep architecture and quality in ICU patients.
