  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroglobin has shown rich neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia and hypoxia, and
      therefore has the potential to impact outcomes after acute ischemic stroke. Hypoxia inducible
      factor (HIF)-1α is neuroprotective in several models of experimental brain injury and is
      increased in brain after acute cerebral infarction in humans and experimental animals.The
      investigators sought to examine the changes in serum neuroglobin and HIF-1α concentrations in
      patients with acute ischemic stroke during the initial 96-h period after stroke and assessed
      the relation between them and the relation of them to prognosis of such patients with acute
      ischemic stroke.

        The patient group comprised 24 male and 16 female. Their age ranged from 42 to 76 years.
        Locations of infarct, as evidenced by radiologic and neurologic symptoms or signs, included
        the territories of the middle cerebral artery (13 cases), the posterior cerebral artery (9
        cases) the anterior cerebral artery (8 cases), vertebrobasilar area (7 cases), and
        watershed area (3 cases with cortical and subcortical low densities crossing typical
        vascular territories).
