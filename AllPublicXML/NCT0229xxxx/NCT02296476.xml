  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study of single-agent MK-8628 (formerly known as OTX015) in recurrent GBM after standard
      front-line therapy failure.

      The first phase of the study (dose escalation) will determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD). MTD assessment will be based using dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed during the
      first 28 days of treatment.

      The second phase of the study (expansion cohort) will assess efficacy as measured by the
      progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS-6) as determined by an independent central
      review committee.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival was the time from the start of study treatment to the date of clinical or radiographic evidence of progressive disease according to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) 2010 criteria or death. Progression, as assessed by RANO 2010, was defined as a ≥25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions; any new lesion; or clinical deterioration. PFS at 6 months was measured as the percentage of participants who were alive and progression-free at Month 6. PFS at 6 months was calculated for all participants who were actively enrolled in the study at the 6-month time point.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the number of participants in the analysis population who experienced a Complete Response (CR: complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non-measurable disease sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions; no corticosteroids; and stable or improved clinically) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥50% decrease compared with baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions; stable or reduced corticosteroid dose; and stable or improved clinically) and was assessed using RANO 2010.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>DOR was the time from the first documented CR (complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non-measurable disease sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions; no corticosteroids; and stable or improved clinically)or PR (≥50% decrease compared with baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions; stable or reduced corticosteroid dose; and stable or improved clinically), as assessed by RANO 2010, until documentation of disease progression, or the date of the last tumor assessment (if there was no documented progression), or the last tumor assessment before the start of further antitumor therapy. DOR was calculated for all participants who experienced a CR or PR.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>OS was the time from the start of study treatment to the date of death. Participants were to be censored at their last contact if they were still alive at the cut-off date. OS was calculated for all participants who did not discontinue from the study due to disease progression.</description>

    <description>Progression-free survival was the time from the start of study treatment to the date of clinical or radiographic evidence of progressive disease according to RANO 2010 criteria or death. Progression, as assessed by RANO 2010, was defined as a ≥25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions; any new lesion; or clinical deterioration.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition temporally associated with the use of the product was also an AE. The number of participants who experienced at least one AE is presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Toxicity Grade 3-5 AE</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition temporally associated with the use of the product was also an AE. The number of participants who experienced ≥1 Grade 3-5 AE per National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 criteria is presented. Grade 3 was classified as severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or limiting self-care; Grade 4 was classified as potentially life-threatening or disabling; and Grade 5 was an AE resulting in death.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS) at 6 Months</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival was the time from the start of study treatment to the date of clinical or radiographic evidence of progressive disease according to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) 2010 criteria or death. Progression, as assessed by RANO 2010, was defined as a ≥25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions; any new lesion; or clinical deterioration. PFS at 6 months was measured as the percentage of participants who were alive and progression-free at Month 6. PFS at 6 months was calculated for all participants who were actively enrolled in the study at the 6-month time point.</description>
        <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
        <population>All participants who received at least 2 complete cycles (8 weeks) of treatment and had a baseline assessment and 1 on-study magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Since no participants reached the 6-month time point in the study, PFS at 6 months could not be calculated.</population>

          <description>OS was the time from the start of study treatment to the date of death. Participants were to be censored at their last contact if they were still alive at the cut-off date. OS was calculated for all participants who did not discontinue from the study due to disease progression.</description>
          <population>All participants who received at least 2 complete cycles (8 weeks) of treatment and had a baseline assessment and 1 on-study MRI or had discontinued early due to disease progression. Since all participants discontinued the study due to disease progression, OS could not be calculated.</population>

        <description>Progression-free survival was the time from the start of study treatment to the date of clinical or radiographic evidence of progressive disease according to RANO 2010 criteria or death. Progression, as assessed by RANO 2010, was defined as a ≥25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions; any new lesion; or clinical deterioration. PFS was measured as the number of participants who were alive and progression-free for up to 6 months.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were obtained at specified time points for the PK analysis of AUC 0-∞ of MK-8628. MK-8628 concentrations were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a tandem mass spectrometry. The AUC 0-∞ was estimated indirectly using the dose and CL/F values. The AUC 0-∞ of MK-8628 after oral administration is presented.</description>
