      This study will investigate the metabolic fate and routes of excretion of 14CAZD0914 in six
      male healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single dose study in 6 healthy male subjects aged 18 to 55 years. Each
      subject will be admitted to the clinical pharmacology unit on the day prior to dosing Check
      in (Day -1) and will remain in the clinical pharmacology unit until up to at least target Day
      8 (168 hours post-dose).

      All subjects will receive 3000 mg AZD0914 incorporating 18.5 MBq (500 Ci) of [14C]
      administered as a single oral dose following at least an 8 hour fast from food. Subjects can
      have water. For specific food and water restrictions.

      This study will investigate the metabolic fate and routes of excretion of AZD0914.

    <description>Maximum observed concentration (Cmax), time to maximum observed concentration (tmax), area under the concentration-time curve from hour 0 to the last measurable concentration (AUC0-t), area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-inf), apparent terminal elimination rate constant (lambdaZ), apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), apparent clearance (Cl/F) (oral and AZD0914 only), and apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) (AZD0914 only). Ratios for area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity including the ratio of total radioactivity in whole blood/plasma and the ratio of non-radiolabeled AZD0914 in plasma/total radioactivity in plasma, will be calculated as appropriate.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Urine and Feces PK Parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 11 days</time_frame>
    <description>The following pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated, whenever possible, based on the urine total radioactivity concentrations: amount excreted in urine (Aeu) over the sampling interval, renal clearance (CLR), and the percent excreted in urine (%Feu). For fecal total radioactivity concentrations, the following pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated for [14C] AZD0914 derived radioactivity: amount excreted in feces (Aef) over the sampling interval and the percent excreted in feces (%Fef).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male subjects between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive, at the time of
             consent with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venipuncture;

          2. Subjects must be able to understand and be willing to comply with study procedures,
             restrictions, and requirements;

          3. Within body mass index (BMI) range 19 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive, at screening;

          4. Non-smokers in past 6 months;

          5. In good health, as determined by no clinically significant findings from medical
             history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, and vital signs as judged by the
             Investigator;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Significant history or clinical manifestation of any metabolic, allergic,
             dermatological, hepatic, renal, hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular,
             gastrointestinal, neurological, or psychiatric disease or disorder which, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of
             participation in the study, interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism or
             excretion of drugs, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate
             in the study;

          2. Any clinically significant abnormalities in rhythm, conduction, or morphology of the
             resting ECG and any clinically significant abnormalities in the 12-lead ECG as
             considered by the Investigator that may interfere with the interpretation of QT
             interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) changes;

          3. Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, hematology, or UA
             results as judged by the Investigator;

          4. Abnormal vital signs, after 10 minutes supine rest, confirmed by repeat, defined as
             any of the following: systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or &gt;140 mmHg; diastolic blood
             pressure &lt;50 mmHg or &gt;90 mmHg; or heart rate &lt;40 or &gt;100 beats per minute;

          5. Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4
             weeks of the first administration of IP;
