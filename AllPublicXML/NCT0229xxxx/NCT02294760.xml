  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent randomised, controlled, crossover study has shown that sacral nerve stimulation
      (SNS) significantly reduces symptoms and improves quality of life of highly selected patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Relief of IBS symptoms during SNS is associated with
      consistent changes in rectal sensitivity and biomechanical wall properties.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate long-term efficacy of sacral nerve stimulation on
      symptoms and quality of life in patients with IBS in a randomised, placebo-controlled,
      crossover study.

    <textblock>
      Twenty two patients with IBS-D or IBS-M according to the ROME III criteria, will be enrolled
      by invitation in the study.

      Having meet inclusion criteria, the patients are first set subsensory for 4 weeks and then
      randomised to receive either OFF-subsensory or subsensory-OFF stimulation in a 4+4-week
      period.

      During the PNE test the effect of the stimulation is evaluated by specific IBS symptom and
      quality of life questionnaires (GSRS-IBS and IBS-IS) and bowel habit diaries.
