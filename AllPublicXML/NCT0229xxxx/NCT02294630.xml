  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), caused by surfactant deficiency, is the leading cause of
      mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. Intratracheal instillation, the only approved
      means of surfactant delivery, requires endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation
      with their attendant risks. Interventions that decrease need for intubation and mechanical
      ventilation like noninvasive ventilation (NIV) including nasal continuous positive airway
      pressure, high flow nasal cannula or nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation are
      increasingly being used for initial respiratory support in preterm neonates with RDS to
      improve outcomes. Aerosolized surfactant delivered during NIV is an innovative and promising
      concept for the treatment of RDS - retaining the advantages of early surfactant with alveolar
      recruitment while obviating the risks of intubation and mechanical ventilation. The
      investigators overall hypothesis is that treatment of RDS with aerosolized surfactant in
      preterm infants undergoing NIV is safe and feasible and will result in short-term improvement
      in oxygenation and ventilation. The objective of this proposal is to perform a single-center
      unblinded Phase II randomized clinical trial of aerosolized surfactant for the treatment of
      RDS in preterm neonates undergoing NIV. Funding Source - FDA-OOPD.
