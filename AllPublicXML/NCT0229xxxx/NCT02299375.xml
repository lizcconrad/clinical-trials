  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-centre study evaluating 15
      milligram (mg) twice daily/ Bi-daily (BID) of losmapimod versus placebo, in addition to
      standard of care (SoC).

      The primary objective of this study is to explore the therapeutic potential of losmapimod as
      a treatment to reduce the rate of exacerbations in the subset of participants with
      moderate-to-severe COPD who are at high risk of exacerbation, having experienced two or more
      moderate/severe exacerbations in the preceding 12 months, and who have &lt;=2% of blood
      eosinophils at screening. As secondary objectives safety, effects on lung function, quality
      of life, pharmacokinetic (PK), biomarkers of both disease and inflammation shall be
      evaluated.

      The duration of the treatment period is variable but will be at least 26 weeks and up to a
      maximum of 52 weeks, with the end of study date being established once the final participant
      has been randomized. The purpose of the variable dosing regimen is to enable participants to
      remain in the study for a longer duration, as it is anticipated that this will increase the
      likelihood of observing exacerbation events without increasing the overall study duration. It
      will also enable safety data on dosing periods beyond 6 months to be generated.

      Approximately 200 participants in a 1:1 ratio between losmapimod and placebo will be
      randomized to the study. Sample size re-estimation will be performed during the course of the
      study to potentially increase the sample size up to a maximum of 600 participants.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  COPD diagnosis and severity: Participants with a clinical history of COPD (established
             by a physician) in accordance with the following definition by the American Thoracic
             Society/European Respiratory Society, for at least 6 months prior to enrolment.
             Participants must have evidence of airflow obstruction, defined as post-bronchodilator
             FEV1 equal to or less than 80% of predicted normal value calculated using &quot;Third
             National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&quot; (NHANES III) reference equation at
             Visit 1 and a FEV1 / FVC ratio &lt;=70% at Screening (Visit 1). Note: Post-bronchodilator
             spirometry will be performed approximately 10-15 minutes after the participants has
             self-administered 4 inhalations (i.e., total 400/360 [microgram] mcg) of
             salbutamol/albuterol via a Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) (use of spacer will be
             optional). The study-provided central spirometry equipment will calculate the FEV1/FVC
             ratio and FEV1 percent predicted values.

          -  Exacerbation History: A documented history (e.g., medical record verification) in the
             12 months prior to Visit 1 of &gt;=2 COPD exacerbations resulting in prescription for
             antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids or hospitalisation or extended observation in
             a hospital emergency room or outpatient centre. Note: Prior use of antibiotics alone
             does not qualify as a moderate exacerbation unless the use was specifically for the
             treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD.

          -  Existing COPD maintenance treatment: Participants must be receiving daily maintenance
             treatment for their COPD for at least 3 months prior to Screening. Notes: Participants
             receiving only &quot;pro re nata&quot; or as needed (PRN) COPD medications are not eligible for
             inclusion in the study. All participants will continue on their current Standard of
             Care (SoC) COPD medications throughout the entire duration of the study.

          -  Tobacco use: Participants with a current or prior history of &gt;=10 pack-years of
             cigarette smoking at Screening (Visit 1). Former smokers are defined as those who have
             stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. One pack year =20 cigarettes
             smoked per day for 1 year or the equivalent. Number of pack years=(number of
             cigarettes per day/20) x number of years smoked.

          -  Sex: Male or female participants aged &gt;=40 years at Screening (Visit 1). A female
             participant is eligible to participate if she is of non-child bearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40
             milli-international unit/milliliter (MIU/mL) and estradiol &lt;40 picogram/milliliter
             (pg/mL) (&lt;140 [Picomoles per liter] pmol/L) is confirmatory] or if of child-bearing
             potential is using a highly effective method for avoidance of pregnancy from 30 days
             before the first dose, for the duration of dosing and until 2 weeks post last-dose.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Corrected ECG QT interval (QTc)&lt;450 milliseconds(msec) or QTc&lt;480 msec for
             participants with bundle branch block. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart
             rate according to either Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), or
             another method, machine or manual over-read. For eligibility and withdrawal, ideally
             the same QT correction formula will be used for all participants. However, because
             this is not always possible, the same QT correction formula will be used for each
             individual participant to determine eligibility for and withdrawal from the study. The
             QTc will be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate ECGs obtained over a
             brief recording period.
