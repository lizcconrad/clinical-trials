      This study will use two Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) techniques that will look at
      participants liver veins and arteries without giving a coloring matter (contrast) before
      taking the images. Investigators propose to evaluate the usefulness of these two new
      techniques, which do not involve exposing participants to radiation or contrast.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects that fulfill the criteria for living liver donation and are evaluated for the
             procedure with CT and MR.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to give informed consent

          -  Unable to comply with breathing or other imaging related instructions resulting in
             inability to obtain diagnostic quality MRI studies

          -  Not suitable to undergo MRI with a gadolinium-based contrast agent because of:

               -  Claustrophobia, unless patient agrees to sedation measures per institutional
                  standard practice during MR imaging

               -  Presence of metallic objects or implanted medical devices in body per
                  institutional safety standards

               -  Weight greater than that allowable by the MR table

               -  Renal failure, as determined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30
                  mL/min/1.73 m2 by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) model based on
                  a serum creatinine level obtained within 28 days prior to enrollment

               -  Known allergy-like reaction to contrast media (gadolinium) or moderate or severe
                  allergic reactions to one or more allergens as defined by the American College of
                  Radiology (ACR), and unwillingness to undergo pre-treatment as defined by the
                  institution`s policy and/or ACR guidance

               -  Pregnancy (if a female is of childbearing potential --defined as a premenopausal
                  female capable of becoming pregnant --a pregnancy test should be done)
