  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial will compare the rates of ongoing pregnancy, safety/side effects and
      acceptability of two medical abortion regimens that are commonly used in Latin America. The
      first regimen will involve three 800 mcg doses of misoprostol taken buccally in three hour
      intervals; the second will involve three 800 mcg doses of misoprostol taken sublingually in
      three hour intervals. This study will also aim to assess the feasibility and acceptability of
      a semi-quantitative pregnancy test (SQPT) for at-home follow-up in both settings.
