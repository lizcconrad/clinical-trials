      This study is a randomized controlled trial that tests the effectiveness of cognitive
      behavior therapy (CBT) for insomnia with comorbid depression in youth aged 12 through 19 who
      have recently begun selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. CBT is
      compared with a control condition of sleep hygiene education.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      160 youth with depression and comorbid insomnia who have just initiated a course of SSRI
      antidepressants will be randomized to insomnia-focused cognitive behavior therapy (CBT-I) or
      an attention control condition of sleep hygiene (SH) education. All participants will have
      in-person treatment sessions and will complete sleep diaries and wear an actigraph to record
      activity levels. Participants will be followed for 12 months.

      Primary depression outcomes are score on the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement (CGI-I)
      and major depressive disorder diagnostic remission; primary sleep outcomes are actigraphy
      total sleep time and score on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Secondary outcomes include
      additional sleep and depression outcomes. The study will also include economic analyses.

    <description>Cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) comprising stimulus control, sleep restriction, and sleep-focused cognitive therapy. The CBT-I consists of in-person sessions and homework assignments and includes stimulus control and sleep restriction to regularize the sleep-wake cycle; cognitive therapy to address dysfunctional sleep beliefs and bedtime rumination; motivational interviewing to help youth make important health changes; and parental involvement. In addition, participants will continue treatment as usual (TAU) SSRI antidepressants delivered by a usual care provider.</description>
