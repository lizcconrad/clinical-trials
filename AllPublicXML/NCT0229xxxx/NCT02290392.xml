    <textblock>
      Background:

      - High blood pressure is a common problem. It can cause heart attacks, strokes, and kidney
      failure. It affects African Americans more than other racial groups. Data were collected from
      over a thousand African Americans across the country. The data were put into a database
      (MH-GRID). The data were about genes, diet, sleep, body mass index. They also cover stress
      and access to healthy foods and parks. Researchers at NIH will study these data in new ways.
      They want to learn more about the connection between African Americans and high blood
      pressure.

      Objective:

      - To study MH-GRID data to find the causes of severe high blood pressure and other
      cardio-metabolic problems in people of African ancestry.

      Eligibility:

      - African Americans age 30 55 with severe high blood pressure were used in the MH-GRID study.
      No new participants will be enrolled in this study.

      Design:

      - Researchers will examine data from the MH-GRID study.

    <textblock>
      The etiology of racial/ethnic differences in health involves dynamic interactions between

      genetic, behavioral and social-environmental determinants. Despite this, the field lacks
      robust

      datasets that integrate these determinants with clinical assessments in minority patient
      cohorts. The Minority Health Genomics and Translational Research Bio-repository Database
      (MHGRID) Network infrastructure facilitated the collection of biospecimens and related
      multidimensional data elements within a consortium of minority-serving clinics. This
      initiative expands the diversity of ancestral groups in national genomic medicine datasets
      and promises to accelerate the translation of personalized medicine into minority
      communities. The MH-GRID project was initiated by Dr. Gibbons (founding PI) prior to becoming
      an NIH investigator. The MH-GRID project has completed its participant recruitment
      activities, closed out its NIH funding and now represents an existing dataset and
      biorepository that is being transferred to NHGRI for ongoing secondary analyses. A variety of
      investigations will be conducted on this existing dataset. The primary outcome variables
      include severe hypertension and hypertension induced kidney damage. Secondary outcome
      variables include obesity, coronary heart disease and metabolic disease syndrome. Intervening
      variables include genetics, behavioral (i.e. sleep quality, health literacy, smoking, diet,
      body mass index), ancestry, social (i.e. socioeconomic status, racial discrimination, stress,
      social depreivation), biological (i.e. insulin resistance, cholesterol, inflammatory
      markers), and environmental (i.e. neighborhood, access to healthy foods, parks).
