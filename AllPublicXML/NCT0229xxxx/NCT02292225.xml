      To evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of Duvelisib (IPI-145) in
      combination with obinutuzumab in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic
      Lymphoma previously treated with a BTKi.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, dose escalation, safety and tolerability study of Duvelisib
      (IPI-145) in combination with obinutuzumab in subjects with Chronic Lymphocytic
      Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma previously treated with a BTKi therapy.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The scope of the program has been reduced to focus resources on studies which can potentially
    enable the registration of duvelisib.
