    <textblock>
      Background: Up to 90% of nursing home residents with dementia experience behavioural and
      psychological symptoms like apathy, agitation, and anxiety. According to analyses of
      prescription prevalence in Germany, antipsychotic drugs seem to be prescribed as first line
      treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in persons with dementia. A huge number is prescribed
      for inappropriate reasons and too long without regular review. The use of antipsychotics is
      associated with adverse events like increased risk of falling, stroke, and mortality. This
      study aims to investigate whether a person-centered care approach developed in the United
      Kingdom can be adapted and implemented in German nursing homes. The aim of the investigators
      trial is to achieve a clinically relevant reduction of the proportion of residents with alt
      least one antipsychotic drug prescription.

      Methods/Design: Cluster-randomised controlled trial comparing an intervention group (two-day
      initial skill training on person-centred care and on-going training and support programme)
      with a control group receiving optimised usual care. Both study groups will receive a
      medication review by an experienced psychiatrist with feedback to the prescribing physician.
      Overall, 36 nursing homes from East, North and West Germany will be included and randomised.
      The primary outcome is defined as the proportion of residents receiving at least one
      antipsychotic medication at 12 months. Secondary outcomes are residents' quality of life,
      behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia as well as safety parameters like falls
      and fall-related medical attention. Cost parameters will be collected and process evaluation
      will be performed alongside the trial.
