      This placebo-controlled study is designed to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability
      of vortioxetine in the treatment of adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) that is
      comorbid with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). Half of the subjects will be randomized to
      receive vortioxetine and the other half will receive placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female adults between 18 and 70 years of age (inclusive).

          2. Subjects must give written informed consent prior to any study procedures

          3. Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), single episode (296.2) or recurrent
             (296.3), according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version 5
             (DSM-5) criteria, as determined by psychiatric evaluation with the investigator and
             confirmed by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).

          4. Duration of current Major Depressive Episode must be at least 4 weeks.

          5. Diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) (300.23 Social Phobia) according to DSM-5
             criteria, as determined by psychiatric evaluation with the Investigator and confirmed
             by the MINI.

          6. Duration of current SAD must be at least 6 months, and SAD should be observable in
             subjects' lives when they are not suffering from MDD, if such periods have occurred.

          7. Subjects must have a minimum total score of 60 on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale
             (LSAS) at both Screening and Baseline visits.

          8. Subjects must have a minimum total Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)
             score of 20 at both Screening and Baseline visits.

          9. Subjects must have a Clinical Global Inventory (CGI) Severity score of 4 or greater at
             both Screening and Baseline visits, where the CGI is based on a composite of MDD and
             SAD.

         10. Male and female subjects of childbearing potential must commit to an effective form of
             contraception for the duration of the trial (Screening/Visit 1 through Follow-Up/Visit
             10). Effective forms of contraception include: condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with
             spermicide, hormonal contraceptive agents (oral, transdermal, or injectable), or
             implantable contraceptive devices. True abstinence will also be considered an
             effective form of contraception.

          1. Subjects with any lifetime history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective
             disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders, or body dysmorphic
             disorder. Subjects with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder, dysthymia, or specific
             phobias can be included in the study provided that MDD and SAD are considered to be
             the primary clinical conditions in terms of need for treatment.

          2. Subjects with substance abuse, panic disorder, or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, in
             the past 6 months before screening.

          3. Subjects who started psychotherapy for SAD or MDD or had electroconvulsive therapy
             (ECT) in the past 6 months before screening. Subjects who have been receiving
             psychotherapy or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for more than 24 weeks prior to the
             Baseline visit are eligible provided that the therapy continues at the same frequency
             for the duration of the trial.

          4. Subjects who are currently pregnant or lactating, or who are of childbearing potential
             and not able and willing to practice an effective method of contraception (as outlined
             in Inclusion criterion #10) for the duration of the trial (Screening/Visit 1 through
             Follow-Up/Visit 10.

          5. Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are at a clinically significant risk
             for suicide. This would include prominent suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior in
             the past 6 months before screening.

          6. Systolic blood pressure ≥165 and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥95, as measured at
             Screening and Baseline visits.

          7. Positive Urine Drug Screen at the Screening visit, unless due to prescribed
             medication.

          8. Any current unstable and/or clinically significant medical condition, based on history
             or as evidenced in screening laboratory or electrocardiogram (ECG) assessments.

          9. Subjects with a history or complication of cancer or malignant tumor not in remission
             for at least 5 years. Basal cell skin cancers are not exclusionary.

         10. Subjects receiving fluoxetine within 28 days of the Baseline visit.

         11. Subjects receiving Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) within 14 days of the Baseline
             visit.

         12. Subjects receiving any other psychotropic medication (including selective serotonin
             re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs),

             allowed for insomnia if not taken more than 3 times per week for the duration of the
             trial.

         13. Treatment refractory SAD: subjects who have a history of two or more failed treatment
             trials with an FDA-approved SAD treatment, each given for at least 6 weeks, during
             which the subject received an adequate dosage

         14. Treatment refractory MDD: subjects who have a history of two or more failed treatment
