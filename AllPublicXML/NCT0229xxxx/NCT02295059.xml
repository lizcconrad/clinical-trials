  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators study aims to determine biological changes associated with a low vs high
      dose of omega 3 fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), over 12
      months in women at risk for recurrent breast cancer. The objectives of the trial are to
      develop mammary epithelial, adipose tissue specific markers of exposure and response to omega
      3 fatty acid supplements that can be carried forward into definitive intervention trials of
      omega 3 fatty acids for breast cancer prevention. The investigators will randomize 80
      subjects with hormone receptor negative, HER-2/neu overexpression positive or negative breast
      cancer to either a high or low dose of omega 3 fatty acids. Using fine needle aspiration to
      procure cellular samples of breast epithelial and adipose tissue, the investigators will
      determine the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on mammary specific biomarkers of response.

      The investigators study aims to determine biological changes that occur with a 12 month
      intervention of low (~0.9 g EPA+DHA/day) vs high dose (~5.4 g EPA+DHA/day) of omega 3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in women survivors of hormone unresponsive breast cancer.
      The objectives of the trial are to develop unique mammary epithelial, adipose tissue specific
      markers of exposure and response to omega 3 fatty acid supplements that can be carried
      forward into definitive intervention trials of EPA, DHA/omega 3 PUFAs for breast cancer
      prevention. The investigators will randomize 80 subjects with hormone receptor negative,
      HER-2/neu overexpression positive or negative breast cancer to either a high or low dose of
      omega 3 PUFAs. Using fine needle aspiration to procure cellular samples of breast epithelial
      and adipose tissue, the investigators will determine the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on
      mammary specific biomarkers of response.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior diagnosis of Stage 0 to III breast cancer that is estrogen receptor negative,
             progesterone receptor negative with completion of definitive surgery, radiation
             therapy and/or chemotherapy.

          -  Completion of chemotherapy or trastuzumab for &gt; six months and of radiation therapy
             for &gt; 2 months, as applicable and 5 years or less from completion of standard therapy.

          -  Greater than 1 year from pregnancy, lactation.

          -  Mammogram within the eight months prior to study enrollment that is not suspicious for
             breast cancer (ACR Class I-III).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other current malignancy or metastatic malignancy of any kind.

          -  Ongoing chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other cancer-related treatment.

          -  Subjects on Coumadin or other anticoagulants.

          -  Subjects with breast implants.

          -  Subjects who have had radiation to both breasts or who have undergone bilateral
             mastectomies.

          -  Barriers to fine needle aspiration sampling of breast adipose tissue and/or
             parenchymal breast tissue, including breast implants, history of radiation to both
             breasts, bilateral mastectomies, and/or insufficient breast adipose/parenchymal tissue
             for adequate fine needle aspiration (FNA) sampling.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, hypertension, or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Chronic use of omega 3 fatty acid concentrates or capsules within the 3 months prior
             to entry on the study or any other supplements that might interact with omega 3 fatty
             acid supplements.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women.

          -  Known sensitivity or allergy to fish.

          -  Subjects on a standing regimen of full dose aspirin (greater than 325 mg/day), NSAIDs
             (nonsteriodal anti inflammatory drug) or NSAID-containing products.
