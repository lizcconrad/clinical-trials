      The primary objective is to compare &amp; evaluate between the treatment groups the changes in
      decline/reduction of HIV viral load &amp; increase changes in WBC white blood cell counts in the
      adult Remune dose vs the low dose Remune placebo groups. Additional objectives include
      changes in CD4+ &amp; CD8+ T cell counts along with increased HIV immunity.

      This is a 26 subject Multi Center double-blind randomized, Safety &amp; Efficacy, pediatric
      HIV/AIDS Phase II study, to primarily to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HIV-1 immunogen
      and secondarily to examine changes in CD4+ &amp; CD8+ T cell counts, determine Remune vaccines
      effect of multiple inoculations of HIV-1 immunogen on viral replication in children with
      HIV-1 infection &amp; immunogenicity of Remune. Multi-center, randomized , double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, two arm parallel design study of Remune.

    <description>Remune vaccine consists of a suspension of killed HIV-1 virus particles that have been emulsified with Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA, a mixture of mannide mono-oleate and a highly purified mineral oil). Each dose is given by IM injection and contains 10 μg of p24 antigen in approximately 100 μg of total protein.</description>
