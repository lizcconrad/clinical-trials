  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate cardiovascular safety of gemigliptin by
      evaluating the time until patients report with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in
      T2DM patients treated with gemigliptin.

      Study patients will be followed up to 4 years until MACE occurrence or until the patient
      drops out of the study or completion of the study. The patient who switches to a
      non-gemigliptin treatment after initiating gemigliptin therapy will be followed until MACE
      occurrence or until the patient drops out of the study or completion of the study.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate adverse events related as well as
      not-related to MACE in diabetic patients treated with gemigliptin.

        Approximately 5,000 Korean patients whose diabetic condition requires gemigliptin in
        monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic treatment, according to the
        physician's judgment, will be enrolled.
