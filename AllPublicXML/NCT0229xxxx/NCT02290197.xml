    <textblock>
      Knee dislocation is a serious injury, usually caused by high-energy trauma. It is classically
      defined as complete loss of articular congruence between the femur and the tibia, confirmed
      by radiography. However it is common that the reduction happens spontaneously. For this
      reason, today the investigators also consider a patient suffered knee dislocation in the
      presence of multi-ligament injury involving the posterior cruciate ligament, often in
      association with anterior cruciate ligament, lateral and/or medial ligamentous complex.

      It is considered a serious injury, because both the strong association with vascular and
      nerve damage, which can lead to the need for limb amputation, such as the difficulty in
      obtaining a good functional outcome even after treatment of all ligament injuries.

      The treatment of these injuries aims to achieve knee stability. Joint mobility is often
      sacrificed in the postoperative period, with the use of immobilizations such as casts,
      splints or bracing. Unfavorable clinical outcomes with high rates of stiffness and joint pain
      are very common in these patients. In attempts to improve these results, rehabilitation
      protocols with early range of motion can be employed. However, results may remain
      unsatisfactory, predominantly because of knee instability recurrence.

      Stannard and Zaffagnini proposed a new model for treatment of acute knee dislocations. In
      this model, after multi-ligament reconstruction or repair, a knee articulated external
      fixator is used. Such external fixator allows early and aggressive joint mobility in the
      sagittal plane only. Flexion and extension are permitted, but rotational movements,
      translations in the anterior-posterior plane, lateral (varus) and medial (valgus) openings
      are not allowed. Thus protective stability is ensured for ligament reconstruction procedures.
      Simultaneously the investigators allow immediate joint mobilization, reducing the risk of
      arthrofibrosis, joint stiffness and postoperative ligament laxity.

      There is no consensus regarding the use of hinged external fixator postoperatively in
      multiple ligament reconstruction procedures for treatment of knee dislocations.

      The objective of this study is comparing functional outcomes after ligament reconstruction in
      patients with knee dislocation, with or without the use of hinged external fixator.
