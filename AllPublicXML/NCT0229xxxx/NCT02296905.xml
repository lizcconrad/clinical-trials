      This is an open-label, single-dose study designed to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety
      of ABT-493 and/or ABT-530 in subjects with impaired hepatic function and compare them to
      those in subjects with normal hepatic function.

      Twenty-four subjects will be selected and enrolled according to the subject selection
      criteria: 6 subjects with mild stable chronic hepatic impairment (Group I), 6 subjects with
      moderate stable chronic hepatic impairment (Group II), 6 subjects with severe stable chronic
      hepatic impairment (Group III) and 6 subjects with normal hepatic function (Group IV).

          -  If female, subject must be either postmenopausal for at least 2 years or surgically
             sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

          -  Females must have negative results for pregnancy test performed:

               -  At Screening on a urine specimen obtained within 28 days prior to initial study
                  drug administration, and

               -  On a serum sample obtained on Study Day -1 of Period 1.

          -  Males must be surgically sterile or practicing at least one of the following methods
             of birth control (sperm donation within the study period is not allowed):

               -  Abstinence

                       prothrombin time elevation &gt; 1.7 or an albumin value below the lower limit
                       of the laboratory reference range and excluding non-hepatic causes of the
                       previous laboratory abnormalities.

        Exclusion Criteria: - History of significant sensitivity to any drug.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding female.

          -  Recent (6-month) history of drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Positive test result for hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M (HAV-IgM) or human
             immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab). Negative HIV status will be confirmed at
