  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II randomized study of 4-months induction first-line chemotherapy with
      FOLFOXIRI + cetuximab followed by maintenance with cetuximab or bevacizumab in patients
      affected by KRAS wild type (wt) mCRC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to obtain a rapid disease control with the therapy and the maximum
      tumoral shrinkage, and than to treat patient with less intensive maintenance to inhibit
      tumoral regrowth.

    <measure>10 months-progression free rate (10m-PFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>10m-PFR is defined as the proportion of patients free from disease progression 10 months after randomization, relative to the total of enrolled patients. Patients whose disease status cannot be evaluated within 11 months after randomization and patients lost to follow up or dead within 10 months after randomization will be considered as progressed for the purpose of the primary endpoint analyses.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best overall response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>every 8 weeks, up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Best overall response rate is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, achieving a complete (CR) or partial (PR) response, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, during the induction and the maintenance phases of treatment. The determination of clinical response will be based on investigator reported measurements that will be subsequently confirmed by a central review. Responses will be evaluated every 8 weeks until disease progression or up to 60 months. Patients who do not have an on-study assessment will be included in the analysis as non responders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>10 month resection rate</measure>
    <time_frame>within 10 months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>10month resection rate is defined as the percentage of patients,relative to the total of enrolled subjects,undergoing secondary R0 resection of metastases within 10months after randomization.Secondary R0 surgery is defined as microscopically margin free complete surgical removal of all residual disease,performed during treatment or after its completion,allowed by tumoral shrinkage and/or disappearance of 1or more lesions.Patients lost to follow up,with disease progression or dead,within 10months after randomization,will be considered as failures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to strategy failure</measure>
    <time_frame>from randomization, up to 60 months</time_frame>

progression during FOLFOXIRI + cetuximab or during a modified FOLFOXIRI + cetuximab regimen;OR
progression and decision to not administer FOLFOXIRI + cetuximab or a modified FOLFOXIRI + cetuximab regimen
introduction of a new agent not included in the study treatment according to randomization arm;OR
death; whichever occurs first.All events will be assessed up to 60 months.For patients still on treatment at the time of analysis, the time to strategy failure will be censored on the last date the patients were known to be alive.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to 2nd progressive disease</measure>
    <time_frame>from randomization, up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is defined as the time from randomization to 2°documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause,whichever occurs first.All events will be assessed up to 60 months.Time to 2nd progressive disease will be censored on the date of the last evaluable on study tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who are alive,on study and second progression free at the time of the analysis.Alive patients having no tumor assessments after baseline will have time to event endpoint censored on the date of randomization</description>

    <description>It is defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause,whichever occurs first. All events will be assessed up to 60 months. PFS will be censored on the date of the last evaluable on study tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who are alive,on study and progression free at the time of the analysis.Alive patients having no tumor assessments after baseline will have time to event endpoint censored on the date of randomization</description>
