    <textblock>
      This is a phase I-II, randomised, placebo-controlled, clinical trial, currently ongoing in a
      single Spanish hospital (Hospital Virgen del Rocío, Seville), to evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of a 4-doses treatment regimen with MSCs (1 million cells/Kg MSCs, weeks
      0-4-8-20) in HIV infected adults with swith discordant virological and immunological response
      to antiretroviral therapy. In the initial phase of the trial (n=5), patients were
      sequentially recruited, with a safety period of 15 days, receiving unblinded cell therapy. In
      the second phase of the trial, subjects are block randomised (1:1) to receive either MSCs
      (n=5), or placebo (n=5), as the control treatment. Immune response variables, adverse events,
      opportunistic infection signs are evaluated as determinants of safety and efficacy of MSCs.
      Study endpoints are measured along a follow-up period of 24 months, that includes 17 visits
      according to a decreasing frequency rate. Intention to treat, and per protocol, and safety
      analysis will be performed.
