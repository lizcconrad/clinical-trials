  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being performed to comply with regulatory requirements that all new
      non-antiarrhythmic drugs must be assessed for potential effects on cardiac repolarization
      through electrocardiographic evaluation in a 'Thorough QT/ Corrected QT interval (TQT)'
      study. This will be a two part study, Part A will be an open-label, single oral dose study
      design in order to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of a 500 milligram
      (mg) dose of GSK1278863 and Part B will be a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      single, oral dose, four-way crossover study design. Parts A and B will be conducted in
      healthy adult subjects with 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory safety
      tests, vital sign measurements, physical examinations, adverse event reports, and
      pharmacokinetic samples collected throughout the study.
