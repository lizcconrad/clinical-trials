      Induction chemotherapy is regarded as an effective way to reduce or downgrade the locally
      advanced or aggressive cancers, and to improve the chance of eradication of the locoregional
      lesions by radical surgery and/or radiotherapy. However, there are still debates on the
      clinical value of induction chemotherapy for patients with advanced and resectable oral
      squamous cell carcinoma. A prospective, open label, parallel, interventional, randomized
      control trial on TPF induction chemotherapy indicate there is no difference in overall
      survival, disease free survival, local regional recurrence free survival and metastasis free
      survival between experimental group and control group, however, the subgroup analysis proves
      that the induction chemotherapy of TPF protocol could benefit the patients with cyclinD1 high
      expression and cN2 locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma. （Zhong et al, Randomized
      Phase III Trial of Induction Chemotherapy With Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and Fluorouracil
      Followed by Surgery Versus Up-Front Surgery in Locally Advanced Resectable Oral Squamous Cell
      Carcinoma, J Clin Oncol 2013）The previous study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov website
      with NCT01542931 identification number.This prospective, interventional, randomized control
      trial was to evaluate the TPF induction chemotherapy have a better effects in the cyclin D1
      high expression and cN2 patients with locally advanced and resectable OSCC. The patients
      would receive TPF induction chemotherapy followed by radical surgery and post-operative
      radiotherapy (the experimental group) or radical surgery and post-operative radiotherapy (the
      control group). The primary endpoint is overall survival and the second endpoint is local
      control and distant control.The study had a power of 80% on the basis of an assumed 2-year
      survival rate of 67% in the experiment group and 25% in the control group, with use of a
      two-sided log-rank test at a level of significance of 0.05. The recruitment period would be 2
      years, and the follow-up period would be 2 years, and 15% of patients would drop out early or
      be lost to follow-up. A maximum of 24 patients per group were to be recruited with stplan 4.5
      software calculation. （Department of Biostatics, MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of
      Texas，USA）The patients in the experimental group received the TPF induction chemotherapy for
      2 cycles followed by radical surgery and post-operative radiotherapy. The palpable edges of
      the primary lesion (both the longest and shortest axis) were marked before induction
      chemotherapy by at least four points, which were 0.5cm away. The patients in the control
      group received the radical surgery and post-operative radiotherapy.

      Induction chemotherapy: For the patients who were randomly assigned to receive TPF induction
      chemotherapy, peripherally inserted central catheter was firstly inserted before intravenous
      infusion, docetaxel(at a dose of 75mg/m2 of body surface area) was administered as a 2-hour
      intravenous infusion, followed by intravenous cisplatin(75 mg/m2), administered during a
      period of 2 to 3 hours. Then, 5-Fu(5 - Fluorouracil) (750 mg/m2/day) was administered as a
      120-hour continuous intravenous infusion for 5 days. Induction chemotherapy was given every 3
      weeks for 2 cycles, unless there was disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or
      withdrawal of consent by the patients. Dexamethasone was given before docetaxel infusion to
      prevent docetaxel-related hypersensitivity reactions, skin toxic effects, and fluid
      retention; prophylactic antibiotics were also given starting on day 5 of each cycle for 3
      days. Hydration with diuretic and antiemetic treatment was also performed. Primary
      prophylaxis with recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was not suggested.
      Chemotherapy dose reductions were allowed for grade 3/4 toxicities occurring after cycle 1:
      25% and 50% dose reductions of the three chemotherapy agents were suggested for grade 3 and
      grade 4 hematologic toxicities or gastrointestinal toxicities, respectively; 25% and 50%
      cisplatin dose reductions were suggested for grade 3 and grade 4 renal toxicities,
      respectively. Surgery was performed at least 2 weeks after completion of induction
      chemotherapy.

      Surgery: Radical resection of the primary lesion and full neck dissection(functional or
      radical) with proper reconstruction(pedicle or free flap) were performed. The safety margins
      of the primary lesion were 1.0-1.5cm far away from the palpable margins of the lesion; for
      patients who received induction chemotherapy, the safety margins were 1.0cm away from the
      marks that were placed before induction chemotherapy, to ensure the same extent surgery in
      both arms. Frozen sections during surgery were performed to confirm adequate margins.

      Post-operative radiotherapy: Radiotherapy was arranged 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. Routine
      external beam radiotherapy, such as conformal or intensity modulated radiotherapy was
      performed, and the dose was 1.8-2 Gy/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks, and totally 54-60 Gy, in
      the patient with high risk features, such as positive surgical margin, extra capsular nodal
      spread, vascular embolism, concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin 80mg/m2 was suggested.

      A complete medical history was obtained and tumor assessment was performed at baseline.
      Clinical tumor response was assessed by clinical evaluation and imaging study and was
      characterized according to the criteria of response evaluation criteria in solid tumors
      (version 1.1) before surgery. Post-operative pathologic response was assessed by
      post-operative pathologic examination as good and bad response. A good response was defined
      as absence of any tumor cells (pathologic complete response) or presence of scattered foci of
      a few tumor cells (minimal residual disease with &lt;10% viable tumor cells); otherwise, a bad
      pathologic response was defined. Toxic effects were assessed weekly during and after
      completion of induction chemotherapy and radiotherapy according to the common terminology
      criteria for adverse events (version 3.0).

      Overall survival was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death; disease
      free survival was calculated from the date of randomization to tumor recurrence or distant
      metastasis or death from any cause; locoregional recurrence/distant metastasis free survival
      was calculated from the date of randomization to locoregional recurrence/distant metastasis
      of tumor or death from any cause. Time to locoregional recurrence/distant metastasis was
      calculated from the date of finishing treatment to tumor locoregional recurrence/distant
      metastasis. Patients were monitored by every three months in the first two years, every six
      months in the next 2 years, and once a year thereafter until death or data censoring.
