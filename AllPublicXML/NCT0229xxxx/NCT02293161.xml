  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2618960 is a humanized Immunoglobulin G 1 ( IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to
      the alpha component (CD127) of the heterodimeric Interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R). It is being
      developed for the treatment of autoimmune indications. This study is intended to further
      explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and
      immunogenicity of single ascending doses GSK2618960 in healthy volunteers beyond those
      already evaluated in I7R116702 (First Time In Human study). The study is anticipated to enrol
      18 subjects in total, with 9 subjects in each of the two cohorts.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males aged between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent OR females of non-child bearing potential aged between 18 and 65
             years of age at the time of signing the informed consent.

        Non-childbearing potential defined as:- pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
        ligation or hysterectomy, or post-menopausal defined as 24 months of spontaneous amenorrhea
        [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
        &gt;40 milli-international units (MIU) per millilitre (mL) and oestradiol &lt;40 picograms (pg)
        /mL (&lt; 140 picomole/liter) is confirmatory. [Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
        and whose menopausal status is in doubt must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
        postmenopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks
        will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on
        the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can
        resume use of HRT during the study.]

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraception methods listed in Protocol. This criterion must be followed from the
             time of the first dose of study medication until 5 half-lives after the infusion (Week
             16 visit).

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinically significant abnormality or laboratory
             parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion
             criteria, outside the local reference range being used for healthy volunteers may be
             included only if the Investigator in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor agree
             and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and
             will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  White blood cell count &gt;=Lower Limit of Normal (LLN), including both lymphocyte and
             neutrophil counts &gt;=LLN.

          -  Body weight &gt;=50 kilogram (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 19.0 - 32.0
             kilogram / square meter (kg/m^2) (inclusive).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Subjects with a confirmed positive vaccination status for tetanus, diphtheria,
             pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, pneumococcus and meningococcus (or consent to
             vaccination)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Criteria Based Upon Medical Histories

          -  Current evidence of ongoing or acute infection within 3 months prior to the first dose
             of study drug, such as: serious local infection (e.g. cellulitis, abscess); systemic
             infection [e.g. pneumonia, septicaemia, Tuberculosis (TB)].

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  A QT duration corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt;450 millisecond
             (msec) based on either single or averaged QTcF values of triplicate ECGs obtained over
             a brief recording period.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an
             average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit is
             equivalent to 8 grams (g) of alcohol: a half-pint ~240 mL of beer, 1 glass (125 mL) of

             vaccination at any time during the study i.e. 6 months following dosing (which covers

          -  Subjects from a high risk area of the world for tuberculosis or have history of
             tuberculosis or have close family members with confirmed TB infection or positive at
             screening by Quantiferon testing (an indeterminate test result at screen may be
             repeated once).

        Criteria Based Upon Diagnostic Assessments

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface and/or core antibody or positive Hepatitis C

          -  A positive test for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody. Other Criteria

          -  Smokers who would not be able to refrain from smoking whilst in the phase I unit.

          -  Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or non-prescription drugs (unless
             permitted as per protocol

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day &quot;rolling&quot; period.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.
