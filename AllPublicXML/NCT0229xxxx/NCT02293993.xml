        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients with a diagnosis of AML (WHO classification 2008).

               -  Patients, 20 years of age or older, who are unresponsive to standard chemotherapy
                  or have relapsed following standard chemotherapy

               -  Patients, 65 years of age or older, who are not eligible for standard intensive
                  chemotherapy

          -  Patients with ECOG performance status (PS) of 0 to 2

          -  Patients with adequate organ function

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must not be pregnant or breast feeding (pregnancy
             test will be performed at Screening). Women of child bearing potential and all men
             with female partners of child bearing potential must practice two medically acceptable
             methods of birth control and must not become pregnant or father a child while
             receiving treatment with SGI-110 and for 3 months following last dosing.

          -  Patients who have undergone prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
             must have no evidence of active graft-versus host disease (GVHD) and must be off
             immunosuppressive therapy by â‰¥2 weeks prior to IMP administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia accompanied by t(15;17)(q22;q12) or
             (PML/RARA) karyotype abnormalities (include other variant types of APL)

          -  Patients with multiple cancers (except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous
             cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer from which the subject has
             been disease free for at least 3 years)

          -  Subjects with life-threatening illnesses other than AML or MDS, uncontrolled medical
             conditions or organ system dysfunction which, in the investigator's opinion, could
             compromise the subject's safety, or put the study outcomes at risk.

          -  Patients with poorly controlled arrhythmias, or any Class 3 or 4 cardiac disease as
             defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification

          -  Patients with symptomatic central nervous system involvement.
