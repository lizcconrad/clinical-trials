  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective cohort study, patients with newly diagnosed gynecologic cancers
      (including cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers) and patients with suspicious recurrent
      gynecologic cancers will be enrolled. The study period is two years and the estimated patient
      number is about 220. Patients will undergo image study before and after treatment. The
      diagnostic accuracy of MR-PET in cancer staging and the potential image biomarkers to monitor
      treatment response and predict treatment outcome will be investigated.
