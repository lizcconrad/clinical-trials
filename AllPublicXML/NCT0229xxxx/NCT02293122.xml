    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the precision and agreement of the study device, a
      specular microscope, in comparison to a currently commercially available specular microscope
      in establishing substantial equivalence of the two devices in clinical use for diagnostic
      purposes of the human cornea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The observational clinical investigation is intended to measure agreement between two
      diagnostic instruments of the eye's corneal endothelium. The study device is the EM-3000
      specular microscope and the control device is the NonCon Robo Pachy (F&amp;A) (CellChek XL)
      specular microscope. Both instruments measure corneal endothelial cell layer parameters
      including cell density, coefficient of variation, percent hexagonality, and central
      thickness.

      The primary variable is the measurement of agreement between the two instruments for the four
      parameters described. The secondary variables include repeatability (intra-investigator) and
      reproducibility both inter-investigator, and inter-instrument.

      Additionally, measurements of agreement will be made on the EM-3000 using automated analysis
      with and without touch-up.
