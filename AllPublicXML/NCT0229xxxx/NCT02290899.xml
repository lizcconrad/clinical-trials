  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate how the brain responds to a procedure known
      as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and how tDCS affects performance on a
      behavioral task. Research suggest that this procedure leads to improvement in brain and
      behavioral measures of inhibitory control (controlling impulses) in healthy control
      participants. The investigators want to explore whether the same improvement will be seen in
      kids with ADHD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of ADHD

          -  Parent informed consent and child assent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Intracranial pathology from a known genetic disorder (e.g., Neurofibromatosis Type 1
             (NF1), tuberous sclerosis) or from acquired neurologic disease (e.g. stroke, tumor),
             cerebral palsy, history of severe head injury, or significant dysmorphology

          -  History of fainting spells of unknown or undetermined etiology that might constitute
             seizures

          -  History of seizures, diagnosis of epilepsy, or immediate (1st degree relative) family
             history epilepsy

          -  Chronic (particularly) uncontrolled medical conditions that may cause a medical
             emergency in case of a provoked seizure (cardiac malformation, cardiac dysrhythmia,
             asthma, etc.)

          -  History of head injury resulting in prolonged loss of consciousness

          -  Substance abuse or dependence within the past six months

          -  Chronic treatment with prescription medications that decrease cortical seizure
             threshold that the patient is unable to withhold from taking during study visits

          -  Damaged skin on the scalp (i.e., skin with ingrown hairs, acne, razor nicks, wounds
             that have not healed, recent scar tissue, broken skin, etc.)
