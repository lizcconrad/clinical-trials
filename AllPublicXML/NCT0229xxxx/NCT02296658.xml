  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this phase II trial was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy combined with S-1 based chemotherapy in patients with
      pathologically positive lymph node after completely resected gastric cancer. Furthermore, the
      investigators sought to compare the dosimetric differences between the volumetric-modulated
      arc therapy (VMAT), Tomotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques in
      treatment planning for gastric cancer as adjuvant radiotherapy.
