  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major cause of chronic morbidity, mortality
      and disability throughout the world, leading to a heavy social and economic
      burden.Bronchodilators, the most commonly used drugs in COPD patients, have been shown to
      reduce dyspnea, improve exercise tolerance and improve health status. However,conventional
      lung function parameters such as forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in
      one second (FEV1) frequently fail to detect significant functional responses to
      bronchodilators in patients with chronic airflow obstruction. It is necessary for clinical
      and scientific reasons to develop a new tool to objectively assess the effect of different
      treatments including bronchodilator on COPD. Our previous study showed that Ventilation-drive
      coupling may be more sensitive and accurate to evaluate the efficacy of inhaled
      bronchodilators in patients with COPD because it could better reflect the pathological and
      physiological characteristics of COPD.

      Based on the above conclusion, the present study were performed using the experimental
      methods of placebo and self-controlled. We aimd to explore the value of ventilation-drive
      coupling in evaluating the efficacy of bronchodilators on COPD and provide a reasonable basis
      for the clinical application of this index.

      Patients were randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups:

        1. Group A: Patients inhaled placebo, ipratropium 80μg, salbutamol 400 μg in sequence;

        2. Group B: Patients inhaled placebo, salbutamol 400μg, ipratropium 80 μg in sequence.

      The data were collected in 30 minutes after patients inhaled placebo,in 30 minutes after
      ipratropium and in 15 minutes after salbutamol.
