  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous Ebola outbreaks have been limited to individual countries and contained by infection
      control activities. The current outbreak in West Africa is international, and air travel has
      resulted in a number of infected travellers crossing national borders. There are currently no
      specific treatments generally available for Ebola and the mortality is high, particularly in
      countries with limited intensive care facilities. There is currently no vaccine and the
      personal protection required by healthcare workers treating patients is cumbersome and
      requires full compliance to be protective.

      There is now a consortium (VEBCON collaboration) of four clinical centres (in Kenya, Gabon,
      Switzerland and Germany), WHO and New Link Genetics (the vaccine manufacturer) under which
      this study will be conducted. The investigators are conducting this trial, a Phase I,
      open-label, dose escalation trial, designed to establish safety, tolerability and
      immunogenicity of two doses of VSVΔG-ZEBOV, an Ebola Virus Vaccine Candidate for the first
      time in sub-Saharan African populations.

      The investigators plan to vaccinate 40 volunteers in Kenya. The trial will be conducted at
      the KEMRI-CGMR Coast site where healthcare workers (both clinical and laboratory) will be the
      primary target population as they are likely to be the recipients of a protective vaccine.
      The investigators will vaccinate a cohort of 20 volunteers at a low dose and then vaccinate a
      further cohort of 20 volunteers at full dose. Each volunteer will receive one dose of the
      vaccine. The investigators will follow them up for a period of one year looking to their
      safety and immunogenicity endpoints.

      This study is being conducted to assess safety and immunogenicity of an experimental ebola
      vaccine.

      An outbreak due to the Ebola Zaire (ZEBOV) strain of unprecedented magnitude and scope and
      with a high mortality continues to spread across West Africa. No vaccine is currently
      licensed.

      The specific opportunity at hand with rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP (BPSC1001) is to achieve long-lasting
      protective immunity to ZEBOV on a time scale of weeks in humans upon a single-shot
      vaccination, offering a discrete benefit over prime-boost vaccination protocols. The current
      outbreak represents a global health emergency and the need for access to therapeutic
      intervention and vaccines is paramount.

      The vaccine investigated in this study might provide a critical tool to suppress future
      out-breaks of EVD in areas at risk.

      This study is 1 of 4 clinical trials currently conducted as part of the WHO-led VEBCON
      consortium, aiming to generate harmonized data for the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP (BPSC1001) vaccine
      candidate to allow optimized rapid decisions on dose and safety.
