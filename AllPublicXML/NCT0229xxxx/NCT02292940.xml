  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient use of health IT tools to interact with healthcare providers and delivery systems,
      including exchanging secure messages with their medical providers and using other web-based
      tools, has great potential to increase patient access to care, change the way healthcare is
      delivered, and affect patient clinical outcomes. This study will examine the impact of
      implementation and use of consumer health IT tools on patient-reported access to care,
      utilization of medical care services, and clinical outcomes.
