  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, observational study the investigators assess the perioperative course of
      right ventricular function in combination with the venous return in patients undergoing major
      non-cardiac surgery. The study aims to investigate if patients undergoing major non-cardiac
      surgery develop an impairment of right ventricular function and/or venous return.
      Furthermore, the study evaluates if an impairment of right ventricular function and/or venous
      return is associated to left ventricular function, arterial side of the circulation and to
      postoperative clinical outcome.
