  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of gene-activated matrix
      (&quot;Nucleostim&quot;) for regeneration of bone tissue in maxillofacial area. Patients with
      congenital and acquired maxillofacial defects (sockets of extracted teeth, bone defects after
      injuries, surgeries, excision of benign neoplasms and pseudotumors, etc.) or alveolar bone
      atrophy will be included into the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients enrolled into the study will receive standard surgery procedures indicated in
      accordance with medical care standards for the certain disease. Maxillofacial bone defects
      (formed after injuries, surgeries, excision of benign neoplasms and pseudotumors, teeth
      extraction, etc.) or areas of alveolar bone atrophy will be the filled by gene-activated
      matrix &quot;Nucleostim&quot;. Safety and efficacy of implanted osteoplastic material will be assessed
      by physical examination, comprehensive laboratory tests, X-ray examination within 60 days
      after operation.

    <description>To determine the quantity of newly-formed bone tissue the morphometric parameters of regenerate will be measured on CT scan using special tools (&quot;ROI&quot;, region of interest, etc.)
The morphometric parameters of bone regenerate include:
average density (in HU);
