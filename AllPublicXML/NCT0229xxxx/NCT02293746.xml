    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain additional safety and efficacy data on the use of
      Inspire® therapy for the treatment of subjects with moderate to severe Obstructive Sleep
      Apnea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm study conducted under a common implant and
      follow-up protocol. Each subject will serve as their own control.

      The study will collect pre-operative two-night home sleep testing, medical history and
      subject quality of life measures. Intra- and post- operative procedure data will be
      collected. Therapy usage and device adjustment data, as well as a subject satisfaction with
      therapy survey, will be collected for additional analysis.

      Post-implant, procedure- and device-related events, QoL questionnaires, therapy usage and
      device adjustment data will be collected. Sleep study data will collected during the 2-month
      visit and, if conducted, a 3-month visit using a single night in-lab titration PSGs At 6 and
      12 months post-implant, 2-night home sleep testing will be completed. Safety data will be
      collected throughout the study. Subjects will be exited from the study following the 12-month
      visits.

      The subject population will consist of otherwise healthy men and women that are at least 21
      years old and have: 1) Provided written informed consent to participate, 2) Indicated a
      willingness to comply with study requirements for the specified follow-up duration, 3) Met
      all inclusion and exclusion criteria of this protocol.

      Up to 60 subjects will be implanted at up to 5 sites in Germany.

    <description>Safety of the therapy will be assessed via the description of all reported SAEs and all procedure- or device-related AEs. Adverse events will be summarized by seriousness, severity, relatedness to the device and/or procedure and temporal relationship to the procedure. No formal statistical hypotheses will be tested. Only device- or procedure-related AEs will be collected in this post-market study.</description>

    <description>Frequencies and description statistics will be used to describe the data gathered in this study. A statistical comparison of pre-implant baseline and follow-up data may be performed.
Efficacy endpoints will evaluate changes in subjects' quality of life (QoL) and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) severity through:
QoL: Epworth Sleepiness Scale: improvement from baseline to 12 months
QoL: Functional Outcomes of Sleepiness Questionnaire: improvement from baseline to 12 months
OSA Severity: Oxygen Desaturation Index: Reduction at 12 months as compared to baseline.
OSA Severity: Apnea Hypopnea Index: Reduction at 12 months as compared to baseline.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Likely suffer moderate-to-severe OSA based on history and physical, or have an
             established diagnosis of OSA (≥ 15 AHI&lt;65) based on a prior sleep test

          2. Willing and capable to have stimulation hardware permanently implanted, and to use the
             patient programmer to activate the stimulation

          3. Willing and capable to return for all follow-up visits and conduct sleep studies at
