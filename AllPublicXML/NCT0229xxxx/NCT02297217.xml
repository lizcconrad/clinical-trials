  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to show that the addition of carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy to a
      palliative course of external beam radiation treatment improves both dysphagia relief and
      patient quality of life in patients with unresectable esophageal cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with carcinoma of the esophagus not suitable for definitive radical treatment who
      have symptomatic dysphagia requiring locoregional palliation, and who have no
      contra-indications to chemo-radiotherapy will be offered Carboplatin (AUC 2) and paclitaxel
      (50 mg/m2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 concurrent with external beam radiation therapy of
      30Gy/10 fractions over two weeks where the primary goal is relief of dysphagia and other
      outcomes include toxicity, quality of life and metabolomics.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients who achieve relief of dysphagia</measure>
    <time_frame>up to day 85</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured as the proportion of patients who achieve relief of dysphagia, defined as improvement of at least one point on the Mellow Dysphagia Score, measured at Day 57 after the start of radiotherapy, and maintained for at least 28 calendar days (until the Day 85 visit).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dysphagia progression free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured from screening to the time of first progression of dysphagia. Progression of dysphagia will be defined as follows:
A drop of at least 1 point on the 5 point Mellow Dysphagia Score,
Stricture requiring intervention, or
Death,
Other secondary objectives as follows:
Time to achieving any response in dysphagia after treatment as measured by an improvement of at least 1 point on the 5 point Mellow Dysphagia Score. Number of patients receiving secondary treatment (radiation, chemotherapy or stenting), Utility assessments pre to post treatment and at 3 and 6 months, Quality of life differences post treatment and at 3 and 6 months. Measures of biological/serological correlates of response, Acute and late toxicity.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive external beam radiation therapy of 30Gy/10 fractions over two weeks (or reduced to 25 Gy/10 fractions if acute toxicity parameters are met during the run-in) and receive carboplatin (AUC 2) and paclitaxel (50 mg/m2) intravenously on Days 1 and 8. Treatment will be planned, prescribed and delivered using standard 3D radiotherapy planning techniques to encompass the primary tumor and surrounding clinical target volume. Patients are seen for 2 weekly Treatment Visits during concurrent chemo-radiation then every 28 days until the End of Study Visit, approximately 6 months after Treatment Visit 1.</description>
