  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial was to determine the efficacy and safety of linaclotide 72 ug
      administered once daily to patients with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). The primary
      efficacy parameter is the percentage of participants in each dosing group that meet the
      protocol definition for complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) Overall Responder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial also included a 145 ug linaclotide treatment arm (an FDA-approved dose for CIC) as
      an established positive control to validate the study design.

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A 12-week CSBM Overall Responder is a participant who was a CSBM Weekly Responder for at least 9 of the 12 weeks of the Treatment Period. A CSBM Weekly Responder is a participant who had a CSBM weekly frequency rate that was 3 or greater and increased by 1 or more from baseline, and completed ≥ 4 IVRS calls for the specified week.
A CSBM is defined as an SBM that is associated with a sense of complete evacuation. An SBM is defined as a bowel movement BM that occurred in the absence of laxative, enema, or suppository use on either the calendar day of the BM or the calendar day before the BM.</description>

          <description>Number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week. A CSBM is defined as a spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) that is associated with a sense of complete evacuation. An SBM is defined as a bowel movement (BM) that occurred in the absence of laxative, enema, or suppository use on either the calendar day of the BM or the calendar day before the BM. Baseline efficacy values are derived from the interactive voice response system (IVRS) daily diary data collected in the Pretreatment Period, specifically the period of time from 14 days before randomization up to the time of randomization.</description>

A CSBM Weekly Responder is a participant who had a CSBM weekly frequency rate that was 3 or greater and increased by 1 or more from baseline, and completed ≥ 4 IVRS calls for the specified week.
A CSBM is defined as an SBM that is associated with a sense of complete evacuation. An SBM is defined as a bowel movement BM that occurred in the absence of laxative, enema, or suppository use on either the calendar day of the BM or the calendar day before the BM.</description>

        <description>A participant's 12-week CSBM Frequency Rate is the CSBM rate (CSBMs/week) calculated over the 12 weeks of the Treatment Period. A CSBM is defined as an SBM that is associated with a sense of complete evacuation. An SBM is defined as a BM that occurred in the absence of laxative, enema, or suppository use on either the calendar day of the BM or the calendar day before the BM.</description>

        <description>A 12-week CSBM Overall Responder is a participant who was a CSBM Weekly Responder for at least 9 of the 12 weeks of the Treatment Period. A CSBM Weekly Responder is a participant who had a CSBM weekly frequency rate that was 3 or greater and increased by 1 or more from baseline, and completed ≥4 IVRS calls for the specified week.
A CSBM is defined as an SBM that is associated with a sense of complete evacuation. An SBM is defined as a BM that occurred in the absence of laxative, enema, or suppository use on either the calendar day of the BM or the calendar day before the BM.</description>

          <description>A 12-week CSBM Overall Responder is a participant who was a CSBM Weekly Responder for at least 9 of the 12 weeks of the Treatment Period. A CSBM Weekly Responder is a participant who had a CSBM weekly frequency rate that was 3 or greater and increased by 1 or more from baseline, and completed ≥4 IVRS calls for the specified week.
A CSBM is defined as an SBM that is associated with a sense of complete evacuation. An SBM is defined as a BM that occurred in the absence of laxative, enema, or suppository use on either the calendar day of the BM or the calendar day before the BM.</description>

        <description>A 12-week CSBM Overall Sustained Responder is a participant who was a CSBM Weekly Responder for at least 9 of the 12 weeks of the Treatment Period, including ≥ 3 of the last 4 weeks. A CSBM Weekly Responder is a participant who had a CSBM weekly frequency rate that was 3 or greater and increased by 1 or more from baseline, and completed ≥ 4 IVRS calls for the specified week.
A CSBM is defined as an SBM that is associated with a sense of complete evacuation. An SBM is defined as a BM that occurred in the absence of laxative, enema, or suppository use on either the calendar day of the BM or the calendar day before the BM.</description>
