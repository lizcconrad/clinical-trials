  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common chronic disorder of the airways characterized by periods of reversible
      airflow obstruction known as asthma episodes or attacks. Asthma attacks are caused by
      chronically hyperactive (contraction of the muscles surrounding the airways) and inflamed
      airways, leading to airflow obstruction, and may be mild, moderate, or severe enough to
      become life-threatening events. Severity of asthma exacerbation is assessed through medical
      history and lung function measurements with Spirometer and requires full cooperation of the
      patient. Thus, in uncooperative populations or during emergency medical situations the
      spirometer cannot be used. As an alternative, capnography data has been proposed as an
      indicator of bronchospasm in asthma. Previous studies found correlations between the
      capnography parameters and methacholine challenge in asthma patients. However, the
      relationship between capnography parameters and severity of asthma or severity of asthma
      exacerbation have not been well characterized. The study hypothesis is that within the
      clinical population that is invited to do the methacholine challenge, a different waveform
      pattern in asthma patients will be detected and possibly a correlation between the severity
      of obstruction and pattern of waveform during the methacholine challenge. In this proposed
      feasibility observational study, sixty subjects, both men and women, who will be invited to
      participate in the methacholine challenge in the Institute of Pulmonary Medicine at Rabin
      Medical Center, will be recruited to the study. Respiratory information will be recorded
      using the CapnostreamTM20p while the subjects will wear the non-invasive Smart CapnoLineÂ®
      Plus sampling line. Additionally, FeNO will be measured using a DENOX 88 device during the
      methacholine challenge.
