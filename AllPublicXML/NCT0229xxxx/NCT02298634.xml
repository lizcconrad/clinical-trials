    <textblock>
      Farber disease, also known as Farber's lipogranulomatosis, is an autosomal recessive
      lysosomal storage disease marked by a deficiency in enzyme ceramidase which cause a
      progressive accumulation of fatty material lipids leading to abnormalities in the joints,
      liver, throat, tissues and central nervous system.

      Farber disease is an extremely rare disorder, with a prevalence of less than 1/1000000.
      Currently only about 80 cases are reported worldwide. Disease onset is typically in early
      infancy but may occur later in life. It is inherited with an autosomal recessive pattern. The
      clinical presentation of Farber Disease (FD) is characterized by the appearance of
      subcutaneous skin nodules, ordinarily near the joints, most often interphalangeal, wrist,
      elbow and ankle joints, or over points of mechanical pressure. These manifestations are very
      painful and lead to progressive joint stiffness, limitation of motion by contractures and
      finally to immobilization and deformation of joints. Also, a characteristic sign of FD is the
      development of a progressive hoarseness due to laryngeal involvement.

      Beside these major manifestations seven phenotypes have been described which differ in
      severity and additional organ involvement, like the lungs, nervous system, heart and lymph
      nodes. Dependent on residual lysosomal ceramidase turnover, patients have a variable degree
      of central nervous system disease, leading to progressive neurologic deterioration. In most
      cases the neuronal dysfunction rather than the general physical dystrophy seems to limit the
      duration of FD. As well, patients with FD may die due to pulmonary disease with interstitial
      pneumonia.

      First symptoms usually appear between the newborn period and the first birthday. Milder forms
      of type 3 were described with onset at 20 months of age. Clinical manifestation in type 5 of
      FD, dominated by neurologic deterioration, begins at 1 to 2 1/2 years of life. Patients
      mainly die within the first years of life, but prolonged courses in patients without severe
      CNS disease may also be observed.

      Type 1 is the most common or classical, form of this condition and is associated with the
      classic signs of voice, skin, and joint problems that begin a few months after birth.
      Developmental delay and lung disease also commonly occur. Infants born with type 1 Farber
      lipogranulomatosis usually survive only into early childhood.

      Types 2 and 3 generally have less severe signs and symptoms than the other types. Affected
      individuals have the three classic signs and usually do not have developmental delay.
      Children with these types of Farber lipogranulomatosis typically live into mid- to late
      childhood.

      Types 4 and 5 are associated with severe neurological problems. Type 4 usually causes
      life-threatening health problems beginning in infancy due to massive lipid deposits in the
      liver, spleen, lungs, and immune system tissues. Children with this type typically do not
      survive past their first year of life. Type 5 is characterized by progressive decline in
      brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) function, which causes paralysis of the arms
      and legs (quadriplegia), seizures, loss of speech, involuntary muscle jerks (myoclonus), and
      developmental delay. Children with type 5 Farber lipogranulomatosis survive into early
      childhood.

      Types 6 and 7 are very rare, and affected individuals have other associated disorders in
      addition to Farber lipogranulomatosis.

      Faber lipogranulomatosis is caused by a mutation in the ASAH1 gene, situated on the short arm
      of chromosome 8. This gene codes for acid ceramidase, a lysosomal heterodimeric enzyme that
      hydrolyzes ceramide into sphingosine and fatty acid. To date, less than 25 distinct mutations
      have been identified in Farber patients, but no large deletions have yet been reported. A
      total of 13 different mutations were identified including 1 splice, 1 polypyrimidine tract
      (PPT) deletion and 11 missense mutations. Eleven mutations were exclusive to the Indian
      population.

      In Farber's Disease, the mutation in ASAH1 gene leads to a reduction in acid ceramidase's
      activity of over 90%. Consequently the ceramide isn't properly broken down and it gather in
      the lysosomes of cell of various tissues, such as lung, liver, colon, skeletal muscles,
      cartilage and bone. Certain studies on the inflammatory symptoms in FD indicates that the
      granulomatous inflammation is not a consequence of mere ceramide storage but reflects a
      dysregulation of leukocyte functions, probably due to the intracellular role of ceramide in
      intracellular signal transduction. However, the sequence of molecular mechanisms leading from
      a defect in ceramide metabolism to chronic granulomatous inflammation still needs
      elucidation. Alterations of receptor-mediated apoptosis by ceramide accumulation in
      inflammatory cells may be one of the mechanisms underlying abnormal granuloma formation.

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectometry 10ml EDTA
      blood, saliva tube and a dry blood spot filter card are taken. To proof the correct diagnosis
      in those patients where up to the enrollment in the study no genetic testing has been done,
      sequencing will be done. The analyses are done in the Albrecht-Kossel-Institute for
      Neuroregeneration (AKos), POB 100 888, Gehlsheimer Str. 20, 18055 Rostock (Germany)
