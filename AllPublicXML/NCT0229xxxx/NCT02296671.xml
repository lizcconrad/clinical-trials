    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators aim to: 1) confirm the objective response rate (ORR) observed
      in the investigators initial study for patients with the TSER*2/*2 genotype 2) determine
      whether PEMOX regimen is more worthy of future development for this patient genotype selected
      population than FOLFOX based on the data indicating that pemetrexed may be a better TS
      targeted agent than 5-FU.

      Patients who are homozygous for the TSER*2 allele (TSER*2/*2) will be able to continue in the
      study and will be randomized. Patients with other TSER genotypes will not be included and
      will be considered screen fails.

      The first 8 patients with the TSER*2/*2 genotype will be randomized 1:1 to receive treatment
      with either PEMOX or FOLFOX (4 in each group).

      Analysis of the objective response rate (ORR) in each treatment arm will occur after the
      first 8 patients are enrolled. Using the proposed Bayesian design, subsequent patients will
      be preferentially assigned to the &quot;better performing&quot; treatment arm based on continuous
      real-time reassessments of ORR results.

    <description>The modified FOLFOX-6 regimen is the following drugs given every 14 days:
Oxaliplatin on Day 1 of each cycle

5-FU bolus and continuous infusion over 46 hours beginning on Day 1 of each cycle
Oxaliplatin will be administered on Day 2 for Cycle 1 only and the 5-FU infusion will be interrupted at 20 hours so that the FLT-PET scan can be performed (only for FLT-PET scan eligible patients).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Pre-Registration Inclusion Criteria

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic esophagogastric
             adenocarcinoma.

          -  Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;10 mm with CT scan, as &gt;20 mm by chest
             x-ray, or &gt;10 mm with calipers by clinical exam. PET/CT scan is acceptable as a
             substitute for a CT scan if the CT portion of the PET/CT is of identical diagnostic
             quality to a diagnostic CT scan.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt; 2

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent
             document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).

        Registration Inclusion Criteria

          -  TSER genotype *2/*2

          -  ECOG performance status &lt; 2

          -  Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x IULN

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt; 3.0 x IULN

               -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 45
                  mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician
             immediately.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Pre-Registration Exclusion Criteria

          -  Prior therapy for this cancer.

          -  A history of other malignancy ≤ 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with pemetrexed and/or oxaliplatin. In addition,
             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

        Registration Exclusion Criteria

          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Known brain metastases. Patients with known brain metastases must be excluded from
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to pemetrexed, 5-FU, leucovorin or oxaliplatin, or other agents
             used for premedication in the study.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must have a negative pregnancy test within 14
             days of study entry.
