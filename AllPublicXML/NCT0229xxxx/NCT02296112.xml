      This phase II trial studies trametinib in treating patients with melanoma with v-Raf murine
      sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) non-V600 mutations that has spread to other places in
      the body. Trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical efficacy of trametinib in advanced BRAF nonV600mutation (MUT)
      melanoma (&quot;high activity&quot; group).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the safety of trametinib. II. To evaluate the progression-free survival
      (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of trametinib in advanced BRAF nonV600MUT melanoma.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical efficacy of trametinib in advanced BRAF nonV600MUT melanoma
      (&quot;low activity/unknown&quot; group).

      II. Identify mechanisms of resistance to trametinib in this patient population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.
