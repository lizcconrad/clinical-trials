  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, non-randomized, sequential, two-period, repeat-dose study to
      evaluate the effect of trametinib 2 milligram (mg) once daily on the repeat-dose
      pharmacokinetic (PK) of an oral contraceptive (OC) containing norethindrone (NE) and ethinyl
      estradiol (EE) (ORTHO-NOVUM® tablets: 1 mg NE + 0.035 mg EE) in female subjects with solid
      tumors.

      The study will determine PK interaction between trametinib and the components of combination
      oral contraceptives that would compromise the effectiveness of the contraceptives.

      The study will also evaluate the repeat dose PK of trametinib and its metabolite M5 using a
      validated assay.

      The study will enroll approximately 24 subjects. Each subject will participate in the study
      for approximately up to 13 to 15 weeks which will consist of a 30 day screening period,
      followed by 2 treatment periods (Period 1: 28 days and Period 2: ranging from 12 days to up
      to 21 days), and a transition visit or post-treatment follow-up visit. In Period 1, subjects
      will take one active tablet from the ORTHO-NOVUM® tablet 1/35 dial-pack once daily at
      approximately the same time each day for 21 days (Days 1 through 21), followed by one inert
      (referred to as placebo) tablet once daily at approximately the same time each day for 7 days
      (Days 22 through 28). In addition, subjects will take trametinib 2 mg (1 tablet) once daily
      at approximately the same time each day for a total of 17 days (Days 12 through 28). In
      Period 2, subjects will take one active tablet from the ORTHO-NOVUM® tablet 1/35 dial-pack
      once daily at approximately the same time each day for 11 days (Days 1 through 11). In
      addition, subjects will continue taking trametinib 2 mg (1 tablet) once daily at
      approximately the same time each day for 11 days (Days 1 through 11). ORTHO-NOVUM® is a
      registered trademark of Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation.
