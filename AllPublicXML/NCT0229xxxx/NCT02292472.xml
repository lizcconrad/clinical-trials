      Subjects who voluntarily signed the informed consent and are judged to be eligible for this
      study will be intramuscularly injected with the study drug or the placebo to find appropreate
      dose for the treatment of Benign Masseteric Hypertrophy. Thereafter, follow-up visits will be
      made and efficacy and safety assessment will be conducted.
