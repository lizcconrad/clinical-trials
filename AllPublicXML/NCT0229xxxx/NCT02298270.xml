  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the efficacy of an 8-week, Skype-based, group resiliency training
      intervention (The Relaxation Response Resiliency Program) for improving psychological stress
      in patients with Neurofibromatosis. A control group will receive a general health education
      curriculum. The investigators hypothesize that patients will improve on measures of
      psychological stress as a result of the resiliency program.

      A substudy (Unique Protocol ID: 2013P002605b) has been approved to test this study on a
      sub-population: patients with NF2 who are hard of hearing.
