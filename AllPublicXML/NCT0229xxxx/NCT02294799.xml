    <textblock>
      Background: Among the instrumental devices that have been proposed over the years to
      integrate the clinical evaluation of temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD), imaging
      techniques are the most studied, showing that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the
      technique most need to describe the anatomy of the TMJ and to evaluate the correlation of
      imaging findings with the clinical diagnosis . Despite the amount available studies on the
      use of MRI for evaluation of TMJ disorders and treatments, there is a lack of studies that
      evaluate the imaging findings after physical therapy. Purpose: To evaluate the influence of
      nonspecific mandibular mobilization about the positioning of the articular disc by MRI in
      individuals with TMD diagnosis of anterior disc displacement with and without reduction
      according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD).
      Analyze the behavior of pain through the numerical scale of pain assessment (END) at baseline
      and after each treatment session, the quality of life of individuals with TMD at baseline,
      immediately, three and six months after the treatment sessions by the World Health
      Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL - BREF), and The Patient's Specific
      Functional Scale (PSFS) at baseline and after treatment. The treatment will be performed
      three times a week during four weeks. Metodology: This is a randomized, placebo controlled,
      blind study designed to assess the effects of techniques nonspecific mandibular mobilization
      x placebo. Individuals will be randomized and divided into two groups: Group A (intervention)
      and Group B (placebo). Statistic analysis: The positioning of the articular disc, extracted
      through the use of MRI, will be considered the primary outcome and, as a secondary outcome
      will be assessed the quality of life, pain and function after treatment. The adherence of the
      data to a Gaussian curve will be verified by the Shapiro-Wilk and the data are expressed as
      mean values and standard deviation. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with
      Bonferroni post hoc test will be used for inter-and intra-group comparisons. The significance
      level is adjusted p ≤ 0.05.
