  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Pre-lens Tear Lipid Layer Thickness After 2 Hours of Lens Wear on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, after 2 hours of lens wear</time_frame>
    <description>The pre-lens tear film is the layer of tears located on top of the contact lens (i.e., between the eye lid and the contact lens). The anterior-most layer of the pre-lens tear film consists of lipids. Lipid layer thickness (LLT) is measured with the LipiView® Interferometer. LLT is measured in interferometric color units (ICUs), where 1 ICU reflects about 1 nanometer (nm) lipid layer thickness. Higher values of LLT indicate a better lubrication of the ocular surface. A thicker tear lipid layer helps reduce evaporation and is indicative of a more stable tear film. The right eye only was used for this measure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Comfortable Lens Wear Time (Time Uncomfortable - Time Insertion) at Baseline and Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>At Baseline and on Day 14, comfort was collected through participant questionnaires regarding average and comfortable wear time. Participants filled in what time of day (over the past three days) they usually inserted their lenses, removed them, and at what time they usually became uncomfortable, or if they remained comfortable all day. Comfortable wear time was calculated as Time Uncomfortable minus Time Insertion. The participant rated both eyes together by providing one single rating. This outcome measure was prespecified for only FID 114657.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants That Experienced At Least 1 Unit Increase From Baseline Score to Day 14 for Overall Comfort With Lenses</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Overall comfort was rated by the participant on a 10-point scale, where 1=Poor and 10=Excellent, at Day 0 for their habitual lenses and at Day 14 for the lenses worn for the study during use of the assigned drop regimen. A 1-unit increase indicates improvement. The participant rated both eyes together by providing one single rating.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Comfortable Lens Wear Time (Time Uncomfortable - Time Insertion) to Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>At Baseline and on Day 14, comfort was collected through participant questionnaires regarding average and comfortable wear time. Participants filled in what time of day (over the past three days) they usually inserted their lenses, removed them, and at what time they usually became uncomfortable, or if they remained comfortable all day. Comfortable wear time was calculated as Time Uncomfortable minus Time Insertion. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. The participant rated both eyes together by providing one single rating.</description>

    <measure>Mean Pre-lens Tear Lipid Layer Thickness After 2 Hours of Lens Wear on Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14, after 2 hours of lens wear</time_frame>

        <title>Mean Pre-lens Tear Lipid Layer Thickness After 2 Hours of Lens Wear on Day 1</title>
        <description>The pre-lens tear film is the layer of tears located on top of the contact lens (i.e., between the eye lid and the contact lens). The anterior-most layer of the pre-lens tear film consists of lipids. Lipid layer thickness (LLT) is measured with the LipiView® Interferometer. LLT is measured in interferometric color units (ICUs), where 1 ICU reflects about 1 nanometer (nm) lipid layer thickness. Higher values of LLT indicate a better lubrication of the ocular surface. A thicker tear lipid layer helps reduce evaporation and is indicative of a more stable tear film. The right eye only was used for this measure.</description>

Participants filled in what time of day (over the past three days) they usually inserted their lenses, removed them, and at what time they usually became uncomfortable, or if they remained comfortable all day. Comfortable wear time was calculated as Time Uncomfortable minus Time Insertion. The participant rated both eyes together by providing one single rating.
