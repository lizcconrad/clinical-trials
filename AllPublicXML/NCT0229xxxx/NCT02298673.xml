      Development of a new MS-based biomarker for the early and sensitive diagnosis of
      Mucolipidosis Disorder type I, II, III, IV disease from plasma. Testing for clinical
      robustness, specificity and long-term stability of the biomarker.

    <textblock>
      Mucolipidoses (ML) are a group of inherited metabolic diseases in which both
      glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and another group of substances called sphingolipids build up in
      the body. GAGs are long, repeating chains of complex sugar molecules, and sphingolipids are
      fats. ML disorders may also be referred to as &quot;targeting defects&quot; because affected
      individuals are lacking the enzyme (a protein that produces chemical reactions in the body)
      that &quot;targets&quot; other enzymes to the lysosome (a sac-like structure found in a cell). Symptoms
      of ML can be congenital (present at birth) or begin in early childhood or adolescence. Early
      symptoms can include vision problems and developmental delays. Over time, many children with
      ML develop poor mental capacities, have difficulty reaching normal developmental milestones,
      and, in many cases, eventually die of the disease. Changes in specific genes results in the
      deficiency or absence of the targeting enzyme. The ML disorders are categorized into four
      groups based on the clinical features and enzyme deficiencies. ML-II and ML-III are the more
      common forms of ML. An individual is usually suspected of having an ML disorder based on
      clinical features. The diagnosis is further confirmed by laboratory testing. The
      mucolipidoses are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, that is, they occur only when a
      child inherits two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent. When both parents
      carry a defective gene, each of their children faces a one in four chance of developing one
      of the MLs. At the same time, each child also faces a one in two chance of inheriting only
      one copy of the defective gene. People who have only one defective gene are known as
      carriers. These individuals do not develop the disease but they can pass the defective gene
      on to their own children. Because the defective genes involved in certain forms of ML are
      known, tests can identify people who are carriers in some instances.

      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future
      the Disorder earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.

      Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from
      the plasma of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose
      and thereby with an earlier treatment. Examining saliva samples will allow determining
      whether measurement is feasible in saliva samples and will further promote early detection of
      mucolipidosis disorder type I, II, III or IV.

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectometry 10ml EDTA
      blood, sputum tube and a dry blood spot filter card are taken. To proof the correct diagnosis
      in those patients where up to the enrollment in the study no genetic testing has been done,
      sequencing will be done. The analyses are done in the Albrecht-Kossel-Institute for
      Neuroregeneration (AKos), POB 100 888, Gehlsheimer Str. 20, 18055 Rostock (Germany)
