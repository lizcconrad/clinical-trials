  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In primary teeth, decay that is near the pulp (tooth nerve)is treated with either a pulpotomy
      or indirect pulp treatment if the tooth is not going to be extracted A pulpotomy involves
      removing the top 1/2 of the pulp, placing a medication/material on the pulp, covering the
      remaining pulp with a cement, and the restoring the tooth. The purpose of this pilot study is
      to gain preliminary information regarding the success of Biodentine, MTA, and IPT in the
      treatment of deep decay in children's primary molars.

      Pediatric patients having deep decay in primary molars seen at UMMC, UMSOD, and University of
      Maryland Rehabilitation and Orthopaedic Institute, will be included in the sample. Teeth with
      deep caries, &gt;50% into dentin, will be randomly assigned using a table of random numbers to
      the three treatment groups:

      Group 1 pulpotomy with MTA, Group 2 pulpotomy with Biodentine, Group 3 indirect pulp
      treatment. Treatment will be performed by board certified pediatric dentists or they will
      directly supervise pediatric dental residents at each site as part of their regular protocol
      for treating deep caries.

      Radiographs will be taken as prescribed in the Guideline for taking Radiographs in Children
      by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry.

      Twice yearly clinical examinations will be performed by the treating dentists or pediatric
      dental residents to check for any soft tissue pathology such as abscess or mobility of
      treated tooth/teeth. If treatment success/failure consensus between the blinded dentists is
      not reached, a third dentist will be consulted.

      The success/failure data will be entered onto spreadsheets and examined statistically using
      statistical software.
