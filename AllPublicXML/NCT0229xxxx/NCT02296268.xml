  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of chronic disability here in Nova Scotia and globally. Aerobic
      exercise is known to improve health by increasing energy levels, physical mobility, balance,
      bone health, cardiovascular risk reduction, mental well-being, cognition, sleep, and quality
      of life. Nonetheless, people remain woefully inactive after stroke, regardless if they are in
      hospital or at home. The current investigative team and others have shown that even during
      physiotherapy, exercise intensity is not adequate to increase physical fitness. Consequently,
      patients are often deprived of a treatment that could improve their recovery. Why does this
      gap between evidence and clinical practice persist? Through a national survey the current
      team found that an important contributing factor is lack of appropriate screening (especially
      stress tests) to ensure that patients are safe to engage in aerobic exercise. This project is
      designed to close this evidence-practice gap by establishing a state-of-the-art aerobic
      exercise screening and prescription clinic at the Nova Scotia Rehabilitation Centre (NSRC).
      The intent is to compare outcomes of stroke rehabilitation participants before and after the
      clinic is underway and determine if the clinic has a positive effect on the confidence of
      NSRC physiotherapists to use aerobic exercise safely and effectively in stroke
      rehabilitation.

      Research question: To what extent does an on-site aerobic exercise screening and prescription
      clinic effect uptake of aerobic exercise and patient outcomes in in-patient stroke
      rehabilitation?

      Design: Pre-post cohort design to explore real-world application and feasibility

      Aim 1. Establish an aerobic exercise screening and prescription clinic (herein 'Aerobics
      Clinic') at the NSRC.

      Aim 2. Assess the potential impact of the Aerobics Clinic on the self-efficacy of
      physiotherapists at NSRC regarding clinical utilization of aerobic exercise in in-patient
      stroke rehabilitation.

      Method: An assessment of the physiotherapy participants' self-efficacy regarding the clinical
      utilization of aerobic exercise post-stroke will be conducted prior to, and after,
      implementation of the Clinic.

      Aim 3: Assess the potential impact of the Aerobics Clinic on prescription and treatment
      practices regarding aerobic exercise among patients in stroke rehabilitation at the NSRC.

      Method: Prior to, and after, implementation of the Clinic the actual utilization of aerobic
      exercise in the practices of the physiotherapy participants will be assessed using heart rate
      monitoring, activity monitoring, and health record review.

    <description>Patients will be referred to the Clinic by their physiotherapist to be assessed regarding their safety and readiness to participate in aerobic training. If they are deemed to be safe and ready, an aerobic exercise prescription will be written to guide the implementation of a safe and effective training protocol. Patients deemed to be at moderate to high risk will need to be cleared for testing by a physician on the stroke service. A cardiologist will be consulted about specific concerns re cardiac status.</description>
