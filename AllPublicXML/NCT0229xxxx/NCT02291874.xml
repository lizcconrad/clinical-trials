      Purpose of this study is to evaluate the Long-term Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of
      Ipragliflozin in Combination with GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in Japanese Patients with Type 2
      Diabetes Mellitus Who Have Inadequate Glycemic Control with GLP-1 Receptor Agonists.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study in patients with T2DM who have inadequate glycemic
      control with GLP-1 receptor agonists for at least 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Week −6).

      Patients on monotherapy with Victoza® or on combination therapy with GLP-1 receptor agonists
      and sulfonylurea (SU) are eligible. Patients on combination therapy with GLP-1 receptor
      agonists and non-SU hypoglycemic agents can also be included; however, these patients must
      undergo washout of the non-SU hypoglycemic agents administered with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

          -  The subject has HbA1c levels of ≥7.5% but ≤10.5% at Visit 2, and the difference in
             HbA1c levels between Visit 1 and Visit 2 is within ±1.0%.
