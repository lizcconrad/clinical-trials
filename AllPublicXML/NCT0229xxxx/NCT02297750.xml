  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to give doctors who perform Endoscopic Retrograde
      Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures a better idea as to the best techniques to use in
      order to examine the bile duct as quickly and safely as possible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sometimes, in the course of a regular ERCP procedure, techniques used by the doctor to pass a
      wire into the bile duct can result in the pancreas duct being entered instead. When this
      happens, the doctor may either remove the wire (known as &quot;single wire&quot; technique) or leave it
      in and use a second wire (&quot;double wire&quot;) to enter the bile duct. This study will try to
      determine whether the &quot;double wire&quot; technique or the &quot;single wire&quot; technique removing the
      wire is the safest and most efficient.
