    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy and safety different dose of GPIIb/IIIa
      inhibitor (tirofiban) in interventional treatment of complex coronary artery disease ,which
      include bifurcation lesion, left main lesion, multiple vessel disease, intracoronary
      thrombus, SYNTAX score&gt;26,chronic total occlusion disease. The primary endpoint is all-cause
      mortality. Secondary endpoints are incidence of major bleeding and the rate of site access
      complication.
