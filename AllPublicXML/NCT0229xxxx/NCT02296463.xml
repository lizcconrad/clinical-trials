  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, observer-blind, irrelevant comparator-controlled trial in male and
      female subjects ≥24 months of age and &lt;72 months of age. Subjects will be without symptomatic
      chronic cardiopulmonary disease, including recurrent wheezing. Subjects will be screened for
      seropositivity to RSV in a qualified serum microneutralization (MN) assay and will be
      excluded if titers for either RSV/A or RSV/B are &lt;1:16 (4 log2).

      Treatments will comprise an IM dose of saline placebo or RSV F vaccine on Day 0 and an IM
      dose of RSV F vaccine or a licensed hepatitis A vaccine on Day 28. Hepatitis A vaccine (and
      in one group placebo) will be used to maintain the study blind; all subjects will receive a
      complete course of hepatitis A vaccine as a study benefit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy males and females, ≥24 months of age and &lt;72 months of age, without known
             chronic cardiopulmonary disease including especially persistent or frequently
             recurrent wheezing.

          2. Free of other illnesses that are believed to increase the risks associated with
             influenza or other respiratory viral infections, including: diabetes mellitus,
             congenital or acquired blood dyscrasias, renal or hepatic dysfunction, and morbid
             obesity.

          3. Parent(s)/guardian(s) willing and able to give informed consent prior to study
             enrollment, and assert ability to comply with study requirements.

          4. Parent(s)/guardian(s) and/or other designated child care provider must have continuous
             capacity for telephone communication with the study site.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Serum MN titers against RSV/A or RSV/B &lt;1:16 (4 log2).

          2. Toxicity grade ≥2 for any safety laboratory parameter.

          3. Participation in research involving an investigational product (drug/biologic/device)
             within 45 days before planned date of first vaccination and planned participation at
             any time during the study.

          4. History of a serious reaction to any prior vaccination, including Guillain-Barré
             Syndrome within six weeks following a previous influenza vaccination.

          5. Receipt of any vaccine (other than the influenza vaccine specified in the protocol) in
             the four weeks preceding the first study vaccination and/or planned receipt of a
             licensed vaccine (other than the hepatitis A vaccine specified in the protocol) at any
             time prior to Study Day 56.

          6. Receipt of an RSV vaccine at any time.

          7. Any known or suspected immunosuppressive condition, acquired or congenital, as
             determined by medical history and/or physical examination.

          8. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 continuous days) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs within 6 months prior to the administration of the
             study vaccine. An immunosuppressant dose of glucocorticoid will be defined as a
             systemic dose ≥1 mg/kg of prednisone per day or equivalent. The use of topical
             glucocorticoids for minor cutaneous symptoms will be permitted, but the use of nasal
             or inhaled glucocorticoids in exclusionary (because of potential related diagnoses
             rather than immunosuppression).

          9. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the administration of the study vaccine or during the study.

         10. Acute disease at the time of enrollment (defined as the presence of a moderate or
             severe illness with or without fever or an oral temperature &gt;38.0°C on the planned day
             of vaccine administration).

         11. Known disturbance of coagulation.

         12. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would pose a health risk to the
             subject if enrolled or could interfere with evaluation of the vaccine or
             interpretation of study results (including social, neurologic, or psychiatric
             conditions in the subject or parent(s)/guardian(s) deemed likely to impair the quality
             of safety reporting).
