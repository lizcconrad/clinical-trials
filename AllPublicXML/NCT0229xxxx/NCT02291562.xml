  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      THC and CBD have distinct symptomatic and behavioral effects. In healthy individuals, THC can
      induce psychotic symptoms and anxiety, and can impair memory. In contrast, CBD has anxiolytic
      and possibly antipsychotic properties, while not impairing memory and other cognitive
      functions. Instead, CBD has been shown to have significant neuroprotective effects. In
      humans, CBD values correlated positively with gray matter concentration in bilateral
      hippocampus. Recent data from experimental animals and in vitro studies suggest that these
      distinct effects might be caused by opposing effects on brain cannabinoid receptors.

      Neuroimaging studies have consistently identified brain activity recorded at prefrontal and
      medial temporal regions as relevant for episodic memory. Additionally, the abundance of
      cannabinoid receptors in the hippocampus and the parahippocampal and entorhinal cortices
      suggests a potential impact of CBD in memory deficits typical in healthy aging. However, the
      evidence relating cannabinoids to these conditions is relatively recent and has been obtained
      from either biochemical or pharmacological studies. It might be hypothesized that CBDs could
      be useful to delay or even arrest the progression of functional and structural neuronal
      degeneration.

      The investigators will use an episodic memory paradigm to test the effects of THC, CBD and
      placebo on memory encoding and retention and the underlying neuronal networks on healthy male
      subjects.
