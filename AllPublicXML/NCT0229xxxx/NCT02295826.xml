      Rationale: To date, anticoagulant therapy in acute stroke has also been limited by excess
      hemorrhagic events. The oral anticoagulant dabigatran is a novel agent, which has been shown
      to be associated with much lower intracranial hemorrhage rates. It has been suggested that
      this agent may provide the superior benefits of anticoagulation in acute stroke, without the
      concomitant increase in hemorrhage risk associated with heparin/LMWH or warfarin.

      Study Design: DATAS II is a randomized, open label blinded endpoint trial. Participants
      (n=300) with TIA or ischemic stroke (NIHSS score &lt;9) will be enrolled within 48 hours of
      symptom onset from approximately four (4) health care centres across Canada. All participants
      will have an MRI with DWI lesion volume &lt; 25 ml. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to
      treatment with dabigatran for 30 days or ASA 81 mg daily (current standard of care). All
      stroke patients will initially be screened with a non-contrast CT scan of the brain. The
      first MRI will be performed within 48 hours of symptom onset. Imaging studies will be
      repeated at day 30. All patients will be assessed clinically at Day 30 and Day 90.

      Study Aims:

        1. Establish the safety of early anticoagulation with the novel oral anticoagulant
           dabigatran in acute cerebrovascular syndrome patients.

        2. Identify the rate of both symptomatic and asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation (HT)
           associated with these treatments.

        3. Identify predictors of HT associated with acute dabigatran treatment.

      Hypothesis: The Investigators hypothesize that symptomatic HT rates in dabigatran and ASA
      treated patients will not be significantly different.

      Study outcomes: The primary outcome is the rate of symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation
      (HT), defined as a parenchymal hematoma, which is &gt;30% of the infarcted area on DWI, with
      substantial space- occupying effect, associated with clinical worsening (≥4 point increase in
      National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score) within 5 weeks of treatment
      initiation. The major secondary outcome the rate of asymtomatic HT see on day 30 MRI
      sequence.
