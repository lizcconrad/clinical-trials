      Single Centre, open label assignment phase II clinical study.

      To evaluate the effect of oral 200mg Methylene Blue tablets (administered 8x25mg) prior to
      endoscopy on double stranded DNA breaks in colonic biopsy samples assessed by histone gamma
      H2AX analysis, compared to control biopsies.

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the effect of oral 200 mg Methylene Blue MMX® tablets,
      (administered as 8 x 25 mg), prior to endoscopy, on double-stranded DNA breaks in colonic
      biopsy samples assessed by histone γH2AX analysis, compared to control biopsies collected
      during standard white light colonoscopy without the prior use of Methylene Blue MMX®.

      Secondary Objectives : To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral Methylene Blue MMX®
      tablets.. To evaluate the staining score for colonoscopy obtained with oral Methylene Blue
      MMX® tablets . Time to reach the caecum during colonoscopy and withdrawal time from caecum to
      exit.

standard white light colonoscopy-equivalent to placebo: standard white light colonoscopy
Subjects who have had samples collected during initial colonoscopy, who require a second colonoscopy within 2 weeks. Prior to this second colonoscopy the subjects take Methylene Blue MMX tablets.
Biopsies collected are compared to their initial colonoscopy for histone gamma H2AX activity.

            <groups_desc>The results of the γH2AX analysis were listed and summarised by frequency tables by visit and colonic region.
The results were compared between Visit 2 and Visit 1 for each colonic region and overall using the Mc Nemar’s χ2 test.
In case of the presence of at least one positive colonic region, that visit was to be considered as ‘Positive’ for the overall γH2AX analysis.</groups_desc>
