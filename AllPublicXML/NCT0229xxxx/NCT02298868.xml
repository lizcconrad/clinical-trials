    <description>Patients undertook a muscle cramp questionnaire prior to treatment that measured frequency in the number of days in a week that a subject experienced muscle cramps.

    <measure>Efficacy of Baclofen to Change Severity of Muscle Cramps in Patients With Cirrhosis After 4 Weeks of Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of 4 weeks of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Patients undertook a muscle cramp questionnaire prior to treatment that measured severity in a 0-10 analog scale (0 is no pain and 10 is most severe pain). These measures were repeated after 4 weeks of therapy and the difference was assessed (4 weeks of therapy-Baseline).</description>

    <description>Subjects undertook a muscle cramp questionnaire prior to treatment that measured frequency in the number of days in a week that a subject experienced muscle cramps and repeated this measure at the end of baclofen therapy (end of week 4). Subjects then underwent a 1 week taper of baclofen and a subsequent two week washout period. At the end of the washout period (end of week 7) the subjects underwent a final muscle cramp questionnaire to reassess frequency of muscle cramps. This was then compared to the end of therapy frequency to document the increase in muscle cramps after stopping baclofen. (week 7 result - week 4 result)</description>

        <description>Subjects undertook a muscle cramp questionnaire prior to treatment that measured frequency in the number of days in a week that a subject experienced muscle cramps and repeated this measure at the end of baclofen therapy (end of week 4). Subjects then underwent a 1 week taper of baclofen and a subsequent two week washout period. At the end of the washout period (end of week 7) the subjects underwent a final muscle cramp questionnaire to reassess frequency of muscle cramps. This was then compared to the end of therapy frequency to document the increase in muscle cramps after stopping baclofen. (week 7 result - week 4 result)</description>
