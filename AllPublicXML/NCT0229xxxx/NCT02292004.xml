  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and early efficacy of a newly developed device,
      bridge-enhanced scaffold (MIACH™,) used to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL.)
      Ten participants will undergo surgery with the new device (Experimental Group) and 10 will
      undergo a standard ACL reconstruction surgery (Control Group.)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human trial for evaluation of the safety (Primary Objective) and
      short-term efficacy (Secondary Objective) of the MIACH™ ACL scaffold and will be carried out
      in form of an observational study of 20 patients: 10 experimental and 10 control.

    <description>Lachman exam demonstrates 6mm or greater AP knee laxity when the knee is in 25 degrees of flexion in the operated knee than the unoperated knee on examination by the physician in the office.
