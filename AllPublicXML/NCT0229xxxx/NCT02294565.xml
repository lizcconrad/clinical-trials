    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1 portion of this clinical research study is to find out what dose
      of dilute fluorescein is needed for a surgeon to best see important lymph nodes that need to
      be removed during surgery (a standard of care surgery referred to as a Sentinel Lymph Node
      Biopsy procedure) in patients diagnosed with breast cancer.

      The purpose of the Phase 2 portion of this clinical research study is to find out if giving
      dilute fluorescein sodium in combination with a radiotracer (a drug that is radioactive) can
      help surgeons localize the lymph nodes that need to be removed in patients diagnosed by
      breast cancer.

      The study is a single center prospective, non randomized, single arm, open label, single dose
      VST-1001 study for lymphatic mapping and localization of lymph nodes draining a primary tumor
      site in patients with clinically node negative breast cancer.

      This study evaluates the combined modality technique of investigational VST-1001 with
      companion medical devices (replacing the blue dye) and 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid for
      concordance in lymphatic mapping and localization of lymph nodes in patients who are
      undergoing a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) surgical procedure.

      This purpose of the Phase I study is to determine a safe and effective recommended dose of
      VST-1001 for intraoperative lymphatic mapping and localization of lymph nodes draining a
      breast tumor. The purpose of the Phase II study is to further evaluate the Phase I study
      recommended dose of VST-1001 and to evaluate its ability to provide intraoperative
      visualization of the lymphatic system and lymph nodes draining the primary tumor in patients
      diagnosed with breast cancer.

    <description>VST-1001 (with medical devices) and 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid are used together during a SLNB procedure in a single subject. Both drugs are evaluated for lymphatic mapping and localization of lymph nodes. The current standard of care for lymphatic mapping and lymph node localization during a SLNB procedure is a combined-modality technique that employs both a radiotracer (99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid is the radiotracer used in this study) and a vital blue dye (a patient receives both drugs). In this study, the vital blue dye is replaced with VST-1001 and companion medical devices.
VST-1001 is excited by a medical device (blue-light LED illuminator) to fluoresce; the surgeon is wearing blue-light filtering eyewear to improve visualization of the relevant tissue structures.</description>
